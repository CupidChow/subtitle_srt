Wu Ankang, Grand General
of the Left Imperial Guard,

13
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,510
has long safeguarded the frontier,

14
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:20,960
[Wu Ankang, Grand General]
repelling countless incursions

15
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,350
from the northern
and western barbarians,

16
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,070
standing as a steadfast protector
of the realm.

17
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,420
[Wu]
His hard work speaks volumes.

18
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,910
In the second year of Shengxi,

19
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,580
when the Shuodan forces
invaded our borders,

20
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,660
[Dingding Gate]
General Wu led his army into battle,

21
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,750
crushing the enemy in Mobei

22
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,820
with overwhelming force

23
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,630
and securing a decisive victory
in the Battle of Jinyuan.

24
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,030
Now, as he returns in triumph,

25
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,070
Her Majesty bestows upon him
the Azure Dragon Golden Mace

26
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,470
and the Golden Radiant Armor.

27
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,790
The Kangping Mansion is granted
a thousand liang of silver

28
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,100
and five hundred pi of silk.

29
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,630
Every soldier under his command
shall receive five pi of silk

30
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,630
and ten thousand copper coins.

31
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,790
Thus the imperial decree.

32
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,910
Thank you, Your Majesty.

33
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,100
General Wu,

34
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,860
we convene today
to discuss state affairs.

35
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,140
If you have any sound strategies,

36
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,630
do not hesitate to share them.

37
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,540
Yes, Your Majesty.

38
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,790
Ministers, is there any matter
that requires my attention?

39
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,700
I have an important issue
to bring to Your Majesty's attention.

40
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,750
Go ahead.

41
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,140
The Longmen Battle is a brutal show

42
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,230
where lowborns kill each other
for the amusement of the spectators.

43
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,420
For the sake of a mere document
freeing them from their lowly status,

44
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,140
brothers turn against each other,

45
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,380
families are torn apart,

46
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,510
and countless lives are lost.

47
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,140
Your Majesty, I earnestly implore you

48
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,350
to issue a decree
to shut down Longmen Arena

49
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,750
and abolish this inhumane practice.

50
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,260
What baseless fearmongering!

51
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,380
Longmen Arena

52
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,860
has granted many lowborn individuals

53
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,230
the chance to break free
from their status,

54
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,380
and change their fate.

55
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,540
This is clearly

56
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,630
[Lu Qi, Minister of Works]
an act of great benevolence and grace,

57
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,470
yet you slander it so.

58
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,630
If I recall correctly,

59
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,630
Mr. Yuan himself elevated his status

60
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,750
through the Longmen Battle.

61
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:46,750
What?

62
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,350
You've benefited
from this policy yourself,

63
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,630
but now you want to abolish it

64
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,980
and prevent others
from having the same opportunity?

65
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,790
[Zhang Quan, Minister of Justice]

66
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,700
The Longmen Battle was personally
approved by Ruler Wen,

67
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,790
yet Mr. Yuan branded it as flawed.

68
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,030
Is he implying
that Ruler Wen is unjust?

69
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,860
Such remarks by Mr. Yuan
betray malicious intent

70
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,190
and cannot be overlooked!

71
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,750
That is an unfair argument.

72
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,190
The Longmen Battle was intended

73
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,470
to provide the lowborn

74
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,190
with a chance to change their fate.

75
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,380
But it was limited

76
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,700
to wrestling matches

77
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,790
that avoided serious injury.

78
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,070
[Xian Guangping]
Yet over time,

79
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,100
[General of Left Yulin Royal Guard]
some have turned it

80
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,750
into a bloodstained gambling den
where human lives are discarded at will.

81
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,750
Mr. Yuan's claims are factual,

82
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,140
yet you keep tying this matter
to Ruler Wen.

83
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,460
Should we not question

84
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,820
your intent behind such statements?

85
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,070
How could this kind of contest

86
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,380
be held without any injuries?

87
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,460
Some with ulterior motives

88
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,820
exaggerate the facts

89
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,190
and now seek
to ruin a well-intended policy.

90
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,670
Is that not laughable?

91
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,700
Mr. Mei,

92
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,700
what is your opinion?

93
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,380
Each reign has its own ruler

94
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,990
and its own system of governance.

95
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,450
[Mei Bowen, Left Chancellor]
Since this policy

96
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,430
has not yet been enshrined in law,

97
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,700
whether it is altered or maintained

98
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,550
is entirely up to Your Majesty.

99

Previously, Minister Lu
and Minister Zhang

100
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,070
often had significant disagreements.

101
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:56,750
Today, however,

A chance to change their fate.

104
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,220
I think what you've said is spot on.

105
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,020
Does anyone else share the same view?

106
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,460
- I do.
- I do.

bring it up.

109
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,310
Since this policy

110
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,900
is so great,

111
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,070
I will put it to the test myself.

112
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,670
You two,

113
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,550
in front of the ministers,

114
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,900
will fight here

115
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,020
in this cage.

116
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,630
The winner

117
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:36,870
will be awarded

- Your Majesty, please calm your anger.
- Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

121

Why all the fuss about Yanqing Lane
being ominous?

122
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,070
Why are so many of you
asking me not to go?

123
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,220
What are you really afraid of?

124

Minister Cui,

125
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,260
did you enjoy

126
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,820
the Longmen Battle yesterday?

[Cui Yi, Vice Minister of Justice]

Back in the day,

129
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:00,820
there were those who deceived

130
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,820
both their superiors
and their subordinates.

131
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:02,950
Now,

132
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,260
some still dare to use Ruler Wen's name
to justify their actions.

133
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,870
All beings deserve to be treated
with compassion.

134
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,550
Despite the gruesome nature
of the bloodshed,

135
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,070
many noblemen

136
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,380
eagerly flocked to the scene.

137
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,900
What lies beneath their masks,

138
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,670
man or demon?

139
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,340
- Your Majesty, please calm your anger.
- Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

140
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,670
Since I ascended the throne,

141
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:22,700
I've decreed

142
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,990
lighter taxes

143
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,220
and returned wealth to the people.

144
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,110
Yet, there are still areas

145
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,550
plagued by refugees and fugitives.

146
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,900
The barbarians eye our borders,

147
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,110
and though I intended
to allocate funds for the military,

148
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,110
I discovered a deficit
in the national treasury.

149
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,820
Every matter I just mentioned,
big or small, is a national concern.

150
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,700
Some individuals,

151
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,070
living off their family's past merits,

152
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,900
occupy their positions
without fulfilling their duties.

153
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,190
Instead of focusing
on the well-being of the nation,

154
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,820
they are obsessed
with preserving Longmen Arena,

155
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,870
a place that treats human lives
as entertainment,

156
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,430

00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,380
Yes, Your Majesty.

159
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,550
As the Vice Minister of Justice,

160
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,470
even before Minister Ji
arrived in the capital,

161
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,190
it was already uncovered

162
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,870
that you allowed your followers
to seize people's land

163
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,670
and engage in corruption.

164
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,110
Are you deserving

165
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,820
of this official regalia?

166
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,110
I am deeply ashamed for betraying
Your Majesty's trust.

167
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,070
No punishment
could ever atone for my sins.

168
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:13,990
I implore Your Majesty

169
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,670
not to let my transgressions

170
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,550
affect your well-being.

Your Majesty!

173

By imperial decree,

174
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,190
from this day forward,

175
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,670
no one

176
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,630
is to use coercion, bribery,
or any other means

177
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,870
to force commoners to fight each other.

178
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,630
Anyone who defies this order

179
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,110
will receive eighty strokes

180

00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,580
many have been placed in the lower ranks

183
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,510
due to the mistakes of their ancestors,

184
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,340
even though they themselves
are blameless.

185
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,260
I humbly request that,

186
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,110
those with two generations
or more in the lower class

187
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,430
should be allowed

188
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,550
to compete in scholarships,

189
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:49,900
and those who excel be granted

190
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,550
freedom from their low status.

191
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,580
[Li Muyuan, Vice Minister]

192
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,700
[of the Department of State Affairs]
It is out of the question.

193
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:55,950
The imperial exams

194
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,220
offer virtuous citizens

195
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,750
the chance to serve the nation.

196
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,780
It is inconceivable to extend
this opportunity to the low-born.

197
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:01,780
If that happens,

198
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,870
class distinctions will cease to exist,

199
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,260
and the entire imperial system
will crumble,

200
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,750
destabilizing
the very foundation of the state.

201
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,820
Mr. Li makes a valid point.

202
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,630
While Mr. Yuan's concern
for the people is commendable,

203
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,670
such reforms may be too extreme

204
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,780
and counterproductive.

205
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,140
Mr. Mei,

206
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,020
Mr. Li,

207
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,510
you two are right.

208
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,670
There's no need
to discuss this matter further.

209
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:26,870
Minister Yuan,

210
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,260
please rise.

211
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:29,550
Yes, Your Majesty.

212
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,390
Your Majesty,

213
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,430
I have an idea

214
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,500
regarding Longmen Arena.

215
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,030
But I am not sure if it is feasible.

216
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,740
Do tell.

217
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,030
Whether a sword is used to inflict harm

218
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:45,790
or provide salvation

219
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,860
depends on the one who wields it.

220
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,670
Treating the lives of the lower class
as a form of entertainment

221
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,790
is a sin.

222
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:51,820
But Longmen Arena itself

223
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,500
bears no fault.

224
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,430
It was built
under Ruler Wen's personal decree.

225
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,270
To seal it off and abandon it

226
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,070
would be a great loss.

227
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:00,950
I propose

228
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,190
that we allow

229
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,550
skilled martial artists
to compete there,

230
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,910
using it as a platform
to discover and promote talent.

231
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,030
You truly are a seasoned general.

232
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,460
Your proposal

233
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,310
aligns perfectly with my idea
of establishing

234
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,700
a military examination system.

235
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,150
In that case,

236
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,860
let's use Longmen Arena

237
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,030
as a trial run.

238
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,340
Issue a decree

239
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,740
to change Longmen Arena
to a Martial Arts Examination Ground,

240
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,430
with two officials
assigned to oversee it.

241
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:31,950
Those who stand out

242
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,980
will be included
in the military officer selection list

243
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,500
for further evaluation.

244
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,790
- Your Majesty is wise.
- Your Majesty is wise.

245
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,030
Her Majesty went to Longmen Arena,

246
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,670
and you did Yuan Shaocheng
a great favor.

247
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,820
He surely owes you a proper thanks.

248
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,220
What's wrong?

249
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:58,980
Are you hurt?

250
00:09:59,220 --> 00:09:59,770
Let me take a look.

251
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:00,700
I'm all right.

252
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,300
I used too much force

253
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,300
and strained my wrist.

254
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,850
Why were you so dramatic then?

255
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,060
You scared me half to death.

256
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:07,850
It's just a sprained wrist,

257
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:08,770
yet you screamed so loud.

258
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,650
You really can't handle pain, can you?

259
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,180
Now that I think about it,

260
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,370
I have no idea how a certain someone

261
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,250
managed to survive in prison.

262
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,530
If it were me,

263
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:18,820
I would have confessed
everything right away.

264
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,130
Did you hear that?

265
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,890
Don't put Cailian in charge.

266
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,250
She'll spill everything

267
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,130
the moment she's tortured.

268
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,650
What do you mean?

269
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,580
Cailian,

270
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,010
is something

271
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:36,890
on your mind lately?

272
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,610
Let us know if anything's bothering you.

273
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:42,460
No.

274
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,730
If you don't tell me, I'll just guess.

275
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,490
Is it something related to us?

276
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,340
No.

277
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,610
Is it related to another woman?

278
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,420
Does it have something to do with a man?

279
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,530
A man?

280
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,340
Who's the man
that dares to bully you?

281
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:10,650
He didn't bully me.

282
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,580
I'll just tell you.

283
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,770
Yuan Shaocheng's subordinate,

284
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:19,940
Gu Wenyu,

285
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,300
has feelings for me.

286
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,580
That's great news.

287
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,420
Do you have feelings for him?

288
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,340
Whether I have feelings for him
isn't important.

289
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,300
What matters is that those villains

290
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:35,940
still haven't paid for what they did.

291
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,580
How could I have time
for a relationship?

292
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,820
Gu Wenyu has worked
for Yuan Shaocheng for a long time.

293
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,460
You can tell

294
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,890
he's thorough and diligent.

295
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,420
He's a reliable person.

296
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,700
We'll get our revenge,

297
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:52,890
but we still have to live on.

298
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,250
We can't live

299
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,340
only for vengeance.

300
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,820
If I were to be with him,

301
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,220
wouldn't I

302
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,130
have to be honest about my past?

303
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,460
After learning about my past,

304
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,530
will he truly be free
of any reservations?

305
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:15,650
If he has doubts in his heart,

306
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,130
in the end,
won't I be the one who gets hurt?

307
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:19,580
Cailian,

308
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,770
what hurts me more
than those unfortunate pasts

309
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:23,980
is what happened

310
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,820
after I escaped
from that abandoned house.

311
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:30,820
Think about it.

312
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,820
Doesn't it make sense?

313
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,300
Why were these women abducted

314
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,700
and not others?

315
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,940
They must have been targeted

316
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,100
because they were improperly dressed.

317
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,820
I've heard a lot of people say

318
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,460
that Yu Qian gave them money.

319
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,220
They were greedy

320
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,820
and ended up becoming house courtesans.

321
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:45,370
I think

322
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,220
they were from pleasure houses,

323
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,220
lured by money to serve men.

324
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:49,850
But in the end,

325
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,850
they got burned to death
by that old rogue Yu Qian.

326
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,700
That's why I say

327
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,980
women should adhere to
the female virtues.

328
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:58,730
Exactly.

329
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:59,610
They ought to behave themselves,
don't you think?

330
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,180
Indeed.

331
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,650
I often wonder,

332
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,060
what's the point of surviving?

333
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:08,850
We'll forever bear

334
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:09,770
these stigmas,

335
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,820
enduring tremendous pressure,

336
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,180
too afraid to reunite with our family.

337
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,010
I don't want

338
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,010
to take any more risks.

339
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,010
Ping'an.

340
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,610
What's wrong, Ping'an?

341
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,100
It's nothing.

342
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,340
The wound is hurting a little.

343
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:33,980
Love is love, and hate is hate.

344
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,100
Why mix

345
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,020
the two together?

346
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,420
The ones who bullied us are villains,

347
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,860
and the ones who slandered us are fools.

348
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:39,900
In the end,

349
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,300
we're only torturing ourselves.

350
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,820
It brings pain to those who love us
and joy to those who hate us.

351
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,660
Isn't that just as foolish?

352
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,980
But what can I do?

353
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,180
From the previous dynasty
to Great Feng,

354
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,060
while the people are open-minded,

355
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,180
as soon as you mention a woman

356
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:51,740
who has lost her chastity...

357
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,260
Rubbish!

358
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:53,540
Chastity is nothing

359
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,820
more than a shackle
that restricts women.

360
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:55,860
Have you ever heard a man

361
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,460
mention chastity throughout history?

362
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,100
Did you give Gu Wenyu an answer?

363
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,340
Go meet him.

364
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:11,980
You can decide

365
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,140
on what you want to say to him

366
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,700
and whether to accept or reject him.

367
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:17,740
But at least

368
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,380
you can't avoid it.

369
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,020
You must face your feelings honestly.

370
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,820
[Zhanlu Hall]

371
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,020
Recently,

372
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,660
Shuodan has sent a letter.

373
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,540
The Khan's eldest daughter
has reached marriageable age.

374
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,220
I have given my consent

375
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,180
to select a prince from Great Feng

376
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,220
to marry the Shuodan princess,

377
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,580
thus strengthening our alliance.

378
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,420
Your Majesty,

379
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,860
throughout history,

380
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,940
only princesses
have been married off for alliances.

381
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,980
There has never been an example

382
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,820
of a prince marrying for such purposes.

383
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,380
If we were to send a prince over,

384
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,580
it would become a laughingstock.

385
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,300
I implore Your Majesty to reconsider.

386
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,860
- I implore Your Majesty to reconsider.
- I implore Your Majesty to reconsider.

387
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,340
A laughingstock, you say?

388
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,940
But in the past, Princess Wencheng

389
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,100
traveled far to wed in a distant land.

390
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,660
With herself alone,

391
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,700
she preserved peace
between the two regions for many years.

392
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,060
Who among you

393
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,420
can match such a feat?

394
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,180
You keep saying there was no precedent.

395
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,740
Since my ascension,

396
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,660
I have grown weary of hearing such talk.

397
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,500
My very reign

398
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,860
is a precedent.

399
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,940
The female officials in the court

400
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,780
are a precedent.

401
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,340
Allowing a prince
to marry for an alliance

402
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,260
can also be a precedent.

403
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,340
Well...

404
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:41,820
Hmm.

405
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,020
Ankang,

406
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,940
what do you think?

407
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,540
Your Majesty,

408
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,420
I believe

409
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,860
that whether it is a princess

410
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:54,820
or a prince,

411
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:55,940
sacrificing oneself

412
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,100
for the peace of the people

413
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,020
and the safe return of the soldiers

414
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,140
is no less worthy of honor
than that of generals.

415
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,660
They'll all be the pride
of our great empire.

416
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,140
I was too shallow in my understanding.

417
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,420
General Wu is absolutely right.

418
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,020
A prince marrying for an alliance

419
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,900
should indeed be the pride
of Great Feng.

420
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,420
In just a few days,

421
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,260
the Shuodan envoys
will arrive in the capital.

422
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,180
While Shuodan demonstrates goodwill,

423
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,220
we must value peace

424
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,020
and at the same time
assert the might of Great Feng.

425
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,140
- Your Majesty is wise.
- Your Majesty is wise.

[Li. Offering congee]
The "Li" character on the congee stall

428
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,420
seems to have quite a background.

429
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,460
You are right.

430
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,060
That congee stall is run by Li Zongxu,

431
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,700
the Prince of Langyang,

432
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,220
a great philanthropist.

433
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,660
During the flood in Yangzhou last year,

434
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,100
he made the largest donation.

435
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,500
But if you ask me,

436
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,660
he's just doing all this

437
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,860
to win people over

438
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,740
for the Li family.

439
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,220
Regardless of his motives,

440
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,140
as long as it benefits the people,

441
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,260
it's a good thing.

442
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,780
As for Yuan Shaocheng

443
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,100
in the court today,

444
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,100
I remember

445
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,580
he was once just a minor official.

446
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,540
How did he suddenly

447
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,700
become the Vice Minister?

448
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,860
With his background,

449
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,620
it's only natural that he's risen

450
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,540
to this position by currying favor

451
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,300
and attaching himself to the powerful.

452
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,100
People like him

453
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,860
are not uncommon in the capital.

454
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,780
It seems

455
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,940
that the darkest place

456
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,020
isn't the battlefield,

457
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,460
but rather this bustling city.

458
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,980
You are finally back to the capital

459
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,220
to enjoy your life for a bit,

460
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,220
why do you seem so burdened?

My return this time

462
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,980
is not for pleasure,

463
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,940
but to collect a debt.

464
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,780
Whose debt are you collecting?

465
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,340

Oh, it's him.

470
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,340
I know what debt

471

Father has been suffering
from heatstroke recently

and has been ill for some time,

476

but he's feeling much better
these past two days.

477
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,140
Knowing you were coming
to the capital today,

478
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,820
he ordered the house to be cleaned

479
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,020
and tidied up early this morning,

480
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,340
all in anticipation of your return.

Look,

484
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,740
I carved

485
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,300
this evergreen tree for you myself,

486
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,060
using

487
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,300
your favorite rosewood.

488
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,780
Looks like you're following in
my footsteps.

489
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,580
You look well and taller

490
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,740
now that you've slimmed down.

491
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,980
Maybe it's not that you've grown taller,

492
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,540
but that I'm getting older.

493
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,460
Father, you're still in your prime years

494
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,420
and at the height of your strength.

495
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,700
The old age label

496
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:52,940
doesn't fit you at all.

497
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,820
Wood carving requires patience.

498
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,980
It's all about controlling

499
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,620
your restless nature.

500
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,340
Not bad,

501
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,620
your craftsmanship has really improved.

502
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,460
I grew up

503
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,260
watching you carve wood,

504
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,300
and through that constant exposure,

505
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,820
I picked up a few basics.

506
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,260
Xian'er,

507
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,180
what nice gift

508
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,380
has your elder brother given you?

509
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,060
This is the Wanchuan Sword
forged by Zhang Yajiu,

510
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:19,580
and from now on,

511
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,940
it will be my sword.

512
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,180
As expected of her elder brother,

513
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,620
you know how to cater
to her preferences.

514
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,620
Her Majesty had kept

515
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,740
the Shuodan marriage proposal
under wraps,

516
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,580
only making it public

517
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,700
once you came back to the capital.

518
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:31,860
Do you understand

519
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,420
the reasoning behind this?

520
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,100
Her Majesty desires a marriage alliance
with the Wu family

521
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,940
to showcase the legitimacy
of the imperial authority.

522
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,140
This is the first reason.

523
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:40,900
The second reason

524
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,180
is the principle of balance.

525
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,980
Akin to drawing water from a barrel,

526
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,420
the planks of the Li and Wu families

527
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,020
must be of equal length

528
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,060
for the water

529
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,900
to stay steady.

530
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,220
This move by Her Majesty

531
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,820
is meant to retrieve my control
over the military.

532
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,340
Since you've figured it out,

533
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,860
give back the military command

534
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,100
and return to the capital
to find a suitable post.

535
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:58,700
Father,

536
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,020
I'm used to leading troops.

537
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,660
I don't belong in the capital,

538
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,220
and I'm not fit

539
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,460
for the work here.

540
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,340
Do you know

541
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,220
why I love wood?

542
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,780
When a tree dies, the wood lives on.

543
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,700
Every sixty years,

544
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,740
life resets,

545
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,220
much like the growth rings of a tree.

546
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,580
These cycles represent
both the universal law

547
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,020
and the path of humanity.

548
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,020
My son,

549
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,620
you still haven't fully grasped

550
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,940
the concept of flexibility.

551
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:25,860
Spend some time

552
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,700
to explore the capital properly,

553
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,900
it might change your perspective.

554
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:30,940
Xian'er,

555
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,380
I've prepared some rock sugar cakes.

556
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,500
Take them up

557
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,140
the mountain to your mother today.

558
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,860
I have some matters to attend to.

559
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,260
I'll send someone

560
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,580
to deliver the cakes.

561
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,940
Since you've just started to get better,

562
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,540
my brother and I will
not keep you any longer.

563
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,780
All right.

564
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,460
One of you
is Her Majesty's favored official,

565
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,780
the other a mighty general.

566
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,460
Now that you've both spread your wings,

567
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,580
you no longer listen to me.

568
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,060
Fine, go on.

569
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:55,620
Leave.

570
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,380
Ankang, ever since your return,

571
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,180
the household has received
over ten invitations.

572
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,580
But I guess

573
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,860
you won't be visiting any of them.

574
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,700
How about I host

575
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,820
a welcome feast for you tonight?

576
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,020
I'll also introduce you

577
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:16,900
to someone rather interesting.

578
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,780
Few people are ever deemed

579
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,580
interesting by you.

580
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,500
I wonder what makes

581
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,380
this person so special.

582
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,300
She

583
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,580
is known as a witch psychiatrist,

584
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,820
and not long ago,
she was involved in a perplexing case.

[Archives]

586
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,260
Who are you?

587
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,340
This is the Vice Minister
of the Court of Judicial Review.

588
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,580
He wishes to check some case files.

589
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,500
Which year's files do you need?

590
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,060
The second year of Zhaofeng.

591
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:06,980
The censor case.

592
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:09,700
I'm sorry,

593
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,020
but there are

594
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,060
so many case files.

595
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,060
It'll take at least a month or two

596
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:13,980
to find this one.

597
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,940
The files are stored by year and month.

598
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,460
How is it so hard to find them?

599
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,860
You're probably hiding something.

600
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:20,780

601
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,340
take him away.

602
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,460
Don't!

603
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:25,820
Vice Minister,

604
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,460
let me be honest with you.

605
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,100
When I took office a few years ago,

606
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,700
I did go through the case files
of previous years

607
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,660
and checked the access records.

608
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,780
After the censor case, however,

609
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,180
the files

610
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,540
were moved

611
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,420
by then Vice Minister

612
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,820
of Personnel,

613
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,740
Mr. Hai Yiping,

614
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:40,740
and they were

615
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,060
never returned.

616
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,500
I didn't dare

617
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,980
to ask about it.

618
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,620
Sometimes, it's wiser

619
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,620
to ask less and think less.

620
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,060
Why are you here?

621
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,100
So?

622
00:22:59,460 --> 00:22:59,980
Did you get it?

623
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,420
That clerk hasn't been managing
the archives for long.

624
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,100
The files are missing,

625
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,340
and there's no record

626
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,340
of them being accessed.

627
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,700
This person is cautious and cunning.

628
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,540
It's no surprise

629
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,980
that he would tamper with the files.

630
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,260
On the contrary, it only confirms

631
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,980
my suspicion that there's something

632
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,300
unusual in them.

633
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:18,620
Oh,

634
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,340
and about the Longmen Arena matter,

635
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,140
thank you.

636
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:23,770
I'm off.

637
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:28,980
Vice Minister,

638
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,770
why didn't you tell her

639
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,090
that Mr. Hai took the files?

640
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,330
Are you trying to keep her
from opposing Mr. Hai

641
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,660
and standing against you?

642
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,380
That's not the reason.

643
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,490
It's a matter of timing.

644
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,460
I need to use the Mei alliance

645
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,010
to counter the Li family.

646
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,490
The issue of salt price manipulation
is still unresolved.

647
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,940
I can't let her disrupt my plans.

648
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,180
Any news

649
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,050
from Nichang?

650
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,090
She got

651
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,730
that old man
from the Ministry of Personnel

652
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:07,330
drunk,

653
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:08,250
and only then did he reveal

654
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,250
that the clerk in charge
of the archives back then

655
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,700
was dismissed for dereliction of duty.

656
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,220
Who authorized this?

657
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,220
Hai Yiping.

658
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:31,950
[Hai Mansion]

659
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,330
Mr. Hai.

660
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,730
You are here, Miss Ye.

661
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,940
How

662
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:44,900
is your health?

663
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,420
Thank you for your concern.

664
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,090
I've nearly recovered.

665
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,180
I've been cooped up inside for too long,

666
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,180
so I thought I'd come out

667
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,140
and check on Hai Yan.

668
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,290
I didn't expect that you'd be set up

669
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,980
right after taking office.

670
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,180
What is this person's agenda?

671
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,860
Is it because of your past dealings

672
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,330
with Du Liang?

673
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,010
This is likely the work

674
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,250
of someone close to Du Liang.

675
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,460
The good thing is,

676
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,290
if this person tries to target me again,

677
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,330
it will surely draw

678
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,380
the attention of Her Majesty.

679
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,330
I'll need to be alone

680
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,700
with Hai Yan for the diagnosis today,

681
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,290
which will take some time.

682
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,090
If you trust me...

683
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:22,980
Miss Ye,

684
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,220
I have complete trust in you

685
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,700
to take care of Hai Yan.

686
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,330
If you need anything, just let me know.

687
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,730
Do you remember this pattern?

688
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,250
You drew it

689
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,770

00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:44,620

No,

693
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,250
it wasn't my brother.

694
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,250
So,

695
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,700
do you know that woman?

696
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,770
Do you know her name?

697
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:05,940
I don't know her.

698

Where is she?

710
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,980
Invite her in.

711
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,490
She went to the backyard.

712
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:01,620
Then,

713
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,290
I'll go check on her.

714
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,370
[The Hai Mansion's Archive]

715
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,050
You must be Mr. Hai's guest.

00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:44,620
Sir,

717
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,860
is this the archive?

718
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,420
Yes,

719
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:48,660
I'm airing them out

720
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:49,700
since the weather's good.

721
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,700
It helps keep the pests away.

722
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,730
This library looks newer

723
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,940
than the buildings in the front yard.

724
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,770
You're quite observant.

725
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,010
This used to be

726
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,420
a guest room.

727
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,980
But years ago,

728
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,810
it was destroyed in a fire

729
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,090
and has since been rebuilt.

730
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,250
A fire?

731
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:11,940
What happened that caused the fire here?

732
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:12,810
Well,

733
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:14,810
that's a bit of a tricky subject.

734
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,730
It's nothing to be secretive about.

735
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,090
- Madam.
- Madam.

736
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:21,980

yet my son still keeps

738
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,140
the books given by Yu Qian.

739
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:28,490
Others avoid talking about the past,

740
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,810
but I

741
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,180
have nothing to hide.

742
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,090
The fire in the guest room

743
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,900
is related to the censor case

744
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,290
from over a decade ago.

745
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:40,810
I've heard of

746
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,330
this case before,

747
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,010
but I never thought

748
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,980
Mr. Hai would know Yu Qian.

749
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,330
Back then,

750
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:54,090
my son, Yu Qian, and Sun Xizheng

751
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,140
were close friends and classmates,

752
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,980
all passing the imperial exams together.

753
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,620
Who would have thought
that more than a decade ago,

754
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,860
Yu Qian's entire family

755
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,570
was executed due to the censor case.

756
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,050
My son couldn't believe

757
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,180
that Yu Qian could commit

758
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,900
such heinous acts.

759
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,460
After his passing,

760
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,090
he fell into deep sorrow.

761
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:14,490
Later,

762
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,180
someone came to our residence

763
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,180
claiming

764
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,490
to be a relative
of the woman who perished.

765
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,090
What is this person's name?

766
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,330
I can't quite recall,

767
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,770
but he said
there was injustice in the case

768
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,050
and sought my son's help,

769
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,940
requesting to view the case files
of the censor case.

770
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:30,900
My son thought

771
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,570
he could clear

772
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,730
his late friend's name

773
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:35,620
and rushed to retrieve the files

774
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,490
of the censor case,

775
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:39,810
bringing them to this guest room
for him to see.

776
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:43,770
But unexpectedly...

777
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,700
Unexpectedly,

778
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,050
[Sun Xizheng, the Manic Poet]
Mr. Hai invited me

779
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,380
and a few friends over that day

780
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:52,420
to discuss the ambiguities

781
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,250
of the censor case.

782
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,220
He told us

783
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,380
that a family member of a female victim

784
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,220
had come

785
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:00,770
to check the files,

786
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,140
and just as he

787
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,940
was about to introduce us,

788
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,090
the person

789
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,490
accidentally knocked over a candle,

790
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:08,770
setting the files on fire,

791
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,980
and even the guest room

792
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,180
was completely consumed by flames.

793
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:17,700
I never would have guessed

794
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,380
that the censor case files

795
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,490
had already become nothing but ashes.

796
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,530
Mr. Hai nearly

797
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,090
couldn't resolve the issue,

798
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,090
but in the end,

799
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,730
we sought the help of his mentor,

800
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:31,010
Chancellor Mei,

801
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,530
to intervene

802
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:34,900
and sort things out at the archives.

803
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,570
I never expected that,

804
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,010
back in the day,

805
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,900
Yu Qian had
such righteous colleagues like you.

806
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:41,770
But

807
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:43,010
now that you mention it, I'm curious.

808
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,570
Who were the old friends

809
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,660
that came with you to his place?

810
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,140
I truly admire you all

811
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:49,700
for still believing in

812
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,700
Yu Qian's innocence at that time.

813
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,460
They are...

814
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:06,490
Mother,

815
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,180
what brings you here?

816
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:10,940
Has Miss Ye left?

817
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,660
Have a seat, Mother.

818
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:16,180
Mother,

819
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,010
what happened to you?

820
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:19,860
Just now, in the backyard,

821
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:23,010
I saw the books

822
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,330
Yu Qian gave you.

823
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,330
Seeing them brought back memories,

824
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,380
and every time I think of him,

825
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:32,250
my heart aches with grief.

826
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,420
[Hai Yiping]

827
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,090
Back then,

828
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,420
when you were about
to be promoted to Vice Minister

829
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:39,860
and Yu Qian was wrongfully imprisoned,

830
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,900
he wrote a letter
and had someone deliver it to you.

831
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,090
You weren't home,

832
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,570
so I took the letter for you.

833
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,330
I knew he was innocent.

834
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:50,330
[Yu Qian]
My son,

835
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:52,490
Yu Qian has put his family's lives

836
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,290
and their reputation in your hands.

837
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,660
You must figure out a way to save him.

838
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:57,490
Mother, rest assured.

839
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,140
Yu Qian is a dear friend of mine.

840
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:00,980
I will make every effort to rescue him.

841
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,250
How pitiful!

842
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:07,460
He was so upright and incorruptible,

843
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:10,940
a truly honest and virtuous official.

844
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,180
But in the end,

845
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,180
he still died with regret.

846
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,010
Mother,

847
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,700
it's all in the past now.

848
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,180
Don't let it upset you anymore.

849
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:23,980
Your health is more important.

850
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,810
Let me take you back so you can rest.

851
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,050
Has everything been set

852
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:40,220
with Madam Hua?

853
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,050
All is prepared.

854
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,010
Rest assured, Master.

855
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,140
All right,

856
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,220
you can act now.

857
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,330
Yes, sir.

858
00:33:58,570 --> 00:33:59,770
Apart from Sun Xizheng,

859
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,730
everyone else who witnessed
the files being burned

860
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,180
said the same thing.

861
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:04,660
Hai Yiping

862
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,380
has indeed been Yu Qian's close friend
for many years

863
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,900
and even defended him

864
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,420
after the censor case.

865
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:11,740
I think

866
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,170
that the arsonist

867
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:13,860
isn't at all someone

868
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,780
from the victim's family.

869
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,090
After searching for so many years,

870
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,380
even the final lead related to the files

871
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:19,980
has been destroyed.

872
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,490
Danxin,

873
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,170
I know

874
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,940
you've always wanted

875
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,820
to clear Mr. Yu's name.

876
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,090
We've been working so hard for so long,

877
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,010
and now we must remain patient.

878
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,690
I understand that.

879
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:40,020
I just feel sorry for Mr. Yu.

880
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,010
He had risen to the rank
of Vice Minister,

881
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,090
but because he spoke up for the people,

882
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,010
he offended high-ranking officials

883
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,530
and was demoted

884
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:48,300
to the eighth rank.

885
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,610
He was so upright and incorruptible.

886
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:52,300
But in the end,

887
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,090
he still fell victim to the malicious.

888
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,860
If all officials were like Yu Qian,

889
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:58,980
how many injustices

890
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,420
would be avoided in this world?

891
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,860
For someone like Mr. Yu

892
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,900
to focus on his work,

893
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,860
it requires someone like me,

894
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,130
who will stop at nothing,

895
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,090
to clear the obstacles for him first.

896
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,010
Miss Wu.

897
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:21,980
It looks like

898
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,210
you're almost fully recovered.

899
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:24,860
Stop staying in the room.

900
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:25,690
Here,

901
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:26,940
change into this.

902
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,300
What is this for?

903
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,530
The Grand Genera
has returned to the capital

904
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,570
and is celebrating with the people.

905
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,380
The curfew is delayed by two hours.

906
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,780
There are three indulgences in life:

907
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,980
indulgences in eating, drinking,
and enjoyment.

908
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,210
If we don't indulge ourselves now,

909
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,420
when else will we?

910
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,130
If it's something so enjoyable,

911
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,490
then I shall happily comply.

912
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,690
Then why aren't you getting changed?

913
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,010
Do you need me to help you?

914
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,650
Who else can be like me,
soaring through the clouds

915
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,500
as freely as the swift wind?

916
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,530
Reaching great heights,

917
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,050
with the world in my grasp.

918
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:01,210
It feels amazing.

919
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,860
Truly amazing.

920
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,900
Miss Wu.

921
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:07,900
Don't call me that.

922
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:08,900
You are ruining my mood.

923
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,820
Call me Xian'er from now on.

924
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,610
Xian'er?

925
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:15,900
You're unrecognizable now,

926
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,300
completely different

927
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,420
from the person I imagined.

928
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,860
It's strange, really.

929
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:23,610
Your skills for healing the mind

930
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:24,300
should be famous

931
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:25,570
wherever you go.

932
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,170
How come no one else

933
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,090
has ever heard of it

934
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,050
aside from the capital?

935
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,380
I often travel to isolated places

936
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,780
to cure people,

937
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:33,780
so it's not surprising

938
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,780
that others haven't heard of me.

939
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,020
Is that so?

940
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:38,530
I actually think

941
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,780
the more isolated the place,

942
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:42,010
the more likely they are to see a genius
as someone remarkable.

943
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,980
This is the first time I've ever heard

944
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,530
someone describe me like this.

945
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,090
I sense something

946
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,460
secretive about you.

947
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:51,940
Would you be willing to tell me?

948
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,460
Now is not the right time,

949
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,210
but perhaps one day,

950
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:00,940
I will tell you.

951
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:03,010
All right,

952
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,090
I'll bring the finest liquor to listen

953
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,090
to your story when the time comes.

954
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,490
But you know,

955
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,820
one must always look ahead,

956
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:09,980
not backward.

957
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:12,900
Listen to the wind.

958
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,650
How free it is.

959
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,920
[Wanguoxiang]

960
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,340
What do you think of this place?

961
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,130
I've booked the entire place
for ourselves today.

962
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:40,980
As expected of you, Miss Wu,

963
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,650
generous as always.

964
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:44,530
Are we

965
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,820
expecting another guest?

966
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:46,980
He'll be here soon.

967
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,340
Madam Hua.

968
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,300
Coming.

969
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:53,460
Come on.

970
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,170
Sorry for keeping you waiting, Miss Wu.

971
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,300
Here is the best pipa artist

972
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,340
at Wanguoxiang Tavern,

973
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,300
a singer named Nichang.

974
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,610
It's hard to look away

975
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:10,610
from someone as beautiful as her.

976
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:11,860
Honored guests,

977
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,940
what tune would you like to hear today?

978
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,010
Ping'an,

979
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,020
you're the guest.

980
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:16,940
You choose.

981
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:18,940
I'll go with whatever you decide.

982
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,380
You two distinguished guests
have such remarkable bearing.

983
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:23,610
How about a rendition

984
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,940
of "Song of Mulan" today?

985
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:26,860
Sounds good.

986
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,130
I like this one.

987
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,980
I read the battle roll last night.

988
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:53,340
The Khan has ordered men to fight.

989
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,980
The roll was written in twelve books.

990
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:59,530
My father's name was in twelve nooks.

991
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,530
My father has no grown-up son.

992
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:05,530
For elder brother I have none.

993
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,170
I'll get a horse of hardy race

994
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:11,860
and serve in my father's place.

995
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,380
She buys a steed at eastern fair,

996
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:20,130
a whip and saddle here and there.

997
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,380
She buys a bridle at the south

998
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:26,420
And metal bit for the horse's mouth.

999
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:29,530
At dawn she leaves her parents
by the city wall.

1000
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:32,900
At dusk she reaches Yellow River shore.

1001
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:36,020
All night she listens
for old folk's familiar call,

1002
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:40,300
But only hears the Yellow River's roar.

1003
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:41,900
Bravo!

1004
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,460
Ping'an.

1005
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:59,860
For miles and miles
the army march along

1006
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:05,340
and cross the mountain barriers
as in flight.

1007
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:14,090
The northern wind has chilled
the watchman's gong.

1008
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:22,460
Their coat of mail glistens
in wintry light.

1009
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,780
In ten years they've lost
many captains strong,

1010
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:36,570
but battle-hardened warriors
come back in delight.

1011
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,820
Back they have their audience

1012
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:44,780
with the Khan in the hall,

1013
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,380
Bravo!

1014
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:53,130
Bravo.

1015
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,300
What a heroine indeed.

1016
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,610
Miss Ye, your swordplay

1017
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,780
may seem effortless and spontaneous,

1018
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,170
yet when you strike,

1019
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,490
your skills are evident.

1020
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:04,740
Do you

1021
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,010
know me?

1022
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:07,490
A talented psychiatrist

1023
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:08,340
who's been in and out of prison twice.

1024
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:09,980
When I returned from the border,

1025
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,860
Xian'er told me

1026
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,900
many stories about you.

1027
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,780
So you are General Wu.

1028
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:16,860
I'm honored to meet you.

1029
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:19,420
I've already questioned

1030
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,980
the workers who were transferred

1031
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:22,090
from the capital to Yangzhou last year

1032
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:23,820
for the dike repairs.

1033
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,300
There is indeed something suspicious

1034
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:27,380
behind the dike's collapse,

1035
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:28,980
and it has something to do

1036
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:29,650
with that philanthropist, Li Zongxu.

1037
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,460
The collapse of the dike

1038
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,940
led to the flooding of the salt fields,

1039
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:36,460
which drove the salt prices up.

1040
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:37,900
Ultimately, the only one

1041
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,300
who benefited was Li Zongxu.

1042
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,340
Vice Minister,

1043
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,780
you haven't had a break in a while.

1044
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,010
The matter of rising salt prices

1045
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:45,690
still requires careful investigation.

1046
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,010
Tonight, with General Wu
returning to the capital

1047
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:47,820
and the curfew delayed,

1048
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,260
it would be better to relax for a bit.

1049
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,690
I see you

1050
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:52,740
are eager

1051
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,610
to meet a lady tonight.

1052
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,130
By the way,

1053
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:57,460
with General Wu
returning to the capital,

1054
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,380
who will host his welcome banquet?

1055
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:00,260
Many nobles

1056
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,260
have sent him their invitations,

1057
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,650
but the general hasn't gone
to see any of them.

1058
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:04,610
However, I heard someone saw him

1059
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:06,940
enter the Wanguoxiang Tavern.

1060
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,610
Ankang, you are the invincible general

1061
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:14,860
who safeguards the borders

1062
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:16,170
and secures our country's peace.

1063
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,650
Now that you've returned to the capital,

1064
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:18,900
we must drink

1065
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,490
to our heart's content tonight.

1066
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,210
Why don't you

1067
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,210
join us, Miss Ye?

1068
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,380
Here.

1069
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,420
Honored guests,

1070
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,690
we

1071
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:38,300
have recently acquired a new dancer

1072
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,530
with remarkable skills.

1073
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,490
Even Miss Wu
has yet to witness her performance.

1074
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:42,940
Since we

1075
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:45,090
[Madam Hua, the hostess of Wanguoxiang]
are welcoming the general today,

1076
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:46,610
how about we call her over

1077
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:47,690
for a dance?

1078
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:48,490
I haven't seen her before?

1079
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,650
Now, I'm intrigued.

1080
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:51,650
I'll go get her now.

1081
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:56,780
How could I not be
part of the celebration

1082
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,300
of General Wu's return?

1083
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,340
Mr. Yuan, you've had a comfortable life

1084
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,820
in the capital for the past five years.

1085
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:07,300
Your complexion

1086
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,650
certainly looks much better

1087
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:09,610
than it did in the barracks.

1088
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:11,460
I never expected

1089
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,860
that you and Mr. Yuan
are old acquaintances.

1090
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:24,050
This fine liquor from Wanguoxiang

1091
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:25,740
is something you could never taste

1092
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:26,980
at the border.

1093
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:28,130
Allow me.

1094
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,900
I guess the liquor at Wanguoxiang

1095
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:36,490
has eroded your integrity

1096
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,460
over the years.

1097
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:38,610
After all,

1098
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:40,170
no one succeeds

1099
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:42,340
in the official world without drinking.

1100
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,610
Speaking of success
in the official world,

1101
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:46,940
I,

1102
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:48,940
of course,
am no match for you, Miss Ye.

1103
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,460
The fact that you are able
to sit here with these two

1104
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:53,050
shows that you are truly remarkable
at making connections

1105
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:54,420
with influential figures.

1106
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:56,690
I know

1107
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:59,090
you dislike me the most, Mr. Yuan,

1108
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,260
but there's no need to pick on me.

1109
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,420
After all, I'm a guest tonight,

1110
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:05,490
yet you came uninvited.

1111
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,570
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

1112
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,050
Move faster.

1113
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:10,740
Come on.

1114
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:11,610
Introduce yourself

1115
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:12,820
to our esteemed guests.

1116
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:16,820
My name is Li Ge,

1117
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,380
and I specialize in the Sogdian Whirl,

1118
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:20,460
long-sleeve dance,

1119
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:21,490
Lyuyao dance,

1120
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:22,340

1121
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:24,340
[Li Ge, a dancer of Wanguoxiang Tavern]
May I ask what you

1122
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:25,530
would like to see?

1123
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:28,900
The city falls
to the beat of battle drums,

1124
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:31,340
the Zhezhi dance vivid
in everyone's mind.

It's great.

1128

Everyone, enjoy it.

1129
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:51,780
General Wu,
you rarely return to the capital.

1130
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:53,610
Let me

1131
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:55,420
raise a toast to welcome you back.

1132
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:03,420
The liquor at Wanguoxiang Tavern

1133
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:04,780
isn't that great.

1134
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:06,490

All right.

Since you've invited me,

1138
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:13,690
how could I not go?

1139
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:24,090
What's going on?

1140
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:25,010
Let me take a look.

1141
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:27,530
You useless fool.

1142
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:28,420
You've ruined

1143
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:29,260
our reputation.

1144
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:30,490

It's my fault.

1152
