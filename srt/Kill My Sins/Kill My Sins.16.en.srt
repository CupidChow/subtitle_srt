I'd like to pawn this

Your item

218
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,350
isn't worth that much.

219
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,320
I don't accept it.

220
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,110
Hundred liang?

221

I see that bronze ox

222

is only worth a dozen liang,

223
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,080
yet you accepted it.

224
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,110
You misunderstand.

225
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,400
That's not a pawned item.

226
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,680
It's just something I brought

Li,

233
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,280
recently,

234
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,400
you've been inviting us

235
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,470
to Wanguoxiang Tavern
for drinks every day.

236
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:39,960
Is it because

237
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,080
what happened at the banquet

238
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,920
scared you

239
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,230
and made you unsettled?

240
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,960
I'm telling you.

241
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,080
I'll never forget that scene

242
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,230
for the rest of my life.

243
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,230
That assassin

244
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,400
died right in front of me,

245
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,830
with her blood spraying all over me.

246
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,630
Ever since that night,

247
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,160
I've been having nightmares.

248
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,990
This liquor is made
by melting ice into mist.

249
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,230
Sirs,

250
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,920
please have a taste.

251
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,320
They say if you have a clear conscience,

252
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,080
you have nothing to fear.

253
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,470
What was that you said?

254
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,400
Repeat it. I dare you.

255
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,160
I simply mean

256
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,560
you look kind-hearted,

257
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,590
so surely you wouldn't

258
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,630
have done anything
against your conscience.

259
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,280
So, you mean

260
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,680
a guilty conscience

261
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,160
will haunt one?

262
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,320
Sir,

263
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,680
did you do anything?

264
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,750
Of course not!

265
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,800
I am upright and honorable!

266
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,680
Isn't that right?

267
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,040
- That's right.
- That's right.

268
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,800
Of course.

269
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,590
Pour me more.

270
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,960
That ice one!

271
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,510
This has been stored
in my residence for years.

272
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,990
I've never been willing to drink it.

273
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:25,510
It would be rude to refuse.

274
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,960
Why did you suddenly invite me?

275
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,230
Didn't you say

276
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,280
you'd treat me to a drink someday?

277
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,400
The liquor is fine,

278
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,710
but the timing

279
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,470
is not.

280
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:36,800
I don't believe

281
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,990
you truly attempted
to assassinate the envoy.

282
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,110
I know you hate

283
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,320
the Shuodan people,

284
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,040
but you would never do anything

285
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,470
to ruin our nation's reputation.

286
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,470
Surely you didn't come here

287
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,990
just to affirm

288
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,800
my integrity, right?

289
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,750
I heard

290
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,200
you once provided relief

291
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,590
to those suffering from a locust plague.

292
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,280
Just for that,

293
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,590
I want to help you. Is that not allowed?

294
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,510
And how will you help?

295
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,470
The Emperor's investigation
into the banquet attack

296
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,510
is merely

297
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,160
to appease the envoys.

298
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,870
The envoys came here

299
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,350
for a marriage alliance.

300
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,800
They don't want conflict.

301
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,800
I can speak with Shuodan's princess,

302
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,080
and persuade her

303
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,200
to prioritize peace

304
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,470
and have this matter dismissed
as a misunderstanding.

305
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,590
That way, the crisis will be resolved.

306
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,110
It's not as simple

307
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,800
as you think.

308
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,400
You hold military power.

309
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,320
Many people fear you.

310
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,990
Countless voices want to send you

311
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,160
to Shuodan as a consort prince.

312
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,320
You can barely protect yourself.

313
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:25,870
Don't trouble yourself over me.

314
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,510
Back on the battlefield,

315
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,990
we faced dangers

316
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,320
far worse than this,

317
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,750
yet we trusted each other

318
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,160
with our lives.

319
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:33,630
Why is it that now,

320
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,400
in the capital,

321
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,080
you hesitate?

322
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,680
On the battlefield,

323
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,590
we could set aside status.

324
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,920
But here, we cannot.

325
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,470
No one chooses

326
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,470
their birth.

327
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,990
If even someone in my position

328
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,350
cannot protect a good official

329
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,830
who serves the people,

330
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,630
then I would truly

331
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,510
be failing my own

332
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,040
conscience.

333
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,280
I know

334
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:06,960
you returned this time

335
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,960
to investigate the grain
and salt transport

336
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,680
during the Battle of Jinyuan, right?

337
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,800
Seems we do have
some tacit understanding.

338
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,280
Since you have suspicions,

339
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,990
so do I.

340
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:17,960
I've been investigating as well.

341
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,110
What have you found?

342
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,710
Li Zongxu.

343
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,110
Then you're not ahead of me.

344
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,510
Besides him,

345
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,590
I also discovered

346
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,080
that the granary magistrate
back then, Xu Qing,

347
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,590
was involved.

348
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,800
Xu Qing?

349
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,230
Mr. Xu, take care.

350
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:43,510
Mr. Yuan,

351
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,630
Mr. Hai wants to meet you.

352
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,320
What's wrong?

353
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:50,990
Nothing.

354
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,110
Since we're both
investigating this matter,

355
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,510
let's see

356
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:55,630
who uncovers the truth first.

357
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,400
I won't lose to you.

358
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,990
You've been dismissed
from your position.

359
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,960
There's no one at your disposal.

360
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:01,990
If you need help,

361
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,110
just let me know.

362
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,070
There is indeed something

363
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:10,900
I could use your help with.

364
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,430
I heard

365
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:13,740
that Su's Pastry Shop

366
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,860
delivers white sugar cakes
to Kangping Mansion

367
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,830
every ten days.

368
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,140
But recently,

369
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,110
they've run out of Nine-Spice Honey,

370
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:20,710
which they use to make the cakes.

371
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:21,860
I happened to

372
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,190
have some at my residence.

373
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,900
So I asked their pastry chef

374
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,140
to make a box,

375
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,830
and I'd like you

376
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,710
to deliver it
to the Prince of Kangping for me.

377
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,500
You know

378
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,020
my father despises those

379
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,430
who curry favor with the powerful.

380
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,020
But

381
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,380
I can try.

382
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:44,740
Wait for my news.

00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:56,740
Why are you here?

386
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,860
Is there any news?

387
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:58,660

00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,150
we will follow.

580
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,670
Take inventory

581
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,910
of my remaining grain and salary.

582
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,340
If I don't return,

583
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,430
distribute it

584
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,910
among the people of Mang Gutter.

585
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:57,870
Master,

586
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,060
Haoji sent words to you.

587
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,390
He will submit a petition

588
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,500
to Her Majesty tomorrow

589
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,300
to appoint Wu Ankang
as the prince consort.

590
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,190
But...

591
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:08,710
But what?

592
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,020
But he is still considering

593
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,740
the salt trade deal.

594
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,910
Find some Shuodan men in the capital

595
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,670
who value money over their lives.

596
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,990
Pay them well

597
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:23,670
and have them

598
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,670
wipe Yuan Shaocheng down tomorrow.

599
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,300
Why not use the secret guards?

600
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,500
Uncle has been investigating him.

601
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:32,990
If he dies,

602
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:34,780
the Wu family

603
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,300
will seize the opportunity

604
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,820
to pin the blame on us.

605
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,500
Yuan Shaocheng attempted
to assassinate the envoy,

606
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,430
yet the court's investigation

607
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,260
has yielded no conclusion.

608
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,230
If some Shuodan residents in the capital

609
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:48,340
are outraged by the incident
and kill him out of vengeance,

610
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,820
that's understandable.

611
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,430
With the prince consort appointed,
and the marriage alliance secured,

612
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:54,870
the court will not hold accountable

613
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,340
for a few Shuodan men.

614
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,430
When the time comes,

615
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,780
have Li Kun

616
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,500
take over the interrogation.

617
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,190
That way, we'll not get involved.

618
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,260
That is reason.

619
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,150
Master, you're brilliant.

620
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,740
But if he dies on Wan'an Mountain,

621
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:11,990
won't that seem suspicious?

622
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,260
It's just a corpse.

623
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,300
It can appear anywhere.

624
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,470
[Rat]

625
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,100
Interrupting others
while they are burning incense

626
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,020
and offering prayer

627
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,350
is very rude.

628
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:17,910
Why don't you light a stick yourself?

629
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,220
I don't believe in such stuff.

630
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,580
The only thing I trust is myself.

631
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:23,620
Makes sense.

632
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,270
Someone like you

633
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,430
who is willing to do anything

634
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,660
for power,

635
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:29,270
even the King of Underworld
wouldn't take you.

636
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,750
Coming here alone for revenge?

637
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:40,180
Should I call you brave

638
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:42,750
or reckless?

639
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:44,390
Oh, right,

640
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,580
you're the only one left now,

641
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,580
aren't you?

642
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:50,990
Yuan Shaocheng,

643
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,660
I asked you

644
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,950
to sell me the river,

645
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,390
but you refused.

646
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,500
Now,

647
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,220
I don't just want that,

648
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,830
but the whole Mang Gutter.

649
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,500
I've already

650
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,100
drafted

651
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,180
a deed of transfer.

652
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,180
If you sign it today,

653
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,540
you'll walk away unharmed.

654
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,950
If you refuse,

655
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:15,790
this place

656
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,660
will be your grave.

657
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,310
You attempted to assassinate the envoy

658
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,580
and frame me,

659
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,350
sabotaging the peace
between Shuodan and Great Feng.

660
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,950
And now, you've even hired Shuodan men

661
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:43,830
to kill me.

662
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,580
How despicable you are.

663
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,790
So what?

664
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,950
Didn't you and Ye Ping'an

665
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,430
try to expose me

666
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,580
at the banquet?

667
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,270
And what happened?

668
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,910
You're still going to die in my hand.

669
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,140
Yuan Shaocheng,

670
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,870
kneel and beg me,

671
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,620
and I can just spare your life.

672
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,870
Yuan Shaocheng.

673
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,500
Once again.

674
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,180
Kneel and beg me,

675
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,060
and not only will I

676
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,830
spare your life,

677
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,700
but I'll spare

678
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,270
those pathetic Mang Gutter lowlifes

679
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,500
as well.

680
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,700
Now, kneel!

681
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,750
Since we've come to this point,

682
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,500
I might as well

683
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,180
tell you another truth.

684
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,580
Haven't you always wanted to know

685
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,270
why I want Mang Gutter so badly?

686
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,750
Because the river through Mang Gutter

687
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,620
can be used to smuggle goods

688
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,990
into the capital.

689
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,100
And I

690
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,180
just happened to find

691
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,500
a hidden salt field.

692
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,990
So the illegal salt smugglers

693
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,660
Wu Ankang caught

694
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,870
outside the city the other day

695
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,580
had nothing to do with you?

696
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,540
Of course.

697
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,790
Wu Ankang hates me

698
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,020
because during the Battle of Jinyuan,

699
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,580
I obstructed the transport
of salt and grain.

700
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,140
Instead of arresting Huang Yimin,

701
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,580
a major illegal salt trader,

702
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,350
he fixated on pinning the crime

703
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,500
of salt smuggling

704
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,500
on me.

705
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,220
How utterly foolish he is.

706
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,620
The salt and grain shortage

707
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,430
was indeed because of you.

708
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,540
You disregarded the lives

709
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,350
of the common people and the soldiers,

710
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,140
leading to countless casualties.

711
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,180
You deserve to die!

712
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,660
Even now,

713
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,310
you're still so stubborn?

714
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,270
Yuan Shaocheng,

715
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:08,580
remember this,

716
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,870
you will always be

717
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,270
a worthless lowlife.

718
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,500
Even if you live,

719
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,620
you will be a person with no real soul.

720
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,310
For years,

721
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,660
I have been learning.

722
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,910
Some taught me patience

723
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,700
with their fists.

724
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,830
Some taught me how to attack

725
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,910
with their blood.

726
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,500
Some taught me strategy

727
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,990
by their mastery of tactics.

728
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,180
And you,

729
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,660
you taught me

730
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,350
to never underestimate my enemy.

731
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,580
Ye Ping'an?

732
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,310
You're not dead?

733
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:20,910
Get lost right now,

734
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:21,870
or I'll call for backup.

735
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,540
The assassination

736
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,540
had nothing to do with me.

737
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,620
As long as you

738
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,830
go to Wan'an Mountain's altar tomorrow

739
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,060
and watch a show,

740
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,100
you'll know the truth.

741
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,500
How dare you!

742
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,580
I am Apuna Haoji,

743
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,620
the envoy of Shuodan.

744
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,060
Li Zongxu attempted

745
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,180
to assassinate me at the banquet.

746
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,950
Now you are colluding with him?

747
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,390
That is a betrayal of Shuodan.

748
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,100
If you do this,

749
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,140
you will have no place

750
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,270
to stay in Shuodan

751
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,270
or Great Feng.

752
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,140
Drop your weapons.

753
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,220
Put down your weapons!

754
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,060
Come back with me,

755
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,790
and I can spare your lives.

756
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,140
I will report what happened today

757
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,350
to Her Majesty.

758
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,220
Your personal grudges

759
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,750
have nothing to do with me.

760
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,950
Why is there not a single lantern?

761
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:28,950
What if a ghost appears?

762
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,910
What's there to fear about ghosts?

763
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:32,870
Humans are far more terrifying

764
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,100
than ghosts.

765
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:37,790
Watch your step.

766
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:38,620
Don't trip yourself.

767
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:39,500
Alright.

768
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,870
Mr. Yuan stored all the grain here.

769
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,390
Won't they easily get damp?

770
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,660
The grain won't,

771
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,350
but the corpses might.

772
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,620
Wait, what exactly

773
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,700
are we supposed to count here?

774
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,910
Whether we count or not

775
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,060
is not

776
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,430
your business.

777
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,350
It's just that the rat droppings here

778
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,030
are making me dizzy

779
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,180
and nauseous.

780
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:17,620
Zhao Yu,

781
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,540
what's wrong with you today?

782
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,260
Why use that ironic tone?

783
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:37,660
Hesheng?

784
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:40,540
You...

785
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:41,580
Er...

786
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,140
Wenyu,

787
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,580
you're not the person
who should be the most stunned,

788
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,220
but the person behind you.

789
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,060
Right,

790
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,540
Xin Jun?

791
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,740
His wound looks serious,

792
00:41:58,980 --> 00:41:59,990
but luckily, it's not fatal.

793
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:01,350
Now, we must

794
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,310
make everyone believe

795
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,540
that Yuan Hesheng is dead.

796
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,310
Only then can we

797
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,580
turn this game around.

798
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,220
Regarding the banquet,

799
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,100
who do you suspect betrayed us?

800
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:12,990
Xin Jun.

801
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,990
He contacts the accounting office
through Zhao Yu.

802
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,580
For Li Muyuan

803
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,790
to obtain my financial records,

804
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,540
I believe Xin Jun was involved.

805
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,580
Keeping him close

806
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,660
was just to avoid alerting the enemy.

807
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,430
So...

808
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,140
you deliberately had me
pass on the message?

809
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,390
What do you think?

00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,820
