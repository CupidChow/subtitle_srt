For some reason,

her husband cast her out.

5
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,410
The divorce wasn't mutual
but was initiated by her husband.

6
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,020
She must have violated
one of the Seven Grounds for Divorce.

7
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,460
What a disgrace.

8
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,060
That says a lot about her character.

Evil spirits.

21

They are here.

Where's that girl?

26
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:26,970
Didn't she want me

27
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,020
to dispel her inner demons?

28
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,500
Oh, my poor granddaughter.

29
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,900
She was tricked into that house
by wicked people,

30
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,220
ruining her reputation.

31
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,740
And now even her husband's family
has abandoned her.

32
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,020
She's been sinking deeper

33
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,220
into despair,

34
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,810
and I fear she'll end her life,

35
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,810
so I took her to see a shaman.

36
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:11,850
Don't!

Let me tell you

58

about my plan.

improve the boats,

62

set up raw material workshops
on the east side,

63
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,330
and reserve the west
for animal training.

64
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,180
As for the lowborn,

65
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,420
I can buy half of them.

66
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,740
I don't recall

67
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:30,890
ever agreeing

68
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,060
to sell you this land.

69
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,620
You put your heart and soul

70
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,060
into helping the people of Mang Gutter.

71
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,450
You went so far as to offend
the noble families

72
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,060
just to put an end
to the Longmen Battle.

73
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,420
But why do the people of Mang Gutter

74
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:45,980
not only fail to appreciate you

75
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,620
but even resent you?

76
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,130
At least

77
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,010
the Longmen Arena

78
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,450
gave them a choice,

79
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,420
a glimmer of hope

80
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,770
to change their fate.

81
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,570
Now, that hope is gone.

But I

83
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,890
can give them a new one.

84
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:00,500
For example,

85
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,500
I could send them to foreign lands
to learn the art of trade.

86
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:03,740
Just imagine

87
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:04,890
how many of them

88
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,370
would fight for such an opportunity.

89
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,690
Prince of Langyang,

90
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,450
you hold no official position,

91
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,890
nor do you wield real power,

92
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,660
yet many in the court

93
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,740
still treat you with deference,

94
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,540
all because

95
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,740
you bear the Li name.

96
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,500
But let me remind you,

97
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:19,810
the Li clan

98
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,620
hasn't had it easy

99
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,890
these past few years.

100
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,810
You're from Mang Gutter,

101

102
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,420
You don't understand

103
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,860
what true wealth is.

104
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:36,980
Wealth

105
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,450
means having a roof above,

106
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,420
fertile land below,

107
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,940
and heirs to carry it on.

108
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,500
In the capital, one mu of land
costs twenty thousand wen.

109
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,300
So,

110
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,500
even with your official title,

111
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,860
you're only renting that house

113
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,010
As for me,

with what others

116
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,250
could never dream of,

117
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,500
simply because of the Li family name.

118
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,980
Do you even understand

119
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,210
the difference between us?

120
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,330
You really don't know Mang Gutter.

121

00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,660
can be easily swayed by profit.

123
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,210
But just so you know,

124
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,180
no one will do business with you

125
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,890
without my consent.

126
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,450

127
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,860
to do business with them?

128
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,010
Do you really think

129
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,620
that just because you secured
the contract

130
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,660
while the land in Mang Gutter is cheap,

131
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,420
you can claim the river as yours?

132
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,690
Mang Gutter

133
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,450
will always belong to the court.

134
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,010
I can have the Market Commissioner

135
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:32,940
re-auction it.

136
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,010
With your wealth,

137
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,890
do you think you can compete with me?

138
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,770
You've allied with the Mei alliance

139
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,890
to suppress the Li family.

140
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,770
So what if you've overthrown Du Liang?

141
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,570
You're nothing but a pawn

142
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,060

from Mang Gutter.

175
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,690

that you worked as a nightsoil collector

177
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,540
and made it all the way
to Prosperity Lane.

178
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:17,660
You must have had

179
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,780
your fair share of turf battles, right?

180
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,260
Since the rich folks' waste

it sells for a higher price.

184

190
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,020
I can make 960 wen.

191
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,540
That's five times more.

He knows how to do the math.

193
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,540
What's the use of fighting?

194
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,180
Have you ever seen blood?

195
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,570
If you stick with us,

196
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:52,900
you'll see plenty.

197
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:54,970
Hesheng,

198
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,660
don't scare him. He's new here.

199
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,540
It was just a joke.

200
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,730
No need to stress.

201
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,850
Your friend

202
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,020
is smart,

203
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,660
but he needs

204
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,180
more guts.

205
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,210
Looks like you're in.

206
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:07,330
Don't worry.

207
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:08,660
From now on,

208
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,330
we're all family.

209
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,060
Thank you.

210
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,090
Thank you so much.

211
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,180
Mr. Yuan,

212
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,210
you've always been the one

213
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,060
I admire the most.

214
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,090
Why?

215
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:17,730
You fought your way out of Mang Gutter,

216
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:18,810
earned your achievements

217
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,180
on the battlefield step by step,

218
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,090
and rose through the ranks.

219
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,180
Now that you hold a high position,

220
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,260
who wouldn't admire you?

221
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:25,420
Wenyu,

222
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:26,450
take him to the accounting office

223
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:27,690
and give him a job.

224
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,060
All right.

225
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,330
Let's go.

226
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:29,850
Thank you.

227
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,020
Thank you.

228
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,140
Even though Xin Jun

229
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,380
is Wenyu's friend,

230
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,450
you

231
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,380
should still ask Mr. Gu

232
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:41,690
to check his background.

233
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:43,660
Got it.

234
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:45,940
So,

235
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,330
what did you
want to talk to me about just now?

236
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:58,490
I've quit drinking.

237
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,570
Quit drinking?

238
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:01,420
Why?

239
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,570
You're going to be an uncle.

240
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,180
You mean Bai Sheng is...?

241
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,300
She's pregnant.

242
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,490
Good for you, Hesheng.

243
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,380
You're going to be a father.

244
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,380
We should have

245
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,490
a celebration feast someday.

246
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,020
What's wrong?

247
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,210
You're about to be a father.

248
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,610
Shouldn't you be happy?

249
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,420
Shaocheng,

250
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,580
we've witnessed

251
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,780
so much death.

252
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,540
Too much.

253
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,300
Ever since we came back from Jinyuan,

254
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,340
Bai Sheng keeps saying

255
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,620
I've been living in a daze.

256
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,620
But the moment I knew
I was going to have a child,

257
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,220
I suddenly felt

258
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,180
alive again.

259
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,300
But I'm worried

260
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,260
that I won't be

261
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,140
a good father.

262
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,460
I remember when I was a kid,

263
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,060
I was carrying sand
near a bridge in Mang Gutter

264
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,300
and accidentally blocked

265
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,140
the way of a thug.

266
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,420
He kicked me

267
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,220
straight into the river.

268
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,180
When I came back,

269
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:52,900
you saw me

270
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,900
covered in dirt,

271
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,700
and without a word,

272
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:55,780
you turned

273
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,700
and ran out the door.

274
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,060
When you returned,

275
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,340
you were just as filthy.

276
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,700
I thought he had beaten you up too.

277
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,940
But guess what?

278
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:05,940
After that day, that thug

279
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,580
never dared to look me in the eye again.

280
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,860
You never told me what happened,

281
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,340
but I always knew

282
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,100
I had a great brother

283
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,860
watching my back.

284
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,260
And I know you'll be a great father too.

285
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,340
By the way,

286
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,020
there's something else.

287
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,660
Li Zongxu approached me.

288
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,340
He's aware
that I've joined the Mei alliance,

289
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,100
so

290
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,060
he threatened

291
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,380
to buy out the river in Mang Gutter.

292
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,900
It's both a test

293
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:29,860
and

294
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,100
a warning.

295
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,980
He could take action against me
at any time,

296
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,740
leaving Mang Gutter defenseless.

297
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,900
He wants to control the lives

298
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,900
of the people in Mang Gutter.

299
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,740
Darn it!

300
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,220
Did we offend the Li family?

301
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,540
It was inevitable.

302
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,340
The noble families
have always tried to stop me

303
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,220
from raising the status of the lowborn.

304
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,460
If we don't put

305
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,140
Li Zongxu

306
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,020
and his stubborn supporters

307
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,140
in check,

308
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,700
the lowborn

309
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,460
will never break free.

310
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,260
Fancy some pork?

311
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,260
No, thanks.

312
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,340
Next time, then.

313
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,580
This is beautiful.

314
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,900
You're so skilled.

315
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,900
I love it

316
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,980
and will never take it off.

317
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,020
Lian.

318
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,620
My Lian.

319
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:22,980
Would you like some?

320
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,500
What are you doing here?

321
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,620
I've been looking everywhere for you.

322
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,100
Come on, let's go home.

323
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,700
What's wrong, Blackie?

324
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,620
Stop barking,

325
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,260
or you'll scare my customers.

326
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,540
You are back.

327
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,460
There's something

328
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:55,940
I need to tell you.

329
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,020
Cailian,

330
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,180
I hope you stay calm

331
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,660
when you hear it.

332
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,420
All right,

333
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,220
go ahead.

334
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,140
We've found the person

335
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,500
who left
the Seven-Petal Epiphyllum mark

336
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,180
on you.

337
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,300
It's Prince of Langyang,

338
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,660
Li Zongxu.

339
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:21,860
Cailian.

340
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:22,940
Nichang,

341
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:23,900
Ping'an,

342
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,100
is it Li Zongxu?

343
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,580
How is he involved in this?

344
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,700
He belongs to
the noble Li family bloodline.

345
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,900
We can't get any more involved in this.

346
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,180
It's too dangerous.

347
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,100
It is dangerous.

348
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,060
That's why

349
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,100
I'll let you make your own choices.

350
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,940
Those who want to marry,

351
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,260
go ahead.

352
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,580
Those who want to live their lives,

353
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,660
do so.

354
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,660
I have only one choice.

355
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,100
No matter

356
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:52,940
who that animal is,

357
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,100
he must pay the price.

358
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,580
I've said it before.

359
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,660
Until the censor case is resolved

360
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,660
and my name is cleared,

361
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,980
even if this path leads to ruin,

362
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,220
I will see it through to the end.

363
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,660
I agree.

364
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,010
In that case,

365
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,010
Danxin and I

366
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,460
will update you on our findings.

367
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,730
[Li]
On the surface, he helps the poor.

368
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,940
His salt shop and fabric shop

369
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,460
provide jobs for many.

370
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,490
But in reality, he colludes
with the Market Commissioner

371
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,490
to monopolize the market.

372
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,700
Under various pretexts,

373
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,100
he extorts small merchants,
demanding payments

374
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,250
[Langyang Mansion]
like a market entry fee,

375
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,490
leaving them with no way to survive.

376
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:45,650
Mr. Li.

377
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:46,980
Mr. Li.

378
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:47,980
Have mercy on me.

379
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:49,460
What are you doing?

380
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,490
He is a devout believer
in the deities and Buddhas,

381
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,460
and makes regular trips
to the mountain to pray,

382
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,130
offer incense,

383
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,220
and visit Wan'an Mountain

384
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,340
every fortnight.

385
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,340
He also invites monks
to expound on Buddhist teachings.

386
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:00,220
Also,

387
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,580
Li Ge told me

388
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:02,650
something important.

389
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,650
Li Zongxu

390
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,340
is unable to partake
in intimate relations.

391
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,130
Given his condition,

392
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:09,650
why must he bring misery to others?

393
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,340
His frustration over his condition

394
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,340
manifests in acts
of cruelty and violence.

395
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:20,220
No.

396
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:21,940
With this,

397
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,580
you'll always be mine

398
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:26,820
until death.

399
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,980
He is both cruel

400
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,580
and suspicious.

401
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,420
Getting close to him

402
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:37,650
would be dangerous.

403
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,850
This is exactly

404
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,180
what makes his weaknesses

405
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:42,650
so pronounced.

406
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:51,650
Master,

407
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,420
everything is going smoothly.

408
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,730
Ye Ping'an is prepared

409
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,770
to take action against Li Zongxu.

410
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,220
Good.

411
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,180
Now, let's see how these two

412
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,290
will clash

413
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,570
like rivals

414
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,090
trapped in a confined space.

415
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,330
Well.

416
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,860
Why is this person acting so strange?

417
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:32,900
Who's there?

418
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:40,660
Hey,

419
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,660
I'm asking you a question.

420
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,620
Why aren't you answering?

421
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,460
Forget it.

422
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,490
Ignore him

423
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,330
and keep heading up the mountain.

424
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:46,940
Yes, sir.

425
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,660
That wretched Jia Yan.

426
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,090
Dying is one thing,

427
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,940
but why did he have to wear
the red wedding robe

428
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,290
from our marriage?

429
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,380
Red wedding robe?

430
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,770
He's not coming for me, is he?

431
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,530
Sis.

432
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,420
Red wedding robe?

433
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,900
It's strange how he died in the well.

434
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,570
Who on earth did he offend?

435
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,090
He had it coming.

436
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,090
If he hadn't done so much evil

437
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,090
in his merchant days,

438
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,660
why would a multi-legged monster

439
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,330
have come for him?

440
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,700
Master, did we just run into a ghost

441
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:27,980
down the mountain?

442
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,050
Nonsense, there were no ghosts.

443
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,980
Someone must have sent them

444
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,250
on purpose

445
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,810
to unsettle me.

446
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:35,900
Take them down

447
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,220
and find out who sent them.

448
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:37,900
Yes, sir.

449
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:40,980
They've disappeared.

450
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,010
Go up and check.

451
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,750
[My late husband, Jia Yan]

452
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,530
No one's here.

453
00:18:59,090 --> 00:18:59,460
Master.

454
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,660
That's odd.

455
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:08,940
I've never seen

456
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:09,810
such a thick fog here before.

457
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,140
What's going on?

458
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,980
A... A monster!

459
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,050
A monster?

460
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,770
If he hadn't done so much evil

461
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,860
in his merchant days,

462
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,380
why would a multi-legged monster

463
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,730
have come for him?

464
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,460
Wan'an Mountain
is blessed by the Bodhisattva.

465
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,660
With such an unusual phenomenon
appearing,

466
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,290
could it be…?

467
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:32,980
No, it can't be.

468
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,530
I make offerings every month,

469
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,220
remain devout, and do many good deeds.

470
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:39,730
Go,

471
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,050
find a local villager immediately

472
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:41,700
and bring him here.

473
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,250
Yes.

474
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:48,900
Hurry.

475
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:51,620
Master.

476
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:52,980
Are you a local villager?

477
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,620
I am.

478
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,180
We met a pair of sisters.

479
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,180
One of them

480
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,330
said her husband was a merchant

481
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,490
who drowned after falling into a well.

482
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,460
His name

483
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,770
was Jia Yan.

484
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,050
Have you heard of this?

485
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,180
Jia Yan?

486
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,010
There was such a merchant,

487
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:06,770
and he did drown himself in a well.

488
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:07,620
But

489
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,530
before that,

490
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,900
he had already killed his wife

491
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,980
and her sister-in-law.

492
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,420
How could you

493
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,660
have possibly met them?

494
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:14,810
You're lying.

495
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,330
I wouldn't dare, Your Highness.

496
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,010
I wouldn't dare.

497
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,140
After you descend the mountain,

498
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,490
you can ask the locals

499
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,180
and see if there's any truth to this.

500
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,530
In other words,

501
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,180
the sisters we met

502
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:25,860
are also...

503
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:26,730
also...

504
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:27,090
Enough.

505
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,010
Let's hurry to the altar.

506
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,010
Yes, sir.

507
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:30,860
Lift the sedan chair.

508
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,660
Bodhisattva above,

509
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,180
is there

510
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,290
something lacking

511
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,620
in my service to you

512
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,620
that led to this warning?

513
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:06,460
I will restore your statue
with golden lacquer,

514
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,460
offering prayers and incense daily,

515
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,140
hoping

516
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,010
for your forgiveness.

517
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:21,810
Sir,

518
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,980
your sincerity is evident.

519
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,050
I believe Buddha

520
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,730
will hear your heartfelt prayers.

521
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,660
May I ask

522
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,220
how I should address you, Master?

523
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,940
I am a humble disciple of Master Puxuan,

524
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,090
and my Dharma name is Liaojing.

525
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,460
Greetings, Master Liaojing.

526
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,090
Master,

527
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:52,900
I encountered some strange things

528
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,810
on my way up the mountain today.

529
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,180
Since you

530
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,620
are a disciple of Master Puxuan,

531
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,420
your wisdom must be profound.

532
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,770
Could you enlighten me on this?

533
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,140
Sir,

534
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,620
please feel at ease and speak frankly.

535
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,420
Master Liaojing,

536
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:09,860
have I encountered

537
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,530
some kind of monster by chance?

538
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,490
From what I can see,

539
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,180
your mental strain

540
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,420
might have caused you to see illusions.

541
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,660
If you are still worried,

542
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,530
I will use the artifact
passed down by my master

543
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,860
to check for you.

544
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,660
I appreciate your help, Master Liaojing.

545
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:01,900
Master.

546
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,010
This is...

547
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,620
Amitabha,

548
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,050
the monster

549
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,530
is nearby.

550
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:11,700
Is there really a monster?

551
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,010
That monster
has been following you for a while.

552
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,730
It only stayed away

553
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,250
because this is a sacred altar.

554
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,420
If we don't resolve this quickly,

555
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,290
there could be

556
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,490
bloodshed soon.

557
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:27,860
Master Liaojing,

558
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:29,810
what can be done

559
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,770
to avert this bloodshed?

560
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:48,900
[Xin]

561
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,700
[Anxin House]

562
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:13,550
[Langyang Mansion]

563
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:21,980
Miss Ye,

564
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:22,900
please follow me.

565
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,330
Little master,

566
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:35,570
please eat more.

567
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,620
Little Master is probably sleepy.

568
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:39,900
Let's go.

569
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,530
Miss Ye,

570
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:43,250
this way, please.

571
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,180
Master,

572
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,860
Miss Ye is here.

573
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:53,460
Let her in,

574
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:54,620
then close the door.

575
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,810
Greetings, Your Highness.

576
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,860
I've long heard of you, Miss Ye.

577
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,290
Since you are favored by Her Majesty,

578
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,860
you must possess
some extraordinary skills.

579
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:13,810
I only know

580
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,220
some magic techniques,

581
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:17,290
which is why Her Majesty
took notice of me.

582
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,770
In that case, Miss Ye,

583
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,730
do you see

584
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,090
anything unusual about me?

585
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,140
At noon,

586
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,530
when the sun is at its peak

587
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:26,770
and the Yang energy is abundant,

588
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,660
it's difficult for evil beings
to get close.

589
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,460
However, upon observing Your Highness,

590
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,090
I notice dark circles under your eyes

591
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,660
and the darkening of your forehead.

592
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:34,700
It seems

593
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,570
you have been deeply entangled
with this monster,

594
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,140
which has left

595
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,900
your mind uneasy.

596
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:42,770
Miss Ye,

597
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:45,570
could you help me
expel the monster then?

598
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,050
It is indeed this very monster.

599
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:12,660
Miss Ye,

600
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,730
could you help me expel the monster?

601
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,420
I will surely reward you handsomely.

602
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:17,620
This monster

603
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,140
is quite formidable,

604
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,620
and eliminating it

605
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,860
will take time.

606
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,900
For today,

607
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,300
I will first help calm

608
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,780
Your Highness's mind,

609
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,820
preventing it from approaching you
in the next few days.

610
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,300
All right.

611
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,100
Thank you, Miss Ye.

612
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,820
Your Highness, focus on this bell

613
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,540
and clear your mind.

614
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,700
Seven-Petal Epiphyllum.

615
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,700
Seven-Petal Epiphyllum.

616
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,660
Why use this pattern?

617
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,300
Because of the Ancestral Hall.

618
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,660
Ancestral Hall.

619
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,140
Ye Ping'an has stayed here
the whole time.

620
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:28,340
Ye Ping'an has stayed here
the whole time.

621
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,540
Nichang and I have rehearsed everything.

622
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:54,780
Rest assured.

623
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,100
Everything is as you instructed.

624
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,140
There's no doubt it'll work.

625
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,540
Li Zongxu is suspicious

626
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,900
and distrustful.

627
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,500
He might even think

628
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,900
someone is trying to harm him.

629
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,500
Did we just run into a ghost

630
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,900
down the mountain?

631
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,780
Nonsense, there were no ghosts.

632
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,020
Someone must have sent them

633
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,180
on purpose

634
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,980
to unsettle me.

635
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,380
As the wind from the northern slope
dies down,

636
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,260
smoke will easily form.

637
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:25,940
Then,

638
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,260
I'll summon the beast.

639
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,220
A... A monster!

640
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,420
A monster?

641
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,940
He believes in the supernatural.

642
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,420
If he witnesses something

643
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,860
he cannot explain,

644
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,220
he will panic.

645
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,780
Once he panics,
he will turn to the deities for help.

646
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,180
But before that,

647
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,580
he had already killed his wife

648
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,700
and her sister-in-law.

649
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,700
How could you

650
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,900
have possibly met them?

651
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,140
Let's hurry to the altar.

652
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,660
I've tied a slipknot for this bracelet.

653
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,180
When you loosen it,

654
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,580
it will easily come apart.

655
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,020
Ping'an,

656
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,300
I'll show you a trick.

657
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,700
Watch closely.

658
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,580
Anyway,

659
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,260
we need to keep leading him on.

660
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,220
It is indeed this very monster.

661
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,380
He went from healthy to sick,

662
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,980
from no monster to believing in one.

663
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,900
Until he fully believes in

664
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,540
the monster's existence,

665
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,700
I will be able
to draw him into the trap.

666
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,100
But you made up the story

667
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,340
about Jia Yan murdering his wife
and drowning himself in a well.

668
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,020
What if Li Zongxu goes down the mountain

669
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:41,900
and verifies it?

670
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:42,900
Then we might...

671
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,340
Who said I made it up?

672
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,780
I specifically

673
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,020
asked Gu Wenyu

674
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,260
about unsolved cases around the capital,

675
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,820
and that's how I chose this one.

676
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,140
If Li Zongxu sends someone to check,

677
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,020
they'll find

678
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,460
that it's all true.

679
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,500
Although this trick

680
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,460
may fool him,

681
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,940
what if he wakes up midway

682
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,180
after being hypnotized?

683
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,460
Then I'll be exposed.

684
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,220
All our efforts

685
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,540
will be in vain.

686
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,060
That's why

687
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,260
I need to find the mark

688
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,500
and the clues

689
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,700
to the censor's case before he wakes up.

690
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,660
Because of the Ancestral Hall.

691
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,900
There's a fifteen-beat interval
between each team.

692
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:49,700
Five.

693
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,420
Ten.

694
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:52,980
Fifteen.

[Li Family Ancestral Hall]

00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,060
[The memorial tablet
of my late father Li Chengzhao]

697
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,820
That's strange.

698
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,100
Why isn't there

699
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,700
a memorial tablet
for Li Zongxu's mother?

700
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,900
[The memorial tablet

[The memorial tablet

702
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,180
This could be an exit mechanism.

703
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,850
Kan symbolizes the Rest Gate,

704
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,180
which is unfavorable for legal matters.

705
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,180
Li Zongxu wouldn't use it.

706
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,290
Li Zongxu is of the metal element

707
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:53,700
and Qian corresponds to metal,
representing the Open Gate.

708
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,500
Wait.

709
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,330
Since he treats
his mother's memorial tablet

710
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,530
as such a taboo,

711
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,020
even hiding it in a secret chamber,

712
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,530
[The memorial tablet]

716
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,980
Could it be that his mother

717
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,420
also suffered some kind of harm?

718
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,250
Maybe illness or injury.

719
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,210
If so, it would be

720
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,130
the Harm Gate,

721
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,500

735
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,250
Your Highness, since you are busy,

736
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,900
I shall take my leave.

737
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,730
I'll make the necessary preparations

738
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,130
and return in a few days
to expel the evil.

739
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,730
Thank you, Miss Ye.

I hope you

than being at the mercy of others.

757
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,940

00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:42,860
I'm listening.

764
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:44,170
When the envoy arrives in the capital,

765
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,540
a banquet will be arranged.

766
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,020
I hope you could ask Her Majesty

767
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,250
to entrust me

768
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,290
with organizing

769
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,090
the night banquet.

770
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,340
What's the reason?

771
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,540
Yuan Shaocheng.

772
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,650
This wild rat is quite something.

773
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,250
He shut down Longmen Arena

774
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,020
and gave all the noble families

775
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,060
a show of power.

776
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,250
Exactly.

777
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,250
Uncle,

778
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,610
Du Liang has been brought down.

779
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,210
We've suffered a setback
at the Ministry of Revenue.

780
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,730
It's all because Yuan Shaocheng
is stirring the pot.

781
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:24,730
Now,

782
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,090
he's getting closer to Hai Yiping

783
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,420
and keeps targeting

784
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,980
our salt trade.

785
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:30,940
Behind all this,

786
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,020
it's definitely the Wu family
pulling the strings.

787
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,610
The night banquet

788
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:39,610
is too significant.

789
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,250
That's why

790
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,420
we need to seize this opportunity

791
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,380
to drag Yuan Shaocheng down.

792
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,340
If the Wu family shields him,

793
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,980
they'll be implicated.

794
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,860
If they don't,

795
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,940
we can make him turn against them.

796
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,130
Fine.

797
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,980
I can lend a hand.

798
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,060
But

799
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,770
as for what you want to do

800
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,020
and how you plan to do it,

801
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,940
I'm completely unaware.

802
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,940
Take care, Uncle.
