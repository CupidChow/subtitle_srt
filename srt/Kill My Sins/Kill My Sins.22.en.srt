[Strong in a Group, Fearless Alone]

3
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,080
Mr. Yuan,

4
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,320
Ye Ping'an has shown up.

5
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,360
Should we

6
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,360
shoot her now?

7
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:51,920
Wait a little longer.

8
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,110
It's not time yet.

9
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,040
Wait for my instructions.

10
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:39,870
Do you know

11
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,800
what will happen tonight?

12
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,200
Hai Yiping wants
to kill two birds with one stone,

13
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,670
by using me

14
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,270
to kill Li Zongxu

15
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,800
and having me killed

16
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,360
for holding a royal member hostage.

17
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,040
In this way,

18
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,270
the truth of the Censor case

19
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,200
will be left to Hai Yiping to determine.

20
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,870
Since you know,

21
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,110
why did you come?

22
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,480
The only chance for Her Majesty

23
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,870
to reopen the Censor case

24
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
comes tonight.

25
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,110
I'll reveal

26
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,240
Hai Yiping's sins.

27
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,440
Even if

28
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,350
it costs your life?

29
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,520
Hai Yiping is guilty,

30
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,150
and so am I.

31
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,150
We should all pay the price.

32
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,030
Hai Yiping is on his way

33
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,150
with Her Majesty.

34
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,520
Tonight,

35
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,590
he is our common enemy.

36
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,030
This is the last time.

37
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,470
Don't let me down.

38
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,200
Why is it you again?

39
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,790
What do you want?

40
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,710
Her Majesty is arriving.

41
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,030
Make way!

42
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,640
Her Majesty is arriving.

43
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,880
Make way!

44
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,790
Ye Ping'an,

45
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,320
you dare

46
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,560
to hold a royal member hostage.

47
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,200
Your crime is extremely heinous.

48
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,470
Surrender and face your punishment.

49
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:56,520
Isn't that

50
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,910
the Prince of Langyang?

51
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,590
And Ye Ping'an,

52
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,200
the evil woman
who has harmed many people.

53
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,910
She kidnapped him?

54
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,710
My savior?

55
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,760
Li Zongxu,

56
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,960
over a decade ago,

57
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,030
you killed many women in Tongquan County

58
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,470
for your disgusting desires.

59
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,390
Today,

60
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,960
I will expose your wrongdoing

61
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,440
to the public.

62
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,000
Ye Ping'an,

63
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,200
you are being ridiculous.

64
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,640
You are holding
a royal relative hostage.

65
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,560
That's a felony.

66
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,320
You know you wouldn't escape death.

67
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,320
That's why you falsely accused me.

68
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,080
Do you have any evidence?

69
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,230
I can prove it.

70
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,680
I, Lu Danxin, am a survivor

71
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,230
among the many victimized women

72
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,680
in the wrongful Censor case

73
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,560
back then.

74
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,440
This is

75
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,320
evidence of him harming women

76
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,520
found in his residence.

77
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,880
Seven-Petal Epiphyllum mark.

78
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,680
What Ye Ping'an just said

79
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,150
is absolutely true.

80
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,150
What?

81
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,470
Is... Isn't the Prince of Langyang

82
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,350
a great person?

83
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,230
How could he...

84
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,440
You never know.

85
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,520
Can we believe what Ye Ping'an says?

86
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,320
But Lu Danxin is a victim

87
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,590
of the Censor case.

88
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,470
Would she lie about it?

89
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:11,880
That's nonsense.

90
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,520
I'm a royal relative.

91
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,030
With my identity,

92
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,080
how could I do such despicable things?

93
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,320
I have never been to Tongquan County.

94
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,080
Your Majesty,

95
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,120
please save me.

96
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,390
Help!

97
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,470
Please.

98
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,150
Li Zongxu,

99
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,390
your actions are monstrous.

100
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,640
You won't leave

101
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,350
Changxia Gate alive tonight.

102
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:29,830
Wait!

103
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,830
Why do you want to kill me?

104
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,390
I don't even know you.

105
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,910
It's not me who wants to kill you.

106
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,390
It's Hai Yiping
who wants me to kill you.

107
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,640
I can only walk down
this gate tower alive

108
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,590
by killing you tonight.

109
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,910
And only after you die,

110
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,390
would no one be able to prove

111
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,080
that Hai Yiping was closely

112
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,080
related to the Censor case.

113
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,640
Did you hear what she said?

114
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:56,790
Mr. Hai is also

115
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,760
involved in the Censor case.

116
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,350
This is impossible.

117
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,390
Mr. Hai is a good official.

118
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,350
Lu Danxin

119
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,790
must have been deceived.

120
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:04,960
Right.

121
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,680
Ye Ping'an is undoubtedly the culprit.

122
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,470
Your Highness,

123
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,880
when I learned

124
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,560
that you were being held hostage,

125
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,000
I immediately

126
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,520
informed Mr. Guo

127
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,790
to rescue you.

128
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,710
You must not

129
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,560
panic now.

130
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,370
I remember now.

131
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,810
You kidnapped me.

132
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,820
I was acting

133
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,980
on Hai Yiping's orders.

134
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,370
Tonight,

135
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,650
you must die.

136
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,700
Li Zongxu,

137
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,250
look

138
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,370
there.

139
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,300
Yuan Shaocheng?

140
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,890
Mr. Yuan, why did you...

141
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,220
They are too close.

142
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,010
I don't want
to hurt the Prince of Langyang.

143
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,530
Who does Yuan Shaocheng

144
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,850
work for?

145
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,610
I'm sure you are very clear about it.

146
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,580
You still haven't figured it out?

147
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,060
Shoot you,

148
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,220
and then blame me
for using you as a shield.

149
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,650
Once we both die,

150
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,220
no one will hold him accountable

151
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,340
for his wrongdoing.

152
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,580
Hai Yiping?

153
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,490
Hai Yiping,

154
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:34,980
you scumbag!

155
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,490
You dare try to kill me?

156
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,370
Fine.

157
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,730
I will drag you

158
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,460
down with me!

159
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:42,850
Your Majesty,

160
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,980
it was Hai Yiping
who concocted the Censor case.

161
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,980
He had people killed.

162
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,700
He forged evidence.

163
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,180
He did all the illegal things.

164
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,340
You have to save me, Your Majesty.

165
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,250
Your Majesty,

166
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:04,730
I don't understand

167
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,060
why Ye Ping'an is targeting Li Zongxu

168
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,340
to have him taken to the gate tower.

169
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,650
But he came after me for no reason.

170
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,610
He's probably

171
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,610
under the coercion of Ye Ping'an.

172
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,460
Your Majesty, I assure you,

173
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,580
I have no connection

174
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,980
to the Censor case.

175
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,370
Hai Yiping,

176
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,220
if you forget,

177
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,130
I'll ask your old friend

178
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,300
to help you recall.

179
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,580
Mr. Sun,

180
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,060
please.

181
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,490
Who is he?

182
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,250
Manic Poet.

183
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,420
Manic Poet, Sun Xizheng.

184
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,700
Haven't you heard of him?

185
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,060
He's a poet.

186
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,820
Why did Ye Ping'an get him here?

187
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,220
Is he

188
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,940
also related to the Censor case?

189
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,020
[Manic Poet, Sun Xizheng]

190
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:50,420
My greetings,

191
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:51,940
Your Majesty.

192
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:53,730
I resigned many years ago.

193
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,300
Today, I dare to speak

194
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,100
in front of you,

195
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,460
because I was entrusted by Miss Ye

196
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,370
to seek justice
for my good friend, Yu Qian.

197
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:03,650
Your Majesty,

198
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,980
I attest to having witnessed
the destruction

199
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,300
of the Censor case files
by fire at Hai Mansion.

200
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,980
The person reading the case file

201
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:10,730
was Chang Qing,

202
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,060
the father

203
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,220
of a victim.

204
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,180
Just the other day,

205
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,340
Miss Ye

206
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,220
had me meet with him again.

207
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:19,370
Your Majesty,

208
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,580
I heard that person

209
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:21,530
has long gone crazy.

210
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,820
Proceed.

211
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:24,890
Yes.

212
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,060
Chang Qing was driven crazy

213
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,530
by his years-long quest

214
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,420
for justice for his daughter.

215
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,580
Later, after being treated by Miss Ye,

216
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,370
he gradually regained his sanity,

217
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,100
and we later discovered

218
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,300
the destroyed files

219
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,250
were a trap

220
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,890
by Hai Yiping.

221
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,850
This is Chang Qing's testimony

222
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,300
I have recorded.

223
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,850
There is a witness now.

224
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,730
Hai Yiping has deceived you,

225
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,010
Your Majesty.

226
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:08,370
Your Majesty,

227
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,370
I am also a witness.

228
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,940
I can attest to it as well.

229
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:13,940
Your Majesty,

230
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,010
Sun Xizheng and I

231
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,340
have indeed been good friends
for many years,

232
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,700
but I don't know

233
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,420
why he

234
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,130
colluded with Ye Ping'an

235
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,180
to frame me.

236
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,130
There must be something suspicious here.

237
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,370
Your Majesty,

238
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,610
I beseech you to look into this matter

239
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,370
and see that my name is cleared.

240
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:30,940
And Ye Ping'an.

241
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,980
It's a fact

242
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,060
that she held a royal relative hostage.

243
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,340
Her crime is extremely heinous.

244
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,460
Your Majesty, please execute her

245
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,980
on the spot.

246
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,010
Your Majesty,

247
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,010
I am willing to be imprisoned

248
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,730
for doing this.

249
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,220
I am here today

250
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,460
to expose the true culprit

251
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,420
behind the Censor case.

252
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:47,490
I hope Your Majesty

253
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,010
can reveal the truth

254
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,100
of this case

255
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,100
and clear the names

256
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,100
of Yu Qian and the victims.

257
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,100
Your Majesty,

258
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,420
it was Hai Yiping who coerced me

259
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,700
into kidnapping Li Zongxu.

260
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,700
It has nothing to do with Ye Ping'an.

261
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,460
I will take full responsibility.

262
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,580
Reopen the wrongful case.

263
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,850
Bring Justice to the victims.

264
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,340
Reopen the wrongful case!
Bring Justice to the victims!

265
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,890

Bring Justice to the victims!

266
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,130

267
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,180

268
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,370
Reopen the wrongful case!
Bring Justice to the victims!

269
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,610
Reopen the wrongful case!
Bring Justice to the victims!

270
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,890

00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,220

272
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,530
Reopen the wrongful case!
Bring Justice to the victims!

273
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,770
Reopen the wrongful case!
Bring Justice to the victims!

274
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,940
Reopen the wrongful case!
Bring Justice to the victims!

275
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,180
Reopen the wrongful case!

276
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,060
Guo Yu.

277
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,060
Your Majesty.

278
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,100
Take down Hai Yiping

279
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,340
and detain him
in the Court of Judicial Review.

280
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:45,580
Yes, Your Majesty.

281
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:46,580
Your Majesty,

282
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,580
I am wrongly accused.

283
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,490
I am innocent, Your Majesty.

284
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:56,370
Hai Yiping.

285
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,010
You plot against people as a hobby.

286
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,650
But today it was you in the trap.

287
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,180
You dared to come after me.

288
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,060
You are not good enough.

289
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,490
Take him away.

290
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:06,730
Your Majesty.

291
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,530
I am completely innocent.

292
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,530
Your Majesty.

293
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,010
Your Majesty.

294
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,130
Your Majesty, I am unjustly accused.

295
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:13,940
Guo Yu.

296
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,980
Your Majesty.

297
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:15,770
Yes, Your Majesty.

298
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,770
Escort the Prince of Langyang
back to his mansion.

299
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,250
Deal with the rest yourself.

300
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,060
Yes, Your Majesty.

301
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,420
Her Majesty is returning to the palace.

302
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,340
Someone,

303
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,250
escort the Prince of Langyang back

304
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,530
to his mansion to reflect on himself,

305
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,650
and take the two women on the gate tower

306
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,060
to the Court of Judicial Review

307
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:49,610
to await their punishments.

308
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,250
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

309
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:14,890
Ye Ping'an,

310
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,460
have you seen it?

311
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,250
Even the empress dares not hurt me.

312
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,010
Aren't you tough?

313
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,370
Stay alive.

314
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,940
Soon,

315
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,770
you'll wish

316
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,650
you were dead.

317
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:37,980
You're

318
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,770
less than nothing.

319
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,060
It's too late.

320
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,100
Danxin.

321
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,250
Don't come closer.

322
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,730
I will kill him if you do.

323
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:06,890
What's going on?

324
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,580
Why did Lu Danxin take

325
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,220
the Prince of Langyang hostage again?

326
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,100
Come with me.

327
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,370
Don't worry.

328
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,650
I know what I'm doing.

329
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:32,770
You...

330
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:33,580
Stop.

331
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,220
Don't move.

332
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,460
Let go of me.

333
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,370
I promise you will live.

334
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:47,420
This first stab

335
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,060
is for you knew the truth
of the Censor case,

336
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,100
yet chose to collude with them

337
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,220
and concealed the truth to this day.

338
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:54,610
I want you

339
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,890
to Apologize to Yu Qian,
the former Monitor Censor

340
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,650
and to each and every member

341
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,130
of his family.

342
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,610
That was Du Liang's doing,

343
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,860
not mine.

344
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,770
Why should I apologize?

345
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,420
This second

346
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,250
is for Cailian who died tragically

347
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,770
on your hand.

348
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,860
You stabbed her
a total of seventeen times.

349
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,530
A number that will haunt you.

350
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,900
Apologize to Cailian.

351
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,660
I didn't do it.

352
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,810
It wasn't me.

353
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,810
Li Zongxu,

354
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,530
even now,

355
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,900
you have shown no remorse.

356
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,940
So many innocent women...

357
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,620
They died

358
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,770
because of you.

359
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:56,530
I want you

360
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,770
to die as compensation

361
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,660
for them.

362
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,900
I caused you all harm.

363
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,250
Danxin.

364
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,860
Did Hai Yiping

365
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,050
make you do something?

366
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,570
He forced me to take poison.

367
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,420
I won't survive tonight.

368
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:47,770
Fool,

369
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,140
you deliberately made me hate you.

370
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,290
You've played your part well,

371
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,330
but I see through your game.

372
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,660
I saw Gui

373
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,090
secretly meet with that old man.

374
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,730
And I knew it was the person you sent

375
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,140
to lure Hai Yiping into the trap.

376
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,220
You used him

377
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,090
to arouse my strong hatred towards you

378
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,730
so that Hai Yiping would believe

379
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,490
that we had really
turned against each other.

380
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,010
Only then will I have a chance

381
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,050
[Yu Qian]
to obtain the physical evidence

382
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,290

572
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,020
I haven't.

573
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,370
Withered flowers

574
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,610
should

575
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:19,020
be removed promptly

576
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,500
to allow

577
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,180
other parts of the plant to flourish.

578
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:25,810
I understand.

579
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:26,940
I will arrange it now.

580
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,000
[Court of Judicial Review]

581
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,260
Mr. Yuan.

582
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,050
I found this object
in a hidden compartment

583
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:44,500
in one of the walls.

584
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:46,370
It has a lock on it.

585
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:48,020
The evidence should be inside.

586
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:21,980
Look out.

587
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,220
Mr. Hai, you have been an official
for many years.

588
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,020
Don't you understand

589
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,330
that if you continue like this,

590
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,850
it will bring the wrath of Her Majesty?

591
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,940
It will not

592
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,500
be beneficial to you.

593
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,090
I was falsely accused.

594
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:48,370
About the Censor case,

595
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:49,810
I know nothing at all.

596
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:51,980
No matter how many times you ask,

597
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,740
my answer remains unchanged.

598
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,900
What is this then?

599
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,500
Mr. Guo.

600
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:10,260
Yu Qian once wrote a letter

601
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,460
to Hai Yiping

602
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,370
in prison,

603
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:13,900
which is hidden

604
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:15,530
in this iron box

605
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:16,420
found in Hai Mansion.

606
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,220
Scribe,

607
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:20,330
please read the testimony

608
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:21,980
you just recorded.

609
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:22,460
Yes, sir.

610
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,130
Hai Yiping argued,

611
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:27,220
"About the Censor case,
I know nothing at all."

612
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:28,900
Know nothing at all?

613
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,500
So why did you secretly hide

614
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:31,980
that letter from Yu Qian?

615
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,220
That day, you said

616
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:35,500
the file was taken by you

617
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:37,810
and accidentally burned at your place.

618
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:38,770
Now it seems

619
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,220
that you intentionally

620
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,420
destroyed the evidence.

621
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,290
Record it.

622
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,130
Ye Ping'an, your trickery

623
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:49,020
can deceive others,

624
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:50,220
but it cannot deceive me.

625
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,090
Since you said this iron box

626
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,610
contains Yu Qian's handwritten letter,

627
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:55,330
why don't you

628
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,500
open it?

629
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:00,370
Ye Ping'an,

630
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,530
bring out the evidence.

631
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,130
Dear Hai,

632
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:22,980
you and I both know

633
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,340
that the crime
was committed by Du Liang.

634
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,380
But he hid the money

635
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,460
in my old house.

636
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,900
He even burned it down,

637
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:31,730
causing all the women to die inside.

638
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,940
My chance of leaving the prison

639
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,730
is now slim.

640
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:37,210
I seek justice in this world

641
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,020
and have never regretted my insistence

642
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,250
on investigating this case.

643
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,690
I don't need to read

644
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,650
the rest of the letter, do I?

645
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,050
This iron box has

646
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,650
a mechanism where it burns upon opening.

647
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,050
But you never know how fate works.

648
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,420
When I opened it,

649
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:57,130
I happened to have a bowl of water
beside me.

650
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:02,250
Look out.

651
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,210
On the condition

652
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,610
of handing over this letter,

653
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,420
you forced Lu Danxin
to invite me to the gate tower.

654
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,170
You tried so hard to get rid of me.

655
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,250
The facts are beyond clear.

656
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:23,730
Do you now dare to say

657
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,340
that you know nothing
about the Censor case?

658
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,130
Mr. Guo.

659
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,130
Since it has come to this point,

660
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:32,690
let me be honest.

661
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,610
Record it.

662
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,050
Back then,

663
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,860
as a close friend of Yu Qian,

664
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,210
I did know
that there were hidden secrets

665
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:39,980
about the Censor case.

666
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,090
But at that time,

667
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,090
Li Zongxu was also involved.

668
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,530
And I had

669
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,820
no alliances or friends.

670
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,420
That's why

671
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,820
I waited this long

672
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,380
to bring Lu Danxin to overturn the case.

673
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:53,300
When she came

674
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,650
to the Court of Judicial Review,

675
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,380
why didn't you hand over the letter

676
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:57,500
from Yu Qian?

677
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,050
Because at that time,

678
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:03,860
I didn't have full confidence

679
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,650
in overturning the case,

680
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,940
I wanted to wait.

681
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:07,650
For what?

682
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,250
After Lu Danxin's death,

683
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,050
even Her Majesty

684
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:12,210
issued an order to thoroughly
investigate the Censor case.

685
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,130
Why did you remain silent?

686
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,610
And why did you set up mechanisms

687
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:18,730
on the evidence?

688
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,420
You tried to destroy it.

689
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:23,170
No.

690
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,210
The mechanism on this box

691
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,980
is designed

692
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,530
to prevent anyone

693
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,530
but me

694
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:32,210
from opening it.

695
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,250
As for remaining silent,

696
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:35,820
it's because...

697
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,940
It's because you didn't expect

698
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,020
Lu Danxin to publicly

699
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,170
expose your crimes,

700
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,730
and Li Zongxu even accused you

701
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,250
of framing Yu Qian before he died.

702
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,050
You knew that no matter
how much you argued,

703
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:45,130
it was in vain.

704
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,530
So you remained silent

705
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,780
to buy time.

706
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,460
Ye Ping'an,

707
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:53,820
whatever you say,

708
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:55,210
it's just a guess.

709
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,050
Mr. Guo,

710
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,420
does the Court of Judicial Review

711
00:36:58,570 --> 00:36:59,300
judge cases based on evidence

712
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:00,980
or

713
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,860
speculation?

714
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,690
Am I to be subjected

715
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,900
to the same injustices as Yu Qian?

716
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,340
Mr. Guo.

717
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:16,570
I have

718
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:17,820
another important physical evidence.

719
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,130
Present it.

720
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,130
Things are about to be getting exposed.

721
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:30,980
Kill the women in the abandoned house.

722
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,130
Isn't it strange

723
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:34,500
that the letter

724
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:36,130
written by Yu Qian

725
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,340
was supposed to be destroyed
after being stored for three years,

726
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,300
yet it is still here?

727
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:42,570
This letter

728
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,250
was important physical evidence

729
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,500
of the Censor case back then.

730
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,420
Did it...

731
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,500
Yes.

732
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,650
Before Sun Xizheng resigned,

733
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,130
he served as a clerical scribe
in the Ministry of Justice.

734
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,050
He had read this letter,

735
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,250
but he had many doubts in his heart,

736
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:02,170
so he secretly kept it

737
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,500
before the evidence was destroyed.

738
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,420
Mr. Sun,

739
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,420
did you notice

740
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,940
any issues with the handwriting

741
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:12,130
on the letter written

742
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:13,500
by Yu Qian?

743
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,500
No.

744
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:17,940
I have looked at it repeatedly.

745
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,380
They were all written by Yu Qian.

746
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:22,020
Yu Qian used to

747
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:22,980
love reading.

748
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,730
If he came across a book he liked,

749
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,210
he would buy two more,

750
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,340
and write his thoughts

751
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:29,210
on the title pages.

752
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,300
He'd give them to me and Hai Yiping,

753
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,460
hoping that the two of us

754
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,130
could appreciate them.

755
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35,860
Are the books

756
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:36,940
the same?

757
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,300
Yes.

758
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:39,940
Mr. Sun.

759
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,380
Can you help me take a look

760
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,690
at these Yu Qian's books

761
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,170
found in Hai Yiping's mansion?

762
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,250
Are there any missing books

763
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,250
compared to yours?

764
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:47,730
Okay.

765
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,610
Hai Yiping had Yuling Scripture

766
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:54,420
and Baisheng Chapter missing.

767
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,500
What does this
have to do with the letter?

768
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,130
Mr. Sun and I read this

769
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,050
for a long time,

770
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,250
but we didn't find

771
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,020
any problem with the handwriting on it,

772
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,900
until I remembered a case

773
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,210
that happened
during the years of Shengxi.

774
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,020
During the years of Shengxi,

775
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,380
Governor Pu Guang
was accused of rebellion,

776
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:12,500
with a letter

777
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:13,610
as evidence.

778
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:15,730
However, during interrogation,

779
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,690
Pu Guang didn't admit to the accusation.

780
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,940
So a verdict was not reached
for several days.

781
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,300
This type of yellow paper

782
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,250
is rough and thick.

783
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:26,780
Cutting out someone else's writing

784
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,460
and pasting it onto this paper

785
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,980
can make it look seamless.

786
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,090
Despite

787
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,420
multiple interrogations,

788
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,500
no one found

789
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:36,650
the rebellion letter

790
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,900
to be forged.

791
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,690
It was not until one day

792
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,860
that the presiding judge of this case

793
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:43,210
suddenly discovered

794
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,090
that the normal paper on the table,

795
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,570
when facing the sunlight,

796
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,300
would show visible adhesive marks.

797
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:26,720
[It's about to come out.]

798
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:34,400
[Take care of the women
in the abandoned house.]

799
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,210
You forged the letter

800
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,340
in this way

801
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,420
more than ten years

802
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,050
before the Pu Guang case.

803
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,420
This letter became
the most important physical evidence

804
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,340
for the three judicial departments

805
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,460
to convict Yu Qian.

806
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,250
Even the smartest

807
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,900
make mistakes.

808
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:51,610
At this point,

809
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,500
what more excuses can you find?

810
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,940
How dare you

811
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,500
compare yourself to Yu Qian?

812
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,500
You're way less of a man.

813
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,050
Hai Yiping,

814
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:05,090
did you live up
to your oath of serving the people

815
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,940
when you started your career?

816
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,210
Did you live up
to the reputation of your ancestors?

817
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,020
You are a disgrace
to the people you murdered,

818
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:12,460
and a disgrace to your office.

819
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:19,050
Those...

820
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,130
Those two books

821
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,340
were stolen from my house

822
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,130
a long time ago.

823
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:27,020
The book thief

824
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:28,730
forged the letter.

825
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:31,530
Your mother knows

826
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:32,980
what paintings and calligraphy pieces

827
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,460
Yu Qian has gifted to you,

828
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:37,020
and whether they have been stolen.

829
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:38,650
What?

830
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,650
Do you plan

831
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,050
to let your mother bear the shame

832
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,380
because of you

833
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,210
at such an old age?

834
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:47,980
No.

835
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:49,570
Don't.

836
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,420
Don't do this.

837
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:54,130
You mustn't.

838
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,530
No!

839
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:12,690
I'll confess.

840
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,860
I will.

841
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,500
I forged

842
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:18,500
this letter,

843
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,860
copying Yu Qian's

844
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,780
handwriting.

845
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,530
I had no choice.

846
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,780
I just made a wrong decision.

847
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:42,170
I only made

848
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:43,610
this one mistake.

849
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:45,730
Someone.

850
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,820
Have Hai Yiping sign his confession,

851
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:49,050
and take him back

852
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:49,820
to the prison.

853
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,420
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

854
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,460
Thank you for your help, Mr. Guo.

855
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,210
Ye Ping'an,

856
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:04,780
I'm not helping you.

857
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,300
I'm

858
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:09,780
serving

859
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,530
justice.

860
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:22,090
Look out.

861
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,340
So cunning.

862
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,090
There must be a solution.

863
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,250
There must be.

864
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,610
These are from Hai Mansion.

865
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,170
I saw Yu Qian's letter

866
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:55,860
from prison.

867
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,610
It was on white hemp paper,

868
00:43:58,570 --> 00:43:59,610
four chi long and eight chi wide.

869
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:01,130
How close could your copy

870
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:02,050
of Yu Qian's writing be?

871
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:03,610
Almost the same.

872
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:04,730
That's enough.

873
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:06,170
I won't get too close to him.

874
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:11,420
[Yu Qian]

875
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,610
Hai Yiping kept this letter

876
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,420
to make deals with Danxin.

877
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,210
But he never thought

878
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,530
to really take it out.

879
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,130
He didn't expect Danxin

880
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:31,570
to read it once

881
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:32,860
and remember everything.

882
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:34,500
The letter we copied

883
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,300
can only disturb his mind.

884
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,020
It's not enough

885
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:39,130
to make him confess.

886
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:41,650
By the way,

887
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:43,250
Sun Xizheng once served

888
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,460
as a clerical scribe
in the Ministry of Justice.

889
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:46,690
Clerical Scribe?

890
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,530
He is likely to have
seen the physical evidence

891
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:52,610
mentioned by Li Zongxu.

892
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:54,530
Ye Ping'an,

893
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,650
rest assured.

894
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:56,690
Today,

895
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,900
we got Hai Yiping's confession of guilt.

896
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,250
Tomorrow, in the court session
held by three judicial departments,

897
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,020
we'll give everyone

898
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:04,460
a clear and satisfying result.
