[Young Li Zongxu]

5
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,460
You're dead!

6
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,660
I'm beating you to death!

7
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:21,820
To death!

8
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,060
The carp

9
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,860
has many bones,
making it difficult to eat.

10
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:45,940
Yeah,

11
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,540
it is a bit of a challenge.

12
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:48,780
But

13
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,100
it tastes delicious.

14
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,580
Mr. Hai, if you want,

15
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,580
I can help you remove the bones.

16
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,540
What do you think?

17
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,500
What's the condition?

18
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,060
If I manage to bring him down,

19
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,420
I want his marketing right

20
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,220
of selling official salt.

21
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,020
Official salt is beyond your reach.

22
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,660
Tell me your real condition.

23
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,220
I'd like to add "Co-Chancellor"

24
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,420
after the title

25
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,060
of Vice Minister
of the Court of Judicial Review.

26
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,660
It can't be

27
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,540
rushed.

28
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,940
If obstacles aren't

29
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,980
completely cleared,

30
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,820
things won't go smoothly.

31
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,540
If I remove Li Zongxu,

32
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,300
the major obstacle for the Mei alliance,

33
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,660
can you

34
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,900
agree to my terms?

35
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,220
If it doesn't work out,

36
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,460
it won't
drag the Mei alliance down either.

37
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,500
This isn't about the Mei alliance.

38
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,540
It's about the common people

39
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,940
who can't get salt.

40
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,340
Let me give you some advice.

41
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,500
Li Zongxu's position

42
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,460
is not ordinary.

43
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,300
You should find

44
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,900
a ready-to-use knife.

45
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,300
Who?

46
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,220
The scout reports

47
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:07,820
that Ye Ping'an

48
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,380
has entered Langyang Mansion.

49
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,260
She's a knife you can use.

50
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,420
But after using this knife,

51
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,420
you'll need to clean it up.

52
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,060
I understand.

53
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,020
Come on,

54
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,220
try the chef's cooking

55
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,460
in my manor.

56
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,700
The carp

57
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,940
is indeed tasty.

58
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,380
I lost everything.

59
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:52,900
All gone.

60
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,900
I'm broke overnight.

61
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,660
Try placing a bet.

62
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,780
For the next round,

63
00:06:59,180 --> 00:06:59,700
do you think he'll win

64
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:00,740
or lose?

65
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,260
Lose.

66
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,500
His luck is at its peak,

67
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,300
and he's won so many rounds.

68
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,700
Why bet on him losing?

69
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,660
This round,

70
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,700
I'll bet on small.

71
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,380
Because the bald guy is one of yours,

72
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,940
he should lose.

73
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,780
Small, small, small.

74
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:19,620
Small.

75
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,180
Well,

76
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,780
you're quite good at this.

77
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,260
You can even go

78
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,060
to Langyang Mansion for treatment.

79
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,540
Are you short of money?

80
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,380
Who wouldn't want more money?

81
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,380
Just looking at all that shiny silver

82
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,780
makes me feel good.

83
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,820
Be honest with me,

84
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,060
is he

85
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:40,820
your next target?

86
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,580
You're good at guessing, aren't you?

87
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,060
You can guess.

88
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:45,860
Let me be direct.

89
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,140
I've

90
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,820
set my sights on him too.

91
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,460
How about

92
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,100
we cooperate again?

93
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,660
I've already infiltrated
the enemy's lair.

94
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,020
Where are you?

95
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,140
Why should I cooperate with you?

96
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,820
You know the answer.

97
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,140
Anyone trying to get close

98
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,100
to Li Zongxu

99
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,100
will be watched by countless eyes

100
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:11,780
in the dark.

101
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:12,740
Besides,

102
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,100
I'm in the court, while you are not.

103
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,140
Dealing with Li Zongxu

104
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,660
isn't as simple as you think.

105
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,860
He's just a merchant.

106
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,380
How awesome can he be?

107
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,060
I don't believe it.

108
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:26,900
Listen,

109
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,300
Li Zongxu

110
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,420
was born in...

111
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,220
You're trying to get news from me?

112
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,780
I never underestimate my opponents.

113
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,500
If I hadn't found out

114
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,180
how cunning and hard to deal with he is,

115
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,060
I wouldn't have come
to your gambling house

116
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,580
upon getting news from you.

117
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,580
But rather than

118
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,100
calling it cooperation,

119
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,740
let's be honest.

120
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,700
It's mutual exploitation.

121
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,380
Having value to be used

122
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,140
is pretty good,

123
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,380
isn't it?

124
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,940
Being useful to me

125
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,220
makes you feel lucky, right?

126
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,860
You just won your bet.

127
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,180
Let's go.

128
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,660
Collect your winnings.

129
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,820
This bag of official salt

130
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,140
is your winnings.

131
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,340
It's of better quality than
the one from Yanqing Lane.

132
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,300
This is worth quite a bit of money.

133
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,700
What about this bag?

134
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,340
This one is poisoned salt.

135
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,820
A porter from the South Market

136
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,900
couldn't afford official salt,

137
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,460
so he bought such poisoned salt

138
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,940
from the black market.

139
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:44,860
After eating it for a while,

140
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:45,740
he died from poisoning.

141
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,860
If official salt weren't so expensive,

142
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:49,860
he wouldn't have been forced

143
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,220
to buy poisoned salt.

144
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,420
A while ago,

145
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,700
I saw an old woman

146
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,980
scraping nitrate in the outhouse.

147
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,380
It's easy to get sick

148
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,860
if one eats such stuff.

149
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,100
Some people say

150
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,580
Li Zongxu

151
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,340
is a great philanthropist,

152
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,780
but others say

153
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,940
he's a cold-hearted salt merchant.

154
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,260
What do you think?

155
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,540
Maybe

156
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,980
to those

157
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,380
who get food from him,

158
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,660
he's a good man.

159
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,380
But to me,

160
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,100
he deserves to die.

161
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,260
I see.

162
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,140
He's involved in the censor case.

163
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,700
Since our goals align,

164
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,340
I'll stop beating around the bush.

165
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,460
Do you know why the salt prices
in the capital

166
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,980
have risen year after year?

167
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,060
I've looked into it.

168
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,740
Li Zongxu has been hoarding salt

169
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,660
for a long time.

170
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,060
The resale of official salt

171
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,620
is under the supervision
of the Ministry of Revenue.

172
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,060
I suspect Du Liang and Li Zongxu

173
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,820
are colluding.

174
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,140
Besides,

175
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,980
last year,
when Yangzhou's levee suddenly broke,

176
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,460
flooding many salt fields,

177
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,780
Li Zongxu took advantage

178
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,380
of the rising salt prices

179
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,220
and made a fortune.

180
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,900
From what I've found,

181
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,660
the levee collapse

182
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,140
was not a natural disaster.

183
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,060
It was man-made.

184
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,860
You mean

185
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,740
Yangzhou's levee breach

186
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,820
is also linked to Li Zongxu?

187
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,620
Li Zongxu's grain donations

188
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,780
did save some people,

189
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,020
but the grain he used to save people

190
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,780
was originally from the people.

191
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,260
Li Zongxu

192
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,740
is far more vicious

193
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,740
than Du Liang.

194
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:27,700
It's beautiful.

195
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:29,780
Is it for Cailian?

196
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,540
Give it to me.

197
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,300
Be careful.

198
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,180
What are you doing here?

199
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,660
Who is Shaocheng meeting again?

200
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:37,820
Miss Ye.

201
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,580
Mr. Yuan asked you

202
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,780
to investigate Xin Jun's background.

203
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,740
He's clean, right?

204
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,060
What problems could he possibly have?

205
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,780
Shaocheng is just cautious.

206
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:52,900
Don't worry.

207
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,340
I'm wondering

208
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,420
what kind of relationship

209
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,820
Mr. Yuan and Miss Ye have.

210
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,980
Friendship?

211
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,220
Sure,

212
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,140
but it's more than that.

213
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,180
More than just friendship?

214
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,900
But their interactions

215
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,060
are nothing like mine and Cailian's.

216
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,180
So, what exactly

217
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,540
is their relationship?

218
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,420
Do you really want to know?

219
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,900
Their bond

220
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,660
is like this.

221
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,140
You don't act like a big brother at all.

222
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,220
You suddenly started
investigating Li Zongxu.

223
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,020
Is it because the Mei alliance
wants to deal with him,

224
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,340
or is there

225
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,460
someone else behind this?

226
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,740
He wants to take the land

227
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,340
by Mang Gutter

228
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,660
to open a cloth workshop.

229
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,980
He also wants to drive out the people

230
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,020
who have lived there

231
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:52,700
for generations.

232
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,580
Opening a cloth workshop

233
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,660
by Mang Gutter?

234
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,540
It isn't his ultimate goal.

235
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,180
That's exactly what I want to uncover.

236
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,900
Also, he controls
the salt prices in the capital.

237
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,100
The Court of Judicial Review
is responsible

238
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:02,700
for investigating him.

239
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,300
The bitterness has faded,

240
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,740
and the color is starting to turn pale.

241
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:11,700
I think

242
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,820
the method is simple,

243
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:13,900
but

244
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,780
if we share it with people,

245
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,500
it can help reduce the harm

246
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,460
of the common people

247
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,180
consuming poisoned salt.

248
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,300
Right now,

249
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,500
the powerful ones are in control,

250
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,900
and the minor ones are causing trouble.

251
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,540
From officials to merchants,

252
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,900
from powerful ministers to petty clerks,

253
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,060
these pests

254
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,380
monopolize the system

255
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,740
and suck the life out of the people.

256
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,500
With this,

257
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,700
the number of people
with mental health issues

258
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,980
will only keep growing.

259
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,660
People need healing,

260
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,700
but we can't just treat people.

261
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,340
This deep-rooted illness
is hard to cure.

262
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,860
The current Vice Minister
of the Department of State Affairs

263
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,460
is his uncle,

264
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,100
and Princess Zhaoyang,
whom the Empress appointed,

265
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,300
is his cousin.

266
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,620
So dealing with him

267
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,700
requires two crazy people like us.

268
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,180
I just hope that

269
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,500
one day,

270
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,140
when you stand high,

271
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,900
you can still remember the suffering
of the common people.

272
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,540
If we don't reach the end of the road,

273
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,060
no one knows

274
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,380
what that end will look like.

275
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,140
You've told me so much

276
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,220
about Li Zongxu today,

277
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,900
so I'll give you a clue in return.

278
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,460
I saw a bamboo tube at Langyang Mansion

279
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,140
with an eagle's head carved on it.

280
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,180
Inside was a letter

281
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,740
written in Shuodan's words.

282
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,740
Why didn't you steal it?

283
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,220
I couldn't alert him.

284
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,940
His mansion

285
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,820
holds the dirtiest secrets.

286
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,620
Perhaps

287
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,180
we can take this chance

288
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,140
to expose all the crimes

289
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,020
he's committed.

290
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,400
[Apuna Haoji, Shuodan's envoy]

291
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,800
[Jiayue, Shuodan's princess]

292
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,260
She's so beautiful.

293
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,500
Hope there's no more war.

294
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,420
Yeah,

295
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,300
it's been hard

296
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,700
to finally live in peaceful times.

297
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:05,670
[Honglu Inn]

298
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,540
You must be tired after a long journey.

299
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,540
All your needs

300
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,740
have been prepared.

301
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,620
Please rest here for today.

302
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,100
[Consul of Honglu Inn]
You'll meet Her Majesty at Chen hour.

303
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,420
Thank you for the arrangement.

304
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:35,740
Prince of Chunyang knows

305
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,780
you're arriving today,

306
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,900
so he prepared some gifts

307
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,500
for Your Highness.

308
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,820
A pair of phoenix jade porcelain bowls,

309
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,940
a flower glass vase,

310
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,260
a jade mirror case with nine turtles,
and so on.

311
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,460
Please accept them, Your Highness.

312
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,740
Prince of Chunyang

313
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,100
is very thoughtful.

314
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,380
I heard Prince of Chunyang,
Wu Liangchen,

315
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,420
is a handsome man.

316
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,420
Your Highness.

317
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:01,820
Your Highness?

318
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,780
I've never seen

319
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,940
such beautiful pomegranate flowers
in Shuodan.

320
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,580
I've heard in Great Feng,

321
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,180
pomegranates are given
as tokens of love.

322
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,020
Haoji,

323
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,100
where is General Wu staying?

324
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,780
I'd like to pick a pomegranate flower
for him.

325
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,740
Your Highness,

326
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,100
why the rush?

327
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:16,820
Why not

328
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:17,980
burn incense, bathe,

329
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:18,940
and turn in early?

330
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,380
Tomorrow morning,

331
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,820
you'll see your lover in the palace.

332
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,380
You're right.

333
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,020
I'll give it to him tomorrow.

334
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,600
[Xu Qing, Chief Secretary
of the Ministry of Revenue]

335
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:43,940
General Wu,

336
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,420
since you've agreed
to meet me here for a drink,

337
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,780
feel free

338
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,140
to speak your mind.

339
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,420
Sure.

340
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,500
You haven't forgotten,
back in the second year of Shengxi,

341
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,660
when you were the Granary Magistrate
of Jiahuai Granary in Bianzhou,

342
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,900
you refused to transfer salt and grain

343
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,740
to relieve the disaster
in Jinyuan, right?

344
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,140
General Wu, let me tell you the truth.

345
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,340
At that time,
there was a severe drought.

346
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,380
Salt and grain were being diverted
for disaster relief.

347
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,580
I refused the transfer
because we didn't have enough stock.

348
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,540
It was a hard time not only
for Jiahuai Granary.

349
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,580
Since it was hard,

350
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,900
how do you explain that

351
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,820
half a month before the transfer order,

352
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,180
you secretly took a thousand dan of salt

353
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,020
without reporting it
to the Ministry of Revenue?

354
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,070
[Jiahuai Granary, sealed]

355
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,420
General Wu,

356
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,020
you have no right
to inspect the granary records.

357
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,580
Illegally taking the records
is a serious crime.

358
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:52,940
Chief Secretary Xu,

359
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,220
read it yourself.

360
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,660
You asked

361
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,380
to hear it.

362
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:13,820
Alright.

363
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,380
On the third day of the 12th month,
the Second Year of Shengxi,

364
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,620
transfer 350 dan of salt

365
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,940
as a gift to Prince of Wei, Li Xian,

366
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,860
for his achievements
in pacifying the rebellion

367
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,860
This is not reported
to the Ministry of Revenue.

368
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,980
On the 26th day of the 12th month,

369
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,260
transfer 500 dan of salt

370
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,660

371

with the proceeds going
to the national treasury.

372
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,180
This is not reported
to the Ministry of Revenue.

373

There were 150 dan...

It's all clearly written above

377

and approved by the higher authorities.

378
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,780
I understand.

379
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,740
In the previous dynasty,
you tied these dirty accounts

380
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,140
to the palace,

381
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,380
making it impossible

382
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,800
for anyone to investigate.

383
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:57,940
This isn't something you,

384
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,540
a mere chief secretary, could've dared

385
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,660
to think or do.

386
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,220
General Wu, would you consider

387
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,220
the difficulties I faced?

388
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,580
It wasn't that I didn't want
to transfer the salt.

389
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,740
There was no salt left to transfer
in the Jiahuai Granary.

390
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,180
If it's about requisitioning
military supplies,

391
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,420
many places had more salt

392
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,420
than Bianzhou had.

393
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,660
At that time, how much official salt

394
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,180
was Li Zongxu hoarding?

395
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,180
I don't know.

396
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,780
If you want to know,

397
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,620
perhaps you should ask him in person.

398
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,260
Master is already
waiting for you, Miss Ye.

399
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:39,900
Please.

400
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:48,860
General,

401
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:49,820
should we still go?

402
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,540
No.

403
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:52,700
Let's go.

404
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,540
Master,

405
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,660
Miss Ye has arrived.

406
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,060
Your Highness.

407
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:07,740
Miss Ye,

408
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,780
since your last visit,

409
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,060
I haven't seen

410
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,220
that creature again.

411
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,180
I've used divination to foresee

412
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,340
that tonight

413
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,940
is the best opportunity

414
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,020
to eliminate the evil.

415
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,740
I need to set up a formation
at the house.

416
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,460
Tonight?

417
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,020
If we miss tonight,

418
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,300
we'll have to wait at least two months.

419
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,100
Your Highness,

420
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,980
you don't want any more delays, do you?

421
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,300
Alright.

422
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,020
Then we'll do as you say.

423
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,740
Sir,

424
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,220
I'll set up the formation here shortly.

425
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,780
Before dawn,

426
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,500
no one is allowed near this place.

427
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:00,740
Otherwise,

428
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,660
the formation will be disrupted.

429
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:03,820
Understood.

430
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,180
I'll go give orders

431
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,060
to the servants.

432
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:21,150
[Langyang Mansion]

433
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,780
You've never

434
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,660
replied to my letters.

435
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,900
Now, you ask me to come.

436
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,100
Isn't it a bit insincere?

437
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,740
You still know less about the capital.

438
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,500
There are eyes everywhere here.

439
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,300
If the letter falls
into the wrong hands,

440
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,340
it'll be solid evidence.

441
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,460
Face-to-face

442
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,260
is the safest way to talk.

443
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,500
So, are you willing to cooperate with us

444
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,660
and sell salt to us

445
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,580
at 30% below market price?

446
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,220
The salt is negotiable,

447
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,300
but about the prince consort...

448
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,100
Feel free to name your price.

449
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,420
You want us to choose

450
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,220
someone from the Li family
as the prince consort?

451
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,580
Quite the opposite.

452
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,180
In Her Majesty's mind,

453
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,820
our Li family's ties to the court

454
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,780
are dangerous.

455
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,580
If someone from the Li family
becomes the prince consort,

456
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,260
and war breaks out again,

457
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,020
can you control her?

458
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,780
Turns out only your people

459
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,900
can guess what your empress is thinking.

460
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,660
I want to recommend someone.

461
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,500
Wu Ankang.

462
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,180
If Wu Ankang becomes the prince consort,

463
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,260
not only can you

464
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,780
take away a skilled general,

465
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,500
but you can also use him as a hostage.

466
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:33,820
Her Majesty

467
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,700
will have to think twice
before taking action.

468
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,300
You don't have

469
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,660
to worry about this.

470
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,100
Our princess

471
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,700
already likes General Wu.

472
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,780
Great.

473
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,260
It seems we are

474
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,500
natural friends.

475
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,100
Since

476
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,980
we're friends,

477
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,820
let me remind you.

478
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,260
The capital is full of danger.

479
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,980
Never underestimate it.

480
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,580
Danger?

481
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,540
We're here for a marriage alliance.

482
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:10,900
Is there anyone

483
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,020
who dares

484
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,540
to move against us?

485
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,660
Now,

486
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,260
many officials

487
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,220
get their positions

488
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,340
through their military achievements.

489
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,100
They watched

490
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,580
their brothers

491
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,780
die on the battlefield,

492
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,420
and held grudges.

493
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:28,260
They might not be so eager
to turn hostility into friendship.

494
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,580
So, keep your guard up.

495
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:48,700
Master.

496
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,540
Find a few death warriors,

497
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,940
disguise them as Mang Gutter people,

498
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,220
and get a skilled archer.

499
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,740
During the banquet for the envoys,

500
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,740
take action.

501
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,980
If something happens to the envoy,

502
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,060
Master, your business with them...

503
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,180
As long as that arrow is shot,

504
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,580
we can accuse the Mang Gutter people

505
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,500
of trying to assassinate the envoy.

506
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,780
If Mang Gutter gets involved,

507
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,780
it'll point straight to Yuan Shaocheng.

508
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,420
But Yuan Shaocheng...

509
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:35,980
Master,

510
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,060
there's nothing unusual.

511
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,060
Let's go.

512
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,780
Check on Miss Ye.

513
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,460
Master,

514
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,020
as you ordered,

515
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,020
I've been watching all night.

516
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,540
Miss Ye has been performing rituals

517
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,460
and hasn't left.

518
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,740
Keep a close watch.

519
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,380
Yes.

520
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,660
I've learned from Honglu Inn

521
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,500
that Shuodan's envoy Haoji

522
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,540
is planning to visit
Langyang Mansion tonight.

523
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,780
Find a few death warriors,

524
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,260
disguise them as Mang Gutter people,

525
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,420
and get a skilled archer.

526
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,940
During the banquet for the envoys,

527
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:43,980
take action.

528
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,500
Shuodan envoy

529
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,820
Apuna Haoji

530
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,060
presents Your Majesty
with a precious gift,

531
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,020
the Dustless Pearl,

532
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,380
along with 2,000 fine horses,

533
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,620
5,000 cattle and sheep,

534
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,540
in hopes of welcoming
the Great Feng's prince consort

535
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,820
and establishing a marriage alliance

536
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,900
to secure a century of peace

537
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,380
and no more wars.

538
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,660
Shuodan wishes to form a bond,

539
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,580
and our court will respond
with great courtesy.

540
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,980
The Ministry of Rites is ordered

541
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,020
to prepare the envoy's banquet
in three days,

542
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,260
to forge an everlasting peace.

543
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,380
Your Majesty,

544
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,900
I, Prince of Langyang, Li Zongxu

545
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,180
am volunteering to organize the banquet.

546
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,660
As a close relative,

547
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,900
his son, Qianzhao,

548
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,780
is also a candidate
for the prince consort.

549
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,940
This is

550
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,940
a good intention.

551
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,140
The Prince of Langyang

552
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,460
is willing to prepare
for the banquet in person.

553
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,500
He will certainly not disappoint me.

554
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:47,740
Permission granted.

555
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,780
Thank you, Your Majesty.

556
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,820
Further request, Your Majesty.

557
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,260
Please approve

558
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,660
General Wu Ankang as the prince consort,

559
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,860
and send him to Shuodan
for the marriage alliance.

560
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,140
Wu Ankang is a general of Great Feng.

561
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,940
He has been stationed
on the borders for years.

562
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,900
How can he become a prince consort?

563
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,500
Since Great Feng

564
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,780
is sincerely seeking peace with Shuodan,

565
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:16,900
why does it need

566
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,220
to keep a general guarding the border?

567
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,220
You must be joking.

568
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,140
A general guarding the border
is a military strategy.

569
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,580
It's irrelated to the marriage alliance.

570
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:26,500
May I ask,

571
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,140
once the alliance is formed,

572
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,300
can Shuodan's generals

573
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,100
withdraw their forces

574
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,900
to the north of Mang Mountain?

575
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,100
They cannot, right?

576
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:35,900
Exactly.

577
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,420
Exactly, how could that be?

578
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,180
I've heard that Great Feng
is full of talents.

579
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,980
Even in military strategy,

580
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,580
are you truly

581
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,140
without any other capable generals?

582
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,140
That's not right.

583
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,180
Great Feng has many

584
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,500
scholarly and martial talents.

585
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,460
Princess Jiayue

586
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,660
has not yet met them,

587
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,900
yet you've already
appointed the prince consort.

588
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,020
Is

589
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,620
Shuodan

590
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,460
intending to follow the ways
of the unruly barbarians

591
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,220
who disregard rituals?

592
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,340
You...

593
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:11,980
Your Majesty,

594
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,820
this is my heartfelt wish.

595
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,420
I begged my father for a long time

596
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,420
before he allowed me to come.

597
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,820
I...

598
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,500
I just wanted to see you.

599
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,260
Princess Jiayue
is so genuine and expressive.

600
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,900
May I ask

601
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,540
when you first met General Wu?

602
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,580
When I was fourteen,

603
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,620
I secretly trained horses on the prairie

604
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,780
without letting my father know.

605
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,700
I fell into a pit and was terrified.

606
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,060
Until later...

607
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,100
I learned

608
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,540
he was a general of Great Feng.

609
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,100
I saw General Wu was so majestic

610
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,180
on horseback.

611
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,420
Even the snow atop the Tian Shan

612
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,780
was outshone by him.

613
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:12,740
Your Majesty,

614
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:13,940
I don't want anyone else

615
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,820
but only him.

616
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,380
With such a story,

617
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,820
and your deep feelings,

618
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,580
how could I not fulfill your wish?

619
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,020
But the rites must not be neglected.

620
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,780
Great Feng's royal family
has many great men.

621
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,660
I remember Prince of Chunyang,

622
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,180
Wu Liangchen,

623
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,420
is a man of both virtue and talent,

624
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,780
and is handsome in appearance.

625
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,020
Why don't you meet him?

626
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,500
At the banquet,

627
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,020
we'll let all the consort candidates

628
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,420
selected by the royal families
show up together.

629
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,340
Prince Kangping,

630
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,540
what do you think?

631
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,620
Prince of Langyang

632
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,580
takes the nation first.

633
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,460
My son

634
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,420
should follow

635
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,740
and do his best

636
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,220
for Your Majesty and Great Feng.

637
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:11,900
Shaocheng,

638
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,180
that

639
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,780
Shuodan official in the capital,
Imperial Attendant,

640
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,420
what was his name again?

641
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,060
Imperial Attendant, Shi Bina.

642
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:19,420
Right.

643
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,580
So, as you said,

644
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,020
I brought Shi Bina
to the gambling house,

645
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,260
made him lose a large sum of money,

646
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,300
and helped him pay it off.

647
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,620
He was so grateful

648
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,740
and even befriended me.

649
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,260
I took the chance

650
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,260
and had him

651
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,180
introduce you to Haoji.

652
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,060
He's already done it.

653
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,020
But,

654
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,780
I did some digging into Haoji.

655
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:34,940
He's been to the battlefield.

656
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:35,900
Dealing with him...

657
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,380
Don't worry.

658
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,300
He just wants to buy salt
at a low price.

659
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,220
I plan to use what he wants

660
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,980
to deal with Li Zongxu.

661
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,180
You know that's not
what I'm worried about.

662
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,140
Since you came back
from the battlefield,

663
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,420
you've never dealt with Shuodan people.

664
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,260
What concerns me is...

665
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:47,780
Well,

666
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:48,980
that was years ago.

667
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,060
Just rest assured.

668
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,060
You're the one the Great Feng warrior

669
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,900
Shi Bina introduced to me?

670
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,300
I think

671
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,940
after staying in the capital
for a few years,

672
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,340
he has lost his judgment.

673
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,060
What do you mean by that?

674
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,020
You've been to the battlefield.

675
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:34,860
What sharp eyes.

676
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,260
I have been

677
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,500
there too.

678
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,540
Those who went on the battlefield
and killed people

679
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,780
smell differently.

680
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,140
You've got Shuodan people's blood
on your hands,

681
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,980
and you've risen in rank because of it,

682
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,020
haven't you?

683
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,260
There's a saying in the Central Plains.

684
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,620
"Yesterday's matters

685
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,340
are all in the past.

686
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,660
Today's matters

687
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,900
are starting anew."

688
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,140
I've already left everything
from yesterday

689
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,500
on the battlefield.

690
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:08,860
Today, I'm here

691
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,380
to make a friend

692
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:11,940
and discuss business with you.

693
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,460
I won't do business with you.

694
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,700
I have my own mission here.

695
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,740
I don't want to stir up trouble

696
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,940
in your territory.

697
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,380
I know you...

698
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,540
I'll be blunt.

699
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,860
I don't like people like you.

700
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,380
Leave this room.

701
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:50,820
Leave now.

702
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:11,540
Hurry.

703
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,340
Follow them.

704
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,260
Shaocheng!

705
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,780
Hesheng!

706
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,820
I was thinking of

707
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,620
getting close to Haoji

708
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:14,860
and finding a way

709
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,660
to take down Li Zongxu through him.

710
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,820
But that man's too cautious.

711
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,700
He holds a grudge against me.

712
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,620
Just seeing him

713
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,820
reminds me of the bloodshed
on the battlefield.

714
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,500
I can't stop myself from fighting him.

715
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:27,740
Come on.

716
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:28,900
Let me help you calm down.

717
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,340
It's fine.

718
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,660
I'll be okay after a rest.

719
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,220
It's not that simple.

720
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,540
Haven't you realized?

721
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,460
Ever since you came back
from the battlefield,

722
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,940
you've been suffering
from mental problems.

723
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,060
Believe me.

724
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,180
I can ease your pain.

725
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,420
What have you learned

726
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,500
from Langyang Mansion?

727
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,900
Two things.

728
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,420
Let me guess.

729
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,260
The Li family

730
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,660
suggested Ankang marry the princess.

731
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,060
That way,

732
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,020
the Wu family will lose a general,

733
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,460
right?

734
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,140
Ankang...

735
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,220
Sounds like you're close.

736
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,900
But that day at Wanguoxiang Tavern,

737
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,220
he wasn't friendly

738
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,820
toward you.

739
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,500
Five years ago,

740
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,700
at the Battle of Jinyuan,

741
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,860
we fought side by side.

742
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,420
But it's been too long,

743
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,860
so he probably thinks I've changed.

744
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,660
What's the other thing?

745
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,660
Li Zongxu

746
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,100
plans to assassinate the envoy
at the banquet

747
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:01,980
and frame you for it.

748
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,140
Well, well.

749
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,180
He uses the accusation of destroying
the peace between the two nations

750
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,740
to eliminate me.

751
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,660
That way,

752
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,860
he gets the land deeds of Mang Gutter

753
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,980
and can frame the Wu family.

754
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,220
With such huge problems,

755
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,500
I'm still willing to work with you.

756
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,460
You really should feel lucky.

757
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:32,820
Li,

758
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,100
your dog's fur

759
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,460
is so shiny and smooth.

760
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,580
It must be a rare and expensive breed.

761
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,540
Just feeding it each day

762
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,140
requires 12 different dishes,

763
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,340
all unique, with no repeats.

764
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,900
Those efforts didn't go in vain.

765
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:43,980
Like the dish

766
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,660
it loves the most, Xiaoling Roast Meat,

767
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,820
I have my servants

768
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,260
make it in various ways for it.

769
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,820
To prepare Xiaoling Roast Meat,

770
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,060
you must use a magpie tongue

771
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,420
and lamb heart

772
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,460
to cook together.

773
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,140
Li,

774
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,740
your family's wealth is impressive.

775
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:57,620
Yeah,

776
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:58,700
buddy,

777
00:37:59,060 --> 00:37:59,860
your dog has been trained

778
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,700
in the Imperial Beast Training Hall
for a long time.

779
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,620
And in our realm,

780
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,980
grand feasts always feature
animal performances.

781
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,020
Elephant and horse shows
are quite spectacular.

782
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,180
If you could

783
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,900
showcase your dog's tricks

784
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,180
at the upcoming banquet,

785
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,860
it would definitely steal the spotlight.

786
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:13,620
That's true.

787
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,220
But my dog

788
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,740
hardly listens to my orders.

789
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,460
When I ask it to stay quiet, it barks.

790
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,740
When I tell it to go west, it goes east.

791
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:23,980
Let's not even talk about

792
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,340
doing any kind of animal performance.

793
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,660
Why is there a dog in the woods?

794
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,020
Come on.

795
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:42,940
Let's check on it.

796
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:43,820
Come on.

797
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:02,500
There.

798
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,460
Who are you?

799
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:18,620
I'm

800
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:19,980
a beast trainer.

801
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:22,900
A beast trainer?

802
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,140
Even if you have some skills

803
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,060
in beast training,

804
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:25,980
I bet you can't compare

805
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,500
to the trainers
in the Imperial Beast Training Hall.

806
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:28,820
I agree.

807
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,340
How dare you...?

808
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,540
The so-called
Imperial Beast Training Hall

809
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,540
only trains hawks, dogs,
and stupid beings.

810
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,580
But I

811
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,220
grew up in the mountains

812
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,340
and lived with wild animals.

813
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,860
Even snakes

814
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,260
listen to my orders.

815
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,140
Training hawks, dogs, and stupid beings?

816
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,340
Sounds more like an insult,

817
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,700
doesn't it?

818
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:54,420
Gentlemen,

819
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,980
why don't you head back for now?

820
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,420
We can meet another time.

821
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,540
- Farewell, Li.
- Farewell.

822
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,340
Go on.

823
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,100
Do you know who I am?

824
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,060
How would I know who you are?

825
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,820
Just introduce yourself.

826
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,100
My father is the Prince of Langyang,

827
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,420
the richest merchant in the capital.

828
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,860
Don't mistake me for some

829
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,180
ordinary, spoiled young man.

830
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,820
I'm not like them.

831
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,380
Is that

832
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,340
how rich people talk?

833
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,620
Can't you just speak plainly?

834
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,060
Fine.

835
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,380
I'll get straight to the point.

836
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,980
I've been thinking

837
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,100
about helping my father
manage the business,

838
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,420
but I don't know

839
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,700
how to win his favor.

840
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,140
That's been troubling me.

841
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,340
Winning someone's favor isn't hard.

842
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,820
Just find out what they like.

843
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,420
Send some gifts

844
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,140
like famous antiques, calligraphy

845
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,060
or some paintings,

846
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,180
especially the priceless masterpieces.

847
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,660
The receiver

848
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,660
can show them off,

849
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,060
and they'll be pleased.

850
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,380
You're getting to the point.

851
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,260
The banquet for the envoys
is coming soon.

852
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,060
You know about that, right?

853
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,500
Of course, I know.

854
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:01,980
I see you have some skills

855
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,860
in beast training.

856
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:03,660
I've decided

857
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,340
to give you a golden opportunity.

858
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,340
I'm one

859
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,860
of the candidates
for the prince consort.

860
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:08,980
I need your help.

861
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,420
You'll use animal performances

862
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,820
to present a famous painting,

863
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,380
the Grand Peace of the Ages,
to the envoys.

864
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,340
You're really eager

865
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,460
to become the prince's consort?

866
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,700
Honestly, I don't care

867
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,940
for that position.

868
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,540
I just want my father

869
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,740
to gain attention and respect

870
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,860
in front of everyone.

871
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:28,860
That way,

872
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,380
he'll be proud of me.

873
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,820
If that's the case,

874
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,420
an eagle or dog performance is too lame.

875
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,860
Why not give him a bigger surprise?

876
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,340
How about a performance
called "A Phoenix Bringing Auspice"?

877
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,540
Huh?

878
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,220
Where can we get a phoenix?

879
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,380
Have you heard of the white pheasant?

880
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,940
It's pure white,

881
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,700
with a tail just like a phoenix.

882
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:52,940
We'll

883
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,740
place the painting in a box,

884
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,180
and I'll have the white pheasant
carry the box

885
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,940
to present the gift to the envoys.

886
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,500
White pheasant?

887
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,540
That sounds perfect!

888
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:15,340
Perfect!

889
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,180
But even if I

890
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,380
get one now,

891
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,860
you won't have time to tame it.

892
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,060
You don't need to worry about that.

893
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,900
I've had a white pheasant
since I was young.

894
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,420
Since it's a surprise,

895
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,100
it must be

896
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,460
kept secret.

897
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,420
No one should know
about the animal performance,

898
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,740
not even your father.

899
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,340
I see.

900
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,460
If you tell anyone

901
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,660
about what happened today,

902
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:40,740
I'll cut out your tongues.

903
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,100
- We won't.
- We won't.

904
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:44,100
Come with me.

905
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,740
I'll take you to where I

906
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,860
keep my white pheasant.

907
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:48,540
After you.

908
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,260
Catching a white pheasant must've taken

909
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,940
quite some effort, right?

910
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,100
No matter how much effort I put in,

911
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,340
I still can't tame it,

912
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:03,540
can I?
