[Kill My Sins]

00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,240
Love, romance,

3
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,320
wealth and fame

4
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,550
all vanish

5
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,390
like smoke.

6
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,110
All along,

7
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,110
power

8
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,430
is the only thing

9
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,710
that lasts.

00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,950
[Episode 29]
[What Goes Around Comes Around]

11
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,480
What's new out there,

12
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,200
Nichang?

13
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,080
Still no news from Yuan Shaocheng.

14
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,640
Wu Youjing, as we expected,

15
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,710
has managed to fix

16
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,430
the salt shop accounts.

17
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,480
But I wonder

18
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,640
why Wu Youjing

19
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,830
hasn't made a move.

20
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,710
Fortunately, they regarded He Maoshan

21
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,590
as the traitor

22
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,240
and did not suspect Yuan Shaocheng.

23
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,590
Unfortunately, this plan
went down the drain.

24
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,040
How to fight

25
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,150
those scums in the future

26
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,960
is what we need to plan now.

27
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,800
Li Jun made a fuss in the black market,

28
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,710
which alarmed the Empress.

29
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,240
Thus, Wu Youjing

30
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,710
dared not act rashly.

31
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,480
But does the Empress

32
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,550
really not know

33
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,670
about

34
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,520
his actions regarding the official salt?

35
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,200
Both medicines

36
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,760
have their own uses

37
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,150
and strengths.

38
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,960
If one medicine is used too much,

39
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,480
the patient

40
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,960
will not be cured.

41
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,200
As the saying goes,

42
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,670
a light symptom
requires immediate treatment,

43
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,830
while a severe illness should wait.

44
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,270
You might not

45
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,040
understand right now.

46
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,040
In the future,

47
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,590
you will know what I mean.

48
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,390
After a year,

49
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,080
now

50
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,870
I understand the Empress's intention.

51
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,830
Enough of the riddles.

52
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,270
Tell us about it.

53
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,390
After the Empress
ascended to the throne,

54
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,870
she encountered both internal

55
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,040
and external troubles.

56
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:07,920
She needed Wu Youjing

57
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,390
to restrain the Li Family

58
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,200
and her son Wu Ankang

59
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,270
to intimidate the enemy.

60
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,480
That's why

61
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,040
she did nothing about his doing

62
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,200
on the official salt.

63
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,470
But Wu Youjing didn't stop there.

64
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,030
He bribed officials,

65
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,640
coveted the Crown Prince's position,

66
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,320
and even switched official salt
with illegal salt,

67
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,790
which

68
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,790
crossed the line the Empress drew.

69
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,230
That means

70
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,680
by making such a fuss

71
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,880
we gave the Empress a reason

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,270
to punish him.

73
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,080
His greed grows day by day.

74
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,640
Wu Youjing even wants

75
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,760
to use his son's merits

76
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,680
to gain greater power.

77
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,440
What do you think

78
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,560
Her Majesty will do?

79
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,960
Of course, to get rid of him.

80
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,030
Anyway,

81
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,760
this is good news.

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,080
I am finally

83
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,200
relieved.

84
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,230
These days,

85
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,710
let's not make any more moves.

86
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,790
Whoever can remain calm

87
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,640
will win.

88
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,650
[Two Months Later]

89
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,760
Report!

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,680
Your Majesty,

91
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,200
a great victory on the northern border!

92
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,000
General Wu masterfully orchestrated
a deception,

93
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,560
making Shuodan believe
the city was undefended.

94
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,710
With surprise attacks,

95
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,910
he routed
Shuodan's massive army of 200,000.

96
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,200
The remaining enemy soldiers

97
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,710
were forced
to retreat north of the Mang Mountain.

98
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,270
The Khan of Shuodan
requested a ceasefire

99
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,230
and a new alliance agreement.

100
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,000
We...

101
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,680
We won!

102
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,760
We won!

103
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,150
Hear my decree:

104
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,710
Our armies shall be rewarded.

105
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,790
Wu Ankang receives
the title of Marquis Zhongyong

106
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,710
and a thousand-household town.

107
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,390
The army is to return without delay.

108
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,560
Under the protection
of Heaven's majesty,

109
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,520
we congratulate Your Majesty.

110
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:10,680
Xian'er,

111
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,590
how long have you

112
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,830
been serving me?

113
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,200
This year

114
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,680
is the 14th year.

115
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,440
It's been so long.

116
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:27,000
When I first met you, you were small,

117
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,230
but very clever

118
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,080
and talkative.

119
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:32,960
I loved

120
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,320
listening to you talk

121
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,230
about politics the most.

122
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,710
It was just

123
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,000
a child's silly talk.

124
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,390
Your Majesty,
you have been so forgiving,

125
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,440
never once blaming me,

126
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,910
and always guiding me.

127
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,390
To me,

128
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,640
you are not only a sovereign,

129
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,270
but also a good teacher.

130
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:14,640
Since

131
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,150
I ascended to the throne,

132
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,830
I have been consumed by work,

133
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,830
day and night.

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,230
Several years passed.

135
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,390
When I look back,

136
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,560
the people around me are all gone.

137
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,150
Whenever I felt nostalgic,

138
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,120
I would come to this room

139
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,350
to see the late ruler,

140
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,000
seeking solace.

141
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,150
You have read a lot of history books.

142
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,960
Tell me

143
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,760
your opinion

144
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,830
on the family.

145
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,150
Those who govern the families

146
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,080
often become

147
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,640
incompetent and lazy

148
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,000
after only three generations

149
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,710
of being virtuous and wealthy.

150
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,390
I need to govern both the country

151
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,640
and the family.

152
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,470
Managing a family

153
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,320
is not easier than governing a country.

154
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,470
Being a good ruler

155
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,710
may not

156
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,200
necessarily make good a parent.

157
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,270
My sons

158
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,520
are all afraid of me.

159
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,000
I can

160
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,520
only continue to make them afraid.

161
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,000
Sages stand

162
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,350
at the highest place,

163
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,080
taking the world
as their own responsibility,

164
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,760
and sacrificing the small for the big.

165
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,150
How can others understand

166
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,560
the difficulties you face?

167
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,080
I'm glad

168
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,230
you understand.

169
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,280
Your father, the Prince of Kangping,
is proud.

170
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,200
But pride alone is nothing.

171
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,590
But he doesn't

172
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,350
restrain himself.

173
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,230
He was like this with the Censor case.

174
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,470
And with the salt issue,
he was no different.

175
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,080
Your Majesty,

176
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,560
my father is just concerned

177
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,630
about extending

178
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,870
the reign of Great Feng.

179
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,160
Please forgive my father,

180
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,320
Your Majesty.

181
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,470
He is my nephew

182
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,160
and has

183
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,680
such good children as you and Ankang.

184
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,440
I won't punish him too harshly.

185
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,080
When Ankang returns,

186
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,080
I will

187
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,080
reward him again.

188
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,110
And I'll change the title,
the Prince of Kangping,

189
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,160
to the Crown Prince's Tutor

190
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,230
to save him

191
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,350
from the humiliation.

192
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,630
I appreciate

193
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:31,990
Your Majesty's forgiveness

194
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,350
on behalf of my father.

195
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,590
Save me from the humiliation?

196
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,160
The Crown Prince's Tutor
is just a title.

197
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,710
The Empress wants
to strip me of real power.

198
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,400
By then, I will be imprisoned

199
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,080
in the capital.

200
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,160
Maybe there is still a chance.

201
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,510
No chance.

202
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,280
The Empress has made up her mind

203
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,830
not to depose the Crown Prince.

204
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,680
I devoted myself wholeheartedly

205
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,320
to Great Feng.

206
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,750
I have

207
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,320
made great contributions to the Empress.

208
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,280
But in the end,

209
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,200
she will return the throne
to the Li family.

210
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,230
The Empress still cares about family.

211
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,750
She wants to protect you

212
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,440
and the Wu family.

213
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,870
The rulers

214
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,560
are the most ruthless.

215
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,280
The Empress has taken action against me.

216
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,350
How would she allow you and Kang

217
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,680
to continue to have great power?

218
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,680
One day,

219
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,990
when the Li family
succeeds to the throne,

220
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,510
our family

221
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,870
will collapse completely.

222
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,800
Her Majesty has made up her mind.

223
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,990
What else can we do?

224
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,440
Do you

225
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,280
dare to rebel?

226
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,230
Why not?

227
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,040
It's...

228
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,560
It's an improper way

229
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,440
to ascend to the throne.

230
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,280
I'm afraid it won't convince the world.

231
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,440
Those who steal small shall be punished.

232
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,160
Those who steal a country
shall be the ruler.

233
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,750
As long as there is a suitable reason,

234
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,080
it is not treason.

235
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,560
But the Empress has the Imperial Guards

236
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,110
and other court guards.

237
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,350
What's our chance like?

238
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,080
Your sets of armor

239
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,160
came from Xian Guangping,

240
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,080
General of the Left Yulin Royal Guard,

241
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,080
right?

242
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,560
You were spying on me?

243
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,590
Not spying.

244
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,160
Protecting.

245
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,200
I even know

246
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,590
that you secretly created Thunder Fire

247
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,630
that can instantly explode.

248
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,990
With Xian Guangping,

249
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,920
we can use the troops

250
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,440
of the Left Yulin Royal Guard.

251
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,110
Kang

252
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,710
is leading the troops back.

253
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,080
Just in time to work with us.

254
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,510
This is our only chance

255
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,440
of winning.

256
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,470
Once Kang is removed
from military power,

257
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,800
everything

258
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,470
will be meaningless.

259
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,080
What a pity for this gift

260
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,510
to the Empress.

261
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,280
Ping'an.

262
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,350
Great news.

263
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,200
The war with Shuodan
on the northern border...

264
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:21,960
We won.

265
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,080
You've heard of that?

266
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:26,750
Where's Mrs. Gu?

267
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,830
Master Suxuan is back
at the Kangping Mansion.

268
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,710
She went to monitor them.

269
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,230
We just won.

270
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,960
And you are so eager to take action.

271
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,440
Is it because you want
to see Yuan Shaocheng?

272
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,990
Of course, we should celebrate

273
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,440
such a big victory in the war.

274
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,160
I can

275
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,200
also inquire

276
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,280
about the court affairs

277
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,200
so that we can figure out

278
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:47,920
what to do next.

279
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,470
Okay.

280
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,200
I'll send a message for you

281
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,320
and ask him to meet you here.

282
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:52,800
I'm off.

283
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,680
Come back.

284
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,400
Although

285
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,960
Wu Youjing has fixed the account,

286
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,800
you still need to find a way

287
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,560
to give the evidence we have

288
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,630
to Li Jun.

289
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,350
Only by making him

290
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,280
pay more attention
to the Prince of Kangping,

291
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,160
can he give me a break.

292
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,350
Shaocheng.

293
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,680
We have just won the battle.

294
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,470
If you don't raise your glass

295
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,160
to celebrate with us,

296
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,350
who else will you toast with?

297
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,800
Who else could it be?

298
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,800
It's been over a month.

299
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,110
He hasn't walked

300
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,160
as fast as he did today.

301
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,140
I see you guys

302
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,160
are also doing nothing else.
I see you guys

303
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,350
are also doing nothing else.

304
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,560
Why don't you

305
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,440
come with me to Mang Gutter

306
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,280
and check the Chinese New Year's goods?

307
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,200
I need to go visit Mr. Chang

308
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,320
and feed Blackie.

309
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,040
I'll get going.

310
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,230
I need to wash my kid's diapers.

311
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:46,870
See you.

312
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,220
[Yuan Mansion]

313
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,610
Mr. Yuan,

314
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,730
in the battle on the northern border,

315
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,610
our army achieved a great victory.

316
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,650
General Wu was conferred the title
of Marquis Zhongyong.

317
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,530
The Prince of Kangping would like
to invite you

318
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,460
to his mansion
for a family banquet to celebrate.

319
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,130
Mr. Yuan,

320
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,820
are you up to something else?

321
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,530
No.

322
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,220
Upon learning that General Wu
has achieved a new victory,

323
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,010
I am preparing to go
to the Kangping Mansion

324
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,420
to congratulate the Prince of Kangping.

325
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:25,170
[Kangping Mansion]

326
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,220
Are these two new here?

327
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,770
The previous servants fell ill,

328
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,100
so we had someone to fill the vacancies.

329
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,250
Please.

330
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,490
Madam.

331
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,650
Didn't you go to the Taoist temple?

332
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,980
Why did you come back so early?

333
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,530
I'm feeling a bit tired.

334
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,770
So I came back
after finishing the prayer.

335
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,130
Since Madam is tired,

336
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,100
escort her to her room

337
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:02,940
to rest.

338
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,010
Yes, sir.

339
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:05,730
Madam,

340
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,980
during your praying today,

341
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,060
did you recite

342
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,610
the Sacred Edict of Lord Taiyi,
the Savior of Suffering?

343
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,580
Madam, please.

344
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,180
Mr. Yuan,

345
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,340
this way.

346
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,370
Sacred Edict?

347
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:39,980
The Savior of Suffering?

348
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,650
Your Highness,

349
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,490
I heard about the victory
General Wu had won.

350
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,010
I came

351
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,220
to congratulate Your Highness.

352
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,650
[Kangping Mansion]

353
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,100
It shouldn't be you
offering congratulations,

354
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,300
but rather,
it should be me congratulating you.

355
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,650
I'm afraid I'm at a loss.

356
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,340
Didn't you say

357
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,770
there was a traitor around me?

358
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,010
You were right.

359
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,420
I finally know

360
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,610
who the traitor is.

361
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,010
Who is he?

362
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,130
He Maoshan.

363
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,580
Why is it him?

364
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,730
He has always been loyal to you.

365
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,650
Yeah.

366
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,490
Why is it him?

367
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,420
Both Huang Qi and Huang Yimin

368
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,850
were brought by him.

369
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,700
After the Market Bureau's ledgers
were lost,

370
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,370
Li Jun went to the black market,

371
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,340
and he

372
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,660
was also there.

373
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,250
I had been generous to him.

374
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,810
So I gave him a last ride
on his final journey.

375
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,090
But upon careful thinking,

376
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,330
there should

377
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,490
be another brain behind him.

378
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:25,770
Your Highness,

379
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,770
it's not like what you think.

380
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,490
I have prepared
a glass of liquor for you.

381
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,180
Would you drink it yourself

382
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,620
or should I help you?

383
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,050
Mr. Yuan,

384
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,660
the liquor bestowed
by the Prince of Kangping.

385
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:53,940
Please.

386
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,980
After all this fuss,

387
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,420
there is no sign of Ye Ping'an

388
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,490
and no evidence
of the Prince of Kangping.

389
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,810
A bunch of useless losers.

390
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:05,570
Stop.

391
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,500
[Receipt]

392
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,600
[Wang Hongchun]

393
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,050
[Purchased 200 dan of official salt]

394
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,180
This is evidence

395
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,460
that the Prince of Kangping
used illegal salt as official salt

396
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,570
for profit.

397
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,050
[Kangping Mansion]

398
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,860
I can drink this liquor,

399
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,860
but I won't accept the accusation.

400
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,290
You won't?

401
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,730
If it weren't for your collusion
with Ye Ping'an

402
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,770
to set traps for me,

403
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,660
how could I

404
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,290
always be one step behind her?

405
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,460
I like people with ambition.

406
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,140
But it's crucial to set your sights
on the right goals,

407
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,700
or you could end up
regretting your choices.

408
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,460
The business

409
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,220
was discussed
between you and Huang Yimin

410
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:04,980
alone in person.

411
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,860
As for the ledger,

412
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,380
I know nothing about it.

413
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,460
Besides,

414
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,460
from the beginning,

415
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,090
I didn't agree

416
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,220
with dealing
with illegal salt smugglers.

417
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,180
On the contrary,
Xian'er was very proactive.

418
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,980
Can your own daughter

419
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,380
also be suspicious?

420
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:19,810
Your Highness,

421
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,010
making you suspicious of me

422
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,140
is precisely Ye Ping'an's plan.

423
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,770
I have no family

424
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,460
or support.

425
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,940
All I can rely on

426
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,380
is you.

427
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,900
Why should I destroy my own foundation?

428
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,620
But I'm already having my doubts.

429
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,010
What should I do?

430
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,250
You are useless anyway.

431
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,220
Maybe just go join He Maoshan.

432
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,810
I am not useless.

433
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,660
I have found

434
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,940
the whereabouts of Ye Ping'an.

435
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,940
Give me a chance.

436
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,220
I can prove my loyalty.

437
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,770
Stop walking around.

438
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,420
I have already had

439
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,420
my men get the ledgers and receipts

440
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,250
to Li Jun.

441
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,530
What time is it now?

442
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,330
It's almost the hour of Shen.

443
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,810
Yuan Shaocheng hasn't arrived yet,

444
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,180
so he must be busy with something.

445
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,050
I know.

446
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,220
I'm just not used to waiting.

447
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,660
Mr. Yuan has sent a message.

448
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,010
He asked you to meet
at the bamboo forest east of the city

449
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,860
for a discussion.

450
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,090
The bamboo forest east of the city?

451
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:36,490
Yes.

452
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,530
Although it's not far,

453
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,090
why did he suddenly change the place?

454
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,380
Well...

455
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,770
I have no idea.

456
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:43,810
Okay.

457
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:44,980
I'll be on my way.

458
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,010
Okay.

459
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:47,900

461
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,380
follow me in secret.

462
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:51,730
OK.

[Tomb of Lu Danxin. Tomb of Cailian]

464
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:34,770
Impossible.

465
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,620
Shaocheng will never

466
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,330
betray Ye Ping'an.

467
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,620
When he comes back, let's ask him.

468
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:39,770
Won't everything be clear then?

469
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,050
I'm afraid Mr. Yuan isn't coming back
for the time being.

470
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,010
Why?

471
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:45,980
Can Wu Youjing

472
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,980
imprison him?

473
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,980
I understand what you mean.

474
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,420
Yuan Shaocheng wouldn't do this

475
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,380
unless absolutely necessary.

476
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,460
He rescheduled their meeting

477
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,380
at the bamboo forest at the last minute.

478
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,810
Ping'an suspected
that something was wrong.

479
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,940
That's why she let me follow along.

480
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:56,810
Where did you lose her?

481
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,980
Their people are very alert.

482
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,250
After I arrived in the South Market,

483
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,050
they all disappeared.

484
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,290
Then I'll take someone to find them
in the South Market.

485
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:01,860
Wait.

486
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,090
The South Market is so big.

487
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,250
When will you find them?

488
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,380
Someone

489
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,730
just brought this to the door.

Who sent it?

494
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,530
The person did not provide a name.

495
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,770
This could be a message

496

00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,490
If I had known it,

499
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,250
I would have gotten myself

500
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,660
a protective talisman.

501
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,570
Mr. Yuan,

502
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,330
let's go.

503
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,180
Protective talisman?

504
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,380
Is he trying to tell me

505
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,900
that someone needs protection?

506
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:54,810
Miss Wu,

507
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,050
we have captured Ye Ping'an.

508
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,140
How should we deal with her?

509
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,250
Send her to Fengrao Salt Shop.

510
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,090
Okay.

511
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,810
This

512
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,730
is the salt shop

513
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,010
we monitored before.

514
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,220
Why did they bring Ping'an there?

515
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,660
Is there

516
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,570
a hidden chamber in the salt shop?

517
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,490
Xian'er.

518
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,330
They are people

519
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,460
whom I have admired since childhood.

520
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,900
[Madam Xian]
Madame Xian ruled the Lingnan Islands,

and Empress Dowager Lyu

527
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,570
[Empress Dowager Lyu]
could manage military affairs

528

and monopolize power.

529
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,770
They were only one step away

530
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,050
from the throne.

531
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,380
But only the Empress

532
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,530
truly claimed the throne.

533
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,090
Xian'er,

534
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,090
I was wrong.

535
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,330
I've failed you.

536
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,860
Actually, every time you came to see me,

537
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:22,700
I hoped

538
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,860
you could stay a little longer.

539
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,730
I was too weak.

540
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,250
In order to escape from the past,
I left home

541
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,010
and abandoned you at a young age,

542
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,290
leaving you with no one to rely on.

543
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:32,810

544
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,460
Stop.

546
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,530
Your father is plotting rebellion.

547
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,940
I can't stop him,

548
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:41,700
but I can save you

549
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,530
and your brother.

550
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,010
Everything hasn't happened yet.

551
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,140
Come with me to the palace

552
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,420
and sincerely seek forgiveness
from the Empress.

553
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,530
Her Majesty will not be too harsh

554
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,290
on you and Kang.

555
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,620
It's not too late yet.

in the past month,

00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,010
I have been very happy

560
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,730
to be by your side.

561
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,460
The times are turbulent.

562
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:02,900
I think

563
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,570
it's better for you
to return to the mountain.

564
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:06,980
After all, you never left the mountain

565
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,180
these years.

566
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,530

00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,420
I won't leave.

569
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,460
If you don't go,

570
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,380
I will beg the Empress with my life

571
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,530
for her forgiveness for you.

572
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:33,660
Xian'er,

573
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,900
let me talk to your mother.

574
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,290
Wu Youjing,

575
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,140
back then, you instructed Hai Yiping

576
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,220
to fabricate the Censor case

577
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,660
in order to cover up the salt incident.

578
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,810
Now you intend
to commit the crime of treason.

579
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,810
Have you ever considered our children?

580
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,010
Don't you feel any guilt?

581
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,860
I have no regrets about what happened.

582
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,660
I only feel bad for failing you.

583
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,380
If I could turn back time,

584
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,700
I would never let you go to the palace

585
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,860
to plead for me,

586
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,420
which made you feel guilty

587
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,380
in your heart.

588
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,620
Until now, you still think

589
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,530
that I left you

590
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,140
just because I feel guilty in my heart?

591
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,940
We are a couple.

592
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,770
You have done

593
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,180
such despicable things.

594
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,770
Even if I didn't do anything,
I am guilty.

595
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,490
I'm guilty of not being able
to persuade you

596
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,140
and failing to stop you.

597
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,620
Whenever I see you,

598
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,460
I feel guilty.

599
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,460
For so many years,

600
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,980

601

or to be my wife.

602
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,460
We are not a couple.

603
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,050
Today,

604
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,180
I will fulfill your wish.

605
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,730
From now on,

606
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,460
no matter

607
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,330

[Letter of Divorce. Wu Youjing]

609
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,730

610

611
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,010
and send her
up the mountain immediately.

- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

614
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,490
Pride alone cannot

615

withstand the cold.

- Yes, Miss Wu.
- Yes, Miss Wu.

619
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,810
I have been playing this game alone

620
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:57,980
for over a month now.

621
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,570
I have heard that you are good at games,

622
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,810
but I have never had the chance
to play against you before.

623
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:02,770
Why

624
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,180
don't we each make three moves

625
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,900
and put an end to this game?

626
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,810
The black pieces look imposing,

627
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,090
but really, they are dangerous.

628

People plan.

631
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,010
Rather than claiming I'm wrong,

632
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,140
it's even more absurd

633
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,660
that Her Majesty intends to pass

634
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,940
the throne to the Li family.

635
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,050
Long breath leads to a long life.

636
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,420
You don't seem

637
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,460
to intend to take a breath for yourself.

638
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,700
If I'm not wrong,

639
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,420
you must have done

640
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,620
a lot of things like risking your life.

641
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,570
So you should understand

642
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,380
that from death comes new life.

643
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,420
You should know

644
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,090
that before ascending to the throne,

645
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,220
the Empress also had the experience

646
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,330
of almost being deposed.

647
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,700
I kept you

648
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,620
so that you could witness
with your own eyes

649
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,620
how I ascended to the throne.

650
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,420
It seems like I won.

651
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,700
There's no need

652
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,810
to continue with this game.

653
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,050
Xian'er,

654
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,180
do you believe
one can glimpse others' dreams?

655
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,250
I saw it all.

656
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,490
My brother
has always been straightforward.

657
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,380
Do you have full confidence

658
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,010
in his decision?

659
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,090
Last year,

660
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,050
he learned the truth
about the Censor case.

661
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,810
Although it was difficult
to accept at the time,

662
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,900
he ultimately chose

663
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,180
to conceal everything

664
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,570
and protect the Wu family.

665
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,660
Now,

666
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,050
he should be more aware

667
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,490
of my good intentions.

668
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,980
He is a man of great feeling.

669
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,250
He will never abandon our family.

670
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,140
Don't worry.

671
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,860
I have already written

672
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,770
a letter to Kang.

673
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,900
No one knows a son
better than his father.

674
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,140
If I can

675
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,940
ascend to the throne,

676
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:08,620
in the future,

677
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,770
you must do your best

678
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,620
to assist Kang

679
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,220
and perpetuate the prosperity
of Great Feng.

680

General Wu.

681
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,220
My son,

682
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,570
as you read this letter,

683
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,460
you must be quite taken aback.

684
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,140
I want

685
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,530
to ascend to the throne.

686
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,140
You have an army at your disposal.

687
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:11,490
By then,

688
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,770
wait outside the city.

689
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,460
Against the rebels,

690
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,570
we'll fight together.

691
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,530
My great cause

692
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,090
will last for generations.

693
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,380
If successful,

694
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,490
Great Feng will continue to thrive,

695
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,490
and you will be the successor.

696
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,290
If defeated,

697
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,490
our family will be overthrown.

698
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,140
You and I,

699
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,460
together with the Wu family,

700
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,620
are bound by blood.

701
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,530
We rise and fall together.

702
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,940
I know your kindness,

703
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,420
and I also know

704
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,490
that you will not

705
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,010
watch your family suffer slaughter.

706

707
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,810

the Empress will reward us greatly.

716
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,250
I heard that she'd bestow upon you

717
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:19,860
the title of Marquis Zhongyong.

718

721
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,940
I wish

722
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,180
that I had died

723
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,330
in Mang Mountain

724
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,730
so that my loyalty

725
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,180
and filial piety

726
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:38,940
could be both honored.

728
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,460
how could you say such things?

729
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,290
What...

730
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,180

00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,180

how lively it will be.

during previous Lantern Festivals,

746
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,010
you were accompanied
by prominent officials

747
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,170
at grand banquets
in the Eternal Pavilion.

748

These banquets were all prepared
by senior officials.

749
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,570
They lacked novelty.

I would like to recommend myself

752

and organize a banquet

00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:46,460
General Xian.

764
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,260
Miss Wu.

765
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,260
These days,

766
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:49,860
you've all done a great job.

767
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:50,940
We were

768
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,490
all saved

769
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,490
by you on the battlefields.

770
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,570
It's our honor

771
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,740
to serve you.

772
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,460
Xian'er,

773
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:58,690
the Thunder Fire

774
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,860
is almost ready.

775
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,010
Starting tomorrow,

776
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,300
it can be shipped out.

777
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,340
Okay.

778
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,860
The Prince of Kangping

779
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,050
has found out, hasn't he?

780
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,740
My father wants to be the Crown Prince,

781
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,650
but I can tell

782
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,820
that the Empress
has no intention of doing so.

783
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:17,780
Find a way

784
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,090
to let him discover

785
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,050
the sets of armor and the Thunder fire.

786
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,050
When his dream
of becoming the Crown Prince

787
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:22,940
is shattered,

788
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,570
he can only rely on me.

789
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:28,570
Okay.

790
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,010
In the end,

791
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,460
we finally came to this point.

792
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,610
Shortly after Empress Dowager Lyu
and Empress Dowager Dou

793
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,530
returned the throne,

794
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,690
their families were slaughtered
by their successors.

795
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,740
Since the Empress is determined

796
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,260
to give back the throne
to the Li family,

797
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,570
the Wu family's future

798
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,210
is clear.

799
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,260
So...

800
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,820
we must act first.

801
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,650
Please allow me to say something bold.

802
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,170
Compared to the Prince of Kangping,

803
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,860
I have always believed

804
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,610
that you're more suitable to be a ruler.

805
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,610
Things are about to change

806
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:02,900
in the capital.

807
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:03,780
General Xian,

808
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,690
will you stand with me?

809
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,530
My heart...

810
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,610
and my duty

811
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,860
are with you.
