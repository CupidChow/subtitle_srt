3
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,070
Are you saying that Li Ge

4
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,910
has the same Seven-Petal Epiphyllum mark

5
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,700
on her arm as Cailian?

6
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,260
Yes.

7
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,260
How much do you know about Li Ge?

8
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,030
I don't know much about her.

9
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,750
She's new here

10
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,100
and usually keeps to herself.

11
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,380
But I heard Madam Hua mention

12
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,580
that her family sold her

13
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,660
to Wanguoxiang Tavern.

14
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,510
Miss Li Ge,

15
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,070
I'm coming in.

16
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,750
Miss Li Ge,

17
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,310
were you hurt

18
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,860
just now?

19
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,700
I'm fine.

20
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,510
My friends have left.

21
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,510
Miss Li Ge,

22
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,190
would you mind chatting with me?

23
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,260
It's no fun just drinking.

24
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:23,990
How about

25
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,380
we play a game instead?

26
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,140
What game?

27
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,190
It's a mind-reading game.

28
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,900
If I guess
what's on your mind correctly,

29
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,460
you drink.

30
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,990
If I'm wrong,

31
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,310
I'll drink instead.

32
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,340
We've just met,

33
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,820
so it should be fair.

34
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,750
This doesn't sound

35
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,670
quite fair to you.

36
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,430
Here's the first drink.

37
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,430
When you talk to me,

38
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,670
although you wear a smile,

39
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,140
your heart is filled with pain

40
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,670
and your hands

41
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,950
often tremble.

42
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,870
Now, the second drink.

43
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,580
Because the pain is unbearable,

44
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,900
you resort to cutting yourself

45
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,990
to release the frustration.

46
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,820
And the third drink...

47
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,380
Who exactly are you?

48
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,750
Now, the third drink.

49
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,380
Your pain

50
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,220
stems from the fact

51
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,900
that someone destroyed your belief

52
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,380
in the goodness of life

53
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,670
and even

54
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,670
abandoned you.

55
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,460
It's hard for you

56
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,990
to open up to others now.

57
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,580
Gossip is a frightening thing.

58
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,900
It's even more terrifying
than disaster or illness.

59
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,070
That's why I never open up to others.

60
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,310
But I never expected

61
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,430
that you'd be able
to see right through me

62
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,260
after our brief encounter.

63
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,110
Didn't you ask who I am earlier?

64
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,310
My name is Ye Ping'an.

65
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,340
You're that witch...

66
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,310
The psychiatrist, I mean.

67
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,750
That explains everything.

68
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,220
Please don't tell anyone

69
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,020
what you just heard.

70
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,220
If others find out,

71
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,110
they'll definitely think

72
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:24,990
I'm a freak.

73
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,820
You have my word.

74
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,820
But could you tell me

75
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,140
who left

76
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,670
this Epiphyllum mark

77
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,750
on you?

78
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,900
I don't want to tell you,

79
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,820
nor can I.

80
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,670
He has a prestigious background.

81
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,820
If you insist on asking,

82
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,750
I'll have to ask you to leave.

83
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,670
What are you carving, Father?

84
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,550
The Eternal Pavilion,

85
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,870
symbolizing everlasting longevity.

86
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,900
If Her Majesty likes it,

87
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,430
I will present it to her
during the upcoming festival.

88
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,870
If not,

89
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,070
I shall keep it

90
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,190
for myself.

91
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,110
To carve the Eternal Pavilion

92
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,670
with such intricate precision

93
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,020
on this rosewood

94
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,190
may take up to a year.

95
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,550
When Her Majesty sees it,

96
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,820
your heartfelt effort

97
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,700
will please her greatly.

98
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,020
Xian'er,

99
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,870
you should have time tomorrow
to go up the mountain

100
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,270
and visit your mother, right?

101
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,580
I still have

102
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,670
some business to attend to

103
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,460
and won't be free tomorrow.

104
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,070
When you were little,

105
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,150
your mother went to the mountain
to focus on her cultivation,

106
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,620
and you were left neglected.

107
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,270
If you have any resentment,

108
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,270
direct it at me.

109
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,220
Father, please don't say such things.

110
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,430
If it weren't for your recognition

111
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,740
of my policy proposals back then,

112
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,820
bringing me to meet Her Majesty,

113
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,390
how could I have reached
where I am today?

114
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,700
You still haven't fully recovered,

115
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,740
so have an early night.

116
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,100
Mother!

117
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,910
Please don't go.

118
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,500
Don't leave me behind.

119
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,100
Mother,

120
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,550
please don't leave me behind.

121
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,190
From now on,

122
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,030
never speak of your mother again.

123
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,700
Get up.

124
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,820
Get up.

125
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,100
Do as you wish.

126
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,410
[Qinglong Bridge]

127
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:42,700
Gu Wenyu,

128
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,150
this lantern of yours

129
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,270
is quite unique.

130
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,670
I bought one while waiting for you

131
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,340
last night,

132
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,190
but later I realized

133
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,150
it would be more meaningful

134
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:52,950
to make it myself.

135
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,310
Unfortunately, I'm quite clumsy,

136
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,580
so this is what I ended up with.

137
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,460
It's for you.

138
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:05,860
Look.

139
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,310
Is the reflection of the moon beautiful?

140
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,390
It's very beautiful.

141
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,790
What about now?

142
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,620
Actually,

143
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,460
many of the things
you think are beautiful

144
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,860
are nothing but illusions.

145
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:26,950
I'm the same.

146
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,070
I know

147
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,790
that if I keep hesitating

148
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,950
and don't give you an answer,

149
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,670
neither of us will be happy.

150
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,580
Gu Wenyu,

151
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,980
from now on,

152
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,070
anyone can come to my meat stall,

153
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,390
but not you.

154
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:44,950
I

155
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,500
will not be with you.

156
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:56,700
Is your concern

157
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,910
related to the censor's case?

158
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,620
How did you know?

159
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,150
What else do you know?

160
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,150
Is it Yuan Shaocheng who...?

161
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,340
Please let me finish,

162
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,030
all right?

163
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,790
I've been a lowly person

164
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,620
since the moment I was born.

165
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,390
When I was twelve,

166
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,860
I was sold from Mang Gutter

167
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,430
and locked away in a house,

168
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,030
living a life devoid of light.

169
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,100
Any mistake I made
would result in a brutal beating.

170
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,100
My mother was worried about me,

171
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,270
so she came to check on me.

172
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,580
She just wanted to take one look at me,

173
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,670
but the scoundrel who bought me

174
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,460
beat her to death.

175
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,580
I rushed up to fight him.

176
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,820
If Mr. Yuan hadn't saved me,

177
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:39,860
I honestly don't know

178
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,190
what would have become of me.

179
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,740
So, whether it's an illusion

180
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,700
or the truth,

181
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,790
the past

182
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,910
is a part of us.

183
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,100
There's no need to run from it.

184
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,150
I've never run from it.

185
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,980
For all these years,
I've wanted to go home

186
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,430
and reunite with my father,

187
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,340
but I was too scared,

188
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,220
and couldn't bring myself to do it.

189
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,140
All I could do was carry the pendant

190
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,230
my father gave me every day,

191
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,380
pretending that he was still by my side.

192
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,260
Gu Wenyu,

193
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,190
both of us

194
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,190
are living in pain.

195
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,350
You can't help me,

196
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,660
just as I can't help you.

197
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,590
I respect your choice.

198
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,110
But my feelings for you
go beyond affection.

199
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,230
There's also admiration.

200
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,590
So, whatever decisions

201
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,310
you make in the future,

202
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,470
I want to stand by you.

203
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,380
Well.

204
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:46,830
No one's inside.

205
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,590
[Anxin House]

206
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,350
Miss Ye, my savior.

207
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,190
Miss Ye.

208
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,500
Miss Ye.

209
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,620
Oh, it's you two.

210
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,660
What are you doing here at this hour?

211
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,470
It was me who brought him here.

212
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,310
He's had another relapse
in the past few days.

213
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,540
When did I have a relapse?

214
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,500
If you were fine,

215
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,900
then why did you join the others,

216
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,350
trying to make a scene tonight?

217
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,380
What nonsense are you talking about?

218
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:15,860
What happened?

219
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,140
Don't move!

220
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,020
If you take one more step forward,

221
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,830
you're forcing me to kill myself!

222
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:23,950
Cai Yun,

223
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,110
we've worked so hard

224
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,020
for so long,

225
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,110
and in the end,
you don't give us any money at all.

226
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,540
You think temporary workers like us

227
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,780
are just pushovers, huh?

228
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,990
- Give us our money.
- Pay us what we're owed.

229
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,230
[Cai Yun, the fabric shop owner]
Did I say I wouldn't pay you?

230
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,830
Did I?

231
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,500
You just need

232
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,540
to give me a few more days.

233
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,710
You kept delaying

234
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,860
the payment.

235
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:40,620
Go up

236
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,660
and bring him down.

237
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,710
Stay back, all of you!

238
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,540
Don't come any closer!

239
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:44,710
I...

240
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,310
Well.

241
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,860
Why has he stopped moving?

242
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:52,500
Step aside

243
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:53,660
and let me take a look.

244
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:08,830
Tell me.

245
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:09,900
Why haven't you

246
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,310
paid them yet?

247
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,620
I went to the gambling house
with the money and lost it.

248
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,230
Keep spinning the story.

249
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,190
It's true. I'm not lying.

250
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,380
Have you heard of

251
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,260
Ye Ping'an from Anxin House?

252
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,590
You're that witch...

253
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,070
I'll tell you the truth.

254
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,310
I'll tell you the truth.

255
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,260
So,

256
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,430
I spent half my life's savings

257
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,470
opening this fabric shop,

258
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,500
thinking

259
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,710
I could take a gamble on fortune
and make it big.

260
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:38,950
But I never expected

261
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,950
that right after
the capital's big fabric shop

262
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,620
sent someone to collect
the so-called market entry fees,

263
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,380
a low-ranking official

264
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,590
from the South Market Bureau

265
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,380
said my fabric
didn't meet the standards.

266
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,500
Now, I've spent everything

267
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,540
trying to grease the wheels.

268
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,230
Let alone paying them,

269
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,260
I don't even have money for food.

270
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,660
This is quality fabric.

271
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,660
Are they deliberately
giving you a hard time?

272
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,260
You're a perceptive one.

273
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,950
I checked with some friends,

274
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,590
and it turns out

275
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,350
both the South Market Bureau

276
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,660
and the pawnshop

277
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,620
are in cahoots
with that big fabric shop.

278
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,070
They

279
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,500
dominate the entire trade,

280
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,260
making sure

281
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,620
small fabric shops
like mine can't stay open.

282
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,860
I'm not the first one

283
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,310
to be pushed over the edge.

284
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,150
That big fabric shop…

285
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,660
It wouldn't happen to be Jiuhe,
would it?

286
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,390
Jiuhe?

287
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,350
That's the biggest fabric shop
in the capital.

288
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,150
You fear

289
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,030
that if they make a scene
at Jiuhe Fabric Shop,

290
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,700
they'll also get themselves
into trouble.

291
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,990
You are pretty loyal.

292
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,470
All right.

293
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,750
So who's behind Jiuhe Fabric Shop?

294
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,270
It's the wealthiest merchant
in the capital

295
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,630
and a royal relative,

296
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,780
Prince of Langyang, Li Zongxu.

297
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,870
Mr. Li, the philanthropist?

298
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,300
That's not possible!

299
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,270
He's hosting a feast

300
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,700
for the people tomorrow.

301
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,420
- Yes.
- Yes.

302
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,420
I heard

303
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,900
this feast is specially

304
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,180
prepared for us poor people.

305
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,660
We'll get plenty to eat and drink.

306
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,390
It's true.

307
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:58,780
It's true.

308
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,390
He has helped us a lot.

309
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:01,870
All right.

310
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,030
I'll trouble you

311
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,540
to endure a bit more hardship tomorrow.

312
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:06,860
What kind of hardship?

313
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,270
Hesheng,

314
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,710
you're going to be a father.

315
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:28,860
Really?

316
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,300
We are going to have a child?

317
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,430
I am going to be a father?

318
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,510
I am going to be a father!

319
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,030
Bai Sheng,

320
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,820
from now on,
I'll do all the heavy lifting

321
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:44,710
at home.

322
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,230
Also,

323
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,270
from now on,

324
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,540
I won't touch a drop of liquor.

325
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,100
Are you sure?

326
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:51,670
I am.

327
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:54,620
Hesheng,

328
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,710
now that we're expecting a child,

329
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,580
how about we move

330
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,300
to the quiet countryside

331
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,710
and live there?

332
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:04,820
But

333
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,990
what about Shaocheng?

334
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,910
He's always taking risks.

335
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,270
As long as I'm around,

336
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,860
he'll still think twice.

337
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,140
If I leave,

338
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,820
he'll only become more reckless

339
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,380
and eventually get into trouble.

340
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,230
I can't just abandon him.

341
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,510
Hesheng,

342
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,670
I know you're worried about him,

343
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,340
but you can't watch over him

344
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,190
forever.

345
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,620
No matter what,

346
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:31,860
you need to let him know

347
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,820
what we're thinking,

348
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:34,620
all right?

349
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,150
[Longmen Arena]

350
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,470
Why did you ask me

351
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,470
to meet you here today?

352
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,670
I wish to see if your martial skills

353
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,710
have deteriorated

354
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,990
like your character.

355
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,270
You must fight me

356
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,860
today.

357
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,190
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

358
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,100
Five years ago,

359
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,510
you broke through
the enemy's encirclement

360
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,580
and brought back crucial intelligence,

361
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,300
achieving great feats.

362
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,270
But now,
why have you become a sycophant

363
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,510
who curries favor with the powerful?

364
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,340
Why?

365
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,230
So what if

366
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,860
I become such person?

367
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,430
Are you afraid that one day

368
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,950
I will become a threat to you?

369
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,780
If you're really after
power and influence,

370
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,470
then why would you risk
offending the nobility

371
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,270
to plead for the people of Mang Gutter?

372
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,270
Because I love meddling
in other people's affairs.

373
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,540
Is that answer good enough, General?

374
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,430
You're just like you used to be.

375
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,710
So are you.

376
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,510
- Nice!
- Nice!

377
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:46,230
This is great.

378
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,430
What's the purpose

379
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,270
of your return this time?

00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,140
As long as it is within my ability,

570
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:32,380
I will do my utmost to help.

571
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:33,910
What a kind-hearted person.

572
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,100
A true embodiment of kindness.

573
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,470
What a kind-hearted person!

574
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:45,580
I can't take it anymore.

575
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:48,190
I can't go on like this.

576
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,750
It's too much to bear.

577
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,710
Mr. Li,

578
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:58,300
please give me a chance to survive.

579
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,270
May I ask who you are?

580
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,340
We are temporary workers.

581
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,060
We finished building
the fabric shop for this man named Cai,

582
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,230
but he hasn't paid us.

583
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,030
He claims

584
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,100
that it was your Jiuhe Fabric Shop

585
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,190
that took away his livelihood.

586
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,230
We know

587
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,670
you are a kind-hearted person,

588
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,470
so

589
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,470
we came to ask you
to help resolve this issue fairly.

590
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,670
Yes.

591
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,780
Mr. Li shall help us
resolve this issue fairly.

592
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,340
- Yes.
- Yes.

593
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,510
Please help us
resolve this issue fairly.

594
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,300
Mr. Li,

595
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,030
I've already paid the market entry fee

596
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,230
to Jiuhe Fabric Shop,

597
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,060
yet they're still

598
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,910
not letting my small fabric shop open.

599
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,060
I went to them

600
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,990
to ask for an explanation,

601
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:34,340
and they beat me up.

602
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,540
The mourning clothes I'm wearing today

603
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,620
are for myself.

604
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:40,670
If you side with them too,

605
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:44,270
I'll die right here in front of you.

606
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,230
I didn't expect

607
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,300
there would be commotion tonight.

608
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:50,620
General,

609
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:51,820
should we still

610
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,540
question Xu Qing

611
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,030
about the Battle of Jinyuan?

612
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,340
Forget it.

613
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,270
Let's not tip our hand tonight.

614
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,140
Go back.

615
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,190
Once the account book arrives,

616
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,300
I'll have a proper talk with Xu Qing.

617
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:04,470
Yes, sir.

618
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,670
You old...

619
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:09,780
Sir,

620
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,620
I'm in charge of Jiuhe Fabric Shop.

621
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,380
There's no way

622
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,510
something like this could happen.

623
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,750
Stop making things up.

624
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,910
I'm making things up?

625
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,230
I'm telling the truth,

626
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,430
I promise!

627
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,430
Can these injuries be a lie?

628
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,670
Everyone, look at my face!

629
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,950
Look at it.

630
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,190
Can the injuries on my face

631
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,750
be fake?

632
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,030
Can they?

633
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:30,470
Father,

634
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,430
he's lying.

635
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,340
The shopkeeper at Jiuhe Fabric Shop

636
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,270
stepped on my face

637
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,340
and beat me.

638
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,620
If you don't believe me,

639
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,100
just call him over

640
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,510
to confront me.

641
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:46,190
Jiuhe Fabric Shop
has already resorted to violence.

642
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,510
Who's to say

643
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,340
they wouldn't do anything else,

644
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,190
right?

645
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,380
I can't go on like this.

646
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,030
Everyone, quiet down.

647
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:54,780
Looks like

648
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,710
they really are monopolizing the market.

649
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,780
I have always valued

650
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,860
harmony in business.

651
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,750
I will never tolerate

652
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,430
any monopolistic behavior.

653
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,140
If anyone at Jiuhe Fabric Workshop

654
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,430
has broken the rules,

655
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,380
I will make sure
to punish them severely.

656
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,910
How much is owed to you?

657
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,780
Each of us is owed 170 wen.

658
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:12,780
There are twelve of us,

659
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,540
so that's a total of 2040 wen.

660
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,510
This is the contract.

661
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,340
All right.

662
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,780
I'll cover

663
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:20,950
your pay.

664
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:21,950
On top of that,

665
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,540
I will add another 10000 wen

666
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,820
as compensation.

667
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,540
You are indeed kind-hearted, Mr. Li.

668
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,190
What a benevolent man!

669
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,380
What a benevolent man!

670
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,270
You are so kind.

671
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,340
He won't bully us common people.

672
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,990
We can really count on Mr. Li.

673
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,190
You are truly kind.

674
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,510
Thank you, Mr. Li.

675
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,580
Whether the kind-hearted Mr. Li

676
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,190
has anything to do
with Jiuhe Fabric Shop

677
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,820
monopolizing the market or not,

678
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,780
for a philanthropist like him,

679
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,670
reputation is what matters the most.

680
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,380
So tomorrow,

681
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,470
focus on three things. First,

682
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,780
use the crowd to your advantage.

683
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,340
Second, sing his praises.

684
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,380
Third, tell a tragic tale.

685
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,510
This way,

686
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,950
the situation will be resolved swiftly

687
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,750
and everyone will be pleased.

688
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,510
[Boundless Benevolence]
Mr. Li,

689
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,140
I extend our sincere gratitude

690
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,190
on behalf of all the temporary workers.

691
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:07,860
That's right.

692
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,430
It's truly our privilege

693
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,270
to encounter

694
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,510
such a benevolent person like Mr. Li.

695
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:13,910
- Yes.
- Yes.

696
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,780
- It's our privilege.
- It's our privilege.

697
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,750
Now that we have a positive outcome,

698
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,270
let's all raise a glass

699
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,510
and toast to a bountiful harvest

700
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,950
and a prosperous, peaceful nation.

701
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,430
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

702
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,430
- Thank you, Mr. Li.
- Thank you, Mr. Li.

703
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,270
If I've guessed correctly,

704
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,300
you're the one who planned

705
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,780
this excellent act tonight
for the temporary workers, right?

706
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,580
General Wu,

707
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,140
what are you doing here?

708
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,670
I was just wandering around

709
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,780
and happened to see you

710
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,950
helping the temporary workers get paid.

711
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:50,990
I didn't know

712
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,060
you had such a sense of justice.

713
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,990
It's only right that people

714
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,030
are paid for their hard work.

715
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,060
When their hearts are at ease,
their minds are calm,

716
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,710
and when their minds are at peace,
they stay healthy.

717
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,380
I heard from Xian'er

718
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,710
that you often provide

719
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,540
for refugees at your camp

720
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,340
and even take the lead
in cultivating new land.

721
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,750
This

722
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,430
is truly an act of great virtue.

723
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,140
This is but a small effort
in the face of a great problem.

724
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,580
Some among the noble families

725
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,030
not only hoard land for their own gain

726
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,230
but also force struggling farmers

727
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,430
to sell their fertile fields
at low prices.

728
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,270
That's why the number

729
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,670
of refugees keeps rising.

730
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,910
It sounds like

731
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,190
you're feeling a bit discouraged.

732
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,030
What about you?

733
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:22,910
Even though you helped

734
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,140
the temporary workers this time,

735
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,190
injustice against the common people

736
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,190
happens all the time.

737
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,430
Have you never lost heart?

738
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,710
Me?

739
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,990
I just think

740
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,540
that when I come across

741
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,510
someone I can help,

742
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:38,860
I should do it.

743
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,620
Coming back to the capital

744
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,140
and making a friend like you

745
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,270
has made this journey worthwhile.

746
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,540
There's no time like the present.

747
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,060
Let's go get Xian'er

748
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,950
and have a drink together.
What do you say?

749
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:52,620
Sure.

750
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,270
Over there.

751
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:55,430
It's her.

752
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,030
It's her.

753
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,230
It's her.

754
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:58,990
What do you want?

755
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,380
She is the savior
of us temporary workers.

756
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:01,620
My savior.

757
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,230
Thanks to Miss Ye,

758
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,750
we got our money back.

759
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,380
Folks,

760
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,380
let's thank Miss Ye.

761
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,820
- Thank you, Miss Ye.
- Thank you, Miss Ye.

762
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,030
- Thank you, Miss Ye.
- Thank you, Miss Ye.

763
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,670
Folks,

764
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,510
from now on, we will not allow anyone

765
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,820
to speak ill of Anxin House.

766
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,300
That's right.

767
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,140
We won't allow it.

768
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,030
- We won't allow it.
- We won't allow it.

769
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:16,910
Step aside.

770
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,190
Look at you, all rough and loud.

771
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,580
You might scare my savior.

772
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,190
Sorry about that.

773
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:21,750
I'm sorry.

774
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:22,860
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

775
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:23,780
All right.

776
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,950
What are we still doing here?

777
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,670
Let's leave.

778
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,340
Folks,

779
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,470
- let's leave.
- Let's go.

780
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,060
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

781
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:30,780
Thank you so much, Miss Ye,

782
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,780
for helping me out of this bind

783
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,750
at this late hour.

784
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,620
Don't mention it.

785
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,510
Miss Ye,

786
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,060
I have another favor to ask.

787
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:38,950
What is it?

788
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,470
I have a patient at home.

789
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,950
I'd like to ask you
to take a look at him.

790
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,030
Rest assured,

791
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,380
I will pay for your services promptly.

792
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,340
The problem

793
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,140
is that the person

794
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,470
is not sound here,

795
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,380
so I can't bring him out.

796
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,470
Would you mind

797
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,470
coming to my house?

798
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:53,710
You should go.

799
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,100
We'll catch up

800
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:55,950
another time.

801
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:58,540
This way.

802
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,470
Several years ago,

803
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,430
I saw him being beaten up

804
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,220
by a group of thugs on the street.

805
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,580
He was covered in injuries.

806
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,260
I felt so sorry for him,

807
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,220
so I brought him home.

808
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,220
Why give him a shawl

809
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,990
when the weather is so hot?

810
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,390
The shawl is his.

811
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:19,950
He carries it wherever he goes

812
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:20,870
and clings to it.

813
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,470
Was he like this
when you brought him back?

814
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,030
Yes, he was.

815
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,260
Do you know his name?

816
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,060
I don't.

817
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,510
Everyone calls him the Crazy Old Man.

818
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:33,870
Don't hit me!

819
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,220
Don't hit me!

820
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,580
Scumbag.

821
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,060
Mr. Cai,

822
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,310
please move back a bit.

823
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,350
That shawl of yours is lovely.

824
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,990
Did you knit it yourself?

825
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:02,990
Shawl?

826
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:07,700
Shawl...

827
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,260
Shawl...

828
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,310
He's mentally confused at the moment.

829
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,540
The only thing we can do

830
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,740
is take it slowly.

831
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,310
I'll come by regularly to treat him,

832
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,260
but he must not

833
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,540
be exposed to any more stress.

834
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,620
Can he be cured?

835
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,910
I can only do my best.

836
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,790
[Anxin House]

837
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,310
Miss Ye.

838
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,930
[Li Ge, a dancer at Wanguoxiang Tavern]

839
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,470
At last, you've come to see me.

840
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:32,390
Tell me.

841
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,390
How did you end up
at Wanguoxiang Tavern?

842
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,910
My family are farmers.

843
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,660
The low-ranking officials
from the Ministry of Revenue

844
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,910
kept increasing the grain tax

845
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,620
with various excuses.

846
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,180
When we couldn't pay,

847
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,470
we'd have no choice
but to sell our land cheaply.

848
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,620
To relieve my family of the burden,

849
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,140
I ended up submitting myself to a man.

850
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,390
But that man

851
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,700
abused me daily,

852
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,790
and I was terrified.

853
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,950
I barely managed to escape back home,

854
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,790
but then Madam Hua
from Wanguoxiang Tavern

855
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,740
came to my father

856
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,660
and offered a bag of salt
in exchange for me.

857
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,700
Seeing how valuable the salt was,

858
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,620
my father used me

859
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,950
to trade for it.

860
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:24,990
I...

861
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:25,870
I...

862
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,700
Close your eyes.

863
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,030
From this moment on,

864
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:46,180
we'll go to a safe place,

865
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,310
just the two of us.

866
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:09,100
I can feel your pain.

867
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,030
This is a safe space.

868
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,950
You can say anything you want.

869
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,620
I feel like no one in this world

870
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,510
needs me anymore.

871
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,540
I'm exhausted.

872
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,700
I truly feel

873
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,350
drained.

874
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,180
I always put others first

875
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,990
and never hurt anyone,

876
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:39,260
but why is it always me

877
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:42,950
who ends up hurt

878
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:45,700
in the end?

879
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,870
You don't want others to be hurt,

880
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:51,790
but you've been hurting yourself
all along.

881
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,100
Li Ge,

882
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,990
you need to take care of yourself first,

883
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:58,700
so you can have the strength
to help others.

884
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,310
Look at this world.

885
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,910
Doesn't it resemble a theater?

886
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,430
Joy and sorrow,

887
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,870
each person's experience is different.

888
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,870
When thoughts

889
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,790
like "I've been abandoned by my family,

890
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,140
life is meaningless"

891
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,100
appear,

892
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:22,140
try

893
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,100
changing your mindset instead.

894
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:28,510
You may say to yourself,
"I finally left the place of sorrow.

895
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,260
I rely on my talents

896
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,910
to support myself."

897
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:33,580
As the days pass,

898
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,660
the life you lead

899
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,540
is shaped by each thought you hold.

900
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,870
Do you feel better now?

901
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,870
I feel much better,

902
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,430
like a heavy weight

903
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,350
has been lifted off my chest.

904
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,260
Take care of yourself from now on.

905
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,580
If you ever experience
mood swings again,

906
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,260
don't hesitate to come to my clinic.

907
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:25,950
By the way, Miss Ye,

908
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,140
why did you want

909
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,990
to know who that person is

910
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,310
when you saw

911
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,310
the mark on my arm before?

912
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,580
Because you're not the only one

913
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,620
who's been hurt.

914
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:48,390
All right,

915
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,540
I'll tell you

916
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,260
