[Kill My Sins]
[This is a work of fiction]

2
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,260
Where's my father?

3
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,350
What happened to him?

4
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,590
Master asked us to send you back.

5
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,900
This is all we know.

6
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:51,590
Useless!

7
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,100
Help my father.

8
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,150
Help him!

9
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,870
I'm going to help him.

10
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:58,710
I will.

[Episode 15]
[Scattered, but Never Forget]

12
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,470
Your Highness.

13
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:55,790
Your Highness,

14
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,030
I found a chance

15
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,380
to read the account book
of Yitai Gambling House.

16
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,750
I noticed that every month,

17
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,660
Yuan Shaocheng would take away

18
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,100
a large amount of money.

19
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,350
However, the account book

20
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,070
was kept by his accountant, Zhao Yu.

21
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:06,980
I couldn't get a hand on it,

22
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,820
but you must have a way.

23
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,910
Do you like to drink?

24
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,750
This is a liquor infused
with tiger bone and ginseng.

25
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,350
A sip of it is worth 500 liang.

26
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,230
You get things done,

27
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,310
so you should be rewarded.

28
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:41,750
Your Highness,

29
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,420
I can't stay there anymore.

30
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,510
Please,

31
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,750
let me stay with you.

32
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,420
Why would I do that?

33
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:50,860
You need to

34
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:51,980
stay around Yuan Shaocheng

35
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,420
and get something on him.

36
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,190
This is the only thing you can do.

37
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,260
But I never thought

38
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,540
that you would kill Mr. Gu.

39
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,950
If Yuan Shaocheng finds out about it,

40
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,030
I...

41
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,630
He will not spare me!

42
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,230
I want to quit.

43
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,030
What did you say?

44
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,220
I didn't hear you.

45
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,070
I can't do it anymore.

46
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,820
It won't end well for me.

47
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,510
If Yuan Shaocheng finds out

48
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,820
that you betrayed him,

49
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,870
he will make you suffer.

50
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,550
That's why the only way out for you

51
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:33,700
is to stay

52
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,510
around him

53
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,260
and get something.

54
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,900
Then you have nothing to worry about.

55
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,630
Who was the one

56
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,870
with a mask on?

57
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:12,900
Master,

58
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,780
our spy sent an urgent message.

59
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,750
He said

60
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,900
it was very important.

61
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:37,990
Stay there.

62
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,070
Sit down.

63
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,750
You are injured.

64
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,900
Forget about the rules.

65
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,340
How are you?

66
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,380
Much better.

67
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,900
I'm tough.

68
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,580
This is

69
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,220
nothing.

70
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,340
Your Highness, I'm so relieved
you're alright.

71
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,580
Otherwise,

72
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,630
I don't know
how to explain to your father.

73
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,380
Your Highness, Sir,

74
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,550
the Prince of Chunyang is here.

75
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,310
Invite him in.

76
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:05,950
Yes, sir.

77
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,820
Greetings, Prince of Chunyang.

78
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:15,780
Sorry for visiting without notice.

79
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,950
I brought you some deer antler ointment.

80
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,140
It's good for healing.

81
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,630
Your Highness
must be scared in the banquet.

82
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,550
These will nourish your body

83
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,580
and ease your mind.

84
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,020
It takes a lot

85
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,460
to scare me.

86
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,950
It was my mistake.

87
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,990
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

88
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,990
Let me be honest with you.

89
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,580
You're handsome

90
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,950
and refined.

91
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,430
There are plenty of wonderful women
in the capital.

92
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,630
You'll find someone perfect for you.

93
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:50,870
Why this obsession

94
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,780
with becoming prince consort?

95
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,750
A good match is someone

96
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,430
you love.

97
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,900
If she doesn't see me,

98
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,070
I'm nothing

99
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,380
but a common man.

100
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:03,870
What's more,

101
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:04,750
I'm not as glorified

102
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,070
as you think.

103
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,580
Others only see me

104
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,190
as someone
with a background and a nice face,

105
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,460
but no real ability.

106
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,310
I'm taking the gifts.

107
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,750
And as you see,

108
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,750
I'm perfectly fine.

109
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,340
See you next time, Prince of Chunyang.

110
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,430
After the banquet,

111
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,510
a lot of people came to visit,

112
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,550
but why hasn't General Wu

113
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,020
sent any message?

114
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:52,900
Your Highness,

115
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,260
please don't be upset.

116
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,430
General Wu and you

117
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,900
didn't see each other for years.

118
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,510
It's normal

119
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,220
that there's some distance.

120
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,310
You can spend more time together
after the wedding.

121
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,190
The feeling will grow

122
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,510
over time.

123
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:39,580
Where are you going?

124
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,070
I can't leave Cailian's body

125
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,790
to Li Zongxu.

126
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,460
I'm taking her home.

127
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,820
I will go with you.

128
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,030
After the banquet,

129
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,620
Li Zongxu will

130
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,500
get more alert.

131
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,670
He will notice

132
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,580
any move you make.

133
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,550
I'll go check it out.

134
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,910
Don't tell anyone that I'm out,

135
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,390
especially my aunt.

136
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,030
How can I be sure

137
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,910
that you are safe?

138
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:06,860
If I don't come back

139
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:07,580
after two hours,

140
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,340
that means I'm in danger.

141
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,070
I will find a way

142
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,740
to leave you a clue.

143
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,860
Don't be reckless.

144
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,910
The ones who tried to murder
the envoy last night

145
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,270
were from Mang Gutter.

146
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:30,700
Everyone knows

147
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,310
your roots are there,

148
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,790
and you have strong ties.

149
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,390
You are

150
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,460
part of this.

151
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,910
Mr. Li, you don't know for sure.

152
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,740
These people were extremely poor,

153
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,070
and would do anything

154
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,740
when offered a price.

155
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,190
Without any evidence,

156
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,620
you cannot accuse Mr. Yuan

157
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,030
of being behind those people
only because they were

158
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,910
from Mang Gutter.

159
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,270
Mr. Mei,

160
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,950
are you playing dumb here?

161
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,070
If they were doing it for the money,

162
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,270
why would they rather die than admit it?

163
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,700
Moreover,

164
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,620
the crossbow they used was found,

165
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,740
and it has a rat pattern.

166
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,700
You still don't have any evidence.

167
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:09,740
You...

168
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,980
Someone could have found some bodies,

169
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,220
dressing them up

170
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,550
as people from Mang Gutter
after the assassination,

171
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,030
and framed it on Mr. Yuan.

172
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,220
The dead cannot talk anyway.

173
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,340
Let me ask you. Who would

174
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,270
leave their own mark

175
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,620
on their weapon?

176
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,460
Do they want everyone to know about it?

177
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,620
Mr. Mei,

178
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,790
you are very good

179
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,980
at counter-charges.

180
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,220
I think you did even better

181
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,310
on your hidden agenda.

182
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,100
You...

183
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:39,820
Mr. Li

184
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,150
and Mr. Mei,

185
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,950
you are both seniors.

186
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,670
Please don't let it

187
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,860
ruin your friendship.

188
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,670
No matter what you say,

189
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,220
you need evidence,

190
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,430
right?

191
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,460
Sure.

192
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,070
About the banquet,

193
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,270
I don't have a witness yet,

194
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,790
but there is something else
about Mr. Yuan

195
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,460
that I want to report.

196
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,430
I was told

197
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,430
that an official

198
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,700
was running the Yitai Gambling House
for his own interest.

199
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,340
I sent people
to the gambling house today

200
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,550
and found the account book.

201
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,220
It used to be

202
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,460
Qi Junshan's property.

203
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,030
Mr. Yuan took over later.

204
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,670
The gambling house

205
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,150
has a total income

206
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,670
of 2,300 liang this month.

207
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,150
And 2,000 liang of it

208
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,550
is specifically marked

209
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,390
as yours, Mr. Yuan.

210
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,190
According to the law,

211
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,700
officials who run a business

212
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,340
should be punished with 50 whippings.

213
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,030
Those who gain profit
are considered bending the law.

214
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,390
Mr. Yuan,

215
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,190
you run a gambling house

216
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,270
and receive huge profits.

217
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,070
I'm afraid

218
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,270
you deserve a severe punishment.

219
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,740
Everything has an exception.

220
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,070
During the years of Zhengguang,

221
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,860
a great businessman Peng Linli

222
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,860
was promoted
as Chamberlain for Ceremonials.

223
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,430
Princesses and kin members
of the royal family

224
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,340
also do business.

225
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,620
Mr. Li, isn't your nephew, Li Zongxu,

226
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,980
also a businessman?

227
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:06,910
Your Majesty,

228
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,070
the law should not

229
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,100
be applied to him solely

230
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:10,950
because

231
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,310
he comes from a humble background.

232
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,190
You said it yourself, Mr. Mei.

233
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,820
He comes from a humble background.

234
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,860
There's no comparison
between those you mentioned

235
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,550
and him.

236
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,700
I think

237
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,030
Mr. Yuan is running the gambling house

238
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,620
not only to take profit

239
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,430
for himself.

240
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,580
Are you suggesting

241
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,860
that he is supported by someone else?

242
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,520
[Langyang Mansion]

243
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,550
Here you are, Miss Ye.

244
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,390
After what happened last night,

245
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,430
I was worried
that His Highness would get worse.

246
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,620
That's why I'm here to have a look.

247
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,340
It's okay.

248
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,070
Master is completely fine now.

249
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,390
He appreciates you a lot,

250
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:10,860
and that's why

251
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,100
he asked me to visit your place
and invite you.

252
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,070
Master

253
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,340
has prepared a feast
and is waiting for you

254
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:19,740
at his private courtyard.

255
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,710
Off you go.

256
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:13,540
Master

257
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:14,990
is over there.

258
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,590
Miss Ye.

259
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,540
Your Highness.

260
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:11,900
Why are you...?

261
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,310
I wanted to feel

262
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:17,110
what it was like to be dead.

263
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,140
Someone wanted me dead.

264
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,190
Are you referring

265
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,260
to the assassin of the banquet?

266
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,710
No.

267
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,500
It was a female.

268
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,310
She was so tough.

269
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,430
Only after being stabbed

270
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,830
seventeen times did she die.

271
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,310
I don't understand what you mean.

272
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,540
Don't you know who she was, Miss Ye?

273
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,660
Your Highness, you overestimated me.

274
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,190
I was not in your dream.

275
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,590
How could I know who she was?

276
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:02,830
Right.

277
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,620
Right.

278
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,110
You are right, Miss Ye.

279
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:43,140
She was the one who wanted to kill me.

280
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,950
I worry her hatred

281
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,860
will linger and haunt me.

282
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,230
So...

283
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,260
So

284
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,470
I want you...

285
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,100
to help me get her heart out

286
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,630
and bury it here.

287
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,910
You can perform a ritual

288
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,710
to keep her hatred

289
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,230
away from me.

290
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,470
Go.

291
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,020
There it is. Get her heart out.

292
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,230
Do it!

293
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,230
Wait.

294
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,390
No.

295
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,470
Why?

296
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,150
I don't know

297
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,780
who told you about it,

298
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,820
but the person
only told you the first part.

299
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,870
There is a second part.

300
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,470
To do this,

301
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,230
you also need to smear your blood

302
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,340
all over her body.

303
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,670
It is a vicious

304
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,710
and sinful act,

305
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,260
which will do you harm.

306
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,580
Are you sure about it?

307
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,260
You are saying...

308
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,260
I have another way.

309
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,060
Ask your guards

310
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,470
to send the body to my house.

311
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:24,910
At noon tomorrow,

312
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,020
I will perform a ritual
to expel the evil spirit.

313
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:37,910
Your Majesty,

314
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,670
I suggest it is necessary

315
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,630
to interrogate all personnel

316
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,500
of Yitai Gambling House.

317
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,340
It's fine.

318
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,430
Minister Yuan,

319
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,100
tell me,

320
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:48,910
what did you do

321
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,740
with the money from the gambling house?

322
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,100
Your Majesty,

323
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,340
the profit of the gambling house

324
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:55,820
was handed to the Governor of Bianzhou,

325
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,780
Sun Haozhi.

326
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,260
Sun Haozhi?

327
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,020
Is he the mentee

328
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,100
you promoted a lot,

329
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,540
Mr. Mei?

330
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,950
Why do it

331
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,430
with no personal gain?

332
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,230
You are ganging up on others!

333
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,670
Mr. Li, please calm down

334
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,910
and hear me out.

335
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,190
Your Majesty,

336
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,630
Bianzhou suffered
from a locust plague in late summer.

337
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,150
The public barn and salt granary
were both in a critical state.

338
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,500
After I learned about it,

339
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,190
I eased the situation
with the profit of the gambling house.

340
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,390
Sun Haozhi

341
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,910
bought grain and salt

342
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,150
in the name of the imperial court

343
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,020
to support those affected.

344
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,300
They were grateful
for the kindness of Your Majesty.

345
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,060
Now I remember.

346
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,820
Minister Yuan did tell me

347
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,910
about doing business

348
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,230
instead of providing relief previously.

349
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,150
I accepted his suggestion.

350
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,260
So the business

351
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,950
was a gambling house.

352
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,300
I was not thoughtful enough.

353
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,020
I should be punished, Your Majesty.

354
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,020
You had my permission

355
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,670
to act for the public.

356
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,580
I won't hold you responsible,

357
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,060
but from now on, the gambling house

358
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,470
should be handed back
to the businessman.

359
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,060
Yes, Your Majesty.

360
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,300
However, about the banquet,

361
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,710
you need to give me

362
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,190
an explanation.

363
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,340
I was out for only a few days,

364
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,180
and now everything is in chaos.

365
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,540
Minister Yuan,

366
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,430
is this what you want to show me?

367
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,710
The assassination of the envoy

368
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,300
is a disgrace to Great Feng.

369
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,470
Since you are involved,

370
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,820
you will be suspended
for further investigation.

371
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,910
Before it is over, you cannot enter
the Court of Judicial Review

372
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,870
or assign any task to any constable.

373
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,990
As you said, Your Majesty.

374
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,780
Your Majesty is wise.

375
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:50,870
In seven days,

376
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,630
I need to see the evidence.

377
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:54,540
Yes, Your Majesty.

378
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,990
I will send people

379
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,740
to question the lowlifes
of Mang Gutter further.

380
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,540
Mr. Mei,

381
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,670
you should assist
with the investigation, too.

382
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,430
I will do my best.

383
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,500
Your Majesty,

384
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:16,990
about the banquet,

385
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,390
- I'd like to...
- Didn't you hear me?

386
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,150
You are suspended.

387
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:21,710
You may leave.

388
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:24,710
Yes, Your Majesty.

389
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,390
I heard

390
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,910
that Ye Ping'an is treating

391
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:35,990
Li Zongxu.

392
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,630
Is that true?

393
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,230
Yes.

394
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,470
Mr. Hai mentioned it.

395
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,390
Send her

396
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,710
a phoenix flagon as a gift.

397
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,910
Tell her

398
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,630
it's not necessary
to thank me in person.

399
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:55,580
Yes, Your Majesty.

400
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,630
This is such a beautiful flower.

401
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,300
There is no evil spirit

402
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,780
or demon,

403
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,580
but lies

404
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,740
that you made up

405
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,230
to approach me.

406
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,540
It is you

407
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,060
who are haunting me,

408
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:36,870
and who should have died

409
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,740
over a decade ago.

410
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,390
The action was a failure,

411
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,300
so Ye Ping'an is worthless now.

412
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,500
She is a risk.

413
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,990
If she stays alive for another day,

414
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,740
we will be in greater danger.

415
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,260
Spread the word

416
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,500
and let Li Zongxu's spy

417
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,630
know about it.

418
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:17,630
Yes, sir.

419
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,390
Master,

420
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,340
our spy sent an urgent message.

421
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,340
He said

422
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,500
it was very important.

423
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,100
Ye Ping'an's background is suspicious.

424
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,230
She might come from Tongquan.

425
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,470
Censor's case?

426
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,500
I didn't expect

427
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,990
anyone involved in the censor's case

428
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,670
to be alive.

429
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,300
Du Liang was sloppy.

430
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:49,990
Ye Ping'an,

431
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,580
you are a toy to me.

432
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,020
You were,

433
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,300
you are,

434
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,300
and you will be.

435
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,430
You a group of lowlifes

436
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,100
want to win against me?

437
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,260
So pathetic.

438
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,870
You can only hide

439
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,340
the jade statue of your mother secretly

440
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,390
in somewhere no one sees.

441
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,820
Have you ever thought about
what she was thinking

442
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,580
when you knelt in front of her?

443
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,580
She was thinking

444
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,230
why her son

445
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,020
would be

446
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,540
such a disgusting monster.

447
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,910
Ye Ping'an,

448
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,740
you two were like sisters, right?

449
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,150
Since you can't bear to see her go,

450
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,950
I will make your wish come true.

451
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,430
You can be her company.

452
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:16,470
Bury them!

453
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,430
Yes, sir.

454
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:19,710
Go.

455
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:21,710
Where's Ping'an?

456
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,150
She is supposed to be in here.

457
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,340
Where is she?

458
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:25,470
She...

459
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,150
Go ahead.

460
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:28,780
She...

461
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:29,470
She...

462
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,230
She said she wanted to get a baozi,

463
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,300
so she went to the shop.

464
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:33,300
I will check on her

465
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:33,990
and see what she is doing.

466
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,470
Stop.

467
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:36,780
Where did you learn this?

468
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:37,990
So now, you are also

469
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:38,670
lying to me?

470
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:39,670
Be honest.

471
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:40,670
Did Ping'an ask you

472
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,430
to keep it from me?

473
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,020
Where did she go?

474
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,540
She didn't want you to worry.

475
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,060
She went to see Li Zongxu.

476
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,540
When did she leave?

477
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,390
We should find her now!

478
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,870
[Langya Mansion]
It's almost two hours.

479
00:25:59,390 --> 00:25:59,950
If anything happened,

480
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,150
Ping'an would leave a clue.

481
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,470
Let's split up.

482
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:03,020
Okay.

483
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,150
Mrs. Gu,

484
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,430
look at this.

485
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,500
It's the powder Ping'an used.

486
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,390
Something went wrong

487
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,020
before she entered here.

488
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,780
That was why she left the clue
in a hurry.

489
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,260
There must be more of it.

490
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,740
We need to follow the mark.

491
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:19,740
Let's go.

492
00:26:59,430 --> 00:26:59,870
Mrs. Gu.

493
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,100
Look.

494
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,100
Why would Ping'an leave town?

495
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,540
We should follow

496
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,430
this direction.

497
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,270
You did a lot

498
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,670
these days.

499
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:18,990
What's wrong?

500
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,230
You can't walk anymore

501
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,030
after the little work you did?

502
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,510
We dug a big hole

503
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,750
and buried the bodies.

504
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:26,990
He didn't even

505
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,780
leave us some horses.

506
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,060
Watch your mouth.

507
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,380
You know what kind of person Mr. Li is.

508
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,300
If he hears what you said,

509
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,030
we might have to

510
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,340
bury you next.

511
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,140
Look at how scared he is.

512
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:42,990

[Tomb of Cailian]

581
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:54,990
Mr. Gu,

582
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,670
may you rest in peace.

583
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,220
I found a place

584
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,220
out of town.

585
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,580
Bai Sheng has packed everything.

586
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,030
We are leaving tomorrow.

587
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:45,790
I'm tired.

588
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:48,470
I don't want my child

589
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,220
exposed

590
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,390
to these killings.

591
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,540
How about revenge for Mr. Gu?

592
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,830
He didn't die in peace.

593
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,620
Li Zongxu didn't pay

594
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,910
his price.

595
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:09,510
You have no right to mention Mr. Gu.

596
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:12,060
He could have enjoyed
the rest of his life,

597
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,790
but you were stubborn

598
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,350
and had to fight those noble families.

599
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:16,990
That was why

600
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,790
it ended up like this.

601
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:22,030
Mr. Gu didn't get killed by anyone else,

602
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,180
but by your ambition!

603
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,790
Calm down.

604
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,350
Calm down?

605
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,030
How?

606
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,060
Our background decides

607
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,350
that we are not the same

608
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,870
as those of the upper class.

609
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,740
We only live

610
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,430
for a few decades.

611
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:43,660
There's nothing wrong with giving up

612
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:45,700
or accepting our fate.

613
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:47,660
You can do whatever you want,

614
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:48,950
but this is my choice.

615
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,620
The enemies are watching me,

616
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,580
desperate to find

617
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,310
my weakness

618
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,740
and kill me.

619
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,620
They are not going to spare me.

620
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:01,740
Do you think

621
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,260
they will spare you?

622
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,100
This is way too dangerous.

623
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,510
Dangerous?

624
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:14,060
Staying with you puts us in danger.

625
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:15,510
It means

626
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,060
constant worries.

627
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,790
Bai Sheng and I are leaving.

628
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,260
If you dare to stop us,

629
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,220
don't blame me for what happens next.

630
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:26,950
Hesheng!

631
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,100
All I want you to know

632
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,430
is that brothers

633
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,180
and families

634
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,350
are everything to me.

635
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,060
Li Zongxu didn't have

636
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:52,950
any suspicions before.

637
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,830
Why all of a sudden, he realized

638
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,100
you were involved in the censor's case?

639
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:00,140
Maybe he figured it out by himself,

640
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,220
or maybe

641
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:03,990
there is someone behind him.

642
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,950
If that's the case,

643
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,990
that person is even more cunning

644
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:08,870
than Li Zongxu.

645
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,620
That's it.

646
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,700
That's it?

647
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,540
Then Cailian died in vain!

648
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,580

649
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,790
to make us go further.

650
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,660
We haven't got justice,

651
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,390
and the villains are still alive.

652
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:22,350
I will not stop here.

653
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,140
What if I say

654
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:26,950
I want to?

655
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:31,950
We've gone so far.

656
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,740
Are you really giving up now?

657
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,790
Cailian met the one she loved

658
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:37,790
and was about to start

659
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:38,870
a new life.

660
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,950
But now,

661
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,310
everything is gone with the wind.

662
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,220
I feel sorry for her.

663
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:47,870
Is that so

664
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:49,990
or are you scared?

665
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,910
Do you still remember

666
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,060
why you came to us in the first place?

667
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,260
You are right.

with hatred for so long.

669
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,700
I'm scared that I won't have time

670
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,060
to experience the beauty of the world.

671
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,100

They told me

674
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,060
the scenery was gorgeous in Yangzhou.

675
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:21,060

Everyone

678
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,870
should live for themselves.

Fate gathers us,

680
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:31,990

00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,620
that it was Yuan Shaocheng

695
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:28,990
who sent the assassins.

696
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,580
Why does he hate us so much?

697
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,100
He is on the side of the Wu family,
