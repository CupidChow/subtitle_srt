195
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,630
Please don't, General Wu.

196
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,470
The salt sacks there

197
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,040
are all sand.

198
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:06,960
Wenyu.

199
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,440
Since no one believes

200
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,960
what we said,

201
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,350
I guess it has to be seen.

202
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,160
General Wu, now,

203
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:51,920
you can

204
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,040
rest assured, right?

205
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,800
He is eager to prove himself.

206
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,200
It's understandable.

207
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,960
I understand.

208
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:02,920
Mr. Yuan,

209
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,590
we haven't finished drinking.

210
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,200
I wanted to toast you.

211
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,590
You haven't had a single sip.

212
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,350
General Wu,

213
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,510
let's

214
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,960
go back for drinking.

215
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,320
Please.

216
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,230
Excuse me.

217
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,680
- Take care.
- Take care.

218
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,440
Why the look?

219
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,200
It has nothing to do with me.

220
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,350
How did they know

221
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,060
our actions?

222
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,700
In an instant,

223
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,300
they swapped sand back to salt.

224
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:46,490
Great.

225
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,300
Now we've alerted them.

226
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,580
From now on,

227
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,700
it will be even harder

228
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:52,850
to confirm their crimes.

229
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,130
It's okay.

230
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,850
They will show their true colors.

231
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,940
What you're best at

232
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,420
is waiting for the right time, isn't it?

233
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,850
Then let's see

234
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,180
whether they or I

235
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,770
will last to the end.

236
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:12,850
Sir,

237
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:14,100
Her Majesty

238
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,370
questioned people from
the Directorate for Palace Buildings.

239
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:16,850
There should be a conclusion

240
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,010
on the Tiansheng Tower construction.

241
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:18,770
Okay.

242
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:42,350
[Tomb of Cailian]

243
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,730
Danxin, where have you been?

244
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,340
Aunt,

245
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:09,940
if you're here

246
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,420
to speak for Ping'an,

247
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,180
don't bother.

248
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,820
Her mistakes were unintentional.

249
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,580
You've come this far together.

250
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,100
Aren't the things she's done for you

251
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,490
enough to atone for her sins?

252
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,300
You want me to forgive her.

253
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,100
Then would the women
who died because of her

254
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:27,940
forgive her?

255
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,650
Du Liang, Li Zongxu, and Hai Yiping

256
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:31,650
are sinners,

257
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,060
whom we need to punish.

258
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,940
But what is Ye Ping'an then?

259
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,300
She was deceived back then.

260
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,010
Du Liang led a group to hunt her down.

261
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,700
Her parents also died because of this.

262
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,340
She was a victim too.

263
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,010
She's been working hard

264
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,420
to make up for her mistakes.

265
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:49,820
She gave her everything

266
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,650
for the censor case.

267
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,100
You've seen it all,

268
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,610
right?

269
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,700
No matter what happened,

270
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,850
you two are still sisters.

271
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,730
Go home with me.

272
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,130
Home?

273
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,420
Mother.

Look,

00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:10,730
is it beautiful?

277
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:11,700
Yes.

278
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,340
Put it on.

279
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:12,700
Okay.

280
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:16,650
Looks great.

281
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:17,490
Does it smell good?

282
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:18,490
Yes.

283
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,010

284
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,980

Go.

00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:25,730

when I fainted.

00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,530
I always thought

289
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,060
it was bandits who drugged me

290
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,940
until I learned the truth.

291
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,530
Then I recalled before I fainted,

292
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,890
I did see

00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,220

00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,860
Still unsolvable.

386
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,050
Mrs. Gu,

387
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,810
if you had to

388
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,490
choose between them,

389
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,420
who would you stand by?

390
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:51,620
I can't.

391
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,090
I'm Ping'an's aunt.

392
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:56,290
But I also genuinely

393
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,770
see Danxin as family.

394
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:01,970
Hai Yiping

395
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,410
is much more devious than Du Liang,

396
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,100
Mrs. Gu.

397
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:06,060
What I'm going to say

398
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,290
may upset you,

399
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,170
but staying by Ping'an's side

400
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,930
won't really help her.

401
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,180
Du Liang

402
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,250
has taken action against you.

403
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,380
If Hai Yiping

404
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,570
does it too,

405
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,250
whether it's Ping'an or Danxin,

406
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,010
it will only make their situations

407
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:20,940
even more perilous.

408
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,980
Follow me back to the sect.

409
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,380
Ask Master to resolve

410
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,380
this crisis for them.

411
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,620
Meet me at the bridge
at Mang Gutter at dusk.

412
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,250
[Court of Judicial Review]
Mr. Zhao, you're righteous

413
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,250
and concerned for the people.

414
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,180
I truly admire you.

415
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,420
Thank you

416
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,530
for speaking up
for the people of Mang Gutter.

417
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,330
No need to thank me.

418
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,730
I couldn't do much

419
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:17,980
in my humble position.

420
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,460
It was the Prince of Kangping

421
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,490
who wrote a memorial saying

422
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,140
if the Mang Gutter people were sent
to build the Tiansheng Tower,

423
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,180
the officials who discriminated
against poor people

424
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,380
would undercut their wages,

425
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,660
not caring if they died from exhaustion

426
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,220
or sickness.

427
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,570
But adding supervisors

428
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,090
would create bureaucracy

429
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,860
and increase the cost of construction.

430
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,290
[Zhao Feng, Vice Minister of Justice]

431
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,570
That would bring more harm than good.

432
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:39,570
That's why

433
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,090
Her Majesty has stopped
sending people from Mang Gutter

434
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,290
to build the tower.

435
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,380
Take care.

436
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,050
The Prince of Kangping?

437
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,090
Shaocheng!

438
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:56,940
You know what?

439
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,490
I've told them they don't need

440
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,330
to build the tower.

441
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,860
They were so happy

442
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,010
that they almost tossed me in the air.

443
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,330
Let's go back
to the Mang Gutter for a drink.

444
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:05,980
I need to

445
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,620
go to Hai Mansion in a bit.

446
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,980
Lu Danxin was trapped

447
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,490
and captured by Hai Yiping last night.

448
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,050
I need to check on this.

449
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,140
What?

450
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:17,460
Captured?

451
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,010
I just saw her

452
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:19,620
at Mang Gutter.

453
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,490
You

454
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:22,770
must be mistaken.

455
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,010
I have eyes.

456
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,180
She was with someone,

457
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,660
so I didn't greet her.

458
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,420
She was on the bridge.

459
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:30,980
Seems

460
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,570
she was waiting for someone.

461
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,290
Father, look.

462
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:41,940
Mother.

463
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:43,570
Wow,

464
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,810
it's great.

465
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,090
Erya.

466
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,050
How do you read this line?

467
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,180
First comes filial piety,
then sincerity and trust.

468
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:57,420
Welcome back.

469
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,180
Mother.

470
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,570
Father caught a lot of fish today.

471
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,010
Really?

472
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,250
Look.

473
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:04,570
Did you have fun

474
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,380
with your father, Xin?

475
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,090
Yes.

476
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:09,700
Here.

477
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,420
Time for dinner.

478
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,660
Father, come and eat.

479
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,330
Coming.

480
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,700
I'll serve you food.

481
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:27,730
Danxin.

482
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,530
Do you know why

483
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,460
I asked to meet here?

484
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,900
Because I've decided

485
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:47,730
what price

486
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,010
I want you to pay.

487
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,050
I knew...

488
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,860
this was going to happen.

489
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,530
You know

490
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,860
you should be held accountable
for the censor case,

491
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,140
and yet you dare meet me here.

492
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:20,730
Do you really think

493
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,460
I won't do anything to you?

494
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:33,250
Where's your dagger?

495
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,380
Take it out.

496
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,810
To fight you?

497
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,570
I won't.

498
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,250
Even if you're going to kill me.

499
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:51,980
Danxin...

500
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,220
This arrow

501
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,730
was for my mother

502
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,140
and for myself.

503
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,810
But how can I believe

504
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,730
you can harden your heart

505
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,490
and kill Ye Ping'an?

506
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,330
I'll meet Ye Ping'an

507
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,330
at Mang Gutter.

508
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,490
And you will see

509
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:52,900
when she faces me,

510
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,730
she'll only feel guilty

511
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,490
and will not resist at all.

512
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,290
That's a smart choice of location.

513
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,380
Eyes are watching.

514
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,940
Even my people

515
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,140
won't be able to do anything to her.

516
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:12,700
Right?

517
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,660
I will prove
my sincerity in cooperation.

518
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:16,140
But

519
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,290
before I get what I need,

520
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,090
she must stay alive.

521
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:22,980
Mrs. Gu!

522
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:24,900
Mrs. Gu!

523
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:34,330
Be careful.

524
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,810
Luckily, this arrow

525
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,050
didn't hit a vital spot.

526
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:48,620
Where's your medicine?

527
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:49,980
Is it at the clinic?

528
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,140
I'll get it.

529
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,900
Over in the cabinet,

530
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,940
there are bandages and medicine.

531
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:12,730
Ping'an,

532
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,380
I don't want

533
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:15,770
and can't bear to see

534
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,050
you turn on each other.

535
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,050
I can only leave

536
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,220
so I won't burden you.

537
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,330
You avoid speaking of it,

538
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,180
yet the heartache has run deep

539
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,090
and tortured you every year

540
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,380
and every day.

541
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,010
You can't hide it from me.

542
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,730
Few in this world

543
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,660
can cure that heartache.

544
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,330
The one who can cure you

545
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:38,940
is only yourself.

546
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,250
I am not capable.

547
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,220
I only hope that one day,

548
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,620
you won't hate yourself anymore

549
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,860
and find peace and joy.

550
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,050
Farewell.

551
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,140
Yuan Shaocheng.

552
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,180
Now everyone

553
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,570
has left me.

554
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,730
Even my closest ones.

555
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,290
When I closed down

556
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,380
the Longmen Arena,

557
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:19,900
the Mang Gutter people

558
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,050
also distanced themselves from me.

559
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,250
Now,

560
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,860
you also know

561
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,490
I'm a culprit of the censor case.

562
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,730
Don't you hate me?

563
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,730
The more they don't know you,

564
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,460
the more terrifying
they'll think you are

565
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,660
and the more they gossip.

566
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,540
I crawled up from the bottom.

567
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,490
I don't care

568
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,690
what you did in the past.

569
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,740
I only believe in the person
you are now.

00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,420
and always see the bigger picture.

766
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,690
Everyone has personal biases.

767
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,380
Not just you,

768
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,570
I do too.

769
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,860
Before ascending to the throne,

770
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,740
I endured

771
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,090
countless agonies.

772
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,010
To be fair to all people,

773
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:32,300
you must abandon personal attachments.

774
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:34,980
I have a grievance to present.

775
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,050
I beg to see Your Majesty.

776
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:38,930
Ye Ping'an,

777
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,890
no shouting here.

778
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,340
If you disturb Her Majesty,

779
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,660
you'll be beheaded.

780
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,290
Even so,

781
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,090
I won't leave.

782
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:47,210
Your Majesty,

783
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:48,820
the censor's case from over a decade ago

784
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:49,490
was a wrongful case.

785
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,130
Li Zongxu

786
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,210
was one of the major criminals.

787
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,380
The Seven-Petal Epiphyllum mark

788
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,570
I'm holding

789
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,090
is proof of his torture

790
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:57,610
of countless innocent women.

791
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,570
Ye Ping'an

792
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:00,620
is just as reckless

793
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:01,950
as you.

794
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,350
Your Majesty.

795
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:07,990
Say no more.

796
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,470
Expel her.

797
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:10,310
Yes.

798
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,260
There's another matter.

799
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:13,700
The Imperial Guards reports

800
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,220
Li Zongxu has woken up.

801
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,540
Good.

802
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:17,990
Ask them

803
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,220
to question Li Zongxu.

804
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,470
Give him a scare.

805
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:23,580
Do you understand?

806
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:24,620
Yes.

807
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,510
Over the years,

808
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,660
Li Zongxu has engaged
in corrupt trade for profit.

809
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,350
This is

810
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,740
the perfect time to make him

811
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,140
surrender his illicit wealth.

812
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,950
Killing someone is effortless for me.

813
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,660
But how

814
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:43,910
and when to kill

815
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,430
must be carefully considered.

816
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,100
I failed to understand
Your Majesty's difficulties.

817
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:50,540
It was my fault.

818
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,060
Enough.

819
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,580
Listen.

820
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,060
While investigating Hai Yiping,

821
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,790
you must check everything by yourself.

822
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,220
Until you uncover

823
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,220
all the corrupt officials
colluding with him,

824
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,430
do not act recklessly.

825
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:03,950
Besides,

826
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,390
stay away

827
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,140
from Ye Ping'an.

828
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:09,390
Yes.

829
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,060
You

830
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,310
still have a long way to go.

831
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:55,880
[Court of Judicial Review]

832
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:05,830
Mr. Hai.

833
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,260
Mr. Guo.

834
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:09,700
Mr. Hai,

835
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,870
[Guo Yu, Minister of the Court]
May I know what case

836
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,220
brings you here?

837
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:14,620
You know

838
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,660
I am a curious person.

839
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:18,830
Besides,

840
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,620
this involves an old friend of mine.

841
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,790
If this lady hadn't come to me,

842
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,260
I would never have imagined

843
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,470
that this old case

844
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,310
concealed

845
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,140
so many astonishing secrets.

846
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,470
Which old case?

847
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:33,790
This is the complaint.

848
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:36,100
I accuse Lu Liang,

849
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,470
the former Tongquan County Constable,

850
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:38,910
who conspired
with his advisor Zheng Yuan

851
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:39,950
and the bandit Qi Junshan,

852
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,220
of abducting young women

853
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,430
and framing

854
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,700
Yu Qian, the then Monitor Censor,

855
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,030
leading to

856
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,220
over 130 deaths

857
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,510
and causing
a massive miscarriage of justice.

858
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,140
Who are you?

859
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,060
Do you know the consequences

860
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,260
of false accusations?

861
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:07,390
I am

862
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,830
a survivor of the censor case,

863
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:09,870
one of

864
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,220
the many unfortunate women.

865
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,180
If I utter a single lie,

866
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,030
my head

867
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,470
is yours to claim.

868
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,220
You may rise.

869
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,030
After so many years,

870
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,790
how can you prove

871
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,140
you're a survivor of the case?

872
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:30,580
Mr. Guo,

873
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,390
when she came to me,

874
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,430
I wasn't sure either.

875
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:34,580
After all,

876
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,060
this case involves many officials.

877
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:36,790
Therefore,

878
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,470
I questioned her about her experience.

879
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,470
She described everything

880
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:42,060
down to the smallest detail.

881
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:43,950
Her words were filled
with grief and pain.

882
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,180
Only then did I begin to believe her.

883
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:47,830
Of course,

884
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,390
you are the main judge of the case.

885
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,540
The truth of the matter

886
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,310
will be for you to decide.

887
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,790
You said that Yu Qian

888
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,470
was framed by Du Liang.

889
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,140
Do you have any evidence?

890
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,470
Du Liang had destroyed all the evidence.

891
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,990
He even became
Director of the Ministry of Revenue.

892
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,310
So all these years,

893
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,180
I never dared to report it.

894
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,990
Du Liang is now dead.

895
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,350
I've just had the courage
to step forward.

896
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,350
I managed to approach

897
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:18,620
the honorable Mr. Hai.

898
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,540
Had Mr. Hai not sheltered me

899
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,350
and agreed to redress my injustice,

900
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:23,790
today,

901
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,350
I would not be able

902
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,030
to stand here.

903
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,310
Go to the archives

904
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,140
and fetch the censor case file.

905
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:30,180
Yes.

906
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:30,620
Wait.

907
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,700
Mr. Guo, there's another thing.

908
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:33,950
After the case was closed,

909
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:34,790
someone claiming to be

910
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:36,430
a relative of a victim approached me

911
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,390
and asked to review the case file.

912
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,030
So I retrieved it for him.

913
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,260
But unfortunately,

914
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,700
he knocked over a candle stand

915
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:44,950
and set the chamber on fire.

916
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:47,350
The entire case file

917
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,180
was burned to ashes.

918
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,700
In that case,

919
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,470
there is no physical evidence.

920
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:57,700
With no proof,

921
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,580
no matter how convincing your words are,

922
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,830
we can't convict
based solely on your testimony.

923
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:04,790
Another person

924
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,310
can prove the censor case
was a wrong conviction.

925
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:06,910
She

926
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:08,350
was also a witness.

927
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:09,220
Who is it?

928
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:11,790
Psychiatric Commissioner,

929
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,390
Ye Ping'an.

930
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,660
Why do I feel like

931
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,430
I've seen this before?

932
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,390
I remember now.

933
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:57,470
After the military fund case,

934
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:58,510
you didn't know

935
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,790
whether to save Ye Ping'an.

936
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:01,620
You had this exact same look.

937
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,510
It's different this time.

938
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,140
Now,

939
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,030
I'm standing

940
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,620
on a square stone platform.

941
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,870
The wind is strong, but I stand firm.

942
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:14,220
If I choose to help her now...

943
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,580
I will be gambling

944
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,740
everything I have.

945
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:29,910
Let it decide

946
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:31,260
like last time.

947
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,100
If it lands on the side with words,
you help her.

948
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:34,430
Without words,

949
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,580
you do nothing.

950
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,400
♪Past events turn to ash,
crushed into mud♪

951
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,830
