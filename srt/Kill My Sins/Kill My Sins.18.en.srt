End him!

5
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,530
He's so heartless.

Mother,

00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,220
I got you involved in this.

I'm proud of you.

Make sure

Do you understand?

36
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,340
Once the tower is built,

37
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,060
will we really get fully paid?

38
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,220
Sure.

39
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,220
As long as you

40
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,850
don't slack off even for a moment

45
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,020
- Yes.
- Exactly.

46
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:06,900
- Yeah.
- Right.

47
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,460
You've been too overly protected

48
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,250

Do you remember who you are?

If illness causes a delay,

00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,060
that's a serious crime.

Directorate for the Palace Buildings

They say there aren't enough workers,

76

from Mang Gutter to help.

Mr. Yuan, where are you going?

You're not planning to confront him,

81
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,570
It's not his idea.

82
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,500

and you haven't recovered.

Someone,

87
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,370
bring a brazier for Mr. Yuan.

89
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,100
Why put it so close to him?

90

What if a spark

catches Mr. Yuan?

92
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:48,540
Move it farther away.

93
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:48,980
Yes.

94
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:55,570
Mr. Hai,

95
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,570
I heard
the Directorate for the Palace Buildings

96
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,500
drafted the people from Mang Gutter

97
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,180
to build Tiansheng Tower.

98
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,620
They are treated as inferior.

99
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:08,740
Her Majesty sympathizes with them,

100
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,420
allowing them to work for wages.

101
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,570
It's a good thing.

102
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,980
But before spring,

103
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,890
when farmers were sent
to build the Yunze Canal,

104
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:15,980
eleven died

105
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,370
within two months.

106
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,450
The farmers had land,

107
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,130
but the Mang Gutter people do not.

108
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,180
Besides,

109
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:23,060
they won't

110
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,570
be paid

111
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,860
until the work is finished.

112
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,940
Building Tiansheng Tower will take

113
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,330
at least two or three months.

114
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,500
If the young people leave,

115
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,250
how will their families

116
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:33,980
survive?

117
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,660
Actually,

118
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,210
there's still room to discuss.

119
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,540
I've already removed the obstacles

120
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,130
blocking your door.

121
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,660
Why are you still

122
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,420
using Mang Gutter people to pressure me?

123
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,620
You handled Li Zongxu's matters

124
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,180
pretty well.

125
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,860
But more than your abilities,

126
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,180

I have high hopes for you,

129
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,500
and I believe you were just
momentarily confused

130
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,180
so you hesitated

131
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,250
about getting rid of Ye Ping'an.

132
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,620
If you want to play the game,

133
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,370
you first have to learn

134
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,690
how to be a good piece on the board.

135
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,980
I have never hesitated,

136
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:14,940
and I won't

137
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,210
let you down.

138
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,570
But

139
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,620
Her Majesty holds Ye Ping'an
in high regard.

140
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:22,860
If we want to eliminate her,

141
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,570
we must take it slowly
and plan carefully.

142
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:25,860
With time,

143
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,100

If you ask me,

165

and see

166

what they're really up to.

167

If there's anything shady,

168
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,740
it wouldn't be on the official ledger.

169
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,450
There should be a secret ledger.

No problem.

178

00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,060
to you.

195
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,090
He's my uncle.

196
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,090
That's why I work here.

197
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,420
You're a stranger,

198
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,300
and you want to work here too?

199
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,300
Just leave.

200
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,330
Keep the liquor far away from me.

201
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,180
I've been drinking
for two days straight.

202
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,690
Now, just the smell
makes me want to vomit.

203
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,060
I'll make you some hangover soup.

204
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,540
But it wasn't in vain.

205
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:41,690
I found out

206
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,140
the owner of Jinlu Pawnshop

207
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,090
is the disciple of Gong Shao,

208
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,140
the magistrate of Dongqiao Salt Granary.

209
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,850
More interestingly,

210
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,090
guess who

211
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,260
recommended Gong Shao

212
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,850
for the position?

213
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,730
It's related to salt.

214
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,140
Could it be

215
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,300
the Li family?

216
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,380
No.

217
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,060
It was Minister of Personnel,

218
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,540
Hai Yiping,

219
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,940
Mr. Hai.

220
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,540
When

221
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,810
you saw her,

222
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,140
was your brother

223
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,780
together with her?

224
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,540
Yan is also here?

225
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,490
Let's have some refreshments.

226
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,690
I didn't expect that you'd be set up

227
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,490
right after taking office.

228
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,570
What is this person's agenda?

229
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,260
Is it because of your past dealings

230
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,900
with Du Liang?

231
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,380
Hai Yiping?

232
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,540
But didn't you already find out

233
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,570
he's close friends with Yu Qian?

234
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,450
So what if they're close friends?

235
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,940
Does that mean
they won't turn on each other

236
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,020
over personal interests?

237
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,060
I'm not sure about others,

238
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,490
but we'll never

239
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:54,940
betray each other.

240
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,380
The secret ledger is very crucial.

241
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,450
Keep investigating

Is Miss Ye here?

245
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:07,810
Miss Ye.

246

This is bad.

250

That crazy old man

251
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,660
is missing.

252
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,940
What happened?

253
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,380
After your treatment

254
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,570
for the past few days,

255
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,380
he was able

256
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,260
to take care of himself.

257
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,690
So I let my guard down.

258
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,780
There were many buyers today,

259
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,450
and I didn't close the front

260
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,490
and back doors.

261
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,690
When I finished talking to the buyers,

262
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,140
I called for him
and realized he was missing.

263
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,180
Calm down.

264
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,060
Though his mind isn't clear,

265
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,490
the most likely places he'll go

266
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,060
are the ones he used to go before.

I first met him.

Where else could he have gone?

Warm wontons.

00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,780
You know her?

387
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,470
I don't.

388
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:14,990
It was just a guess.

389
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,350
My daughter...

390
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,660
was wronged.

391
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,380
I'll clear her name.

392
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,350
I can help you,

393
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,590
but you have to tell me

394
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,260
what happened

395
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,140
to your daughter.

396
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:43,740
She's dead.

397
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,900
She was burned alive.

398
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,620
Many years ago,

399
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,350
your daughter went missing.

400
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,630
One day, you suddenly learned

401
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,710
she was kidnapped
into an abandoned house.

402
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,020
Before she could be rescued,

403
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,430
she was burned to death

404
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,430
in the fire.

405
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,230
Am I right?

406
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,100
Nod if I am.

407
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,190
Yes.

408
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,430
You came to the capital
around that time?

409
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,780
I sold my cattle and sheep,

410
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,100
exchanged them for money, and came here.

411
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,540
[Ministry of Justice]

412
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,580
But...

413
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,150
The censor's case is final.

414
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,100
The criminal, Yu Qian, has confessed.

415
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,540
What further grievance do you have?

416
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,260
Sir,

417
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,470
this case is not

418
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,990
the work of Yu Qian alone.

419
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,150
After my daughter went missing,

420
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,950
I reported it
to County Constable Du Liang,

421
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,580
but he refused to take it.

422
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,630
There's definitely something fishy here.

423
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,500
How dare you!

424
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,580
You have no evidence.

425
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,870
How dare you slander an official?

426
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:54,870
Get out of here now!

427
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,670
There's more to this than meets the eye.

428
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,710
I want to see the official!

429
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,910
let me see the official!

430
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,990
If you keep causing trouble,

431
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,340
you'll be beheaded!

432
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,740
I won't leave!

433
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,340
I must clear my daughter's name!

434
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,470
I want to see the official!

435
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,260
My money ran out soon.

436
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,300
To survive,

437
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,020
I had to work for others.

438
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,260
I fed pigs

439
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,340
and sheep.

440
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,190
I even

441
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,390
stopped carriages.

442
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,500
I stopped the officials' carriages
to plead for justice.

443
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,230
I begged them for help,

444
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,060
but

445
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,670
no one did.

446
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,150
Then...

447
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,500
- Then...
-Then,

448
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,260
you turned to Hai Yiping,

449
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,430
right?

450
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,020
You mentioned the candle

451
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,740
and said you didn't start the fire.

452
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,390
Is it related

453
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,300
to the burning of the censor's case files?

454
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,390
Hai Yiping...

455
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:56,870
I remember now.

456
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,820
They say he is a good man,

457
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,500
someone who can bring justice.

458
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,630
You want to clear your daughter's name?

459
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,230
Yes.

460
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,150
Please, help me.

461
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,740
Help my poor daughter.

462
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,260
I beg you.

463
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:10,910
Please don't.

464
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:11,780
Come on.

465
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,670
Please rise.

466
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:14,870
I'll

467
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,100
ask someone
to help retrieve the case files

468
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,910
and see if we can find any clues.

469
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,470
Rest in the guest room for now.

470
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,430
Thank you, Mr. Hai.

471
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,780
I appreciate it.

472
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,390
Please have some tea.

473
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:28,990
No.

474
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:29,820
I'm just a rough man.

475
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,150
How can I drink such fine tea?

476
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,230
This is how my master

477
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:32,990
treats guests.

478
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,580
If you don't drink,

479
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,710
others will think

480
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,500
he looks down on you.

481
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,150
I'm truly fortunate

482
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,630
to meet someone as great

483
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,540
as Mr. Hai.

484
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,100
Mr. Hai.

485
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,190
Sir,

486
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,740
this is the

487
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,540
file of the censor's case.

488
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,150
Take your time.

489
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,100
I have other guests to attend to.

490
00:19:59,300 --> 00:19:59,710
Alright.

491
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,190
Thank you, Mr. Hai.

492
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,150
After drinking the tea,

493
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,820
I felt dizzy.

494
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,630
I thought

495
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,950
I was just exhausted.

496
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,390
Before I fell asleep,

497
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,100
I clearly remember blowing out the candle.

498
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:20,500
However...

499
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:25,990
The case file!

500
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,950
Someone, help!

501
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,630
Put out the fire!

502
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,300
You're responsible for this!

503
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,100
The case file is burned!

504
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,870
Someone, help!

505
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,340
Help!

506
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,190
Hurry up!

507
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,260
Put out the fire!

508
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,430
The file...

509
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,740
I'm sorry!

510
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,580
It was all my fault!

511
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,390
What's wrong with you?

512
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,020
How could you be so heartless?

513
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,470
Mr. Hai was kind enough to help you,

514
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,540
and you dared

515
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,670
to set fire to the house

516
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,630
and destroy the case file!

517
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:56,950
It was all my fault!

518
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,540
I was to blame.

519
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,990
I don't know why this is happening.

520
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,060
I owe my daughter a lot.

521
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,260
What did you say?

522
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,580
And you're still crying here?

523
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,670
What you've done

524
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,100
will get Mr. Hai in big trouble.

525
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,100
Do you understand?

526
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,820
Alright, enough.

527
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,630
He's also a pitiful man.

528
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,470
Let's not blame him

529
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,780
for setting the fire.

530
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,020
Let him go.

531
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,150
Leave now.

532
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,470
Mr. Hai,

533
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,950
I'm sorry.

534
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,230
Coming.

535
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:28,910
The water's here.

536
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,710
Leave now.

537
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,870
I'm not crazy

538
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,630
or foolish.

539
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,580
I didn't start that fire.

540
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,990
I really didn't!

541
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,020
I know.

542
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,260
I know.

543
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,630
Lian.

544
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,230
You're Lian?

545
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,870
I'm not Lian.

546
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,300
You are.

547
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,500
Look at this wolf fang.

548
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:56,990
I

549
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:57,870
polished this

550
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,500
for you.

551
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,670
It can ward off evil

552
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,580
and keep you safe.

553
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:08,630
My name

554
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,910
is Cailian.

555
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,630
My daughter's name is Chang Lianhua.

556
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,630
Lian,

557
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,990
you've finally come back to see me.

558
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,100
Please, don't leave again.

559
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,390
Oh, my handkerchief...

560
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,230
Hurry, bring it to me.

561
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,430
Alright.

562
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,260
[No haggling]

563
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,230
Why hasn't the assistant come yet?

564
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,300
He's late for too long.

565
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:53,540
Sir,

566
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,100
do you remember me?

567
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,910
I've brought something nice.

568
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,020
Take a look.

569
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:01,870
This jade's quality

570
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,580
is decent.

571
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,540
The gold edge is also

572
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,780
acceptable, I suppose.

573
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:08,500
However,

574
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,710
I can only offer you 100 liang for it.

575
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,870
Look at the craftsmanship.

576
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,470
It should be worth at least 200 liang.

577
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,060
Well, beauty is
in the eye of the beholder.

578
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,190
When it comes to craftsmanship,

579
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,740
it's actually the least valuable part.

580
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,740
This one's good.

581
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,430
Can I trade this with my hairpin?

582
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,470
You really have a good eye.

583
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,990
But this is redeemable pawned.

584
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,500
Without the owner's consent,

585
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,740
I can't sell it.

586
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,100
But the more I look at it,
the more I like it.

587
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,230
Can you help me arrange
a meeting with the owner?

588
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,430
I'm sure we can negotiate the price.

589
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,470
Please wait a moment.

590
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:04,750
[Ledger]

591
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:08,820
Look at this one.

592
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,020
This one is non-redeemable.

593
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,340
Look at its color.

594
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,390
It is so even.

595
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,100
Listen to this sound,

596
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,260
so crisp.

597
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,580
If you like it,

598
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,340
you can trade your hairpin

599
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,740
for this piece of porcelain.

600
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:21,710
Let me see.

601
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,870
When did you come in?

602
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,230
Sir,

603
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,020
I've been waiting to pawn my item.

604
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:35,780
Excuse me,

605
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,390
I was here first.

606
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,500
Please wait here

607
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,390
for a while.

608
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:41,820
Let me tell you,

609
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:42,870
everything in my shop

610
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,100
is valuable.

611
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,740
I can't stand any thief.

612
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,820
Why didn't you make a sound
when you came in?

613
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,390
Sir,

614
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,430
be reasonable.

615
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,470
If you hadn't been talking

616
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,470
for so long,

617
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,390
would I have waited this long?

618
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,430
I...

619
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,150
What?

620
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,470
Is this how you do business?

621
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,390
Forget it. I won't deal here.

622
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:56,990
You...

623
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:57,540
Sir,

624
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,100
I think this one's quite good.

625
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,230
I'll trade for this one instead.

626
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,100
Here you go.

627
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:03,540
Really?

628
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,430
Yeah.

629
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:05,630
Good.

630
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:08,950
Miss Ye,

631
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,500
who sent

632
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,060
you here?

633
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,300
What case are you handling?

634
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,430
I'm not.

635
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,020
I'm just trading

636
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,260
for something I like.

637
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:20,390
You...

638
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,580
You're actually an official?

639
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,500
Shopkeeper,

640
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,430
you dare take in

641
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,430
this suspicious item?

642
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:29,820
Sir, I suspect

643
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,780
that what this woman has

644
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,340
is stolen.

645
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,060
That's enough.

646
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:38,870
Come with me.

647
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,430
Take the item with you.

648
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,340
Once it's checked,

649
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,430
we'll return it to you.

650
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,540
You were flaunting
your authority in front of me.

651
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,060
Who was it for?

652
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,340
No one's making a show.

653
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,060
I warned you

654
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,230
not to interfere

655
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,260
with the salt issue.

656
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,060
And let me advise you one last time.

657
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,190
After Li Zongxu's matters,

658
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,540
forget about

659
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,230
the censor's case.

660
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,390
Is it

661
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,260
because of Hai Yiping?

662
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,580
You've known all along

663
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,740
he's involved in the case.

664
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,430
No wonder

665
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,820
on Wan'an Mountain,

666
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,950
before I could even question Li Zongxu,

667
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,390
you were eager to have him killed.

668
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,470
No wonder

669
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,260
you didn't let me get involved
in Xu Qing's case.

670
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,670
Since when did you know

671
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,060
Hai Yiping

672
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,540
was involved?

673
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,630
Since the military fund case.

674
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,740
Back then,

675
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,390
you allowed Li Jun to take me away.

676
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,260
I didn't blame you.

677
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,190
I know we were

678
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,230
just using each other.

679
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,580
But later,

680
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,300
you told me

681
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,430
I was your confidant.

682
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,500
What a confidant.

683
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,300
For all this time,

684
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,430
you knew

685
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,540
he was plotting against me,

686
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,190
yet for your own future,

687
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,710
you concealed the truth

688
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,390
and watched me desperately

689
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,580
investigate the censor's case.

690
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,150
Since you understand all this,

691
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:15,990
you should also know

692
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,540
that among all the important matters
in the world,

693
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,060
it is not

694
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,910
the only one that matters.

695
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,060
You can't take

696
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:22,740
this secret ledger with you.

697
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,150
I'm going to return it.

698
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:27,630
How did you know

699
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,670
I would go to the pawnshop today?

700
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:32,710
I see.

701
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,910
You've had people following me,

702
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,340
waiting to snatch the ledger

703
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,430
from my hands,

704
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,630
so you can take credit for it
with Hai Yiping.

705
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,870
Since you've figured it all out,

706
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,020
I have nothing more to explain.

707
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,710
I was naive before.

708
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,340
The path in the official world
is full of obstacles,

709
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,430
and there are no real confidants.

710
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:05,710
Give it to me.

711
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,910
You can't take the secret ledger.

712
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,150
Something worth just a few liang

713
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,150
was pawned for over a thousand.

714
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,540
Clearly, it's being used

715
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,300
as a cover

716
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,150
to withdraw money from the pawnshop.

717
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,020
Give it to me.

718
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,500
Hold it properly.

719
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,230
Don't just give it away to others.

720
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,230
I recently treated a patient

721
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,470
named Chang Qing.

722
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:49,540
To uncover the truth

723
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,740
of his daughter's death

724
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:51,910
and clear the slander

725
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,150
that was pinned on her.

726
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,100
He was driven mad by Hai Yiping

727
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,020
and wandered the capital
for over a decade.

728
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,260
He was just one of those

729
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,950
who had no hope of justice
and lost everything.

730
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,060
Don't become my enemy,

731
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,870
or even you,

732
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,540
I won't show mercy.

733
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,190
So,

734
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,270
what exactly happened today?

735
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,510
The secret ledger

736
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,380
was taken by Yuan Shaocheng.

737
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,580
It's clear that the one behind this,

738
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,780
trying to get rid of me,

739
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,230
is Hai Yiping.

740
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,750
Those who pretend to be kind
are the most horrible.

741
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,510
They're respected by the common people.

742
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,820
If we accuse him of serious crimes,

743
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,750
who would believe us?

744
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,030
Yet Yuan Shaocheng is intent
on protecting him.

745
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,990
He knows so much about us.

746
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:25,990
Aren't we

747
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,380
in great danger?

748
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,470
If he truly wanted to help Hai Yiping,

749
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,030
he would have betrayed us long ago,

750
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,100
but he didn't.

751
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,300
In fact,

752
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,780
he didn't even truly stop me

753
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,510
from reading the ledger.

754
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,990
There must be a reason

755
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,340
for the sudden change in his attitude.

756
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,470
Nichang,

757
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,230
when are you going to Yangzhou?

758
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:51,510
I was planning

759
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,910
to leave you all behind.

760
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,710
But now we're surrounded by danger.

761
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,510
If I leave,

762
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,510
you'll be left

763
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,710
with nothing.

764
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,510
I'll stay a little longer.

765
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,190
Even if we face some disasters,

766
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,300
your sharp tongue will help us out.

767
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,540

and almost vomited the other day?

Then, you'll need

772
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,620
to inquire with the noble families

773
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,670
about the news from the court.

we need to reassess him.

He typically only travels

between the Ministry of Personnel
and his residence.

00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,060
Apart from necessary social engagements,

783

Hai Yiping wields both benevolence
and coercion.

784
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,750
He personally arranges for the families

785

of his servants to be taken care of,

786
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,100
posing as charity,
but in reality, it's a threat.

That's why they're all very loyal.

788
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,950
I can't infiltrate his house

by being a servant.

790
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,540
He's neither greedy for money

nor lustful.

Hai Yiping can no longer wait.

797

He fears I have evidence against him,

798
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,750

He even tried to manipulate
others to do his bidding,

but now,

803
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,220
there's no need for him to hide anymore.

804
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:16,870
Since I've exposed

805
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,310
myself to him,

806
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,740
it's better to confront him

958
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,580
to Yangzhou with Nichang for a while?

959
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,100
If we leave,

960
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,580
you'll be left alone to face danger.

961
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,220
If you were me,

962
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,790
would you agree to that?

963
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:43,620
So, what's

964
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,350
your next move?

965
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,790
You're so alert

966
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:00,990
and caught on

967
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,510
to Ye Ping'an's movements.

968
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,870
As you said,

969
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,580
I'm learning

970
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,620
how to be a good piece.

971
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,580
Have you

972
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,030
read the ledger?

973
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:19,660
To be honest,

974
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,220
I've read it.

975
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,220
But as soon as I turned the page,

976
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,870
I knew I shouldn't keep reading.

977
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,220
You are the Vice Minister
of the Court of Judicial Review.

978
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,310
You must know

979
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,620
who owns Jinlu Pawnshop, right?

980
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,220
It's a disciple
of Granary Magistrate Gong Shao.

981
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:40,390
Do you want

982
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,510
to be my disciple?

983
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:46,470
Master,

984
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:47,910
thank you for taking me in.

985
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:50,990
But,

986
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,430
the dealings behind the pawnshop

987
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,260
have already been exposed.

988
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,140
Do you need me to...

989
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,220
To be my disciple,

990
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,870
you must stay righteous.

991
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,740
The pawnshop has nothing to do with you.

992
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:04,830
For these next few days,

993
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,470
keep a close eye on Ye Ping'an.

994
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,390
Make sure

995
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,910
she doesn't cause any more trouble.

996
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,350
I have a way to get into Hai Mansion.

997
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,260
What's it?

998
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:22,700
The paint used by Hai Yan

999
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:23,990
comes from the Qixi Painting Shop.

1000
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,220
Find a way to work here

1001
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,430
and take on the job of delivering paint,

1002
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,100
and you'll get into Hai Mansion.

1003
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,790
I'm curious to see

1004
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:33,990
what Hai Yiping's

1005
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,060
next move will be.
