Miss Ye,

4
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,250
I am Zhao Feng,
Vice Minister of Justice.

5
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,370
I heard

6
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,580
that you are about to leave the capital,

7
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,890
so I've been waiting here for you.

8
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,890
Mr. Zhao, what is the meaning of this?

9
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,410
I was asked by someone

10
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,500
to deliver this to you.

11
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,620
This is...

12
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,900
Please don't ask any questions.

13
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,250
I have fulfilled my duty.

14
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,460
Safe travels to you, Miss Ye.

You left the capital

18
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,970
without a word,

19
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,410
and I've missed you.

20
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,410
Where have you been

21
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,090
for the past year?

22
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,410
I've been to a lot of places.

23
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,650
Otherwise,

24
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,090
how could I be sitting here?

25
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,650
Stop beating around the bush.

26
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,090
Just tell me.

27
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,570
Why did you become an middleman?

28
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,620
Now that salt prices are so high,

29
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,180
who wouldn't want to seize
the opportunity to earn a little more

30
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,180
and live a better life?

31
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,620
Stop with the act.

32
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,130
Such a glib tongue.

33
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,250
How could she possibly

34
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,410
provide this much illegal salt?

35
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,620
Mr. Yuan, it seems

36
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,690
that you have
a strong prejudice against me.

37
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,220
Since you don't trust me,

38
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:23,850
feel free to leave.

39
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,500
I'll just find another buyer.

40
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,780
Do you really have

41
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,250
so much salt?

42
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:32,690

How do you know him?

48
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,530
Mr. Yuan,

49
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:50,850
you truly are forgetful.

50
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,500
How could you forget what I do

51
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:53,180
for a living?

52
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,500
After I cured

53
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,020
an illegal salt smuggler's headache,

54
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:57,500
he introduced me

55
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,970
to his leader.

56
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:03,650

in this trade.

I apologize if I've offended you,

66

does have the nickname
"Iron Crutch Huang,"

but no one knows

72
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,370
how he got his limp.

73
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,010
It's a simple story.

74
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,690
His limp wasn't caused

75
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
by a physical injury

76
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,660
but by the deep anguish he endured

77
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,450
after his wife passed away.

78
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,940
So you treated him and ended up

79
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,620
forming a connection with him.

80
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,010
Exactly.

81
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,890
It's because of this connection

82
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,740
that he entrusted me

83
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,860
with some illegal salt business.

84
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,100
Your story

85

Stop wasting time on her.

Let's go.

88
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,060
Mr. Yuan, you haven't even become

89

the Prince of Kangping's son-in-law yet,

90
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,130
yet you're already trying

91
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,500
to control Miss Wu.

92
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,370
Be careful,

93
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,010
or he might exploit you.

94
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,620
You should worry

95
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,330
about yourself.

96
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,940
You could make a fortune,
but you might not live to spend it.

97
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,540
Enough.

98
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,540

99
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,210

to do business with Ping'an?

101
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,890
If you truly know Huang Yimin,

102
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,370
pick a day

103
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,940
and bring him to see us.

104

That's very nice of you, Miss Wu.

105
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:38,420
How about this?

106
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,890
No matter how much
you make from this deal,

107
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,100
the commission
will be a fixed 800 liang.

108
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,060
Sure, no problem.

109
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:49,940
We'll leave now.

110
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,500
By the way, Mr. Yuan,

111
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,690
it's cold and the roads are slippery.

112
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,740
Be careful

113
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,370
not to fall.

114
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,300
I've warned you.

115

You're no match for her.

116
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:18,980
We can find

other ways to get salt.

118
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,690
Why bargain with a tiger?

119
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,810
Mr. Yuan, how well do you know me?

120
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,210
There's no need

121
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,740
to impose your own weakness

122
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,250
onto me.

123
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:29,890
Be

124
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,250
dutiful and devoted.

125
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,620
It's what I expect

126
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,740
when you're with me.

127
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,180
Who has the audacity

128
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,570
to block my carriage?

129
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,300
An anonymous tip has reached
the Ministry of Justice,

130
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,890
alleging the presence
of illegal salt in this carriage.

131
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:58,500
Sorry for the offense.

132
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:00,060
Search it.

133
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:00,890
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

134
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:12,770
Sir,

135
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:16,860
we found this under the carriage.

136
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,660
Mr. Zhao,

137
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,690
you know us.

138
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,300
Why could we hide illegal salt

139
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,180
under the carriage?

140
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,420
We've clearly been framed.

141
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,860
Whether it's a frame-up or not,

142
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,330
I'll get to the bottom of it.

143
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,210
Without an official token,

144
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,740
I don't acknowledge any claims.

145
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,660
So once you see the token,

146
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,940
you'll let us go, right?

147
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,570
With it,

148
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,890
you enter the prison as an official.

149
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,540
Without it,

150
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,690
you enter as a commoner.

151
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,500
Have you thought it through?

152
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,130
No need to bother.

153
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,130
We'll go with you

154
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,940
as two commoners.

155
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:21,210
My friend,

156
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,500
may I ask where Mr. Zhang is?

157
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,620
Mr. Zhang is occupied
with official duties.

158
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,690
He'll only return after a few days.

159
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:29,810
Wait.

160
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,970
Please go
to the Court of Judicial Review

161
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,610
and tell them that Minister Yuan...

162
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,180
What are you talking about?

Luckily, no one saw it,

164
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:46,940

Miss Wu, are you all right?

172
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,300
Of course.

173
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,090
[Xian Guangping]
I heard from the jailer

174
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,380
[General of Left Yulin Royal Guard]
that Mr. Yuan is still inside.

175
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,540
Should I bring

176
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:15,260
him out as well?

177
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,260
No need.

178
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,330
He has his own way out.

179
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,140
Who would have the nerve

180
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,090
to frame you?

181
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,490
Who else could it be?

182
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,610
Of course, it's her,

183
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:26,970
Ye Ping'an.

184
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,450
Ye Ping'an?

185
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,490
Isn't she your friend?

186
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:31,660
Yes.

187
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,490
But sadly,

188
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,780
we can only be rivals.

189
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,300
I got you out of prison in the past,

190
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,730
and now you've helped me out.

191
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,970

Hang in there.

00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,090
Next.

here today?

208
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,420
He's too proud for his own good.

209
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,810
A few days ago,
he had bad luck and offended

210
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,140
the Commander-in-Chief,
landing himself in prison.

211
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,180
The Commander-in-Chief
is someone who holds grudges,

212
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:34,260
so he might use this

213
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:35,690
as an excuse to have him killed.

214
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,130
Thank you for saving my life, Miss Wu.

215

for you.

Yes.

not to hurry.

Where's Shaocheng?

263
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:27,980
He has something to take care of.

264
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,580
That person does indeed have salt,

265
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:30,850
and she claims to be acquainted

266
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:31,940
with Huang Yimin,

00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:32,980
the largest illegal salt smuggler

268
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,460

00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,980
The goods are his.

270
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,820
If it truly is Huang Yimin,

271
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,130
then the amount of salt makes sense.

272
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:41,850
How much
is the middleman's commission?

273
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,460
Eight hundred liang.

274
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,730
That's the market rate.

275
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:47,180
However,

276
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,490
you'll be surprised

277
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:49,650
by the middleman's identity.

She's Ye Ping'an.

279
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,850
There must be a hidden agenda

280
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,010
behind her actions.

281
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,220
If she truly knows Huang Yimin,

282
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:02,890
then we...

283
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,610

We...

288
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,130
You're probably not in it for the salt.

290

A few days ago,

00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,250

293
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:21,730

294
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:22,130

and offered his full support.

297
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,730
Her Majesty's response
was just five words:

00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,980
"No noise in the court."

299
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:31,770
No noise...

300
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,890
That was Her Majesty subtly warning him,

301
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,460
purposely letting you see it.

302
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,010
It's also a reminder for me.

of the mountain.

382
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,730
Though the quantity is small,

383
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,980
this first deal will establish

384
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,860
some trust between us.

I can only pay you

390
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,380
half of the money upfront.

391

395
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:31,980
over this, Miss Wu.

to prepare the silvers.

we'll meet at Xiyun Mountain Gorge

399

of the Court of Judicial Review,

how come

403
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,090
you came out a day later than me?

404
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,940
I heard you just came back
from outside the city.

Does your father know about this?

410

of the profits.

426
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,980
which means she's laying

427
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:46,810
a trap for me.

431
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,900

432
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,290

439

It's all my fault.

00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,730
and follow me out of the city.

567
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:37,330
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

568
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,290
I saw Wu Xian'er leaving the city,

569
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,330
so I sent someone to follow her

570
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,140
and mark the trail.

571
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,490
Get reinforcements
from the Court of Judicial Review

572
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:43,420
[Yuan Mansion]
and move out right away.

573
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:53,700
All the goods are here.

574
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:09,900
No need for that.

575
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,090
I have full trust in you

576
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,460
as my client.

577
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:15,660
I assume your salt

578
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,250
is measured fairly and precisely.

579
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,620
Since you're a valuable client,

580
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:20,730
allow me to see you off.

581
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,290
No need

582
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,700
for courtesies between us.

583
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:25,180
Farewell.

584
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,460
Stay where you are!

585
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:45,140
Go!

586
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,330
Arrest everyone on both sides!

587
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:05,900
This is a letter accusing He Yi

588
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,420
of embezzling river transport fees.

589
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,770
Wu Youjing is a prudent man.

590
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:10,860
Once he sees it,

591
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,180
he will surely shut down
all the transportation of salt himself.

592
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,290
He'll be desperate

593
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,250
[To the Court of Judicial Review]
to find an alternative.

594
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:19,180
Ping'an,

595
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,530
we can then make our next move.

596
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:23,490
Prince of Kangping,

597
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,330
I will redeem myself.

598
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:25,770
Leave!

599
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:26,730
Yes, sir.

600
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,490
I'm going to find a new source of salt

601
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,620
to make up for my mistake.

602
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,490
Are you really

603
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,180
only asking for 100 wen per dou?

604
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,940
Since Wu Xian'er considers me

605
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,860
a worthy opponent,

606
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,010
I shall grant her wish

607
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,980
and turn into a mouse,

608
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,860
letting her think
she has the upper hand

609
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,940
while delivering this cat

610
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,290
right where I want it.

611
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:54,090
[Psychiatric Commissioner]

612
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,010
[Imperial]
So, what was left in the jar a year ago

613
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,290
was the token
of the Psychiatric Commissioner.

614
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,380
Miss Ye, since you have returned
to the capital

615
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:01,490
and come to me,

616
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,700
you must be here
for something important.

617
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,050
There is an official

618
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,250
in the capital

619
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,140
manipulating the salt trade
for personal gain.

620
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,900
I intend to lure out this big fish.

621
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,250
Salt prices have soared,

622
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,250
leaving the people unable to afford it

623
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:15,770
and struggling to survive.

624
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,810
It's time to expose

625
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,250
the culprit behind this.

626
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,090
Miss Wu,

627
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,250
I received a secret letter

628
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:28,570
accusing you,

629
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,090
a court official,

630
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,460
of knowingly breaking the law

631
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,490
by using silver
to purchase illegal salt.

632
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,730
Mr. Zhao,

633
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,660
you've arrived just in time.

634
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,140
I also received a secret letter

635
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:37,860
claiming

636
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,250
that illegal salt was being traded here.

637
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:41,420
So I came to make a deal

638
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,490
and draw them out.

639
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,490
Sure enough,

640
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,010
we caught them red-handed.

641
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,290
Please, Mr. Zhao,

642
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:48,620
take her into custody.

643
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,620
Mr. Zhao,

644
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,860
Miss Wu accuses me
of selling illegal salt,

645
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,490
but buying and selling
are equally punishable.

646
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,900
The silver is right here as proof.

647
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,460
How can I be convicted

648
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,860
based on her words alone?

649
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:17,380
Sir,

650
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,420
we've found a set
of Mountain-Pattern Armor.

651
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:29,700
Miss Wu,

652
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:30,980
are we just going to leave now?

653
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,180
Should we put in place
what you asked us

654
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:32,730
to prepare?

655
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:33,940
Yes, do it.

656
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:34,570
Yes, ma'am.

657
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:42,730
Ye Ping'an,

658
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,250
you are truly audacious.

659
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,700
Not only do you sell illegal salt,

660
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,290
but you also secretly hoard armor.

661
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,730
Such actions

662
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,140
amount to treason.

663
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,180
I'm just a commoner.

664
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,900
How could I possibly have
this Mountain-Pattern Armor?

665
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,730
Only someone from the Wu family

666
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,660
would have such resources.

667
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,980
You might not have the resources,

668
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,900
but those behind you do.

669
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,490
If the Wu family falls,

670
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:05,940
the biggest beneficiary

671
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,140
would be the Li family.

672
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,050
Taking such a risk to secure

673
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:09,940
the Crown Prince's position

674
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:11,570
is hardly surprising.

675
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,330
Enough.

676
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:13,940
This is getting more and more absurd.

677
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,530
A matter of such gravity

678
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,180
cannot be determined

679
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:18,570
by one person's words alone.

680
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,330
This item

681
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,900
was hidden among the illegal salt.

682
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:21,940
No matter what,

683
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,420
Ye Ping'an can't wash her hands of it.

684
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,140
Someone!

685
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,460
Wait!

686
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,380
I'd like to see who dares
to make a move.

687
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,420
Mr. Zhao,

688
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,330
are you protecting Ye Ping'an

689
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,250
because you, too,

690
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,290
wish to commit treason?

691
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,250
Mr. Zhao,

692
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,010
I'll go with you.

693
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:00,530
Over here!

694
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:01,810
Hurry!

695
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:17,570
You should leave now.

696
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:18,810
Go!

697
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,900
This man is Ye Ping'an's accomplice,

698
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:50,420
Huang Yimin,
the biggest illegal salt smuggler

699
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,940
in the Henan region.

700
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:52,900
Hang on.

701
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:55,810
Where is his crutch?

702
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,700
Such a cunning act of deception.

703
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,220
This matter involves many parties.

704
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,700
Mr. Yuan,

705
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:19,130
please hand the person over
to the Ministry of Justice

706
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,090
for a thorough investigation.

707
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,530
I captured this person,

708
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:23,370
so naturally, the case

709
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,530
should be handled
by the Court of Judicial Review.

710
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:25,810
Mr. Yuan.

711
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:26,570
Mr. Zhao,

712
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,500
the suspect Ye Ping'an

713
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,290
escaped under your watch.

714
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,290
Even if it wasn't intentional,

715
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:33,940
you are still accountable
for negligence.

716
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:35,660
Stay out

717
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:37,420
of this matter.

718
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,130
Miss Wu.

719
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,740
Zhao Feng

720
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,700
once submitted a letter
to Her Majesty,

721
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,090
claiming that the Crown Prince
was the rightful heir.

722
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,740
Go to Xinkai Prison

723
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:11,810
and tell Zhou Mi

724
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,980
that Zhao Feng is involved
in the salt and armor case.

725
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:15,610
Zhou Mi knows

726
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,460
how to extract evidence

727
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:18,770
from him.

728
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:19,290
Yes, ma'am.

729
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,460
The criminal Ye Ping'an
is guilty of secretly trading armor,

730
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,130
resisting arrest,
and flouting the law.

731
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,660
She has fled to Luozhou.

732
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,700
- Luozhou.
- Luozhou.

733
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:33,770
Anyone who reports her whereabouts

734
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:34,900
will be rewarded
with 100 liang of silver.

735
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,090
A hundred liang?

736
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,660
Those who assist the authorities
in capturing her

737
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,370
will be rewarded
with 1,000 liang of silver.

738
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:40,740
[Wanted]

739
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,370
Anyone found harboring her will face

740
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,050
the same punishment as her.

741
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:44,940
Why is Ye Ping'an

742
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,770
involved in so many crimes?

743
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,570
Indeed.

744
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:47,810
Exactly.

745
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,220
Get up.

746
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:01,940
Quiet down.

747
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,940
Someone's trying to sleep here.

748
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:06,810
How dare you be so arrogant?

749
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:07,980
Do you even know where you are?

750
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,570
This isn't just any prison.

751
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,980
This
is the Court of Judicial Review Prison.

752
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,260
No matter how tough you think you are,

753
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:13,980
here,

754
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,700
you'd better bend

755
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:16,610
and behave.

756
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,900
What's your monthly salary?

757
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,180
With salt costing 400 wen per dou,

758
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:25,460
how much can you afford
with your monthly salary?

759
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,570
Wait. What's that supposed to mean?

760
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,220
Since you've dropped the disguise,

761
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,220
stop pretending
to be an illegal salt smuggler.

762
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:36,370
Now,

763
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,770
the crime committed by Ye Ping'an

764
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,850
is far worse than selling illegal salt.

765
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,420
She has hoarded armor.

766
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,180
According to the laws of Great Feng,

767
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,130
one set of armor equals
three crossbows

768
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:50,020
and three sets of armor
can result in execution.

769
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,090
You should know this, right?

770
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,500
It all leads to death anyway.

771
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,500
Whether the charges are heavy or not,

772
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:58,290
does it really matter?

773
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,220
I only have two questions for you.

774
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:01,770
First,

775
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,180
what is your relationship

776
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,020
with Huang Yimin?

777
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:10,530
Second,

778
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,650
where is Ye Ping'an

779
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,130
right now?

780
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:20,020
I knew

781
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,570
getting an unyielding man
like you to talk

782
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,130
would not be so easy,

783
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,500
so I came prepared.

784
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,300
How do you plan to torture me?

785
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,530
Just bring it on.

786
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,530
That won't be necessary.

787
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,610
Your real name

788
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,210
shouldn't have been traceable,

789
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,730
but I still found it.

790
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,090
Qiu Yin.

791
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,860
You were once just a farmer,

792
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,250
but you were forced into the life

793
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,500
of a vagrant
when your land was taken.

794
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,500
Only with the help of some friends

795
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,170
did you learn martial arts,

796
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,300
and become a hatchet man for a living.

797
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:53,820
Hence, the word "loyalty"

798
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,500
is etched on your heart.

799
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,050
How did you find out?

800
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,050
What?

801
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,420
Is something I said incorrect?

802
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,300
For someone like me,

803
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,130
loyalty is the most important thing.

804
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,570
There's no difference between friends

805
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,610
and family.

806
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:16,300
You corrupt officials

807
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,300
wouldn't understand.

808
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:18,460
Well said.

809
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,980
Today, I'll see

810
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:22,530
how you'll choose

811
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,020
between friends

812
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,940
and true family.

813
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,740
If I remember correctly,

814
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,730
you have a cousin

815
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,020
in Ruanyang County.

816
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,170
How about I bring him here

817
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:34,610
to visit you?

818
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,940
I'll go immediately

819
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,820
and make sure he's well taken care of.

820
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:38,860
No need.

821
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:43,730
I can answer

822
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,500
your first question.

823
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,860
Over the past year,

824
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,460
we've been exploring new sources of salt

825
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,570
because we know

826
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,050
Wu Youjing needs salt.

827
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,020
How did you know

828
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:01,900
that the Prince of Kangping

829
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,650
would halt all the transportation
of salt in Yangzhou

830
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:07,210
due to a lawsuit filed
by the local silk maker against He Yi?

831
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,090
Could it be that the letter
accusing He Yi

832
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,050
of embezzling the transportation fee,

833
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,530
which was sent

834
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:14,980
to the Court of Judicial Review
some time ago,

835
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,650
came from Ye Ping'an?

836
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:20,650
That's right.

837
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,460
As for Huang Yimin,

838
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,020
we don't really know him.

839
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:27,980
We only borrowed his name

840
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:28,900
because it is

841
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:30,380
so widely recognized.

842
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,300
She sure knows how to spin a good story.

843
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,020
The letter of accusation

844
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,380
didn't contain lies.

845
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,340
As for your dear father-in-law,

846
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,020
since last year,

847
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,420
he's been sending people
to the salt fields

848
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:44,860
under the pretext of capturing bandits

849
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,340
and guarding the salt fields.

850
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:47,780
He's used every possible trick

851
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,170
to seize land from farmers,

852
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,500
forcing many to become refugees

853
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,020
and resort to selling illegal salt.

854
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:57,380
You traitor,

855
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,500
how dare you slander
the Prince of Kangping!

856
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,340
Ye Ping'an...

857
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,090
Tell me.

858
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,380
Where is Ye Ping'an right now?

859
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:17,690
Open the door!

860
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:23,460
Come in.

861
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,090
What has he had?

862
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:28,090
Nothing.

863
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,530
He only had two bowls of water
when he came in.

864
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,530
Go fetch the physician.

865
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,170
If he dies,

866
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:33,300
I'll hold you accountable.

867
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:33,900
Yes, sir.

868
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,300
[Court of Judicial Review]

869
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,300
Ye Ping'an

870
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,170
doesn't speak a single word of truth.

871
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,050
She

872
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,020
has always

873
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,130
been a master of deception.

874
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:48,900
Let's find another way

875
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:49,820
to handle the salt issue.

876
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,900
Where did you get those sets

877
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:54,980
of Mountain-Pattern Armor?

878
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,690
If you want answers, you should arrest

879
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:57,300
and interrogate Ye Ping'an.

880
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:59,170
She's the one

881
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,530
hoarding the armor.

882
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,420
You know full well
that hoarding armor is a serious crime.

883
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,610
Why did you use...?

884
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:07,860
Had it not been for the armor,

885
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,020
Ye Ping'an

886
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:10,340
could have easily explained

887
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,690
the source of her salt.

888
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:14,420
Now that she's back,

889
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:15,860
the battle

890
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,050
is on.

891
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,210
This time,

892
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,780
we must take her down in one fatal move.

893
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:26,570
How is he now?

894
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,860
The prisoner is in poor condition

895
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:28,940
and unfit for interrogation.

896
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,130
Investigate it!

897
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:31,820
I'd like to see

898
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:33,380
who dares to poison someone

899
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,460
inside the Court of Judicial Review.

900
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:35,500
Pass down my order.

901
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:36,940
No one is to approach

902
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,460
this prisoner's cell

903
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:39,820
except for me.

904
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,340
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

905
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:46,610
Sir,

906
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,020
I'd like a word

907
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,050
with you in private.

908
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,730
Get to the point.

909
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,420
That old man

910
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,780
wasn't wrong about everything.

911
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,090
With the meager salary I have now,

912
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,650
I can't even afford to use salt freely.

913
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:08,020
Those are just words
meant to sow discord.

914
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,020
Your salary

915
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:11,570
might be modest,

916
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,250
but hasn't the Prince of Kangping
given you

917
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,980
quite a few perks under the table?

918
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:18,210
So I guess

919
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,460
I was wrong

920
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,780
to expect you

921
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,380
to promote me.

922
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,610
I should have sided with
the Prince of Kangping from the start.

923
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:27,050
Sir,

924
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:29,570
do you think

925
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:31,420
I can still change my mind now?

926
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,820
This... This is the engagement gift

927
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,170
the Prince of Kangping gave you.

928
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:54,780
I wouldn't dare to take it.

929
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,530
This is your reward

930
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:59,900
once the task is done.

931
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:02,940
I planned

932
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,050
to give it to Wenyu,

933
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,460
but since you are so eager for merit,

934
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,420
I shall let you have it instead.

935
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:09,210
What's the task?

936
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,380
Go to Caozhou

937
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,380
and find the real Huang Yimin.

938
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,460
Persuade him to sell illegal salt to us.

939
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:16,380
I've asked around

940
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:17,980
and his salt is indeed quite cheap.

941
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,020
If you can make this happen,

942
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:22,730
you will have earned great merit for me

943
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,020
in the eyes of the Prince of Kangping.

944
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,530
But I have

945
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:33,690
no connections in Caozhou.

946
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,690
Even if I manage to find

947
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:35,530
the real Huang Yimin,

948
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:36,530
I doubt

949
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:37,780
he'd be willing to see me.

950
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,420
If I had no confidence in this,

951
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,500
I wouldn't have planned

952
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:41,860
to let Wenyu handle it.

953
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,690
Open it and take a look.

954
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:51,300
This is...

955
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:52,530
This is the token.

956
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,340
Huang Yimin, the illegal salt smuggler,

957
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,460
values profit

958
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:56,900
but cherishes loyalty even more.

959
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,090
He has a son

960
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,300
named Huang Qi.

961
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,300
Coincidentally, I have

962
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,340
a merchant friend

963
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:03,020
who once risked his life

964
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:04,900
to save Huang Qi
when he was being pursued

965
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,780
by bandits.

966
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,130
In gratitude,

967
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,020
Huang Qi gave my friend

968
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,300
this tooth he lost in the incident,

969
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,610
promising

970
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,420
to help him

971
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,730
whenever needed.

972
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:20,090
Rest assured.

973
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:21,570
I will not let you down, sir.

974
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:22,900
You have three days.

975
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,900
Get it done, even if your horse

976
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,300
collapses from exhaustion.

977
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,250
Yes, sir.
