[Hai Mansion]
Are you here to ask for the help

4
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:33,990
of Mr. Hai?

5
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,110
The mansion is closed today.

6
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,110
Please come again another day.

7
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,390
Miss Wu

8
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,960
sent me here to get more pearl powder.

9
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:41,960
I see.

10
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,270
I will tell Mr. Hai now.

11
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,040
This way.

12
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,150
Miss Ye,

13
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,240
please.

14
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,760
This way.

15
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:33,670
Mr. Hai.

16
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,200
It's only been a few days,

17
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,990
and you're already a commissioner.

18
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,550
I'm flattered, Mr. Hai,

19
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,240
but it sounds better than it really is.

20
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,390
You helped me last time, Mr. Hai.

21
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,080
I should have come
to thank you in person.

22
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,360
I was only

23
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,320
doing my job.

24
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,670
When I was passing through the mansion,

25
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,830
I saw...

26
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,240
It is because of my sister, Hai Yan.

27
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,200
Yan

28
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,870
has been different

29
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,040
since she was young.

30
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,800
Different?

31
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,110
She doesn't like to talk,

32
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,200
leave the mansion,

33
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,270
or meet strangers,

34
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,390
but she is talented

35
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,550
in drawing,

36
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,590
and she never forgets anything she sees.

37
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,080
Unfortunately, many years ago,

38
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,710
our house was on fire by accident.

39
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:19,710
Yan was scared,

40
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,230
and got

41
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,270
even worse.

42
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,640
An occultist learned about it

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,880
and told my mother

44
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,560
that Yan was possessed by a demon.

45
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,120
That was why my mother insisted

46
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,680
on having the occultist here
to expel the demon every month.

47
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,880
Filial piety
is the foundation of all virtues.

48
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,680
I have to follow her words.

49
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,200
May I see your sister, Mr. Hai?

50
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,560
I promise

51
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,710
to keep it a secret

52
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,470
no matter what, Mr. Hai.

53
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,350
Mr. Du,

54
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,270
you are right.

55
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,320
Ye Ping'an went to the Hai Mansion.

56
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,390
She does have something to do
with the Mei alliance.

57
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,560
The Mei and the Li
are not exactly friends.

58
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,880
That letter

59
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,880
was definitely a setup by the Mei.

60
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,320
If it is true,

61
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,270
the Mei family has something on me,

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,520
and I'm at a disadvantage.

63
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,560
Oh,

64
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,230
how about Ye Ping'an's aunt?

65
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,590
I sent someone to sneak into her house,

66
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,230
but there was no trace of her aunt.

67
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,560
She has no serious profession.

68
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,030
Where else can she be?

69
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,350
We need to strike
at the weakest point of the enemy.

70
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,200
As long as we get her aunt,

71
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,910
the life of Ye Ping'an is in our hands.

72
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,390
It might be the chance for me

73
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,200
to take the Mei down.

74
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,910
The last stroke is a shame.

75
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,520
Mr. Du,

76
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,640
this last stroke

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,270
is like a fierce tiger,
turning its head around.

78
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,080
It has the essence of Ouyang Xun.
[*A well-known calligrapher]

79
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,350
It is

80
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:45,790
magnificent.

81
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,790
Since that's the case,

82
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,390
sell it at the same price
as the work of Ouyang Xun.

83
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,200
Anyone who buys it

84
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,520
will be introduced

85
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,520
to serve the chief
of the granaries section.

86
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,030
My mother didn't allow Yan to draw

87
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,640
and took all the ink and paper away.

88
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:16,710
Every time the occultist was here,

89
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,520
he said the room had to be locked

90
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,710
to keep the demon from running away.

91
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:21,640
Now,

92
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,760
open the door.

93
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,000
But the exorcism is still going on.

94
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,270
Madam may...

95
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:27,790
Open it.

96
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,200
My mother

97
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,590
took her ink and paper.

98
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,880
We didn't know

99
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,000
that she hid the coal away.

100
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,760
Yan,

101
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,200
a physician is here for you.

[Black Market]

103
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,000
It's rare.

104
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,830
A real rarity.

105
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,640
Come and have a look.

106
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:10,760
It's cheap.

107
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,560
Fresh fish.

108
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,710
The price is good.

[Hai Mansion]

110
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,520
You've never seen it before, right?

111
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,960
Isn't it much better than black?

112
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,280
Here you go.

113
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,990
You can draw your mother,

114
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,870
alright?

115
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,680
This is

116
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,040
a present from your mother.

117
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,200
You...

118
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,400
How dare you?

119
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
Why didn't you stop her

120
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,400
on her way?

121
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,800
The exorcism was done,

122
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,110
and Madam insisted on taking a look.

123
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,800
I had no reason to stop her.

124
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,040
Who are you?

125
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,470
Madam Hai,

126
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,870
I'm Ye Ping'an.

127
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,510
You're the witch who was in jail before.

128
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,040
How could you allow

129
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,040
someone like her in?

130
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,080
What if she put a curse

131
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,080
on Yan?

132
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,080
Who is going to take the fall?

133
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,400
Mother.

134
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,680
Mother, calm down.

135
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,320
I shall take my leave

136
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:20,590
and visit again another day.

137
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,400
Yan.

138
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,160
It's mine.

139
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,560
Of course, it's yours.

140
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,590
Who gave it to you?

141
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,630
My mother.

142
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,990
Yan, my dear girl.

143
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,200
You are finally talking.

144
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,510
Yan.

145
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,990
How did you do that?

146
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,710
In fact, Hai Yan

147
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:11,740
cannot fully grasp

148
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,990
the intricacies of conversation.

149
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,430
It will be better

150
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,020
if you can talk to her
as simple as possible.

151
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,020
And she likes drawing.

152
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,950
You can take advantage of it

153
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,540
to get closer to her.

154
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,860
I see.

155
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,900
I apologize for earlier,

156
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,900
Miss Ye.

157
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,020
I could have

158
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,710
kept you from helping Yan.

159
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,260
Get

160
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,260
the jewel case

161
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,950
from my room now.

162
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,500
It's okay,

163
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,260
Madam Hai,

164
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,620
it's my duty.

165
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,070
And I'm here today

166
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,590
to ask for help

167
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,500
from Mr. Hai.

168
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,620
Miss Ye, please don't hesitate.

169
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,590
I will do my best.

170
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,350
As you said,

171
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,540
it will be a scandal that Du Liang

172
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,860
embezzled the military fund.

173
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,660
It only took you a few days

174
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,070
to find out

175
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,380
such a big secret.

176
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,590
I simply got lucky.

177
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,110
However, he has melted

178
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,620
the 5,000 Liang from the fund

179
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,830
and destroyed the evidence.

180
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,830
How could I help you?

181
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,860
I don't have any power,

182
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,470
so there is

183
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,350
nothing much I can do.

184
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,540
For the sake of the people,

185
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,590
I will do anything I can.

186
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,350
Then may I introduce someone to you?

187
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:35,780
Who?

188
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,500
Someone who is investigating
the military fund,

189
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:38,990
Yuan Shaocheng.

190
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:52,780
Ping'an.

191
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,380
Your aunt...

192
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,780
She was caught in the black market.

193
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,310
Who did it?

194
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,350
Du Liang.

195
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,950
I will ask Gui to help.

196
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,990
Du Liang kidnapped my aunt

197
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,500
to threaten me.

198
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,500
He will come to me.

199
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,860
Is the Psychiatric Commissioner here?

200
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,110
Commissioner,

201
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,310
Mr. Du would like to invite you

202
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,860
to join him for dinner at his mansion.

203
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,950
It would be an honor to have you.

204
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:37,860
My pleasure.

205
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,500
I will get my cape.

206
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:47,990
Notice Yuan Shaocheng.

207
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,230
Mr. Du.

208
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,660
Miss Ye.

209
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,740
I'm having a feast here

210
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,710
to celebrate your appointment.

211
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,710
Thank you so much, Mr. Du.

212
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,110
May I ask how my aunt is doing?

213
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,950
I will take good care of her.

214
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,500
After the dinner,

215
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:33,900
I will send you

216
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,590
and your aunt back.

217
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,350
Where is Yuan Shaocheng?

218
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,190
He is out.

219
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:47,950
Du Liang

220
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,860
kidnapped Ping'an's aunt,

221
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,310
and Ping'an is now at his mansion.

222
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,500
I will tell Mr. Yuan now.

223
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,860
I heard that Du Liang

224
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,990
gave you a gambling house.

225
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,660
You should be on his side,

226
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,260
shouldn't you?

227
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,430
You really know everything,

228
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,500
Mr. Hai,

229
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,540
but if I don't pretend

230
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,230
to be working for him,

231
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,500
I won't get the chance

232
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,860
to talk to you.

233
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,260
Loyalty is above all for a man.

234
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,110
Since you turned your back on Du Liang,

235
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,780
how can I trust you?

236
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,230
No one should follow
orders without thinking.

237
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,900
Du Liang gave me the gambling house,

238
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,950
but he also smashed it.

239
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:24,950
I know

240
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,350
connections

241
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,950
are not reliable.

242
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,380
The only thing reliable

243
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,070
is interest.

244
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,430
Interest?

245
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,500
The world belongs to the Empress

246
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,500
and the people.

247
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,780
Since you mentioned interest,

248
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:40,990
do you know

249
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,660
where does interest come from?

250
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,950
It comes from the people

251
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,780
and should end up in people's hands.

252
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,500
That's why

253
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,380
I'm here

254
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,310
to visit you, Mr. Hai.

255
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,430
For your career of over two decades,

256
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,190
you've been helping the people.

257
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,660
In the first year of Kangzhou,

258
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,500
you've done over one hundred deeds

259
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,430
for the sake of the public.

260
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,740
As for Du Liang,

261
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,860
he has done more

262
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,740
for his own interest.

263
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,070
I help the Mei alliance,

264
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:07,780
and you help me.

265
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,710
We are doing it for the people.

266
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,990
Well said,

267
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,780
but to help the people,

268
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,860
you need to know how to be an official.

269
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,430
Do you know the principle of that?

270
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,190
Please enlighten me, Mr. Hai.

271
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,860
You can go straight
to the point, Mr. Du.

272
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,830
Miss Ye, you were
the suspect of a murder,

273
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,900
but you got out of jail soon.

274
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,780
You met the Empress
and was appointed as a commissioner.

275
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,230
I wonder who was the one

276
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,070
behind you

277
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,830
that cleared the way for you.

278
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,380
The Empress saved my life

279
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,900
and appointed me.

280
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,310
If there was anyone,

281
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,020
it could only be the Empress.

282
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,710
Since you know
how to please the Empress,

283
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,190
perhaps you could

284
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,540
give me some hints?

285
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,340
Mr. Du,

286
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,740
how is it possible for us

287
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,670
to figure out the mind of Her Majesty?

288
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,710
It was my mistake.

289
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:19,910
Of course not.

290
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,780
Tell me

291
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,820
what you see in the picture.

292
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,870
Numerous nations paying tribute.

293
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,390
But what I saw

294
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,820
was much more simple.

295
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,230
The color.

296
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,230
Red, black, green, and yellow.

297
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,910
Without the color,

298
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:45,500
there

299
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,190
will be no painting.

300
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,260
Now,

301
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,300
how many colors
does the human mind have?

302
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,780
Love, hatred, greed,
anger, ignorance, desire.

303
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,430
There are a lot.

304
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,340
How should

305
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,390
an official

306
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,630
manage desire?

307
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,580
Everyone prefers
to be an upright official,

308
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:06,710
but the desire

309
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,950
is human nature.

310
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,430
It is impossible to ask everyone
to suppress their nature,

311
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:11,710
so...

312
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:14,820
So what?

313
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,740
So,

314
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,020
only the murky depths
can reveal the true sky.

315
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,150
Too much purity

316
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,820
may fail to steady the world.

317
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,990
You do have some talent,

318
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,100
but you'll face
stiff competition in the Mei alliance.

319
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,150
What makes you special?

320
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:34,430
Because

321
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,100
I have prepared

322
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,710
a big gift for you, Mr. Hai.

323
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,100
I will have to see

324
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,740
how big it is.

325
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,260
The military fund.

326
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:50,430
Sir!

327
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,060
Sir,

328
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,710
Ye Ping'an was taken

329
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,580
to the Du Mansion.

330
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,740
What?

331
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,580
I can't be at the Du Mansion.

332
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:03,990
Go to the Hai Mansion

333
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,870
and find Mr. Hai.

334
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,430
Yes, sir.

335
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,430
I don't know

336
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,580
about the Empress's mind,

337
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,230
but I do know you

338
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,990
very well.

339
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,190
You and your aunt are close.

340
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,300
I can keep her here for a few more days,

341
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,910
but by then, I'm not sure

342
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,580
whether she can walk out on her feet

343
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,780
or she is going to be carried outside.

344
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:32,950
Mr. Du,

345
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,430
my aunt has been practicing

346
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,780
the incantation technique since young.

347
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,630
If you cross her,

348
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,150
I'm afraid
that it won't end well for you either.

349
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,020
Miss Ye.

350
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:00,990
Master!

351
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:02,670
Master,

352
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,740
Mr. Hai sent someone here.

353
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,060
Truly sharp and perceptive,

354
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,060
Miss Ye.

355
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,390
Mr. Du,

356
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,670
Miss Ye has an appointment with Mr. Hai

357
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,540
at his mansion.

358
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,060
Hearing that she was at your mansion,

359
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,580
he sent me to pick her up.

360
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,580
How is

361
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,340
Mr. Hai doing?

362
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:29,500
It's nothing serious.

363
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,260
Miss Ye,

364
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,910
since the dishes are not warm anymore,

365
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,580
I shall let you go.

366
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,870
Next time, you should hurry up

367
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,190
and enjoy them while they are warm.

368
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,780
Of course.

369
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,300
You must be frightened.

370
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,580
Thank you so much
for your help, Mr. Hai,

371
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,500
but

372
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,540
Du Liang still has my aunt.

373
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,100
Don't worry.

374
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,150
He knows we are friends now.

375
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,780
He won't harm your aunt
without justification.

376
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,540
It is the curfew now.

377
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,910
For your safety,

378
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,100
you should stay

379
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,230
and take a rest here tonight.

380
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:52,230
Hai Yan?

381
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,740
If you keep practicing,

382
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,100
