00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,100
went to check
if Mr. Zheng was sleeping well.

376
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,260
He then saw Ye Ping'an with a knife.

377
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:52,820
It's straightforward,

378
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,420
but I think it is suspicious.

379
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,460
Why?

380
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,420
[Gu Wenyu, Constable]
First, the anonymous report

381
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,220
was too immediately

382
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,140
and we got her too easily.

383
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,540
Second, the dagger in Ye Ping'an's hand

384
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,580
has no blood on it

385
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,780
and doesn't match

386
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:03,660
Mr. Zheng's wound.

387
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,460
Third, for any reason,

388
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,620
why would Ye Ping'an kill him

389
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,860
on the day when people knew

390
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,020
she visited on the very same day?

391
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,660
Wouldn't that only
make her more suspicious?

392
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:20,540
Wake up.

393
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,140
Wake up!

394
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,340
Get some water.

395
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:37,900
Are you

396
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,100
the officials to interrogate...

397
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,780
You fell asleep
even when you committed a deadly crime.

398
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,380
As expected from a quack of the streets.

399
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,260
No.

400
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:49,980
Behave yourself!

401
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,460
I am not a liar.

402
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,460
I was being hunted,

403
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,660
and that was why
I went to Zheng Mansion.

404
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,340
When I found him, he was dead.

405
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,820
It must be a trap.

406
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,060
Someone wants to frame me

407
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,740
and make me the scapegoat.

408
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,660
It makes sense.

409
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,580
So you are framed,

410
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,420
and there is something behind it.

411
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,060
Alright.

412
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,940
You can write down everything

413
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,060
that happened last night in detail,

414
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:14,860
okay?

415
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:15,860
Sure.

416
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,090
[I confessed
to the killing of Zheng Yuan]

417
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,020
This is

418
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,660
a confession?

419
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,020
You just said...

420
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,420
What did I say?

421
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,740
I was just continuing the story

422
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,420
you made up.

423
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,820
Don't waste my time.

424
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,620
Sign it.

425
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:40,940
Sign it now.

426
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,380
Don't keep us from handling other cases.

427
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,980
In the end, all I was waiting for

428
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,700
was a useless officer.

429
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,180
Maybe I should still thank you

430
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,860
for coming to the jail

431
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,820
and investigating me

432
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,060
for show, Mr. Yuan.

433
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,380
You know who I am?

434
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,140
Some say you hold yourself

435
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,180
to a high standard

436
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,780
and never gang up with others.

437
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,900
Others say you are cruel

438
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,180
and merciless.

439
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,780
You come from the Mang Gutter,

440
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,860
where there is no chance to rise,

441
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,620
but you did well in battle

442
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,820
and got to be a minor officer in return.

443
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,060
You made every effort
to compete for credits

444
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,540
and got promotions.

445
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,020
Finally,

446
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,820
you become

447
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,580
such a useless officer.

448
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,180
You...

449
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:23,860
Wenyu.

450
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,660
Fine.

451
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,540
You are good at making your point,

452
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,460
but it won't change your situation.

453
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,620
It makes no difference

454
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,780
whether you sign the confession or not.

455
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,540
Someone else will do it for you.

456
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,420
Really?

457
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,100
Alright.

458
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,100
I killed him.

459
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,420
Do you want to know how I did it?

460
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,820
I stared at his eyes

461
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,060
and performed my witchcraft.

462
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,700
I made him

463
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,180
kill himself,

464
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,580
just in the same way

465
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,700
like I'm staring at you right now.

466
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,660
Whether it is witchcraft

467
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,100
or a trick,

468
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,260
I don't care.

469
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,860
You are dead

470
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,740
to me.

[Anxin House]

472
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,260
I heard the one

473
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,500
who killed the official

474
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,420
was this witch, Ye Ping'an.

475
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,300
Did they say how?

476
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,380
They said she put a curse.

477
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,540
Come here. Hurry!

478
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,220
What happened?

479
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:43,940
Did you get any updates?

480
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,460
It was not just a curse.

481
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,700
It was about dreams.

482
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,060
The witch

483
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,500
can put you to sleep

484
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:50,980
and glimpse your dreams.

485
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,260
I heard that the witch

486
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,620
could get into your head.

487
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,180
Once you dream,

488
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,060
she will become the ghost

in your dream.

490
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,020
Mr. Zheng was scared to death

491
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,060
because of it.

but now

497
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,620
I heard about another dream.

498
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,460
I also heard something about it.

499
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,740
I wonder if we are talking

500
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,980
about the same one, Your Majesty.

501

You can tell me what you heard.

502

The rumor goes that there is a physician

503
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,860
who can glimpse people's dreams
and treat their illness.

504
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,180
How can anyone

505
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,980

I guess Mr. Yuan

527

with blisters that sting,

531
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,060

Is that true?

536

She is a fraud instead of a physician.

The so-called "entering dreams"

00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,820

what Mr. Yuan said isn't the truth.

00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,500
I cannot enter anyone's dream,

547

but I can take a glimpse at it.

548
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,100
I saw someone

00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:02,940
Minister Yuan,

566
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,620
just do what she says.

567
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:07,780
Yes.

568
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,580
Your Majesty,

569
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,300
whenever I glimpse people's dreams,

570
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,700
I need some liquor.

571
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,620
I know

572
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,020
that Your Majesty favors the finest.

573
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,860
May I

574
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,260
ask for a cup of it?

575
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,860
Let her have it.

576
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,940
Mr. Yuan,

577
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,980
you have a tough mind,

578
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,700
but when I tell you

579
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,860
not to think of fire,

580
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,860
do you

581
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,460
have fire

582
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,900
in your mind?

583
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,580
What's the most pleasant moment for you?

584
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,580
Let me guess.

585
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,700
It will be when you are back
to your most familiar place.

586
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,500
It's completely silent.

587
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,860
You are alone, on the boat,

588
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,180
on the river.

589
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,500
Your arms are under your head.

590
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,020
And at this moment,

591
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,220
you feel a second of peace.

592
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,380
Watch out. It's hot!

593
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,180
Mother!

594
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,300
Father!

595
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,660
Shaocheng!

596
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,850
Shaocheng!

597
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,220
Father.

598
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,420
Watch out!

599
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,340
Tell me.

600
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,820
Why did he

601
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,300
behave like that?

602
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,220
What did you see

603
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,820
in him?

604
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:33,740
Your Majesty,

605
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,060
it's hatred.

606
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,420
I saw a very intense hatred.

607
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,460
For whom?

608
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:51,810
[Power]

609
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,660
Mr. Yuan's hatred comes from...

610
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,900
My. Yuan reached his hand

611
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,940
because he saw the woman he loved

612
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,580
in his memory.

613
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,180
He was opening his arms,

614
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,260
but suddenly, there were two kids,

615
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,700
and they were asking for their father.

616
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,140
Mr. Yuan realized

617
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,220
that the woman was already
the wife of another man.

618
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,740
That's why Mr. Yuan

619
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,700
comes across as so aloof

620
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,460
and remains unmarried

621
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,980
even though he's no longer young.

622
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,900
That makes sense now.

623
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,660
Minister Yuan,

624
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,140
is she

625
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,620
telling the truth?

626
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,060
Your Majesty,

627
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,860
what Ye Ping'an said

628
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,220
was indeed true.

629
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,500
It seems

630
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,460
that you do have

631
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,060
the skill to tell people's minds.

632
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,060
If I keep you alive,

633
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,740
and you help others

634
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,220
to guess my mind,

635
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,220
wouldn't I be putting myself at risk?

636
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,900
Well,

637
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,820
being merciful is a virtue.

638
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,780
I would like to see

639
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,420
if you can

640
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,300
save yourself now.

641
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,420
You have one day.

642
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,500
Find out the truth
before the curfew of tomorrow,

643
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,460
and you will live.

644
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,620
Otherwise,

645
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,340
you will be dead.

646
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,260
One day?

647
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,140
Yes.

648
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,100
I won't fail
your kindness, Your Majesty.

649
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:54,980
You may leave.

650
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,260
Yes.

651
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,020
Your Majesty,

652
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,660
her ability to glimpse others' dreams

653
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,980
is not as miraculous

654
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,180
as in the rumor,

655
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:13,980
but it is

656
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,260
truly remarkable.

657
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,660
It's not about glimpsing dreams.

658
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,340
She is smart

659
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,620
and very brave.

660
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,260
Perhaps

661
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,500
she has potential.

662
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,540
[Zhanlu Hall]
However, her life

663
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,540
is in her own hands now.

664
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,140
I can barely stand.

665
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,220
Help me out.

666
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,460
You were eloquent

667
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,380
when you were

668
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,380
making up the story inside.

669
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,140
Aloof?

670
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,020
Unmarried?

671
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,540
I was afraid of death

672
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,740
and trying to survive.

673
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,820
As a gracious man,

674
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,420
you will forgive me, right?

675
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,460
How did you know

676
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,180
that I was once burned?

677
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,660
When you asked me
to sign the confession letter,

678
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,460
I saw the scar on your hand.

679
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,500
Before we entered the hall,

680
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,340
you mentioned

681
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,300
the blisters on my hand.

682
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,740
That's when you started

683
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,580
to compel me.

684
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,260
I told you.

685
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,380
You have a tough mind.

686
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,380
The common way

687
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,700
cannot put you to sleep.

688
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,220
Where did you learn the witchcraft?

689
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,460
If this is witchcraft,

690
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,820
then witchcraft is everywhere.

691
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,300
The embroidery on your collar

692
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,340
makes you uncomfortable,

693
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,100
but why are you still wearing it?

694
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,260
It's because you believe

695
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,820
that it shows your status.

696
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,540
After all, all the nobles
have embroidery

697
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,780
on their attire.

698
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:32,900
You want to be part of them,

699
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,100
so you do the same.

700
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,620
Isn't it also

701
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,420
a witchcraft?

702
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,780
The Court of Judicial Review has checked

703
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,500
the crime scene,

704
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,180
but I still want to have a look myself.

705
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,140
One day is not a lot of time.

706
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:43,900
Shall we immediately...

707
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,100
You are going to die tomorrow,

708
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,020
while I'm not.

709
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,660
Why should I care?

710
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,100
Your people

711
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,500
are guarding the Zheng Mansion.

712
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,460
I won't be able to enter without you.

713
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,780
If you don't want to go,

714
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,540
I will have to follow you all the time

715
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,420
to see where you go

716
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,660
and who you see.

717
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,700
If

718
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,180
I have to die tomorrow,

719
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:00,900
I'm more than willing

720
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,100
to tell everything to Her Majesty.

721
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,180
You don't want me

722
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:03,700
to drag you down, do you?

723
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,180
Alright.

724
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,500
Say one more word,

725
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,020
and I will leave you alone to do it.

726
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,970
[Zheng Mansion]

727
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,380
Since the coroner has checked the body,

728
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,340
you must know

729
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,340
when Mr. Zheng died,

730
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:33,980
and I was not

731
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,780
in the mansion at that time.

732
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,900
You can keep denying it.

733
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,700
The body was not moved,

734
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,980
so it was likely that the murderer

735
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,860
suddenly appeared behind him

736
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,700
and cut his throat

737
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,180
when he was unaware.

738
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:50,820
You are now

739
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,420
telling me what you did.

740
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,700
May I ask

741
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,220
who the Court has interrogated?

742
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,620
The coachman.

743
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:00,860
The steward.

744
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,380
Both of them proved

745
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,140
that you never left the mansion.

746
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,900
What did they say exactly?

747
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,900
You entered the mansion
at the first hour of Hai.

748
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,620
Everyone in the mansion heard the gong

749
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,180
of the second hour of Hai.

750
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:11,860
It was

751
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,180
in this hour

752
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,620
that you committed the crime here.

753
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,540
Something is wrong.

754
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,580
Because the curfew was about to start,

755
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,500
I left the mansion in a hurry.

756
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,620
When I was home,

757
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:22,940
I read the handbook for a while

758
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,540
and then I was hunted.

759
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,180
After that, I came back
to the Zheng Mansion.

760
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,060
It would take at least an hour.

761
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,900
It should be the first hour of Zi.

762
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,540
Stop pretending.

763
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,540
You never left.

764
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,100
Otherwise, how could an hour

765
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,940
be missing?

766
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,220
One hour was gone.

767
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,700
How was it possible?

768
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,060
Mr. Yuan,

769
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,660
have you asked
the watchman last night?

770
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,940
It doesn't matter.

771
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,020
It won't change the fact

772
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,460
that you killed Mr. Zheng.

773
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,060
Mr. Yuan, an honorable man,

774
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,060
could you please see it
without the assumption

775
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,380
that I'm the murderer, just for once?

776
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,020
Wenyu,

777
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:12,700
check anyone

778
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,660
who left the mansion last night
after the murder.

779
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:15,620
Yes, sir.

780
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:22,660
Sir,

781
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:23,620
after investigation,

782
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,540
two persons left the Zheng Mansion

783
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,180
last night.

784
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:25,900
The servant Xiao Quan

785
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:26,940
was found dead on the outskirts.

786
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,940
The maid Xin is missing.

787
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,540
All we know is she has

788
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,060
a plum-blossom birthmark on her neck.

789
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,500
Is this the servant Xiao Quan

790
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,580
who left the mansion after the murder?

791
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,180
Yes, it's him,

792
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,260
sir.

793
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,700
This is a dead end now.

794
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,700
How about the maid Xin?

795
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:49,740
Can you find her?

796
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:50,820
If she is indeed

797
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,980
part of the murder,

798
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,380
I guess

799
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,980
she will end up like him.

800
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,060
If she was lucky and survived,

801
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,500
she is probably

802
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,660
out of town now.

803
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,980
It is the second hour of You,

804
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,980
only two hours from the curfew.

805
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,180
Wenyu,

806
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,060
go with the steward

807
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,620
and check everything
about Xiao Quan and Xin

808
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:11,420
when they started

809
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,540
working in the mansion.

810
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:13,860
Yes, sir.

811
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,460
Follow me.

812
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,260
We can

813
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,540
ask the watchman some questions

814
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,020
in the last two hours.

815
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,220
It's not necessary.

816
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,420
You can start thinking

817
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,900
about the words

818
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,700
on your tombstone.

Sir,

822
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:07,740
Zeng Xuan is here for a visit.

823
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,060
Mr. Zeng,

824
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,220
it's late.

825
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,460
What brings you here?

826
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:18,860
Please have a look at this, Mr. Yuan.

827
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,100
How's everything, Danxin?

828
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,540
Was it fun?

829
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,630
[Xin]

830
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,220
It was great fun.

831
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,180
[Lu Danxin]

832
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,500
Following your plan,

833
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,540
I worked in the mansion for over a year

834
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,220
and finally earned Zheng Yuan's trust.

835
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,500
Three days ago,

836
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,420
I saw Zheng Yuan receiving a letter

837
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,900
about Du Liang's corruption.

838
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,140
I sent a letter
to Du Liang on the same night

839
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,700
and let him know that Zheng Yuan

840
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,860
[Zheng Yuan has evidence against you.]
had the evidence of his corruption.

841
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,580
I turned them against each other.

842
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,220
Zheng Yuan.

843
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,500
I also

844
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,820
added more powder

845
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,140
that would keep him from falling asleep.

846
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,580
After you got his attention

847
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,020
on his path...

848
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,680
I'm Ye Ping'an, a psychiatrist.

849
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,740
I treat those with illness in mind.

850
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,580
I suggested him to ask you for help

851
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,140
and made sure
that Du Liang's spy knew about it.

852
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,620
Zheng Yuan was killed,

853
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,540
[The military fund is 85,000 Liang.]
and as you expected,

854
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,620
[Put 80,000 on the report]
you were the perfect scapegoat

855
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,860
[and send the rest to the outskirts.]
in Du Liang's mind.

856
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:29,900
You could

857
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,720
redeem yourself.

858
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,740
According to the plan,

859
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,580
I switched several identities

860
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,140
and spread rumors about you.

861
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,190
It finally got the Empress's interest.

862
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:43,140
A decree from Her Majesty.

863
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:51,980
Am I

864
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,340
a good scapegoat?

865
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,260
Well, I'm also

866
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,580

867
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,220
The first step

868
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,220
is done.

869
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,820
It's time for the next move.

870
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,460
Du Liang didn't expect

871
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,260
that Zheng Yuan had a backup plan.

872
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,940
He wrote a letter

873
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,940
exposing the corruption
of the military fund

874
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,460
and gave it to his friend, Zeng Xuan.

875
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,180
A good friend of Zheng Yuan

876
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,780
reports that Du Liang
is behind Zheng's murder.

877
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,900
That will be more convincing.

878
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,420
Something's wrong.

879
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,300
Zeng Xuan went missing.

880
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:19,340
What?

881
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,780
[Accusation Letter]
I am the left rectifier, Zheng Yuan.

882
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,500
I would like to report

883
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,620
for taking 5,000 Liang
of the military fund for his own use.

If I unfortunately die,

885

00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:31,860
Where did you get it?

887
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,500
Mr. Zheng is the left rectifier

888
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,100
with the power
to report directly to Her Majesty.

889
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,540
After knowing Du Liang's corruption,

890
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:37,900
he wanted to tell Her Majesty,

891
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:38,940
but Du Liang

892
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,500
was one step ahead
and asked questions to test him.

893
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,260
Mr. Zheng realized that Du Liang

894
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,860
might have known it.

895
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,140
Zeng Xuan,

896
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,140
keep this letter carefully.

897
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,660
Are you afraid
that Du Liang will kill you?

898
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,460
But you are a high-ranking official.

899
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,300
Even if he is...

900
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,220
You don't know how cruel he can be.

901
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,300
Years ago,

902
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,900
I was his adviser.

If anything happens to me,

904
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,140
hand it

905
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,460
to someone you trust.

906
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,900
Why bring it out now?

907
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,780
I have no power

908
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,340
and no means to have
a direct audience with Her Majesty.

909
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,380
I heard a female murderer was caught,

910
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,100
so I couldn't show anyone the letter.

911
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,420

913
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,420
So only now, as this case
is being re-investigated,

914
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,460
do I dare to make it known.

915

No.

as I left home.

919
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,620
I managed to shake them

00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,700
before coming to see you.

921
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:28,980
Mr. Zeng,

922
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,940
to be honest,

923

not only Du Liang and I

924

have no common interest,

925
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:34,900
but we also have history.
