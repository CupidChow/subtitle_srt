[Kill My Sins]
[This is a work of fiction]

2
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,940
May my mother's illness

3
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:45,940
get better soon.

4
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,130
This is my decision.

5
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,900
Hatred is the grittiest power.

6
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,650
But you've known Ping'an for four years.

7
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,410
Can you make up your mind?

8
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,300
Compared to what I've been carrying,

9
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:36,850
four years

10
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,250
are nothing.

11
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,060
From now on,

12
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,370
I'll make my own decision.

00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,920
[Episode 19]
[Extinguished Light, Last Goodbye]

14
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,060
Ankang,

15
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,810
this toast is to you.

16
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,690
Excellent!

17
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,460
Xian'er, you can really hold
your liquor now.

18
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,570
I learned from the best.

19
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:35,850
Don't drink so much

20
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,690
when you're out there on your own.

21
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,180
Don't worry.

22
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:41,530
Finally!

23
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:42,340
Take a seat.

24
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,060
It won't be so good if it gets cold.

25
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,180
Today,

26
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,970
the osmanthus liquor
is specifically chosen for you.

27
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:47,650
Nice, right?

28
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,850
Thank you for letting me try
all the delicacies.

29
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,810
Don't even mention it.

30
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,690
I heard

31
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,060
you visited Her Majesty,

32
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,850
but she refused to see you.

33
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:58,690
Xian'er,

34
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,530
you are always around Her Majesty.

35
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,090
Do you know

36
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,940
why I was turned away?

37
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,220
Either you made a mistake

38
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,810
and Her Majesty didn't like it,

39
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,970
or she

40
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,650
knows exactly what you're going to say

41
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,010
but doesn't want to respond.

42
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,620
If it's the latter,

43
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,180
it is in vain even if you ask me

44
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,180
to convince her.

45
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,860
That's pretty much what I thought.

46
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,210
Why did you want to see

47
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:28,620
Her Majesty?

48
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,940
I wanted to ask

49
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,620
for permission
to investigate an old case.

50
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:33,890
What case?

51
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,330
General Wu,

52
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:39,980
Li Zongxu was the one

53
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,940
who obstructed
the transportation of grain and salt

54
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,130
to the border
during the Battle of Jinyuan.

55
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,620
Five years ago,

56
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,540
he gave up the lives

57
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,370
of commoners and soldiers

58
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,570
for his own interest.

59
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,180
Five years later,

60
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,570
he used the banquet

61
00:04:58,890 --> 00:04:59,810
to frame Yuan Shaocheng

62
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,500
out of greed.

63
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,860
Such a disgrace to our realm.

64
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,180
However,

65
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,450
he has nothing to do
with the unlicensed salt trader you got

66
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,770
out of the capital.

67
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,100
If the salt

68
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,100
was not from him,

69
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,250
this is worse.

70
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,180
I'm afraid

71
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,420
that the Granary Magistrate, Gong Shao,

72
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,690
is involved.

73
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,210
Gong Shao?

74
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,860
Gong Shao

75
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,420
and Xu Qing.

76
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,740
I need to get a chance

77
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,250
to check the Dongqiao Salt Granary.

78
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,010
Ankang, you don't have any evidence.

79
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,370
It would be better to avoid

80
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,250
any direct conflict with him.

81
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,500
Or they will be on guard.

82
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:37,540
Don't worry.

83
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,330
I have my plan.

84
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,060
Welcome back, Ping'an.

85
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,300
Ping'an.

86
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,980
Aunt, are you making flatbread?

87
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,740
Yes.

88
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:21,620
Did you forget

89
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,660
the Mid-Autumn Festival

90
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,100
is in a few days?

91
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,660
So I was thinking
about making flatbread.

92
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,570
I can sell half of it,

93
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,420
and the other half

94
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,210
will be for you!

95
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:30,980
Just a minute.

96
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,660
I'll be right there.

97
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:33,860
Try it.

98
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,060
How does it

99
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,500
taste?

100
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,620
What are you doing?

101
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,570
Try it now.

102
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,420
Is it good?

103
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:42,860
Yes!

104
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,330
By the way, Nichang,

105
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,570
have you decided on the date

106
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,370
to leave for Yangzhou?

107
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,300
I'm not in a hurry.

108
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,540
The Mid-Autumn Festival
is a day for togetherness.

109
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,010
I need to stay here and have the meal

110
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,370
with everyone first.

111
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,540
Are you kicking me away?

112
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,940
No.

113
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,130
How dare I?

114
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,100
Mrs. Gu,

115
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,130
the baozi is filled with crab roe.

116
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,570
I didn't know we could afford

117
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,980
something like this!

118
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,330
Gui brought us

119
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,740
these.

120
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,300
You two

121
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,860
may be fellow disciples,

122
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,690
but why do I feel like

123
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,420
there's something more to it?

124
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,420
You're good

125
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,330
with words, aren't you?

126
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,770
Even all the food

127
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,690
can't keep your mouth

128
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,180
busy?

129
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:27,940
Alright.

130
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:28,860
I will feed you.

131
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,620
You didn't

132
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,810
try the flatbread.

133
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:31,370
Here you go.

134
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,010
Try it.

135
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:32,570
It's too big!

136
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,060
Try it!

137
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,770
Okay.

138
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,330
Aunt and Nichang

139
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,940
have found their next stop.

140
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:40,980
I guess when we are old,

141
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,660
we have to bear with each other

142
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,180
and share one bed.

143
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,740
I don't want that.

144
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,250
You roll around all the time

145
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,370
when you sleep,

146
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,370
like flipping a pancake.

147
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,330
When you roll over, you wake me up.

148
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,500
Am I still going to get

149
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,180
the sack you make for me?

150
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,420
Stop asking about it.

151
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,770
It's almost done.

152
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:03,450
Let me have a peek.

153
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,980
I will give it to you in a few days.

154
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,770
What's the smell?

155
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,860
My flatbread!

156
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,860
I forgot about it.

157
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,570
Oh no.

158
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,330
It's burnt!

159
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:17,860
It's hot!

160
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,100
Watch out!

161
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:20,620
It's hot!

162
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,860
Now we are going to get
some burnt flatbread.

163
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,250
Ping'an,

164
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,890
I'm working for Qixi Painting Shop

165
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,100
and am going
to the Hai Mansion tomorrow.

166
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,210
If there's any news,

167
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,260
I will let you know.

168
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:33,730
Okay.

169
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,660
Danxin,

170
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:42,850
be careful.

171
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,850
[Hai Mansion]

172
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:54,690
Check this out.

173
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,420
This is indigo,

174
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,330
emerald green,

175
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,450
and maple red.

176
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,210
Here you go.

177
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,090
This way.

178
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,180
It looks great.

179
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,180
Miss Hai would love it.

180
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,450
That old man must be a poor man.

181
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,090
Why is he here in the mansion?

182
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:11,900
It's normal.

183
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,380
Mr. Hai is a kind man.

184
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,060
People who get bullied

185
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,660
would often come

186
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,940
to beg for his help.

187
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,780
I've checked everything.

188
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:20,450
You may leave.

189
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:20,940
Of course.

190
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,570
Master, there's some good news.

191
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,060
Following your instructions,

192
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,540
we found the person

193
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:28,690
in Tongquan.

194
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,450
Go ahead.

195
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,420
Greetings, sir.

196
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,450
Tell me

197
00:09:58,730 --> 00:09:59,690
what you know.

198
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,660
If you do well, you will be rewarded,

199
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,660
but if you lie about anything,

200
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,210
you know the consequences.

201
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,180
Well...

202
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:08,780
Well...

203
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,180
I... I'm also not sure

204
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,450
if Miss Ye

205
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,450
is the little girl from Tongquan

206
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,380
back in the day.

207
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,900
The steward said

208
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,020
she could

209
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,090
compel and put people to sleep.

210
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,660
It makes me feel like

211
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,610
they are the same person.

212
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:25,690
What's the name

213
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:26,610
of the girl?

214
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,540
Her last name is Gu,

215
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,540
and she's called Gu Qing.

216
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,450
I remember once

217
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,210
when my grandson was back, he told me

218
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,420
that Gu Qing was holding

219
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,420
something special.

220
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,420
She was shaking the thing,

221
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:38,730
and then he fell asleep.

222
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,060
When he woke up,

223
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,210
his face was painted

224
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,140
in a mess.

225
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:42,850
I asked him,

226
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,610
but he said
he couldn't remember anything.

227
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,090
It could be a joke

228
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,140
from the kids.

229
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,090
It's not reliable.

230
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,570
Not only my grandson,

231
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,260
but I also saw it.

232
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:54,850
What did you see?

233
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,180
Well...

234
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,260
You are hesitating,

235
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,850
which means you are making it up.

236
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,260
Somebody.

237
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,330
Sir,

238
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,060
I was going to

239
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,060
take it to the grave.

240
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,660
It was so strange!

241
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,690
On that day,

242
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:24,850
back then,

243
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,330
Gu Qing was a little girl.

244
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:27,690
She was the one

245
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,260
who led the women
to the abandoned house.

246
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:32,940
Then the house

247
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:33,940
was burned

248
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,540
by the censor...

249
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,450
No, by the other person.

250
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,900
Everyone there was dead.

251
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,330
It was horrific.

252
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:42,660
Since then,

253
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,900
Gu Qing's entire family disappeared.

254
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:45,900
Sir,

255
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,330
isn't that

256
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,330
strange and scary?

257
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,970
You did great.

258
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,940
You can get your reward
from the steward.

259
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,260
Thank you, sir.

260
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,540
I appreciate it.

261
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:08,690
Sir,

262
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,300
why did you ask me

263
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,380
to repeat what I told you the other day?

264
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,610
Do you trust me now?

265
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,660
I saw with my own eyes

266
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:18,610
that Gu Qing

267
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,060
made them fall asleep.

268
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:23,570
I got it.

269
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:24,900
You may leave.

270
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,660
Yes, sir.

271
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:35,330
Master,

272
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,450
I was watching Ye Ping'an these days,

273
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,940
and I noticed a woman

274
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,260
who was very close to Ye Ping'an.

275
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:41,660
They wanted to get into the mansion

276
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,380
by delivering the paint.

277
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:47,730
Well done.

278
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,330
Since she wanted to enter here,

279
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,020
ask her
to bring the paint here tomorrow.

280
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,260
I will

281
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,300
have something big for her in return.

282
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,090
Rest assured,

283
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,380
I will transfer Xu Qing
out of the capital.

284
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:01,970
It will

285
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,090
be a dead end for them.

286
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,900
What's your plan

287
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,570
against Ye Ping'an?

288
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,060
The reason Du Liang and Li Zongxu

289
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,610
lost to Ye Ping'an

290
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,470
is that

291
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,430
none of them

292
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,110
found her true weakness,

293
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,780
but I do.

294
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,710
The most frightening thing

295
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,660
is not the enemy,

296
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,990
but the friend
you spend all your time with.

297
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,590
Guess what I learned

298
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,110
from the Hai Mansion today?

299
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,190
What made you

300
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,590
so excited?

301
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,310
Nothing important, actually.

302
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,070
I guess Hai Yiping realized

303
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,350
that I was overhearing,

304
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,780
and he found a conman

305
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,350
to put on a show for me.

306
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,430
The conman said

307
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,190
he was from Tongquan,

308
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,950
and that he knew you.

309
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,070
He said that over a decade ago,

310
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,830
he saw you compelling a woman

311
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,500
and leading her to an abandoned house.

312
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,470
How is that even possible?

313
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,260
It's a terrible story.

314
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,830
Also,

315
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,230
your last name is Ye,

316
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:52,230
but the name he made up was Gu Qing.

317
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,110
Ping'an,

318
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,860
I was worried that he would
ruin your reputation.

319
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,350
Maybe we should take him...

320
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,260
My former name...

321
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,350
No!

322
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,020
Ping'an.

323
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,140
My former name was Gu Qing.

324
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,990
What you said is true.

325
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,260
I lied to you.

326
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,110
I've been lying to you.

327
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,190
I told you about my past,

328
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,070
but it was a lie.

329
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,260
No,

330
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,740
it wasn't entirely a lie.

331
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,820
The first survivor

332
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,420
I met from the censor's case

333
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,900
was Ruan Qin.

334
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,540
The butterfly pendant

335
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,430
was hers.

336
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,660
I could only

337
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,260
watch her

338
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,830
when she

339
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,540
jumped off the cliff.

340
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,990
Du Liang and Zheng Yuan

341
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,900
tricked me

342
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,110
into compelling

343
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,990
three women

344
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,780
to the abandoned house.

345
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,260
Since I was just a kid,

346
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,950
no one would suspect me.

347
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,110
Mrs. Gu,

348
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,350
you knew it a long time ago,

349
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:38,860
right?

350
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,470
Now I know

351
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,740
why you can't fall asleep every night

352
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,660
even with the calming incense.

353
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,070
The nonsense about sharing the pain

354
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,470
and sticking together.

355
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,470
How ironic.

356
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,100
You are here to pay for your sins.

357
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,910
Once you find

358
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,230
survivors like us,

359
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,540
you cling to them,

360
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,500
your only hope for atonement.

361
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:21,870
You are right.

362
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,230
I know you too well.

363
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:29,870
All these years,

364
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,430
you've been tortured by guilt.

365
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,820
You tried everything

366
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,950
to make up for what happened,

367
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,190
so that you could get a moment of peace.

368
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,470
You are always scheming.

369
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,500
You are only using us

370
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,300
as a blade.

371
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:46,870
You are right.

372
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,540
Do you know

373
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,060
that if it weren't for you,

374
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,390
some of these girls wouldn't have died?

375
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,710
They could have spent
the rest of their lives

376
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,190
with their family.

377
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,150
You're to blame

378
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,100
for Du Liang's

379
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,190
boldness

380
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,470
and these abductions.

381
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,340
Have you heard their cries

382
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,950
when they were burnt alive?

383
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,300
Ye Ping'an,

384
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,190
you are full of sins.

385
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,820
You are right.

386
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,540
Danxin!

387
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:25,990

00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,260
and watched his family die?

579
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,540
Yu Qian

580
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,060
was too stubborn.

581
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,710
I tried to convince him to leave it,

582
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,060
but

583
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,230
he insisted.

584
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,340
That's why you planted the evidence

585
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,470
and framed him up?

586
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,230
Why would someone

587
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,540
who has been planning to kill me

588
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,870
bring only a crossbow?

589
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,540
Instead of a knife?

590
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,150
What do you want most?

591
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,020
To overturn the censor's case.

592
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,910
Then think about

593
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,630
the words

594
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,710
Hai Yiping wanted you
to hear from the man.

595
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,500
What's his goal?

596
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,740
He wants us to turn against each other.

597
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,150
He wants

598
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,780
to use me

599
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,430
to kill Ye Ping'an.

600
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,990
I'm going to fake the assassination

601
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,230
and get caught by him.

602
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,020
Danger can never be overcome

603
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,910
without taking risks.

604
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,230
I

605
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,380
underestimated you.

606
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:16,780
No.

607
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,060
You know

608
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,580
very well about me.

609
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,340
However, instead of ambushing me
when I was out,

610
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,780
you took the risk
to come to the mansion.

611
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,140
You are not here to kill me.

612
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,300
You want to get caught

613
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,710
and learn more from me.

614
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,820
What's ridiculous

615
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,470
is that Ye Ping'an actually thought

616
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,510
that you were going to kill me.

617
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,380
She even wanted to stop you.

618
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,750
Stop bringing her up.

619
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,340
She and I

620
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,620
are not on the same path anymore.

621
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,230
There is something I share

622
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,270
with Ye Ping'an.

623
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,780
We both want

624
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,430
to erase our connection

625
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,430
with the censor's case so much.

626
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,380
You are not

627
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:10,860
her concern.

628
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,380
Mr. Hai is not going to think

629
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,780
I can be convinced

630
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,380
by only a few words, right?

631
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:19,950
Somebody.

632
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:20,780
Untie her.

633
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:21,820
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

634
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,060
If you want to leave,

635
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,230
do it now.

636
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,750
If not,

637
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,140
tomorrow,

638
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,820
I'll take you somewhere.

639
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,580
Why are you sitting here?

640
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,300
It's cold.

641
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,580
Go inside.

642
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,270
Where are you going?

643
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,340
I heard

644
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,300
that Xu Qing

645
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,620
is going to be transferred
to a local county.

646
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,710
The order
was from the Ministry of Personnel.

647
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,100
It probably has something to do with Hai Yiping.

648
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,670
I want to see
if I can get more information

649
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,820
before he leaves the capital.

650
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,190
Maybe

651
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,750
I can find something.

652
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,340
Danxin

653
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,270
used to treat you

654
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,340
as the one she trusted most.

655
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,990
The truth was too cruel for her.

656
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,710
I'm afraid that she would harm herself.

657
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,860
She needs some time to take it in.

658
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,060
I will talk to her.

659
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,510
Take care of yourself, too.

660
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:43,780
Also,

661
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,510
how did Hai Yiping find out

662
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,190
about your past?

663
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,140
We need to figure that out.

664
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:50,470
Alright.

665
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,580
Get inside.

666
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:08,860
Miss,

667
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,910
you must be Miss Ye.

668
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:12,910
That's right.

669
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:14,780
Qing,

670
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:15,990
it's you!

671
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:16,780
Qing,

672
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,060
I can't recognize you

673
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,430
anymore!

674
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,510
You are...

675
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,030
It's me!

676
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,300
Zhu Laosan.

677
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,670
The one who sells pork intestines!

678
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,100
My grandson

679
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,270
Zhu Yuanbao

680
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,860
used to play with you a lot.

681
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,470
I remember it now.

682
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,670
You are here in the capital.

683
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,230
I have to go.

684
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,540
Wait.

685
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,990
I set up a tea house
on the edge of the capital.

686
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:38,820
Let's catch up.

687
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:39,710
I...

688
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,430
Let's go.

689
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,340
It's just around the corner.

690
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:49,470
[Tea]

691
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,470
Have some tea.

692
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,030
The rent of the capital is high.

693
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,540
I've been working on this for two days.

694
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,030
It's finally coming together.

695
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,620
But I still don't have everything yet.

696
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,140
Since you don't have a lot of money,

697
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,100
why are you starting a tea house

698
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,100
in the capital?

699
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:06,510
Well...

700
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,140
It's all because of you.

701
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,180
Me?

702
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,220
Yes.

703
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,100
You were a strange girl.

704
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,100
I talked about it with your mother,

705
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:14,950
about...

706
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,180
About your skill of compelling others.

707
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,950
It would make you in trouble.

708
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:19,990
I saw

709
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,510
how you led the woman

710
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,700
into the abandoned house.

711
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,140
I thought

712
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,310
you were just having fun.

713
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,310
It turned out...

714
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:33,910
So

715
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,470
you are the one who spread it out.

716
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,790
About that,

717
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,950
I saw it by accident.

718
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,950
Now that I get it straight,

719
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,220
I see what was going on.

720
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,950
You must be worried.

721
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,620
You were also involved

722
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,620
in the death of those women.

723
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,390
The past is the past.

724
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,470
Your tea house

725
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,790
is not in a good location,

726
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,580
and you don't know the capital
or anyone here.

727
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,220
You should go back to Tongquan.

728
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,100
I can hire a carriage for you.

729
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,350
Sure.

730
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,470
My grandson is a grown-up man now.

731
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,180
He should have married someone,

732
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,990
but the ladies in Tongquan

733
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:10,870
look down on him

734
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,220
for he is a poor man
who sells pork intestines.

735
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,430
It's not good.

736
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:16,540
How about

737
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,910
you give me 500 liang,

738
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,540
and I'm done

739
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,700
with this tea house?

740
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,390
It's up to you.

741
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,830
You'd better think it through.

742
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:27,740
People in the capital

743
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,540
have no idea what you've done.

744
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,390
If you don't give me the money,

745
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,430
I'm going to tell everyone

746
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,140
about how you tricked the women

747
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,220
into the abandoned house.

748
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,140
I'm the witness.

749
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,390
Do you remember
how many women you tricked?

750
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,540
Three, five,

751
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,910
or seven?

752
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,220
My word is evidence

753
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,620
of your sins!

754
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,390
Help me!

755
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,390
Grab my hand.

756
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,140
Help!

757
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:18,990
Help!

758
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,140
There is

759
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,830
no one else.

760
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,100
He fell by accident.

761
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,510
No one will suspect anything.

762
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,310
It's about her old sins.

763
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,950
Guess what she would do?

764
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,510
I know her.

765
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:33,660
She won't.

766
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:35,990
Help!

767
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:39,790
Help!

768
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,830
You told me

769
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,700
to bring her here

770
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,390
and wash the mop by the river.

771
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,060
You didn't

772
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,220
tell me about this!

773
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,220
Now you see it, right?

774
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,990
What you used to believe

775
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,180
is wrong.

776
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,100
When it comes to the sins
they've committed,

777
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,100
what she did

778
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,870
is no different

779
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:25,950
from what Du Liang

780
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,260
or Li Zongxu did.

781
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,700
Ye Ping'an is judging the others,

782
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,220
but she should start with herself.

783
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:35,910
You should know

784
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,910
that people forget.

785
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,220
How many people are there

786
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:39,950
who still remember

787
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,140
the censor's case?

788
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,350
Life is short.

789
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,390
Don't consider

790
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,510
what you are doing

791
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,580
as a great deal.

792
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,220
I don't care about

793
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:50,830
what others think.

794
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,990
Even if I'm the only one left,

795
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,180
I'm going

796
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,790
to bring justice

797
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,510
to Yu Qian and all the women.

798
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,350
It's not impossible

799
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,870
to achieve your goal.

800
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,620
I only need one thing from you

801
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,790
and I can get you

802
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,990
the result you want most.

803
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,430
You want

804
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,660
Ye Ping'an's life,

805
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:15,870
right?

806
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,870
Why do you allow me to live,

807
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,060
but not her?

808
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,510
In the Warring States period,

809
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,430
Gongshu Cuo

810
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,470
gave his advice to King Hui of Wei

811
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,950
before he got severely ill:

812
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,510
"Appoint Shang Yang,

813
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:31,870
or kill him."

814
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,700
King Hui didn't listen to his words.

815
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,220
Later, Shang Yang turned to Qin state.

816
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,140
After a while,

817
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,100
Qin destroyed

818
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,430
Wei.

819
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:45,580
That's

820
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,950
the way it is

821
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,430
for those who are different.

822
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,790
Even without the censor's case,

823
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:52,660
if she is on my side,

824
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,510
I can keep her.

825
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,260
If she's against me,

826
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,660
she must die.

827
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,540
What can you give me in return?

828
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:01,740
Are you

829
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,180
going to overturn the case

830
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,510
with me in person?

831
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,870
Why not?

832
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,430
Let me ask you.

833
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,910
Can you tell me

834
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,180
how am I involved

835
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,950
in the censor's case?

836
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,100
You...

837
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,430
I can overturn the case

838
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,220
for Yu Qian and the women who suffered,

839
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,180
and make sure
Li Zongxu and the others are sentenced.

840
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,390
I'm the only one who can help you.

841
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,740
All I ask is to kill Ye Ping'an for me.

842
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,030
How are you going to do that?

843
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,870
Everyone thought all the women

844
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:45,870
were dead.

845
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,580
No one can prove

846
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,220
that you are the victim of the case.

847
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:50,990
However, as an old friend

848
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,740
of Yu Qian back then,

849
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,350
I can introduce you

850
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,870
to Guo Yu,
Minister of Court of Judicial Review,

851
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,660
and prove your identity.

852
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:01,870
It's a good offer,

853
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,060
but not enough.

854
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:06,660
Ye Ping'an

855
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,260
was my best friend.

856
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,030
I've spent
four years with her day and night.

857
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:12,830
Her life

858
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,510
should be worth more.

859
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,910
True. Keep going.

860
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,350
To ask the Court of Judicial Review
to reinvestigate,

861
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,990
my words as a commoner

862
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,870
is not convincing at all.

863
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,580
The file of the censor's case is burnt.

864
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,790
There's no other physical evidence.

865
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,350
I have no proof

866
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,350
of Yu Qian's innocence.

867
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,700
After I kill Ye Ping'an for you,

868
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,830
you can simply

869
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,950
break your promise.

870
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,430
Why should I trust you?

871
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,950
I have a letter

872
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,350
Yu Qian wrote to me

873
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,620
when he was in jail.

874
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,260
In the letter,

875
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,870
he wrote down

876
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,510
that he was framed

877
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,140
by Du Liang.

878
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:03,670
[Yu Qian]

879
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,100
This is the handwriting of Yu Qian.

880
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,310
I didn't lie to you.

881
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,540
You were

882
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,180
Mr. Yu's last hope

883
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,910
back at that time,

884
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,180
but you chose

885
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,870
to stand aside.

886
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:28,910
I'm warning you.

887
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,620
At the Court of Judicial Review,

888
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,580
repeat everything

889
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,140
I've told you,

890
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,740
word for word.

891
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,350
If you say anything wrong,

892
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,260
no one will be able to help you.

893
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,060
You are the hope to overturn the case.

894
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,580
You can trust me.

895
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:47,990
However,

896
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,140
are you indeed
going to give me the letter?

897
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,790
Don't you worry
that the Court of Judicial Review

898
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,310
would question you
for not turning it in back then?

899
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,140
The letter is only
circumstantial evidence.

900
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,740
Nobody trusted the words of Yu Qian

901
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,060
at the time.

902
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,030
Even if I showed the letter,

903
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,060
I couldn't save him.

904
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,220
And I will

905
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,910
get myself into trouble.

906
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,140
I buried it
deep down in my heart for years.

907
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:10,990
Only after

908
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,510
I met a victim, you,

909
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,100
did I dare to show this letter

910
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,990
and overturn the case for Yu Qian.

911
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,620
Buried it deep down, huh?

912
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,620
What an admirable act,

913
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,350
Mr. Hai.

914
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,140
I will give you the box

915
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,510
for sure

916
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,310
if you can do what you said.

917
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,310
However, how are you
going to convince me

918
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,470
that you can make up your mind

919
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,620
and kill Ye Ping'an?

920
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:50,950
You will see.

921
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,510
In the world,

922
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,060
I am

923
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,870
