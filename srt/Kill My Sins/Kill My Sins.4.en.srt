[Episode 4]
[Yesterday's Enemy, Today's Friend]

3
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,590
The military fund.

4
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,390
So that's why Qi Junshan

5
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,670
smashed the gambling house today.

6
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,110
Where is the rest of it?

7
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,830
Spill it

8
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,960
and you will suffer less.

9
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,870
Mr. Du, are you trying to get credit

10
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,200
by interrogating me here,

11
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,430
or are you not happy

12
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,640
with the 5,000 Liang

13
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,830
in your hands?

14
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,270
If I do have the military fund,

15
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,240
why would I

16
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,240
hide one ingot of it

17
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,430
in the gambling house,

18
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,320
waiting for someone to find it?

19
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,960
These ingots have a seal on them.

20
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,200
I can't use them on the market.

21
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,990
Why wouldn't I melt them?

22
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,870
Nobody can find

23
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,830
the military fund now.

24
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,670
How did you get the ingot?

25
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,920
You wanted to say someone framed you,

26
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,240
but why would anyone do that?

27
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,430
Mr. Du, take it easy.

28
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,240
Think about it.

29
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,920
They framed me

30
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,830
because they were afraid of me.

31
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,240
They knew

32
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,040
that only I

33
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,870
can find the fund now.

34
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,640
That was why

35
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,320
they were turning us against each other.

36
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,710
Do you have any leads?

37
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,360
If you keep me here

38
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,800
for any longer,

39
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,800
I'm afraid
that there will be nothing left.

40
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,080
If it's as you said,

41
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,110
that they value you this much,

42
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,520
I will give you seven days.

43
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,680
Five days...

44
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,150
will be enough.

45
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,710
I learned the lesson well today.

46
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,830
Also,

47
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,230
I don't have another option.

48
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,200
All I hope

49
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,960
is that one day,

50
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,760
when you rise to the vice minister,

51
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,590
you'll take me along.

52
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,200
You are smart

53
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,520
for choosing the right side.

54
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,390
There is one more thing

55
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,200
I would like to ask, Mr. Du.

56
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,390
How did Qi Junshan know

57
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,680
that there would be an ingot

58
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,350
in the gambling house?

59
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,200
Shaocheng.

60
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:10,960
Sir.

61
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,440
Shaocheng!

62
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,000
Who did this?

63
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,150
Help me.

64
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:16,830
Get out of the way.

65
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,350
Here is water.

66
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,470
Don't get so close.

67
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,640
He needs to breathe.

68
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,590
Move.

69
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,270
Stop yelling.

70
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,030
I'm okay.

71
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:26,640
Shaocheng,

72
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,830
hang on.

73
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:33,710
Hesheng,

74
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,390
let me check his wound.

75
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,080
You all can leave.

76
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,000
He will be fine.

77
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,120
- Go.
- Let's go.

78
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,760
Tell me.

79
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,880
Who did it?

80
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,470
Du Liang.

81
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,470
Du Liang?

82
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,680
Aren't you allies?

83
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:51,910
Why would he

84
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,960
do this to you?

85
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,270
Allies?

86
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,590
We are only making use of each other.

87
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,390
One day,

88
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,590
I will make him pay for it.

89
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,520
Qi Junshan.

90
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,120
All his dirty tricks.

91
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,230
I won't

92
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,640
let this slide.

93
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,790
It's not a big wound,

94
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,200
but it's deep.

[Bai Sheng, Yuan Hesheng's wife]
Before

96
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,470
trying to get revenge,

97
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,030
you should know

98
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:16,910
your position better.

99
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,350
This is

100
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,910
not helping.

101
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,680
If he hadn't taken

102
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,640
Qi Junshan's gambling house

103
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,590
and got involved with people

104
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,200
like Du Liang,

105
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,440
he wouldn't have been like this.

I...

107
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,390
Forget what she said.

108
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,120
Don't make any reckless moves

109

against Qi Junshan.

110

It is

111
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,270
not the time

112
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,030
to make an enemy.

Check on your wife.

114
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,710
I'm fine.

Wenyu,

00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,270
take care of him.

117
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,560
It's not good.

118
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,910
I was outside the Yuan Mansion,

119
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,560
and Yuan Shaocheng was back.

120
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,120
That was quick.

121
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,760
Maybe

122
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,470
he's made a new deal

123
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,640
with Du Liang.

124
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,710
Are Gui and his people out of town?

125
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:15,350
Yes.

126
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,120
Ask them to return.

127
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,390
We can't do anything tonight.

128
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,710
Then what about the fund?

129
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,030
We can find another chance.

130
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,320
The most important thing now

131
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,910
is not to make any mistakes.

132
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,150
Yuan Shaocheng

133
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,470
won't let this go.

134
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,760
I need to think of a solution.

135
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,350
Everyone, be more cautious.

136
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,590
Why are you

137
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,150
taking the bridal attire out?

138
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,640
When you two were on the battlefield,

139
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,760
I told myself

140
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,000
that if you made it back,

141
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,830
I would put it on and marry you.

142
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,590
If you were dead,

143
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,080
I would put on the mourning dress

144
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,320
and bring you home.

145
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,320
I made it back,

146
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,150
didn't I?

147
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:13,680
Yes,

148
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,390
you made it,

149
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,590
but you changed as well.

150
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,680
Your brother changed more.

151
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,440
He used to say

152
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,350
he would make people in Mang Gutter
live a better life,

153
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,520
but now, he is together
with the corrupt officials,

154
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,760
craving for power.

155
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,230
I'm his elder brother.

156
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,560
I have to protect him.

157
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,510
Brothers always

158
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,630
stay together.

159
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:40,400
Fine.

160
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,230
I'm fine with your brother.

161
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,630
If one day,

162
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,750
you are back like the way he is today,

163
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,110
I will not shed a tear for you.

164
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,040
Bai Sheng,

165
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,560
trust me.

166
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,920
I knew you were awake.

167
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,830
When I couldn't fall asleep,

168
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,230
my mother would hold me like this

169
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,830
to make me feel safe.

170
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,990
After a while, I would fall asleep.

171
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,440
We have known each other
for a long time.

172
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,710
This is the first time

173
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,350
you told me about your family.

174
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,110
When my mother was young,

175
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,230
she traveled a lot.

176
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,960
She only settled down

177
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,750
because of me.

178
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,830
In my memory,

179
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,350
I never met my father,

180
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,510
but my mother was always good to me.

181
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,960
She told me

182
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,710
it was important
to be a sensible person.

183
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,710
She saved a basket of eggs.

184
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,630
She didn't eat them

185
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,750
but exchanged them with others
for old books.

186
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,680
That was how I got to read

187
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:34,680
and write.

188
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,320
Life was simple

189
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,470
but happy as well.

190
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,800
Then she fell sick.

191
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,470
I was going to the woods
to get some herbs for her.

192
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,560
When I left,

193
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,200
she smiled at me.

Hurry.

387
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,290
Be careful. Easy.

388
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,050
Pass it to me.

389
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,490
Watch out.

390
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:31,250
Easy.

391
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,290
Easy.

392
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,330
Down the end.

393
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:34,700
Mr. Gu,

394
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,020
you have to

395
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,730
keep it well.

396
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,460
Send a few more guards.

397
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,740
The entry

398
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,090
of the secret tunnel

399
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:41,810
has to be covered.

400
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,660
Don't worry.

401
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,770
[Mr. Gu]

402
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:44,810
It's all been taken care of.

403
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:45,940
Shaocheng,

404
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,250
do you understand
how terrible it can go?

405
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,530
It's not only about you,

406
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:51,260
but about every one of us.

407
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,530
The greater the risk,

408
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:53,530
the bigger the reward.

409
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,500
I'm doing it
for the people of Mang Gutter.

410
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:57,220
Your father

411
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,290
was my best friend.

412
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,460
I treat you

413
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,330
like my own son.

414
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:02,770
Mr. Gu,

415
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,490
since I was young,

416
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,460
I've always

417
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:06,490
respected you,

418
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,500
but this time,

419
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:09,810
I've made my decision.

420
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,090
Listen to me.

421
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,050
Hand it in after a couple of days.

422
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:14,940
It will be

423
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,420
a feather in your cap.

424
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,900
Forget about your other plans.

425
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,570
Stop!

426
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:23,980
Come on.

427
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:26,900
Watch out.

428
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:27,900
Easy.

429
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:32,900
Be careful.

430
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,500
Shaocheng,

431
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,050
I didn't mean it.

432
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,010
You've done enough.

433
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,250
You don't have to push yourself so hard.

434
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,330
I remember when I was little,

435
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,220
at around eight or nine,

436
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,010
I was so hungry.

437
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,980
All I did was take the meat bun

438
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,260
an official dropped on the ground.

439
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,700
The man was going to send me

440
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,570
to jail.

441
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,460
It was then that I realized

442
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:24,810
the life of lowborn people

443
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,490
meant nothing.

444
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,020
My father

445
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,490
was kneeling and bowing

446
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,180
on the street,

447
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,530
one after one.

448
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,980
It was only when his forehead
was bleeding

449
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,330
that the man agreed to let me go.

450
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,450
[Young Yuan Shaocheng]

451
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:44,770
Later,

452
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,730
in order to set my brother and me

453
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,940
free from the low status,

454
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,620
he signed up for the Longmen Battle.

455
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,770
[Yuan Anhe]

456
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:18,700
Father.

457
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,530
My mother was never well.

458
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,090
After my father died, she got very sick

459
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:24,220
and passed away.

460
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:24,860
Father!

461
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:26,860
When alive, the people of Mang Gutter

462
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,860
are treated like dirt.

463
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,980
When they are dead, nobody cares.

464
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,980
They become a pile of bodies,

465
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,330
unrecognized,

466
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,570
burnt like trash.

467
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,770
Even today, I remember the smell

468
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,770
from burning the bodies.

469
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,290
Over the years,

470
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,290
I've learned a lot.

471
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,460
No matter how hard I try,

472
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,660
in the eyes of the nobles,

473
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,460
I'm nothing but a rat
to be trampled upon.

474
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,620
To avoid

475
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,380
a sword hanging

476
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,570
over my head,

477
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,420
I must

478
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,290
crush them first.

479
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,940
I need to show them

480
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:10,940
we're rats

481
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,900
who can

482
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,980
shake their world.

483
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,140
Mr. Gu,

484
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,140
I will ensure everyone here

485
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,330
has a good life.

486
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,380
Everyone

487
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,290
can sleep well

488
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,570
and be safe.

489
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,330
If I hadn't seen it myself,

490
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,700
I wouldn't have known

491
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,490
there was such an impoverished area

492
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,380
in the capital.

493
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,250
All these wooden houses
you are looking at

494
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:03,900
were built by people hired by Mr. Yuan.

495
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,490
When we were little, a lot of us

496
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:06,490
didn't even get to stay in a house

497
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,860
and had to sleep in the stable.

498
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,050
The young and the strong

499
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,730
would leave the space
for children and elders.

500
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,570
A blanket was considered a luxury.

501
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,530
No wonder the people of Mang Gutter

502
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,620
are going for the Longmen Battle.

503
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,090
Have you seen the Longmen Battle?

504
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,490
No,

505
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,140
but I heard of it.

506
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:30,620
Nichang.

507
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,700
So it all worked out?

508
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:35,980
Yuan Shaocheng

509
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,570
is on our side now.

510
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:43,530
Ping'an,

511
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,090
I've checked around.

512
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,090
Last night, there were more spies

513
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,770
from the Court around Wanguoxiang.

514
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,530
Danxin,

515
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:53,050
tell Nichang

516
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,770
to draw Yuan Shaocheng in.

517
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:57,700
You wrecked

518
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,140
the partnership between Du Liang and me,

519
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:00,660
leaving me battered and bruised.

520
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,010
Where else can I go?

521
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:04,860
I'm telling you.

522
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,380
I will make you pay.

523
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,860
A gentleman's revenge is never too late.

524
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:11,530
You

525
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,090
are not a gentleman.

526
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:14,940
I will give you five years.

527
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,290
It will be suspicious

528
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,460
if you are missing for too long.

529
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,050
Have some food,

530
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,010
and I will have someone

531
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,810
get Nichang back to Wanguoxiang.

532
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,490
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

533
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,290
I can do it myself.

534
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:27,770
Fine.

535
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:29,180
Up to you.

536
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,660
You two are quite similar.

537
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,490
You like to take the risk

538
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,180
and play mind games.

539
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,490
Is it a compliment?

540
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,940
But then again,

541
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:45,900
is he reliable?

542
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,010
No matter what, we are together.

543
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,330
However, Du Liang
has the Li family's support.

544
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,290
If we want to bring down Du Liang,

545
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,570
we need one more person.

546
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:56,940
Who do you have in mind?

547
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,050
Wu Xian'er.

548
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:02,050
I met her before at Wanguoxiang.

549
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:03,900
She seemed to be dating someone.

550
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:06,460
Who?

551
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:08,900
Qi Junshan.

552
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,770
[Wanguoxiang]
I like your song.

553
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:14,730
Really?

554
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,330
You should come to my place next time.

555
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:16,900
Sure.

556
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,330
I have some fine liquor.

557
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:19,140
Later,

558
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,090
join me for a few more drinks.

559
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:20,940
This way.

560
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,090
Somebody.

561
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:31,460
Fill my cup.

562
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,090
Tell Madame Hua

563
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,490
that she should switch the snacks here.

564
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,180
The same thing will not be as good

565
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,140
the third time around.

566
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,860
You need to keep it fresh.

567
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,180
Luckily,

568
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,860
this is the second time
you see me, Miss Wu.

569
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:51,380
Otherwise,

570
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,010
you are going to get bored

571
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,460
of me.

572
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:57,660
No.

573
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,050
I saw you when you met the Empress

574
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,220
in Zhanlu Hall.

575
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:02,380
Today

576
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,140
is exactly the third time.

577
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,290
That's why you need to think about

578
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,490
how to keep me interested.

579
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,090
Interested?

580
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,900
I found a way

581
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,220
to get Qi Junshan's man

582
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,420
to deliver a message.

583
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:19,660
Sir.

584
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,490
Mr. Du knows I'm here

585
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,570
and is coming over to see me.

586
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:26,940
I need to go and stop him.

587
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,090
It will be bad

588
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,010
if he finds out I'm here

589
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:29,730
with you.

590
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:31,140
I'll be off now.

591
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,180
Please don't worry, Miss Wu.

592
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,700
I'm here by coincidence.

593
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,290
I hope I didn't

594
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,220
ruin your mood.

595
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,250
He is afraid of Du Liang.

596
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,490
I'm not.

597
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,570
I thought I was special

598
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,290
since Miss Wu was willing

599
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,980
to take the cup from me,

600
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,380
regardless of the quality

601
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,420
of the drink.

602
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,530
That's why I'm here.

603
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:02,530
I can tell

604
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,660
that I'm just flattering myself.

605
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,980
I like

606
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,420
your audacity.

607
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,490
Alright.

608
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,530
Tell me.

609
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,460
Why

610
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,620
are you here?

611
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,460
When I was
looking into Zheng Yuan's case,

612
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,460
I found out that Du Liang

613
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:23,770
took part of the fund for himself.

614
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,490
I told Her Majesty about it,

615
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,050
but she

616
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,770
didn't give me any response.

617
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,660
Du Liang was bold.

618
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:32,660
That was the military fund.

619
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:33,770
My escape

620
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,530
from the Zheng Yuan case

621
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,050
and my appointment
as Psychiatric Commissioner

622
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,140
have put me directly
at odds with Du Liang.

623
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,730
It's going to be a problem.

624
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:43,730
So that's why you are here

625
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:44,770
asking for my help?

626
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,620
I'm from the Wu family.

627
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,090
I have to set an example

628
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:49,620
so that there won't be gossip

629
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,490
saying the Wu and the Li families
have issues.

630
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,380
I can't help you

631
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:54,810
with your problem.

632
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,090
I understand.

633
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,730
Then I'm only here

634
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,980
to get a sip
of your fine drink, Miss Wu.

635
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,380
I can't help you,

636
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,010
but I can introduce you

637
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:09,810
to someone else.

638
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:11,900
Who?

639
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:13,900
You can visit Hai Yiping

640
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:15,490
with my message.

641
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:16,660
Tell him

642
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,220
that his pearl powder is a good one.

643
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,570
Ask him

644
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,810
to send me more later.

645
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,730
Thank you so much, Miss Wu.

646
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,180
- Help!
- Help!

647
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,010
- Anyone?
- Anyone?

648
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:32,980
- Fire!
- Fire!

649
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,570
- Fire!
- Fire!

650
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,900
- Help!
- Help!

651
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:01,700
You are lazy.

652
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,620
It's already noon.

653
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,900
Look at your sack.

654
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,700
It's all worn.

655
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:10,570
Tell me.

656
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:12,530
What pattern do you like?

657
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,660
I will make you a new one.

658
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,290
The Goddess of the Luo River.

659
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,220
Emperor Taizong
Receiving the Xizang Envoy.

660
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:22,330
Auspicious Beasts Gathering.

661
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,490
You are the beast, aren't you?

662
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:28,980
My family name is Ye.

663
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,980
How about a leaf?
[*"Ye" means "leaf."]

664
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:32,770
A leaf?

665
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,090
That's a good one.

666
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,050
Even if it falls,

667
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,180
it becomes fertilizer,

668
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,730
and there will be a new one next year.

669
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:40,980
It goes forever.

670
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,980
I will make it for you.
