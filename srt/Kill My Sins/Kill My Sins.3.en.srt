00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,140
If they wanted to get the fund

196
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,940
to the capital today,

197
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,060
they needed to set off

198
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,300
last night.

199
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,180
There will be heavy fog these days,

200
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,140
make use of it.

201
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,900
Cailian knows the wind well
in the woods.

202
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,180
She added
the anesthetic smoke into the fog,

203
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,700
and the escort

204
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,900
passed out quickly.

205
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,900
Our people were hiding in the woods.

206
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,500
Nobody could notice them.

207
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,340
Is this the ghost?

208
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,180
Such a dirty trick.

209
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,420
The anesthetic smoke
was added into the fog,

210
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,420
and these morons were yelling.

211
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:12,980
The more agitated they were,

212
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,740
the more smoke they inhaled.

213
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,580
Without the rhythm

214
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,100
that messed with their mind,

215
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,860
they wouldn't have been so vulnerable
to losing control.

216
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,700
I think

217
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,180
it was a nice move.

218
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,420
What are you waiting for?

219
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,300
Search the woods!

220
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,220
Do not miss

221
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:27,820
any suspicious spots.

222
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:28,420
Yes, sir.

223
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,060
Wait.

224
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,340
There is something wrong with the track.

225
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,740
The carriages were full of silver.

226
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:36,820
Why is there

227
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,500
such a shallow track?

228
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,460
Perhaps they transferred it separately.

229
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,740
I just don't want you

230
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,980
to end up in vain.

231
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:45,980
If it is not in the woods,

232
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,580
where else can it be?

233
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:48,980
In such a short time,

234
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,220
if I were them,

235
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,220
I would take an easier way

236
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:54,740
without transferring it

237
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,700
out of the woods.

238
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,460
Sir,

239
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,700
shall we search the woods?

240
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,340
He got a point.

241
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,620
If he is right,

242
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,580
he can't be the one
taking all the credit.

243
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,340
Follow him

244
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,300
and see what he is up to.

245
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:10,740
Yes, sir.

246
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,340
You didn't hide the fund in the woods?

247
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,220
It is difficult to hide the track

248
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,740
and we can't go far away

249
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,580
with such a heavy cargo.

250
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:19,940
Moreover,

251
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,580
one of the officials
in the investigation team

252
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,500
can be a tricky problem.

253
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:24,940
Who?

254
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,980
Yuan Shaocheng.

255
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,980
The Court of Judicial Review

256
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,220
would definitely get involved
if the fund was missing.

257
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,340
Mang Gutter

258
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,980
is the poorest area in the capital.

259
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,340
People of low status,

260
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,420
abandoned by their families

261
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,420
and scorned by society,

262
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,700
gather here.

263
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,980
Their descendants
are all considered lowlifes.

264
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,420
Yuan Shaocheng

265
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,580
is the only one among them

266
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,580
who got rid of the low status

267
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,060
and became an official.

268
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,980
He got something then.

269
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,340
By the way,

270
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,340
I overheard from a man of Qi Junshan

271
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,620
that Qi Junshan
gave Yitai Gambling House

272
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,860
to Yuan Shaocheng.

273
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,740
It seems like Yuan Shaocheng

274
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,180
has gained a lot after ganging up

275
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,340
with Du Liang.

276
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,220
Qi Junshan lost his profit

277
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,860
to Yuan Shaocheng.

278
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,820
I don't think he will just let it pass.

279
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,820
You worked with Yuan Shaocheng before.

280
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,460
What kind of man

281
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,220
is he?

282
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,220
He is cruel

283
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,500
and good at scheming,

284
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,820
often with

285
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,500
his own means.

286
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,340
He

287
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,620
is the biggest enemy

288
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,180
in our plan for the military fund.

289
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,740
That was why we listened to Ping'an

290
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,780
and hid the money

291
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,140
in the river.

292
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,220
Is he

293
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,340
going to see through it?

294
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,780
Keep the money in the river.

295
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,940
Really?

296
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,700
Hiding it in the river

297
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,100
is the safest,

298
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,460
most unexpected move.

299
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,180
Wenyu,

300
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,060
call the boatmen

301
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,700
and search along the river carefully.

302
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,300
Yes, sir.

303
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,580
Search in detail!

304
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,020
Here

305
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,820
and there.

306
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,380
Everyone says

307
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,740
that you are not with the Li family

308
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,860
or the Wu family.

309
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,140
But people are like water,

310
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,300
ever-flowing, ever-changing.

311
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,820
I'm curious

312
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,700
whether you are with the Li

313
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,180
or with the Wu now.

314
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,860
Have you changed, Mr. Li?

315
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,980
I'm in this position

316
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,060
thanks to the trust of Her Majesty.

317
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,940
I'll do anything to protect the Empress.

318
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,100
My loyalty is unwavering.

319
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,820
Chancellor Fu

320
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,300
died in prison because of you.

321
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,900
You are

322
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,860
a terrifying wolf

323
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,140
in the eyes of the eminent families.

324
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,820
You are smart, Mr. Yuan,

325
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,140
so what do you think

326
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,060
Her Majesty

327
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:57,940
values most?

328
00:13:59,100 --> 00:13:59,660
Sir,

329
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,060
there seems to be something
in the river.

330
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:03,500
Go.

331
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:09,580
Mr. Li,

332
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,500
over there.

333
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,580
Get into the river

334
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:18,940
and help the people

335
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,740
of Yuan Shaocheng.

336
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,460
The one who finds it
will be rewarded greatly.

337
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:21,780
Yes, sir.

338
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,100
Follow me.

339
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:33,780
Mr. Li,

340
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,780
we found nothing.

341
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,380
The reflective thing

342
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,500
is the mud at the bottom of the river.

343
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,340
Hey,

344
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,460
why is the mud in the bottom

345
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,780
reflective?

346
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:45,660
Sir,

347
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,300
we travel along this river a lot.

348
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,140
There is a mine in the upper stream,

349
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,820
so there is nothing strange

350
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,780
that it is reflective.

351
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,220
Why would I believe your words

352
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,500
and waste all my time here?

353
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,100
They are long gone now!

354
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,220
Yuan Shaocheng,

355
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,460
I doubt

356
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,500
that you are together with them!

357
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,620
Mr. Li,

358
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,500
please watch your mouth.

359
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,940
This is useless.

360
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:12,860
You'd better

361
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,100
keep a distance from this case.

362
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,300
Otherwise, you might get into trouble.

363
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,940
Everyone, follow me to the woods.

364
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,220
Don't waste any time here.

365
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,340
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

366
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,220
I just checked.

367
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,420
Besides Yuan Shaocheng,

368
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,340
the cruel official Li Jun

369
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,820
is also working on the case of the fund.

370
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,340
Li Jun is willing to betray anyone

371
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,700
in order to get to a higher position.

372
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,420
He is wild and impulsive.

373
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,700
When you asked us
to sprinkle the minerals

374
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,500
on the mud,

375
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,420
I was thinking

376
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,180
what the point was.

377
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,500
Now I know that you were

378
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,940
setting a trap for Yuan Shaocheng,

379
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,220
so that

380
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,180
he wouldn't

381
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,580
keep an eye on the river all the time.

382
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,300
Also,

383
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,420
the war is on pause now,

384
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,180
but we need to hurry up

385
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,980
and complete our plan
as soon as possible,

386
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,740
so that the imperial court
can get the fund in time.

387
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,340
If we hide it in the woods,

388
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,500
it will be more tricky.

389
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,420
That's why we need another way.

390
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:10,940
Danxin,

391
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,940
do you think

392
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,420
it is risky

393
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,220
to let Nichang,
who we don't know very well,

394
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,300
be

395
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,580
part of the plan?

396
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,340
It did occur to me at the beginning,

397
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,340
but

398
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:28,740
you and I

399
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,980
also became families from two persons

400
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,500
who didn't know each other well.

401
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,340
Over these years,

402
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,100
the three of us went through a lot,

403
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,940
but none of us
ever thought about giving up.

404
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,060
Don't worry, Ping'an.

405
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,500
An overcautious

406
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,700
or hesitant person

407
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,820
will not succeed.

408
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,580
You risked your life

409
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,700
and put yourself in it,

410
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,220
and I am willing to be

411
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,740
the best sidekick

412
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,500
of yours.

413
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,100
This is too big.

414
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,300
I can't take the whole thing.

415
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,700
Make it half.

416
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:03,700
Alright.

417
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,700
You should have made a bigger one

418
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,780
and a smaller one,

419
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,420
and I will take the smaller one.

420
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,500
No problem.

421
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,980
This is small enough,

422
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,940
but that one looks better.

423
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:17,700
Over here.

424
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,940
This is good.

425
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,700
I will take this one.

426
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,500
What are you doing?

427
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,620
Are you doing business or not?

428
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,260
Madame,

429
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,660
I will take the whole thing.

430
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,220
She is taking it.

431
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,660
Wrap it and send it over.

432
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,220
Sure!

433
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,220
Blackie, keep an eye out!

434
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,140
So impressive.

435
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,020
You scare away

436
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:42,940
all the annoying people.

437
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,140
How's everything in the east outskirts?

438
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,260
There will be big fog tonight.

439
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,940
It is the best time

440
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,900
to transfer the money.

441
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,060
Yet, there are people

442
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,020
guarding the river.

443
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,180
From whom?

444
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,020
Yuan Shaocheng.

445
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,700
Li Jun is searching in the woods,

446
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,660
but for some reason,

447
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,700
Yuan Shaocheng didn't go.

448
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,260
Alright.

449
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,700
I will think of something.

450
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,300
Here you go. See you around.

451
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:03,500
What are you doing?

452
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,420
Don't touch Blackie.

453
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:08,620
Miss Cailian,

454
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,660
I will have one Jin of pork.

455
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:10,500
Sure.

456
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,220
Seventy Wen in total.

457
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:13,660
The price is higher than before.

458
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,220
The price of salt is much higher.

459
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,740
Of course, it is the same for pork.

460
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:17,780
Are you taking it or not?

461
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,260
Do not get in my business.

462
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,220
I will take it.

463
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:21,740
Is this enough for you?

464
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:22,900
Yes.

465
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,220
Did someone cross you today?

466
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:25,860
Why are you angry?

467
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,460
It's none of your business.

468
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,420
Thanks,

469
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,420
Miss Caizhu.
[*Zhu means pork]

470
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,460
What...

471
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,740
What are you saying?

472
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,980
I'm going to poison you
and Yuan Shaocheng one day.

473
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,060
Aunt?

474
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,220
You are...

475
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,980
I never thought

476
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,700
that the furnishing of the house

477
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,780
could be so elegant.

478
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,260
It is a bit different

479
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,940
from the shops in the surroundings.

480
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,980
I heard that you were
an excellent psychiatrist.

481
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,420
I would like you

482
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,540
to have a look

483
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,740
for me.

484
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,220
This way, please.

485
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,860
Do you have any symptoms?

486
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,700
No symptoms.

487
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,980
No symptoms?

488
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,420
Then why are you here?

489
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,940
Your name

490
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,220
is well known

491
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,180
in the capital now.

492
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,660
I'm just curious.

493
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,100
What's so special

494
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,900
about you?

495
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,380
I see.

496
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,940
I will get you some medicine.

497
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,700
What's this?

498
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,580
Try it, and you will know.

499
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:41,980
This liquor

500
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,420
is strong,

501
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,780
but nothing special.

502
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,700
This is what you need.

503
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,060
What can unravel these woes of mine?

504
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,900
I know but one drink, Du Kang Wine.

505
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:57,660
Excellent.

506
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,500
It's a good cure.

507
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,540
I like it.

508
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,220
You do

509
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,820
live up to your reputation.

510
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,700
A verbal decree from Her Majesty.

511
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,300
[Psychiatric Commissioner]
There's no progress in finding the fund,

512
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,780
and it is upsetting.

513
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,780
Ye Ping'an is now officially appointed

514
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,980
as the Psychiatric Commissioner

515
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,540
with the right to assist in the case

516
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,900
and use it as a pass.

517
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,340
Make use of your ability

518
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,020
of reading people's minds.

519
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,140
I...

520
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,580
It is

521
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,820
my honor.

522
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,380
You can get up.

523
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,020
So you are Miss Wu,

524
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,940
Editorial Director
of the Palace Secretariat.

525
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,180
I apologize

526
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,340
for being rude earlier.

527
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,820
How do you know my identity?

528
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,860
There is only one woman in the capital

529
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,340
who is as noble as you

530
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,340
and can deliver messages

531
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,580
for the Empress.

532
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,300
I just didn't expect

533
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,620
you to drink

534
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,180
my cheap stuff

535
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,700
without a second thought.

536
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,260
I don't have a preference for liquor.

537
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,100
A cheap one

538
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,180
and a fine one will do the same.

539
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,740
What matters

540
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,180
is the person

541
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,540
who hands me the cup.

542
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,160
[Psychiatric Commissioner]

543
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,620
[Imperial]
Alright.

544
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,940
I'm getting

545
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,260
more interested in you now.

546
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,060
Maybe your priority should be the case,

547
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,060
Mr. Yuan.

548
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,100
Mr. Li is searching the woods now,

549
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,860
while you are just doing nothing

550
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,140
by the river.

551
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,500
Don't you worry

552
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,500
that someone else will take the credit?

553
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,220
I'm interested in listening

554
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,300
to the opinion

555
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,740
of our new official,

556
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,900
the Psychiatric Commissioner.

557
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,660
Since they are hiding the money

558
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,620
in the woods...

559
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,780
If.

560
00:22:59,140 --> 00:22:59,700
Fine.

561
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,940
If.

562
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,020
If they are hiding

563
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,620
the money in the woods,

564
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,380
it can be found

565
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,020
by the people who live around.

566
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,980
It is 80,000 Liang.

567
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,620
It can't be hidden

568
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,260
under the leaves.

569
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,580
If they were doing it properly,

570
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,220
they needed to dig beforehand.

571
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,380
It wouldn't be easy,

572
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,580
and they would need hands.

573
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,860
I won't be here

574
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,740
without a lead, Mr. Yuan.

575
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,660
I went to the black market

576
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,220
and learned

577
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,580
that a few days earlier,

578
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,020
someone hired some stonemasons

579
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,500
to go to the mountain ahead of you.

580
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,140
They are not out yet.

581
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,700
Who hired them?

582
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,580
The rule of the black market

583
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,100
is taking the money

584
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,580
without asking any questions.

585
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:44,900
However,

586
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,900
I gave some money
to the middleman of the black market

587
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,060
and asked him to mark

588
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,820
the possible spots they were hiding.

589
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,260
They've been in there for a while.

590
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,660
There must be some trace.

591
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,140
All we need is to follow it.

592
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,740
You are a nice person,

593
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,140
handing over

594
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,220
this important lead.

595
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,060
I just got appointed,

596
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,540
so I cannot fail
the trust of the Empress.

597
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,540
However, I don't have any actual power.

598
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,380
I will need your assistance

599
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,660
to close the case.

600
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,900
When it's time for credit and rewards,

601
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,900
please don't forget

602
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,060
to include me

603
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,420
as someone who helped, Mr. Yuan.

604
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,420
You won't do it in vain.

605
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:26,940
Thank you.

606
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,020
You are welcome.

607
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:29,620
Let's go.

608
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:33,900
Wenyu,

609
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,620
hand this to Li Jun.

610
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:37,420
Yes.

611
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:38,900
Let's go.

612
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:45,660
What?

613
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,140
You are not going with them?

614
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,100
Searching in the woods is exhausting.

615
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,140
I should stay

616
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,260
and take a rest here.

617
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:53,980
Maybe later

618
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:54,980
they will think it through

619
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,260
and bring the money back.

620
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,340
Sure.

621
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,260
I won't bother you anymore.

622
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,620
Good luck.

623
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:16,900
Mr. Du,

624
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,980
the Psychiatric Commissioner
is Ye Ping'an.

625
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,660
So Ye Ping'an gets involved

626
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,180
in the military fund now.

627
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,980
I have no idea
what the Empress is thinking.

628
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,940
Why would she appoint

629
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,220
a despicable commoner like her?

630
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,420
Things are not going well for me lately,

631
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,980
and they all seem to do with Ye Ping'an.

632
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,420
I may have underestimated her.

633
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,180
Mr. Du,

634
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,660
let's just do it in the simplest way.

635
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:42,820
I will send some people

636
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:43,820
to eliminate her.

637
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,380
Zheng Yuan is dead,

638
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:46,940
and now the military fund is missing.

639
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,420
All the cruel officials are looking.

640
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,540
Killing someone at this moment

641
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,180
is too risky.

642
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,420
Keep an eye on her.

643
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,300
Find out what she is doing

644
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,780
other than the investigation.

645
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,700
She might

646
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,020
have the Mei alliance behind her.

647
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:05,820
[Mei Mansion]

648
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,180
Please.

649
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,900
Please.

650
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,900
Have mercy on me,

651
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:16,820
a poor, blind old man.

652
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,900
Sir.

653
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,220
Sir.

654
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,740
Please show me some kindness.

655
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,700
Earth?

656
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,140
That's a good one.

657
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,940
Crops grow on the earth.

658
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,540
If there are crops,
people will not starve to death.

659
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,420
They can work as long as they are alive.

660
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,980
I like this.

661
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,020
I see. This is your reward.

662
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,540
Here you go.

663
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,420
He's got the wrong answer.

664
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,700
What should we do with him?

665
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,340
He should carry the water barrels

666
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,540
for at least four hours!

667
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:29,980
That's right.

668
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,700
Why are you standing here? Go.

669
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,740
[Mei Bowen, Left Chancellor]
He is the elder son of the Feng family.

670
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,940
Find him something

671
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,020
that is easy and can make money.

672
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,100
This is yours.

673
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,620
Thank you, Master.

674
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:48,620
Hurry up.

675
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,860
As for the other one,

676
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,100
send him

677
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,940
to work for Xian Guangping.

678
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,940
He will go through hardships

679
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:56,900
with General Xian

680
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,140
in the Yulin Royal Guard.

681
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:58,900
He is a young man.

682
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,180
Hardship will be good for him.

683
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,260
Too much wit leads to downfall.

684
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,340
Yes, sir.

685
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,860
I heard

686
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,180
that a lot is going on in the capital.

687
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,180
Rumor has it

688
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,020
that a woman can see people's dreams.

689
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,220
That's right.

690
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,860
She got involved,

691
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,380
but she gained the Empress's trust

692
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,620
with her ability to glimpse dreams

693
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,580
and got away from the trouble.

694
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,420
Both were about dreams.

695
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,140
While Fu Shengjun fell,

696
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:20,740
she

697
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,940
rose.

698
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,620
Do you truly believe

699
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,580
that the dream

700
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,620
led them to different paths?

701
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,420
Master.

702
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,860
What brings you here?

703
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,540
Master,

704
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,540
what do you think

705
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,860
about the military fund?

706
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,940
Everyone is looking

707
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,100
at the military fund now.

708
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,020
Yes, sir.

709
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,100
About this,

710
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,740
leading the charge
are the merciless officials

711
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,420
and the Court of Juridical Review.

712
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,300
Wait for it.

713
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,620
After that,

714
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,940
some will get promoted,

715
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:00,980
and others will suffer.

716
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,220
The military fund

717
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,740
supports people's livelihood
and border defense.

718
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,100
I'm afraid

719
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,220
that someone will act recklessly

720
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,740
to get the credit.

721
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,020
Don't worry.

722
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,940
The war is temporarily suspended.

723
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,940
The military fund might be

724
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,340
in better use

725
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,780
if it is missing for a few days.

726
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,260
Whether it is the Wu or the Li,

727
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,900
they are both eminent families.

728
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,100
Sometimes,

729
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,900
taking a break is not a bad thing.

730
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,900
So we should do nothing?

731
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,180
Please enlighten me, Master.

732
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,420
Keep this in mind.

733
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,140
Sometimes,

734
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,180
doing nothing can bring progress.

735
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,900
Impatience

736
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,780
leads to mistakes.

737
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,820
You will see.

738
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,260
Any updates

739
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,860
on the military fund?

740
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,100
Not yet.

741
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,340
Mr. Du,

742
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,020
is Yuan Shaocheng reliable?

743
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,340
He handed me the letter,

744
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,380
which means all he wants is power.

745
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,740
As long as he wants something,
he won't be a problem.

746
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,580
One can't fight against stronger forces.

747
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,380
At least

748
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,300
he knows that.

749
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,420
That's for sure.

750
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,500
The priority now

751
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,420
is to keep a close eye
on Yuan Shaocheng.

752
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,060
Once he finds the military fund,

753
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,820
I will report it and get the credit.

754
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:45,620
Watch out for traps.

755
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,340
The more traps we encounter,

756
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,020
the more it proves
we're on the right path.

757
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,260
Keep searching.

758
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,220
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

759
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:03,820
Sir,

760
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,340
the track of the carriages

761
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,500
is divided into three again.

762
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:07,940
Which one should we follow?

763
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:08,980
Sir,

764
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,100
Mr. Yuan sent this map.

765
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,340
Stop following the track.

766
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,740
Search these places in the woods

767
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,540
one by one.

768
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,420
Yes, sir.

769
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,980
We won't have enough time

770
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,500
if Yuan Shaocheng
keeps staying by the river.

771
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:25,900
I will get some people over there

772
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:26,780
and distract him.

773
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:27,980
Don't be reckless.

774
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:29,940
Ping'an,

775
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,260
what's the plan?

776
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,300
He's aligned with Du Liang, right?

777
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,900
Then let's take him

778
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,420
down.

779
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,500
[Du Liang]
Du Liang is greedy.

780
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,340
[Greedy]
He wants both the credit and fortune.

781
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,700
[Qi Junshan. Easily irritated]
Qi Junshan is impatient

782
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,140
[Yuan Shaocheng]
and competitive.

783
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,100
He and Yuan Shaocheng
don't see eye to eye.

784
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,340
[Gambling House]
We can start from Qi Junshan.

785
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,620
If he finds out that Yuan Shaocheng

786
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,300
is suspicious of taking the fund,

787
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,260
they will go against each other.

788
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,820
Go away.

789
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,620
Hurry up.

790
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,340
Sir,

791
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,060
look at this.

792
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,980
You've been drinking quite a lot, huh?

793
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,940
The missing military fund

794
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,340
is with Yuan.

795
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,660
He's hidden it in Yitai Gambling House.

796
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,020
You will find a trace.

797
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,340
Who gave you this?

798
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,940
I...

799
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,420
I have no idea.

800
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,900
If you mess things up
because of getting drunk again,

801
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,620
I will seal your mouth.

802
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,700
Yes, sir.

803
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:48,740
Sir,

804
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,700
Yuan Shaocheng

805
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,060
has been favored by Mr. Du.

806
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,340
For anyone who takes

807
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,820
things of mine,

808
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,220
I will take his life in return.

809
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,770
I always keep my word.

810
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,780
Integrity is the most important thing,

811
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,340
right?

812
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,340
That's right.

813
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,340
Bring some people.

814
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,140
We are catching the rat.

815
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:44,900
Sir,

816
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,020
this is the military fund.

817
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:54,620
Sir,

818
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,060
I've got you some food.

819
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:56,700
Here you go.

820
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,900
What makes you so happy?

821
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:01,620
Nothing.

822
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,100
You've been smiling a lot for no reason

823
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,860
since you were back
from hunting last time.

824
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,020
Are you interested in someone?

825
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,700
When I was hunting last time,

826
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,180
I saw a lady

827
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,860
training an eagle

828
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,220
in the woods.

829
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,540
When I was back in town,

830
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,180
I met her again at the port stall.

831
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,940
I've been buying pork
from her a lot since then.

832
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:40,780
What?

833
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,780
You want to be the pork

834
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,740
and let her chop you up?

835
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:44,660
Sir,

836
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:45,820
you are making jokes now.

837
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,020
I've been wanting to tell you,

838
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:49,980
but I'm afraid...

839
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,100
Do you think I will stop you?

840
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,540
You saved my life.

841
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,940
You said
I was one of the Yuan family as well.

842
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,020
We can't be bullied.

843
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,700
We're not cowards.

844
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,620
And we work together.

845
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,500
You let me work in the Court,

846
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,620
and you gave me dignity.

847
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,060
If you disagree,

848
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:04,580
I won't...

849
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,660
I didn't give you dignity.

850
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,940
You earned it yourself.

851
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,260
You said it yourself.

852
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,740
We are not cowards.

853
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,660
Since then,

854
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,740
you can tell the lady

855
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,740
about your feelings.

856
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,820
If she says yes,

857
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,060
I will take charge

858
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,660
of the wedding.

859
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,020
Sir.

860
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,140
Thank you, sir.

861
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,100
Alright.

862
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,740
Did Li Jun make any progress?

863
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,340
Sir!

864
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,180
Sir!

865
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,340
Sir!

866
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,460
Qi Junshan

867
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,140
is smashing the gambling house!

868
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,180
What?

869
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:37,940
Call everyone

870
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:38,620
and head back now.

871
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:39,780
Notice Mr. Gu

872
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,140
to watch out for Mang Gutter.

873
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:41,500
Yes, sir.

874
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,460
Mr. Du wants to meet you.

875
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,420
It must be the first time

876
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,860
that you experience this.

877
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,140
If you don't want to suffer,

878
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,180
tell me

879
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,140
where the military fund is.

880
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,420
Military fund?

881
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,780
Why are you asking me about that?

882
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,900
I will only say it one more time.

883
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,460
Where is

884
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:37,980
the military fund?

885
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:39,860
I have no idea.

886
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,820
I don't know what you are talking about.

887
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,260
Without treatment,

888
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,100
you will bleed to death

889
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,660
in less than two hours.

890
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,940
I know people like you very well.

891
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,820
You grew up
drinking the water from the Mang Gutter

892
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,260
and eating the leftovers of others.

893
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,100
Nonetheless,

894
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,420
you managed to survive

895
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,420
like a rat.

896
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,980
But I'm born a tiger.

897
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,460
How can a rat

898
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,740
fight against a tiger?

899
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,420
It takes only one step

900
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,660
for me to smash you.

901
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,100
Do you understand

902
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,460
who you are messing with?

903
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,380
You will be begging for death.
