00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,250
Isn't it pleasant?

3
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,860
We're lying here, enjoying the breeze.

4
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,220
It seems like
everything is calming down.

5
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,290
When you are in a bad mood,

6
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,500
you are welcome to come

7
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,810
and enjoy the peace only found here.

8
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,370
Sure.

[Episode 25]
[Find the Right Remedy]

10
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,090
Lass,

11
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,810
don't worry. You can stay here tonight.

12
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,690
Tomorrow, I will give you some money,

13
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,570
so that you can go home.

14
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:55,850
Where do you live?

15
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,300
Tongquan.

16
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,970
Tongquan?

17
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,370
It sounds familiar.

18
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,850
What's wrong?

19
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,620
Nothing.

20
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,850
It reminds me

21
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,130
of an old friend.

22
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,740
He was from there, too.

23
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,250
It is far away from here.

24
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,020
Lass,

25
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,370
you were robbed.

26
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,220
It's better to report it.

27
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,180
I don't want to do that.

28
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:36,370
Why not?

29
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,460
I hate the officials.

30
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,300
Years ago,

31
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:43,900
my sister

32
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,460
was taken by an official.

33
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,220
The house she stayed in was set on fire,

34
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,020
and she was nearly burnt to death.

35
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:51,740
Later,

36
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,570
she was forced

37
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:55,970
to jump off a cliff

38
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:57,810
and died.

39
00:03:58,970 --> 00:03:59,650
My parents

40
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,740
went through a lot
while raising my sister.

41
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,250
It was very difficult for them

42
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,020
to handle all these.

43
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:09,500
Do you think

44
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,900
I can trust any official?

45
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:17,940
Right.

46
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,660
It was

47
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,250
a lot

48
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,660
to bear.

[Dongqiao Salt Granary]

50
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,100
Where is he?

51
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,570
Over there.

52
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:44,940
Why is he

53
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,860
so persistent?

54
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,330
This...

55
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,770
General Wu!

56
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:53,770
Sir,

57
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,100
what brings you here again?

58
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:57,860
About the salt,

59
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,370
you've checked by yourself.

60
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,060
You aren't going to go on and on,
are you?

61
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,420
Don't worry, Mr. Gong.

62
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,810
I'm not doing it again.

63
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,420
Great.

64
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,250
That's great.

65
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,500
Because

66
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,010
it is not necessary anymore.

67
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,130
This is...

68
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,420
This is a statement made by a guard

69
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,890
of Dongqiao Salt Granary
and some of the illegal salt smugglers.

70
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,420
The man I've been investigating lately

71
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,770
used to be responsible

72
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,010
for guarding the salt granary.

73
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,570
His name

74
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:26,770
is Zhao Bu.

75
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:28,540
He would steal

76
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,010
the official salt
from Dongqiao Salt Granary

77
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,300
and bury it in the outskirts.

78
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,770
Then the smugglers would

79
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,100
take it out.

80
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,370
Unfortunately, Zhao Bu

81
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,130
was addicted to gambling.

82
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,060
He couldn't pay his debt,

83
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,620
so he took the risk

84
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:43,940
and put the salt

85
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,060
in his own pocket.

86
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,210
However,

87
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,500
the truth will out.

88
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:50,890
He didn't know

89
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:51,940
that once it came to light,

90
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,210
the one behind him

91
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,660
would kill him to cover everything up.

92
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,100
Mr. Gong, do you think

93
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,660
I've saved this guy?

94
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:14,740
Sir,

95
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,130
why are you still up?

96
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,370
I can't fall asleep.

97
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,180
They said
people would get confused as they age.

98
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,940
I am old,

99
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:25,940
but why is the past

100
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,890
getting clearer in my head?

101
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,330
Who are you

102
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,740
doing this for?

103
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,620
I don't know.

104
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,420
Truly.

105
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,010
What's wrong?

106
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,300
Someone is trying to kill me.

107
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:46,980
Who?

108
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,250
Who is trying to kill you?

109
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,250
You...

110
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:51,570
Who are you?

111
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:52,540
Why

112
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,370
are you

113
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,540
trying to kill this young lady?

114
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,210
She isn't any random lady.

115
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:57,690
Lu Wei,

116
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,180
do you know who she is?

117
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,060
She is involved in the Censor case.

118
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:07,690
Move,

119
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,740
or I will kill you as well.

120
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,250
Move!

121
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:11,770
Stop!

122
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,620
Don't!

123
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,210
What do you want?

124
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,330
He gave the order

125
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,210
and killed so many women back then.

126
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:19,950
And he forced
the three judicial departments

127
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,660
to make the final judgment.

128
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,250
Yu Qian's entire family died
because of it.

129
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,180
Wu Youjing has done

130
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,570
so many evil things.

131
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,100
Why does he have to

132
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,300
kill a woman?

133
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:30,770
If you want to kill her,

134
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,890
you'll have to get through me first.

135
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,180
Run!

136
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,210
I don't need to run,

137
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,180
and you don't have to die.

138
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:01,660
You...

139
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,660
You are...

140
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,540
Who are you?

141
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,330
Mr. Gong,

142
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,570
do I have to make everything clear

143
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,770
for you?

144
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,770
General Wu,

145
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,130
please don't trick me.

146
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,250
I don't know

147
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,620
who you're talking about.

148
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,540
I have him now!

149
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:22,740
If you want to deny it,

150
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,060
we are going to see Her Majesty

151
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,010
and find out the truth!

152
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,540
General Wu!

153
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:28,210
General Wu!

154
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:28,980
No.

155
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,180
You can't do that!

156
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:34,690
Now,

157
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,210
I have to tell you the truth.

158
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:37,970
I've been asking you to drop it.

159
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:38,900
It is

160
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,810
not only for me,

161
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,610
but also

162
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,180
for your own sake.

163
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,660
I didn't know

164
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:03,730
so many happened

165
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,810
in the years after I left the capital.

166
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:08,540
Here you go.

167
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,330
Here.

168
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,300
I thought

169
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:12,300
you were one of them.

170
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:13,970
But just now,

171
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,060
you were ready to die for me.

172
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,380
It means

173
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,690
you are not a greedy, deceitful person.

174
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:22,940
So why did you

175
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,690
make the judgment in haste back then?

176
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,330
For the sake

177
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,300
of their children,

178
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,140
parents would...

179
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,570
As the Chief Censor,

180
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,300
I supervise the enforcement
of the country's laws and regulations.

181
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,690
I get justice for the wronged ones,

182
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,940
or I fail the trust of the people

183
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,420
and of the ruler.

184
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,970
I don't give in to power or wealth

185
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:02,970
nor do I accuse innocent men.

186
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,180
Yu Qian is the backbone
of the Imperial Court.

187
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,970
It is immoral for me

188
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:07,850
to bring him down.

189
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,570
Your son

190
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,380
is serving in the Personal Guard
of the Court, right?

191
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,940
One day, he got drunk after the court

192
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,540
and raped a maid of the imperial palace.

193
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,540
My son sees me as a role model.

194
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,420
He is a righteous man

195
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,970
and would not have done
anything like that.

196
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:22,660
No?

197
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,380
But I think he did it.

198
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,610
Once you have a weakness,

199
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,940
sometimes you make mistakes

200
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,070
against your will.

201
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,430
Yu Qian

202
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,190
was someone I truly admired,

203
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,190
but look what happened to him

204
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,780
and to his family.

205
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,140
Everything was in vain

206
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,230
no matter how hard you tried.

207
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,470
Yu Qian was an honest
and honorable official,

208
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,710
but there were few like him.

209
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,830
Since then,

210
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,950
I couldn't look at my official robe

211
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,990
without guilt anymore.

212
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,470
That was why I resigned and left.

213
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,740
From a County Constable

214
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,430
to royals

215
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,900
and high-ranking officials,

216
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,140
this case is very complicated

217
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,540
and involves many people.

218
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:36,500
Young lady,

219
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,540
I'm an old man.

220
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,380
I don't have many years left.

221
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,310
Yet it is different for you.

222
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,950
Listen to my words.

223
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,380
Let it go

224
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,830
and do not confront Wu Youjing.

225
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,190
He is not someone you can mess with.

226
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,900
Don't get yourself killed

227
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,780
because of it.

228
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,590
I'm sorry, Mr. Hai.

229
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,590
Your Highness came
to visit me in person.

230
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,140
I guess

231
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,190
this is

232
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,500
where I'm going to spend my last days.

233
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,430
In the end,

234
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,710
we still end up

235
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,740
with this.

236
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,070
That's right.

237
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,140
It is an exchange of expendable pieces.

238
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,070
No one would have seen it coming.

239
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,380
You are suffering for me.

240
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,110
Back then,

241
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,350
you went to Tongquan for me

242
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,380
to rope Du Liang in.

243
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,190
Our goal was to take
the salt granary in Tongquan

244
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,140
into our hands.

245
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,190
There's nothing to regret about that.

246
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,860
Your game on salt

247
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,500
is halfway to victory.

248
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,070
The Li family

249
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,900
is counting on the Crown Prince.

250
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,020
They are waiting for a chance.

251
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,620
Her Majesty, meanwhile, doesn't favor
the eminent families

252
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:43,900
but promotes those with no background.

253
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,430
One day,

254
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,660
if Her Majesty passes away,

255
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,470
the Wu family

256
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,830
needs something to compete with them.

257
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:51,430
Salt

258
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,260
is the lifeblood of a country.

259
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,430
Only with salt in our hands

260
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,260
can the Wu family keep its foundation.

261
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,260
Prince of Kangping,

262
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,020
what should I do next?

263
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,430
Please tell me.

264
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,900
I will make a plea

265
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,260
to keep your family

266
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,740
from getting involved in this.

267
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:30,660
I see.

268
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,350
Ye Ping'an

269
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,990
can read the signs and see the trend.

270
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,860
She is a trouble in the chaotic game.

271
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,350
No matter what,

272
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,350
she has to be gone.

273
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:48,660
Ping'an,

274
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,110
I see that your thoughts are troubled.

275
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,740
You're in the capital,

276
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,540
but it is as if you're in a cage.

277
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,230
Have you considered leaving for a while?

278
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,710
To me,

279
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,990
everywhere is a cage.

280
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,540
Hai Yiping took his own life.

281
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,110
Yet I still feel

282
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,860
there is more behind this.

283
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,780
The end of the Censor case

284
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,380
didn't dispel all her doubts.

285
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,990
She still wants to look into the salt.

286
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,990
It could be a problem sooner or later.

287
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,740
Please make a plan in advance.

288
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,590
Father,

289
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,660
Ye Ping'an has to be gone.

290
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,310
She will figure
the Censor case out eventually.

291
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,350
It's not good for us to do it ourselves.

292
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,860
How about taking advantage
of the merciless official?

293
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,620
The Censor case?

294
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,110
Is it

295
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,590
all your plan?

296
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,830
And now, you want

297
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,430

298
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,430

299
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,780
respect the rules.

300
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,190
Tell me what the rules are.

301
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,310
I'm back from Gong Shao's place.

302
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,380
Do you know what I found?

303
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,430
I always thought

304
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,500
the one
who was stealing the official salt

305
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,260
was Li Zongxu.

306
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,590
The Wu family

307
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,070
is prosperous.

308
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,190
Why would you do that?

309
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,540
Why?

310
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:58,740
Ankang.

311
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,740
You often mention that numerous people

312
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,620
died in the Battle of Jinyuan.

313
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,230
They died

314
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,140
because the Li family

315
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,860
was in charge of the official salt
and got in the way.

316
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,590
Do you want anything similar

317
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:11,540
to happen again?

318
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,710
No matter
who is in charge of the official salt,

319
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,110
it won't happen again

320
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,470
as long as all the officials

321
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,310
are honest

322
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,500
and upright.

what you are doing

is never for me.

326
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,780
You do it for your own power.

327
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,380
For that,

328
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,830
you stole the official salt

329
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,140
and ganged up with others.

330
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,430
You orchestrated the Censor case

331
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,830
and killed so many people.

332
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,110
It is

What do you think

380
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,260
makes a medicine effective?

386
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,150
while a severe illness

387
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,780
should wait.

388
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,500
May I ask

389
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,340
how to treat

390
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,020
an unknown disease?

391
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,190
It hides in the dark,

392
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,780
and the patient often pretends
it doesn't exist.

393
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,100
As time goes by,

394
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,710
a light symptom becomes a severe illness

395
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,100
and eventually something incurable.

396
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,300
By that time,

397
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,260
even the most miraculous medicine

398
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,100
cannot change anything.

399
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,580
Keep going.

400
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,580
The pain of the people

401
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,300
starts from their tolerance.

402
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,580
They value

403
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,910
bonds and relationships,

404
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,190
so that they endure

405
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,060
being exploited.

406
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,430
I travel around

407
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,580
to treat the unknown diseases of people

408
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,820
and keep them safe.

409
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,230
Ye Ping'an,

410
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:37,950
I finally see

411
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,340
how you treat people,

412
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,870
but your treatment is too strong

413
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,190
and inappropriate.

414
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,630
Your skill

415
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,300
still needs some refinement.

416

I heard from those coming to pay homage

422
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,390

427

Helping your father at that time

431
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,430

Leaving you behind
to run away from everything

433

437
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,150

I plead to lead the army to the border.

578
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,540
I will guard the Great Feng

579
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,630
and keep the foreigners out!

00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,990
I shouldn't throw the water on Mr. Yuan.

587
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,540
I am stupid.

588
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,020
I shouldn't throw the water on Mr. Yuan.

Let's go.

592
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,230
What did he do

593
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,500
to be punished this way?

594
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,500

to the Court of Judicial Review

596
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,430
for selling illegal salt.

597
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,540
The old man was mad.

598
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:07,670
He said his son did that

599
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,820
only because he was starving.

600
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,020
[Zhao Feng, Vice Minister of Justice]
He then threw a basin of water

601
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,430
over the head of Mr. Yuan.

602
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,540
This pissed the Underworld Lord off,

603
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,630
so the Underworld Lord

604
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,710
punished him to kneel here.

605
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,260

606
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,630
This is his nickname now?

607
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:21,390
That's right.

608
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:22,500
The Underworld Lord

609
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,870
used to be a nice guy.

610
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,710
He did a lot for the people

611
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,910
and helped Mang Gutter a lot.

612
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,230
But he has been
like a totally different person

613
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,580
since he was with the Mei alliance.

614
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,950
He is arrogant

615

and indulges in pleasure.

616
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,470
Anyone who crosses him will suffer.

617
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:37,780
He is cruel!

618
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,500
And the illegal salt smugglers
shouldn't take the blame.

619
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,060
The price of salt
dropped for a while last year,

620
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,500
but this year, it keeps going up.

621
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,470
The price of salt

622
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,630
is 400 wen per dou in the capital.

623
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,540
No one can afford it.

624
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,300
It is almost impossible
to have some salt.

625
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,190
I shouldn't throw the water on Mr. Yuan.

After the Khan died,

633
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,340
he took over the throne.

634
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,300
He simply disregarded
the alliance with the Great Feng,

635
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:18,150
held Wu Liangchen as hostage,

636
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,740
and sent troops to the south.

637
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,500
He is a barbarian.

The second prince killed his brother
and seized the throne.

639
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,780
It's created an atmosphere

640
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,100
of fear and uncertainty.

641

To settle down the internal affairs,

there's something I really don't get.

651
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,190
Why did you

652
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,540
ask the Vice Minister of Rites

653
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,710
to impeach you and say

654
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,820
you were extravagant
and only served for the money?

655
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:53,060
You ended up being punished
by Her Majesty.

656

657

00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,630
Do you know

00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,230
what defines a corrupt, upright,

Well...

662
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,670
To be honest,

663
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,870
Master, you don't consider yourself

664
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,260
as an upright one, do you?

665
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,470

667

eliminates opposition by purging them,

671

would have nothing on me.

678

get into any trouble lately, right?

682
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,540
Not exactly a problem,

683
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:58,630

00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:01,780
was out of his mind.

688
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,430
on Yuan Shaocheng in this cold weather.

689
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:05,990

to kneel on the street

while holding
a basin of water over his head

691
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:07,950
and apologizing out loud.

692
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,630
Deceit and loyalty can be very similar.

693
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,820

00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:30,060
why do you pretend to be sick

704
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,670
and avoid seeing him again and again?

705
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,470
You really didn't understand

706
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,540
a word I said just now.

708
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,430
asked me multiple times

709
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,670
to find him positions
in the areas with salt.

710
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,300

713
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,580

the problem with Mr. Mei is weird.

his entire body gets itchy,

734
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,990
and there will be red rashes.

735
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,910
So it's better not to get too close.

736
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,620

that before you get well,

what should we do?

746
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,060
