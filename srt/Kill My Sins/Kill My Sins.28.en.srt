[Kill My Sins]
[This is a work of fiction]

2
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,000
Mr. Mei, you have been sick
in bed for a while.

3
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,800
Do you feel better now?

4
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,750
I was bedridden,

5
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,640
but I needed to stay alert.

6
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,880
It's good to have a clear mind.

7
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,520
Bearing the throne

8
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,030
comes with a price.

9
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,720
Being an official

10
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:04,670
is nothing easy either.

11
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,960
You need to follow the will of the ruler

12
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,550
and feed and protect the people.

13
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,550
It can be difficult

14
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,150
to stay true to the mission.

15
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,520
I shall

16
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,270
make my best efforts
to serve you, Your Majesty.

17
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,520
Is there something bothering you?

18
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,640
I have a few nephews,

19
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,240
and I am closest

20
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,520
to Wu Youjing and Wu Yousi.

21
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,760
What do you think

22
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,360
if I were to depose my own son

23
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,550
and make one of them

24
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,480
the Crown Prince?

25
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,830
I thought you just said

26
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,990
you would make your best efforts
to serve me.

27
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,640
Why are you

28
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,150
in silence now?

29
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,110
All I want to say is

30
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,670
the mother of the ruler

31
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,520
can be enshrined
in the Imperial Ancestral Temple,

32
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,520
blessed with countless inheritances.

33
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,800
However, in history,

34
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,590
no ruler

35
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,830
has enshrined

36
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,990
their aunt or uncle

37
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,870
in the Imperial Ancestral.

[Tomb of Lu Danxin. Tomb of Cailian]

41
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,640
I saw the bell,

42
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,960
and I knew you were here.

43
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,680
There is no weed

44
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,080
but burning candles.

45
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:43,910
Thank you.

46
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,350
You shouldn't be back.

47
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,440
But you wish I were.

48
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,270
I will kill you.

49
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,030
Is that so?

50
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,030
What is in it for you?

51
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,790
I can take the credit

52
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,590
and get rewarded.

53
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,230
The Prince of Kangping

54
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,440
will support me
to be the chancellor soon.

55
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,470
It seems like I mean a lot.

56
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,590
However, you do know

57
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,830
that the Prince of Kangping

58
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:14,880
is not going to let anyone

59
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,150
from Mang Gutter

60
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,030
become the chancellor.

61
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,830
So what?

62
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,880
I can bear it.

63
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,440
I can wait.

64
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,440
Wait?

65
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:25,960
For what?

66
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,790
To be the son-in-law
of the Prince of Kangping?

67
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,030
Is the wedding date
of Xian'er and you decided?

68
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,320
In his mind, there is no difference

69
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,710
between you and Hai Yiping.

70
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,120
You only see

71
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,270
that Wu Youjing is using me,

72
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,640
but maybe,

73
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,560
I'm also taking advantage of him.

74
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,660
That's why I said

75
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,980
you wished me here.

76
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,900
You need me to help you.

77
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,370
It must be difficult

78
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,730
to collect evidence
of him controlling the official salt

79
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,340
by yourself.

80
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,610
It will only be more risky

81
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,220
if you are

82
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,980
around me.

83
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,410
What if we convince them

84
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,490
we are

85
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,020
on the opposite sides?

86
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,580
Wu Youjing won't cooperate

87
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,700
with illegal salt smugglers easily.

88
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:17,660
That's why

89
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,780
I'm going to draw him in

90
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,410
with a fake Huang Yimin.

91
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:25,780
You should go.

92
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:26,700
Go!

93
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,100
Zhao Feng will be there,

94
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,050
so Wu Xian'er will let me bring Jin

95
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,020
to the Court of Judicial Review Prison.

96
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,660
She will be there

97
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,780
for the investigation as well.

98
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,220
That's why

99
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,410
Jin cannot confess straightly.

100
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,140
You have to force him.

101
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,140
With what?

102
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:51,460
With his family.

103
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,250
I have a cousin.

104
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:54,170
I will

105
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,810
tell you his details afterward.

106
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,100
Then, Jin will

107
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,810
tell them everything

108
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,490
about the first step of our plan.

109
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,460
That's right.

110
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,370
We know

111
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:06,900
no Huang Yimin.

112
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,580
We pretended to be him

113
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,580
only

114
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,460
because of

115
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,050
his reputation.

116
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,140
Wu Xian'er knows

117
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,850
that I like to make up stories,

118
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,050
so I can't let her down.

119
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,050
Wu Xian'er

120
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,780
will then believe

121
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,410
Huang Yimin and I

122
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,020
have no connection at all.

123
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,140
Good on you.

124
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,100
You are going to slip a small lie

125
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,580
into the truth

126
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,980
to confuse others.

127
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,780
However, once I have Jin,

128
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,140
I will have to interrogate him for real.

129
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:42,610
Otherwise,

130
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,100
it will be suspicious.

131
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:44,980
Don't worry.

132
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,780
This is a special pill.

133
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,020
It won't kill me.

134
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,140
I will take it

135
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,140
when I'm in prison.

136
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,540
You are using illegal salt

137
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,900
to expose Wu Xian'er,

138
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,370
but once they find out,

139
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,580
Wu Xian'er and Wu Youjing

140
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,900
will hunt you down in the capital.

141
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,020
Then,

142
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,900
it will be dangerous for you

143
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,660
to even be in the capital.

144
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,100
That's why

145
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,810
I'm going to find the Master Suxuan

146
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:12,780
you told me about.

147
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,370
I will ask her to join me

148
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,250
and hide in the black market.

149
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:18,490
You should

150
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,610
come in time

151
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,610
with the Prince of Kangping,

152
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:21,810
so that

153
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,410
you have a reason

154
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,700
not to be suspected.

155
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,370
Why don't you ask Master Suxuan

156
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,140
to reveal the truth

157
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,100
of the Censor case directly?

158
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,580
Isn't it what you want?

159
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,300
Because this has become

160
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,220
more than the Censor case now.

161
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,980
We can't stay
in the black market for long.

162
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,370
You need to make a tunnel

163
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,940
from Mang Gutter

164
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,580
to the haunted house at Yanqing Lane.

165
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,180
There is some distance.

166
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,100
We will have a very tight schedule.

167
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,770
Or

168
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:51,940
it will be a perfect one.

169
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,980
I will leave it to you two.

170
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,220
How was the food

171
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,730
from He Meng?

172
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,700
It was much better

173
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,610
than what I had in Caozhou.

174
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:12,580
The liquor is good, too.

175
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,250
And it's a lot.

176
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,580
So does Jin

177
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:18,940
really have a cousin?

178
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,370
Of course...

179
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,180
not.

180
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:31,980
Let's go to get some air.

181
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,650
Take a break,

182
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,420
everyone.

183
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,850
Come to get the mantou.

184
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,300
It's for everyone.

185
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,420
Come here and get one.

186
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,700
Continue with a full belly.

187
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:46,530
Here.

188
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,420
Here you are.

189
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,370
Take it.

190
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,650
Thank you.

191
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,420
Here. It's for everyone.

192
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:50,980
Thank you.

193
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,300
Mr. Wang, here you go.

00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,940
Wait, this is...

387
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:04,290
You...

388
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,180
This is...

389
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,330
[Receipt. The 9th of the 11th month.
500 dan of salt for 500 liang of silver]

390
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:09,980
Mr. Huang,

391
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,380
what is this for?

392
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,700
Sir, you should know

393
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,570
who my father is.

394
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,570
Only with this,

395
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,140
my father will send

396
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:16,940
the next batch of salt.

397
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,180
I never heard about

398
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,530
this rule before.

399
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,380
If we don't have

400
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,620
any receipts,

401
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,330
you can sell us out anytime.

402
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:27,140
Am I right?

403
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:29,980
You are overthinking it.

404
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,460
Even if you don't trust me,

405
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,490
you have to trust
that person's reputation.

406
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,460
I care nothing about reputation.

407
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:36,860
If anything goes sideways,

408
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,770
my father and I will be most affected.

409
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:39,980
Assistant Minister,

410
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,090
what are you worrying about?

411
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:43,860
But...

412
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,010
We have a lot of salt ready to be sold,

413
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,770
but you don't even
want to give us a receipt.

414
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,180
If you have time,

415
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,530
I don't mind you asking

416
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,090
that person first.

417
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,460
I can wait.

418
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:57,490
Or

419
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,290
you can sign it yourself.

420
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:00,660
What do you think?

421
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,250
Sign it!

422
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,420
I will.

423
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,050
Like father,

424
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,460
like son.

425
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,620
You can fake some decency,
but you are a barbarian

426
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,730
in nature
as the son of an illegal salt smuggler.

427
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,220
Wang Hechang,

428
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,220
you are the Minister of Rites.

429
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,620
Tell me about this memorial.

430
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,460
Your Majesty,

431
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,250
the Prince of Kangping
has made great achievements.

432
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,380
He is a capable and virtuous man,

433
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,900
a role model for all officials.

434
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,860
Thousands of people signed a petition,

435
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,490
and I'm presenting
the wish of the people.

436
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,050
[Wang Hechang, Minister of Rites]
Please make Wu Youjing

437
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,700
the Crown Prince.

438
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,330
This is...

439
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,330
The current Crown Prince
is in the Orient House,

440
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,700
and he makes no mistake.

441
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,660
This is an absurd proposal

442
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,220
from you, Minister Wang.

443
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,380
Do you have any respect

444
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,330
for the hierarchy or rites?

445
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,140
This is to depose the son
without any reason.

446
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,660
Do you want Her Majesty

447
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,330
to bear the accusation of injustice?

448
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,050
You...

449
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:52,980
Mr. Li,

450
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,380
no ruler in history has made anyone

451
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,530
of another family name as their heir.

452
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,860
The Crown Prince should be a man
of the Wu family.

453
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,090
It follows the rites

454
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,420
and is a matter of course.

455
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:01,660
Making the nephew the Crown Prince

456
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,010
is not without precedent.

457
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,090
The nephew
of Chen Baxian, the founding ruler

458
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,090
of the Chen dynasty,

459
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,050
led the prosperity
of the Reign of Tianjia.

460
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,570
Chen Baxian's five sons
died at an early age,

461
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,570
so he had to pass his throne
to his nephew.

462
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,180
Why don't you mention

463
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,620
the example of Emperor Cheng of Han,

464
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,420
who made his nephew the Crown Prince,

465
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,530
regardless of his sons,

466
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,620
and caused unrest in the nation?

467
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:21,330
Your Majesty,

468
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,250
the Crown Prince
is fundamental to a realm.

469
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,980
It shouldn't be altered easily.

470
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,010
Your Majesty,

471
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,420
the matter of the Crown Prince
is critical to the realm.

472
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,980
The decision cannot be made at will.

473
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:37,330
I reckon

474
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,420
that since there is no consensus,

475
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,220
it requires further discussion.

476
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:43,460
You...

477
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,050
The war against Shuodan

478
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,140
is still on.

479
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,460
The cold hinders
the transportation of grain and salt.

480
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,380
We have a lot to worry about.

481
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,220
We will discuss the Crown Prince later.

482
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,290
That is all.

483
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,220
You may leave.

484
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:01,980
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

485
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,900
[Mei Mansion]

486
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,260
Shaocheng,

487
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,500
I invite you here today

488
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,330
to talk about salt.

489
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,570
You've been
with the Prince of Kangping for a while.

490
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,940
You should

491
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,460
have known

492
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,460
the majority of it.

493
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,130
Now,

494
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,740
it's time to pretend
that you know nothing.

495
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,220
Actually, sometimes,

496
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,700
the more I know about it,

497
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,180
the more confused I get.

498
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,330
The Prince of Kangping

499
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,850
has so much salt in his hands.

500
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:40,900
Can he take everything in?

501
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,570
It's not only for him,

502
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,220
but also for those with him,

503
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,570
including the eminent families

504
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:50,610
and the gentry.

505
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,020
Salt can bring them
a substantial amount of money,

506
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,330
and with the money,

507
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,220
they can buy more land.

508
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,420
The official title cannot be passed down
to their children,

509
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,570
but the land can.

510
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,770
Once they are all fed,

511
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,900
he can secure his position.

512
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,500
The more supporters he gets,

513
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,290
the more land will be taken.

514
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,900
As a result, more people

515
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,850
will be forced to become vagrants.

516
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,610
When they

517
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,660
cannot make a living anymore,

518
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,180
they become thieves.

519
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,260
They become illegal salt smugglers.

520
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:17,810
Therefore,

521
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,050
without solving the problem of the land,

522
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,530
the world will be in disorder.

523
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,420
No one can solve the land problem.

524
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,500
It's all tangled

525
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,850
and mashed together.

526
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,940
If you want to put your idea
into practice,

527
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,330
you are literally

528
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,180
taking their food away.

529
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,130
Unless one day,

530
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,570
you have ultimate power,

531
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:39,940
and then...

532
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,330
Isn't that

533
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,810
what you are trying to do?

534
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,500
Please pardon me.

535
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,500
For what?

536
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:54,740
I've been

537
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,660
serving the realm for my whole life.

538
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:57,770
I'm tired.

539
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,810
It's time to give the position away.

540
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,220
The Great Feng

541
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,050
needs people like Yu Qian.

542
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,740
He was like the backbone.

543
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,500
It also needs people like you.

544
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,370
You are the flesh.

545
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,370
Remember,

546
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,610
loyalty is not the only requirement.

547
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,980
Supporters are essential, too.

548
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,020
Most of all, be capable.

549
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,850
I once

550
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,420
told the same thing to Hai Yiping.

551
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,530
Unfortunately, he still went astray.

552
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:36,770
I hope

553
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,740
you won't let me down.

554
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,420
I will bear it in mind, Chancellor Mei.

555
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,700
They opposed changing the Crown Prince?

556
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,740
These people are old and rotten.

557
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,810
People like Zhao Feng

558
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,850
support
the Crown Prince from the Li family.

559
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,330
That's why
you need to pay more attention

560
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,420
to them.

561
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,050
They are traitors.

562
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,220
I understood.

563
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,290
The salt from Huang Yimin
belongs to the salt shop now,

564
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,180
so it is the official salt.

565
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,260
Send it to the border

566
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,050
under my name

567
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:18,980
to keep the soldiers' morale.

568
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,090
Got it.

569
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,330
Compared to the Crown Prince

570
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,220
who lives in the Orient House
but contributes nothing,

571
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,460
you have done so much

572
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,770
for the realm, Father.

573

If Her Majesty sees it,

574
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,260

581

As long as I have the pieces,

584
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,180
I can decide how the game goes.

585
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,740
I can lower the price of the salt

586

when appropriate,

587
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,180

the so-called support from them.

The key

592
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,260
is to find a way

from eminent families

to change the Crown Prince,

However, I need to remind you.

605
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,330
The ruler may reign for a century,

606
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,980

can last for millennia.

00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,130

761
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:25,900
it is going to last.

The grain and salt
on the northern border

763
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,130
will not last

764
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,530
for over two months, and Wu Youjing

765
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,420
is in charge of the transportation
of the military necessity.

00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,220
What should we do then?

If you miss the chance,

770
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,290
Wu Youjing will destroy the evidence,

771
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:38,900

Apuna Xuanye of Shuodan

782
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,860
is a fierce general.

783
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:11,020
He is good at tug of war
and luring the enemy.

784
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,860
This time,

785
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,940
he had been retreating

786
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:16,900
only to lure our army

to the snowy mountain

00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,500
Luckily, Ankang

00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,690
noticed it in advance

791
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,130
and avoided greater loss.

792
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,820
Ankang won't be held accountable

793
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:28,820
for the loss.

794
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,210
Thank you
for forgiving him, Your Majesty,

795
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,210
Ankang retreated
and is now guarding the city,

796
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,730
but I'm sure he is figuring out
how to fight back.

797
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,300
A winter war

798
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:38,570
is always hard

799
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:39,980
and not our strength.

800
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:41,210
I know

801
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:43,130
that you are helping the border.

802
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:45,020
You did it

803
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,780
out of a good intention.

804
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:50,250
It is my duty

to share the burden of Your Majesty.

806
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:55,610
You share my burden,
but you also bring me trouble.

about the official salt.

Do you have anything to explain?

810
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,780
It is a complete lie.

811
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,690
There are always ill-intentioned men

the Awakening by Illumination

831
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,130
of Avatamsaka Sutra.

832
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:01,730

Yes, Your Majesty.

Sir,

836
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:20,420
you and Ye Ping'an
kept everyone in secret

837
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,020
and pretended to be enemies for so long.

838
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,820
Today was a perfect chance.

839
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,650
Why did she give up?

840
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:28,380
It was for the northern border.

841
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,730
Are you going to see her

842
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:32,610
and discuss the next move?

843
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,420
We cannot make any move
if nothing changes

844
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:37,900

on the northern border,

845
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,020

848
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,300
Ye Ping'an had done so much.

849
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,540
Why didn't she hand the ledger

850
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,300
to Li Jun?

851
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:04,860
I guess

852
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:06,940
she didn't want to put the border

853
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:07,690
at risk.

854
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,050
Arrogant.

855
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:12,820

Now,

866
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,460
even if Ye Ping'an shows the ledger

867
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,460
as evidence,

868
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:34,980
it won't make a difference.

869
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,090
Evidence can be faked

870
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,980
and can disappear.

The key

872
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,050
is the attitude of the Empress.

873
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,980
So what should we do now?

874
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,340
Right now,

Before that,

881
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:06,690
all you need
is to read the Empress's mind.

Father has kept

890
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,730
the setting of your room well.

891
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:36,860
I heard
that you took the illegal salt

892
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,530
and sold it as the official one.

893
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,940
It is only a rumor.

894
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,570
This situation is very complicated.

895
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:44,250
You shouldn't listen to the lies.

896
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,820
It's okay.

897
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,090
We didn't separate,

898
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,130
and now,

899
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:50,650
the family
is going through some trouble.

900
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,460
I shouldn't stand by.

901
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,340
All these years,

902
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,730
without you, the mansion felt like

903
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,900
an empty house.

904
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,300
When your mother
started living in the mansion,

905
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:02,820
she was very active.

906
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,610
She brought liveliness
to where she was.

907
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,530
She said

908
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,820
that we should be a common couple.

909
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:09,460
We should forget about the rites

910
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,170
and rules.

911
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,650
I am no longer

Sure.

917
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:30,340
You are not the same anymore,

918
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:32,460
but it will

919
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:33,690
hurt Xian'er
