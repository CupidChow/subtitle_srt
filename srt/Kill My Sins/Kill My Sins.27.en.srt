deserve to die miserably.

4
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,470
You took our farmland,

5
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,310
forcing us to become homeless.

6
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:01,030
How are we supposed to live?

Mr. Li.

00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,670
[Li Jun, In-palace Enquiry Censor]

12
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,520
Last year, the Empress
suddenly summoned me and scolded me

13
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,080
for dishonoring Ehuang, Nyuying,
and Emperor Shun

14
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,800
by using cruel punishment.

15
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,270
I was given a severe reprimand

16
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,670
and ordered

17
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,990
to reflect on my actions until now.

18
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,960
All of this is thanks to Ye Ping'an.

19
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,430
I've been consumed day and night

20
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,990
with thoughts

21
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,800
of how to make her suffer.

22
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,760
The Empress has now

23
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,640
sent you

24
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,150
to Xinkai Prison in Lijing Gate.

25
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,710
Clearly, she still values you.

26
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,200
Zhou Mi was at the same rank
as me last year.

27
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,710
He was promoted
to Palace Chamberlain this year.

28
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,920
I must

29
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,150
seize this opportunity to make merit

30
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,240
and show Her Majesty

31
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,150
that I am the one

32
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,520
who is capable.

33

[Wanted]
Ye Ping'an secretly hoarded armor.

34
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,960
She must be plotting rebellion.

35
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:47,710
Do you agree?

36
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,870
Of course.

37
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,110
Capturing her

38
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,920
will be a great achievement.

39
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,550
But

40
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,270
where could she be hiding?

41
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,520
If she's hiding in the mountains,

42
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,760
it will be hard to find her.

43
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,080
I know her tactics well.

44
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,480
She should still be

45
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,080
in the capital.

46
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,150
Take a look here.

47
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,080
Pick one.

48
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:18,390
Come on.

49
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,590
Choose one you like.

50
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,440
Take a look.

51
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,080
After the winter,

52
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,350
the flowers in the capital
will all bloom.

53
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,590
But who will be there

54
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,910
to appreciate them?

55
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,390
Our enemies or us?

56
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,640
Wu Xian'er's moves

57
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,960
are truly ruthless.

58
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,680
She uses the illegally sold
sets of armor

59
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,350
to frame you for treason.

60
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,830
Xian'er wants

61
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,120
to cut off my retreat.

62
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,020
As the saying goes,

63
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,410
one set of armor equals
three crossbows

64
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,020
and three sets of armor
can result in execution.

65
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,660
The law strictly forbids
stashing illegal armor.

66
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,730
It shouldn't be circulated
in the market.

67
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,220
I don't even know

68
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,610
where she got it from.

69
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,170
What about Jin?

70
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,460
Should we just ignore them?

71
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,930
Although

72
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,850
entering the Court of Judicial Review
isn't ideal,

73
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:19,900
it's safer

74
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,370
than anywhere else.

75
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,340
Yes, Ping'an is right.

76
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,100
Now,

77
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,460
we're actually in more danger.

78
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,370
Once the warrant is issued,

79
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,780
doing anything will be impossible.

80
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,100
The black market isn't safe either.

81
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,810
The hefty rewards

82
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,290
will be too much

83
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,050
for many to resist.

84
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,100
Did we make a mistake

85
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:36,980
to return to the city?

86
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,700
The curfew has passed,

87
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,980
so even if we want to leave,

88
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,660
it's impossible.

89
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,700
Entering the city is difficult,

90
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,730
and leaving the city is just as hard.

91
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,660
But what we need to do

92
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,980
must be done within the city.

93
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,370
Father, you've spent

94
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,370
an entire year
carving this wooden sculpture.

95
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,850
I truly admire

96
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,140
your patience.

97
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,490
Building a structure

98
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,220
requires a tremendous amount of effort,

99
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,370
while its collapse

100
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,850
can happen in the blink of an eye.

101
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:00,930
Father,

102
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:01,700
could you recall

103
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,340
the officials

104
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,540
guarding the salt fields?

105
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,140
They've been occupying

106
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,140
the farmland around the salt fields,

107
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,580
turning farmers into refugees.

108
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,220
Not only does this offend the Empress,

109
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,460
but it will also cause the people

110
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,340
to resent the Wu family.

111
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,490
To ensure this structure
remains standing,

112
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,490
the most important thing

113
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,700
is a solid foundation.

114
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,850
With land, grain, and salt in hand,

115
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,780
the aristocratic families' power
is secure.

116
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,140
With the Empress at the top,

117
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,340
I'm in the middle,

118
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,610
I shall balance the families' interests

119
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,370
while easing the Empress's burdens.

120
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,780
It's difficult.

121
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,250
But the tower

122
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,610
stands only because

123
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,340
it's built

124
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,420
on the people's support.

125
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,980
If we lose the people's trust,

126
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,140
it's a loss that can't be recovered.

127
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,580
Father,

128
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,540
if you truly hope the Wu family

129
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,900
will inherit the throne
after the Empress's reign,

130
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:46,940
you shouldn't seek short-term support

131
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,500
from the aristocracy at the cost

132
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,100
of losing the people's favor.

133
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:50,700
Xian'er,

134
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,500
where did you

135
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,340
get those sets of armor?

136
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,780
I once saved

137
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,780
a general's life.

138
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,620
Borrowing a few suits of armor from him

139
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,460
isn't difficult.

140
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,140
You've never mentioned

141
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,100
such a general to me before.

142
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,660
I'll tell you more about him later.

143
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,820
For now, the urgent matter

144
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,020
is to find Ye Ping'an.

145
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,380
I believe

146
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,980
she's hiding in the capital.

147
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,940
Mr. Zhang is back in the capital.

148
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,220
Borrow someone
in the Ministry of Justice

149
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,140
from him.

150
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,700
Since Ye Ping'an dares to return,

151
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,580
we'll make sure she never leaves again.

152
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:46,980
Mr. Li,

153
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,540
we have searched

154
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,340
the entire capital.

155
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,260
We've checked the clinic,

156

157
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:52,780
the fabric shop,

158
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,060
and every place she might've been,

159
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,260
but we found

160
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,860
no trace of her.

161
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,260
Are you sure?

162
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,980
Have you checked the black market

163
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,700
near Yanqing Lane?

164
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,100
Not yet.

165
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,300
Let's go.

166
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,180
[Ministry of Justice]
Mr. Zhang,

167
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,580
the warrant has been issued
for seven days.

168
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,220
If you don't catch her soon,

169
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,340
you'll have trouble

170
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,660
explaining it to my father.

171
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:20,700
The Ministry of Justice

172
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,100
has already increased manpower.

173
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,500
Please give us a few more days.

174
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,220
At most, three days.

175
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,060
Bring Ye Ping'an alive to me.

176
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,140
Mr. Zhang, Miss Wu,

177
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,140
someone takes the warrant,

178
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,460
claiming they saw Ye Ping'an

179
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,020
at Jiulong Pavilion

180
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,740
in the black market.

181
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,140
This is exactly what we needed.

182
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,340
Mr. Zhang,

183
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,740
let's go together

184
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,820
and capture Ye Ping'an.

185
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,420
Mr. Yuan,

186
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,500
our scouts report

187
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,860
that Ye Ping'an is hiding
in the black market.

188
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,140
Fine liquor! Give it a try!

189
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,540
Come taste this great liquor!

190
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,380
It's homemade!

191
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,700
No.

192
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,820
Drink.

193
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,500
Come on, drink up.

194
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:11,700
Drink them all.

195
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,220
Cheers.

196
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,460
Mr. Li,

197
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,300
should we proceed in secret

198
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,060
or...?

199
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,900
When do we ever need

200
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,220
to act covertly?

201
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,380
Everyone,

202
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:29,780
back to your rooms,

203
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,580
light the lamps,

204
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,540
and open the doors.

205
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,500
After three counts,

206
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,260
anyone still on the streets

207
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,660
will be considered a co-conspirator

208
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,860
and killed.

209
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,780
If any house hasn't lit its lamps

210
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,620
or opened its doors,

211
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,220
kill them without hesitation.

212
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,140
Three.

213
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,380
Two.

214
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,580
One.

215
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,300
Search every house.

216
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,340
Whoever captures Ye Ping'an

217
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,340
will be greatly rewarded!

218
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,140
Miss An,

219
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,580
the merciless officials
are leading a search

220
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,700
in the black market for you.

221
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,860
Ping'an, we should leave now.

222
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,380
I'm afraid we can't.

223
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,260
Ping'an,

224
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,460
what should we do now?

225
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:24,980
Since we can't leave,

226
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,300
we'll stay.

227
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,500
The lamps on the east side

228
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,180
have somehow

229
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:42,940
been all lit.

230
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,300
The east side is cleared.

231
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:52,740
Nothing found.

232
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,620
Mr. Li,

233
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,700
nothing is found here either.

234
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,380
Search the west side!

235
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,140
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

236
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:11,620
Ping'an.

237
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,780
[Jiulong Pavilion]

238
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,060
I think I smell

239
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,420
the scent of prey.

240
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,780
Everyone,

241
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,500
surround Jiulong Pavilion!

242
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,260
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

243
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,540
It's Li Jun's men.

244
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,420
They're coming in.

245
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:49,740
Miss Wu?

246
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,660
Mr. Zhang?

247
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:52,780
Wu Xian'er is here too.

248
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,260
Of course she'd come.

249
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,660
What a big scene here.

250
00:11:59,180 --> 00:11:59,900
Mr. Zhang,

251
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,380
this is Jiulong Pavilion.

252
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:02,900
Understood.

253
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,740
Go in and capture her.

254
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,420
Wait!

255
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:08,780
Mr. Li,

256
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,660
what do you mean?

257
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,660
What do I mean?

258
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,420
I was the first
to find Jiulong Pavilion.

259
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,420
Ye Ping'an was involved in illegal salt,

260
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,300
and then in the armor trade.

261
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,380
The case is complex.

262
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,300
The Ministry of Justice will take over
for further questioning.

263
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,340
Besides,

264
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,660
I know all the details of the case,

265
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,260
so you don't have to worry, Mr. Li.

266
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,780
She's involved in the armor trade.

267
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,420
There's clear suspicion of rebellion.

268
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,340
Any case involving that

269
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,820
must go through Xinkai Prison
for interrogation.

270
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,820
This is something I must handle.

271
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:39,860
Ye Ping'an,

272
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,580
you have no way out.

273
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,780
Come out.

274
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,820
Mr. Li, it seems she doesn't care
for your authority.

275
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,500
I'll have to go in
and invite her myself.

276
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:54,620
Step aside.

277
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:55,700
Li Jun,

278
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:56,940
aren't you afraid

279
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,820
I'll report you to the Empress

280
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,140
and have you punished?

281
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,420
Step aside.

282
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:10,860
Ping'an,

283
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,100
what should we do?

284
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,380
They're breaking in.

285
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,620
Mother?

286
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,220
What are you doing here?

287
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,620
You are...?

288
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,620
I've heard you've been following
the monastic life for years.

289
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,260
I came today

290
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,700
to seek your guidance.

291
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,540
What is troubling you?

292
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,060
I've felt guilty

293
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,700
about the past.

294
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,020
But finally,

295
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,740
I put an end

296
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,220
to it.

297
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,500
From now on,

298
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,260
can I forgive myself?

299
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,580
And can I

300
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,620
forgive others?

301
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,660
Everything that increases
eventually declines.

302
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,580
What is full will eventually be drained.

303
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,260
Some people hold power

304
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,980
but act against the way.

305
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,900
Such people will fall sooner or later.

306
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,180
Why should one intervene

307
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,980
in the laws of nature?

308
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,300
Meeting you here

309
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,020
is a stroke of fate.

310
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,180
Since it's fate,

311
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,140
I should leave the mountain now.

312
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:23,520
[Jiulong Pavilion]

313
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,340
Miss An, you're here.

314
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:34,610
This guy is greedy.

315
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:35,490
Now that he's seen you,

316
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:36,530
he'll surely report it
to the authorities.

317
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,980
Master Suxuan, I'm afraid

318
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,010
you'll have to stay a bit longer.

319
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,420
I know what you're planning.

320
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,890
You want me to be your backup.

321
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,700
The person you're looking for

322
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,460
is no longer in the black market.

323
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,650
Good move.

324
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,850
What a good move.

325
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,770
She managed to find you.

326
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:08,580
So this is the famous

327
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,610
Master Suxuan

328
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,220
from Wan'an Mountain.

329
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,530
I've heard much about you.

330
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,060
Master Suxuan has lived in seclusion
for many years.

331
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,940
You came down the mountain now

332
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,980
and are involved with Ye Ping'an,

333
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:18,940
the fugitive.

334
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,820
I came down the mountain

335
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,100
with no connection
to the person you mentioned.

336
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,820
It's just that I've understood
some things.

337
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:30,530
Xian'er,

338
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,980
you've suffered

339
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,180
all these years.

340
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,220
The past

341
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,610
doesn't matter to me

342
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:44,980
anymore.

343
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,220
But the past

344
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,940
matters to me.

345
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,420
I once made a mistake

346
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,850
I can never undo.

347
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,300
To this day,

348
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,250
I cannot let that mistake stand.

349
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,650
What is the mistake

350
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,130
you mention?

351
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:07,620
The mistake is...

352
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,290
Mother.

353
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,570
What are you doing?

354
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,090
Who gave you the courage

355
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,940
to encircle my wife?

356
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:21,620
Your Highness, you've misunderstood.

357
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,620
We're here to capture a fugitive.

358
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,050
We didn't expect

359
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,900
Master Suxuan to be here.

360
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,220
We also want to know

361
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,810
what's going on.

362
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,530
Xuanmin,

363
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,140
you've finally come down
from the mountain.

364
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,860
I'm a Taoist now.

365
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,250
Your Highness,

366
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,620
just call me by my title.

367
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,330
Over the years,

368
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,090
Xian'er and I

369
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,090
have waited every single day
for you to return.

370
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,570
Even the rock sugar cakes...

371
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:53,860
I know

372
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:54,940
why you're saying this.

373
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,010
You may not care about me,

374
00:17:59,050 --> 00:17:59,980
but Xian'er has grown up.

375
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,090
She's served the Empress for many years,

376
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,700
and after much hardship,

377
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,420
she's finally become
an official of the court.

378
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,570
Aren't you happy for her?

379
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:10,700
Mother,

380
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,140
please come back with us.

381
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:16,940
I'm staying right here.

382
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,140
I'm not going anywhere.

383
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,530
But this place

384
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,530
it's too noisy.

385
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,570
You come from the Wei family,

386
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,490
and your status is noble.

387
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,700
This place is not suited
for your peaceful life.

388
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,730
All the turmoil is fleeting.

389
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,900
Only by freeing oneself from desires
can one find peace.

390
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,620
Without you,

391
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:35,660
I feel this place

392
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,570
is even more peaceful
than anywhere else.

393
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,530
Your Highness,

394
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,180
there are too many eyes here.

395
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,180
Let them all leave.

396
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,730
It's all a misunderstanding.

397
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,530
Since there's no fugitive,

398
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,460
you guys should leave.

399
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:03,250
Let's go.

400
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,050
Take care, Mother.

[Jiulong Pavilion]

402
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,770
Luckily, your plan worked.

403
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,250
I nearly died from fear

404
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,460
when they were about to break in.

405
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,530
After so long,

406
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,570
Li Jun is back on our tail.

407
00:19:58,770 --> 00:19:59,660
Besides him,

408
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,090
Wu Youjing has sent more men

409
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:01,700
to track us down.

410
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,180
We're surrounded on all sides.

411
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,770
Master Suxuan stayed in the black market

412
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:07,810
to make

413
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,220
Wu Youjing wary.

414
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,380
For now,

415
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,810
he won't send anyone else after us.

416
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,330
But still,

417
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,250
we need to find a new place to stay.

418
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:16,530
Let's go.

419
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,090
We'll thank her properly.

00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:35,900
It seems Ye Ping'an

424
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,420
had everything planned from the start.

425
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,770
Someone must

426
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,140
have told her about the old matters

427
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:40,860
in our manor,

428
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,770
so she convinced Mother
to come down the mountain.

429
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,460
Who could it be?

430
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:46,940
I wonder who it is.

432
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,090
what do you think?

433
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,250
In my opinion,

434
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,050
there's a traitor in the manor.

435
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,490
If that's true,

436
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,420
we need to find them out quickly.

437
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,380
People in our manor

438
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,380
are all excellent,

439
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,250
loyal, and trustworthy.

440
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,810
They have no reason to betray us.

441
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,290
Those in power

442
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,050
often see those below them

443
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,140
as mere tools

444
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,290
and forget they also
have feelings and desires.

445
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,860
But they are still humans.

446
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,140
And humans

447
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,660
can be tempted.

448

What about you?

449
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:19,940
What temptation

450

could sway you?

You suspect me?

Yes,

Xian'er, don't forget

455
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,900
that I was the one
who noticed the false lead

456
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,660
about Ye Ping'an in the black market,

457
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,810
which allowed His Highness
to arrive in time.

458
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:37,810
Even if you take your anger out on me,

459
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,730
it won't change the fact

460
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:41,770
that you lost to Ye Ping'an

461
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,050
in the end.

462
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,730
The mountain roads are slippery,

463
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,490
and with the snow, it's hard to travel.

464
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,530
We've already lost

465
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,050
several salt carts.

466
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,490
How can we replenish the supply?

467
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:56,860
I have a suggestion.

468
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,180
The Huang Yimin Ye Ping'an found

469
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,220
was a fake.

Why don't we

471
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,730
find the real one?

476

and searching for him.

477
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,140
Finally, I found

478
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,420
Huang Yimin's son, Huang Qi,

479
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,570
and through him,

480

bring him a warm coat.

Yes, Master.

485
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:30,700
I can't take credit for this.

486
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,290
It was Mr. Yuan

487
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,620
who remembered Your Highness's concerns

488
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,530
and helped me get the token

489
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,660
that Huang Qi left

490
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,460
after getting help from others.

491
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:37,730
Only then was I able

492
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:38,860
to resolve this smoothly.

493
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,180

at the Court of Judicial Review.

Thank you, Your Highness.

can Huang Yimin sell?

500
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:56,700
He has 50,000 dan of salt.

Huang Yimin insists on meeting you
in person

504
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,180
before agreeing to the deal.

A lowly smuggler

506
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:05,980
certainly has a big attitude.

507
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:07,980

Mr. Yuan.

511
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,010
You will

512
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:22,940
become

But don't worry,

I swear I will

516
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,980
be a great helper to you.

517
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:29,620
Remember,

518
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,570
I can tolerate something once,

519
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,290
but I will never allow anyone

520
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,770
to threaten me twice.

521
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:41,460
Yes.

522
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:42,180
I got it.

523
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,420

529
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:02,940
that once she's captured,

530

she must be strictly interrogated.

Isn't this a bit

532
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:06,980
too harsh?

533
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,570
Do we really have to push her

534
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,460
to the brink of death?

535
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,460
Father, are you worried

536
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,090
about me talking to Huang Yimin?

537
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,660
I just want you to be more cautious.

538
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,570
This batch of salt is significant.

539
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,420
I'll send someone to Caozhou

541
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,660

After the Censor case
was re-investigated,

544
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,460
the Empress dismissed
several salt officials.

Yet the salt price

546
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,700
is even higher than last year,

547

this unusually strange.

that everything I do

is to ensure the development
of Great Feng.

the burden of military supplies
for the border war

558
00:24:58,810 --> 00:24:59,530
rests on my shoulders.

Ping'an,

572
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,250
the secret tunnel is ready.

573
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,490
We can change locations now.

574
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:20,770
Let's go.

575
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:32,420
Master,

576
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:33,570
I've confirmed that the person

577
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:34,700
He Maoshan is looking for

578
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:35,770
is indeed Huang Yimin.

579
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,180
We've explained our intentions

580
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,660
and shown our sincerity.

581
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:39,770
He's agreed to meet.

582
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:40,570
He's now

583
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:41,860
at Dong Shan.

584
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:43,620
Let's

585
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:44,810
go to Dong Shan.

586
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:45,460
Yes, Master.

587
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,420
Master,

588
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,090
do you need Mr. Yuan to come with us?

589
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:49,570
No need.

590
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,450
[Huang Yimin, an illegal salt smuggler]

591
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,940
You seek an audience with me,

592
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,700
and I'm here.

593
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,050
That alone shows my sincerity.

594
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,180
No need for more words.

595
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,770
Give me a reasonable price.

596
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,700
How much salt do you have?

597
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,530
I'll take it all.

598
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:46,810
A master who's used

599
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,730
to controlling situations

600
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:49,940
should be

601
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,460
relaxed and calm.

602
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,010
Only those who serve,

603
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:55,620
like guards

604
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:57,420
or rookies

605
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,140
without any experience

606
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,090
would straighten up

607
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,490
like you

608
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,730
and try

609
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,940
to look imposing

610
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,730
and threatening.

611
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,860
Even if you're wearing fine clothes,

612
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,420
you don't have the presence
of the Prince of Kangping.

613
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:16,570
True greatness is almost inaudible
and formless.

614
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,010
Get lost.

615
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,220
Don't embarrass yourself

616
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,380
in front of an old-timer like him.

617
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,180
You didn't bring many people,

618
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,090
but you likely

619
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,700
have more than I expected.

620
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:42,900
I came from Caozhou

621
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,490
to the capital,

622
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,180
so naturally, I have to be cautious.

623
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,290
You insisted on meeting me.

624
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:50,940
Is it because you don't trust me,

625
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,220
or because you're dissatisfied

626
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:52,860
with my price?

627
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,420
The business I do is illegal.

628
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,250
What the buyers do with the salt

629
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,460
is none of my concern.

630
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,460
I'm not curious.

631
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,010
As for the price,

632
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,460
I'm sure Your Highness

633
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,700
has already inquired.

634
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,570
I usually sell

635
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:10,290
at 120 wen per dou,

636
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,050
with no rise in price.

637
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,460
And

638
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,010
I'm willing to sell

639
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,250
at 100 wen per dou.

640
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:24,420
So,

641
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,660
what is it that you truly want?

642
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,860
Feel free to say it.

643
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,530
It's quite windy out here.

644
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,570
Would Your Highness like

645
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,290
to come inside for a more private talk?

646
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,330
Your Highness,

647
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,620
please have a seat.

648
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:54,180
Come in.

Father.

650
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,250
It is truly an honor for me

651
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,290
to meet Your Highness.

652
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,380
I've only heard

653
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,330
that Iron Crutch Huang has a son,

654
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,620
[Huang Qi, Huang Yimin's son]
but I didn't expect him

655
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:13,620
to be so refined and elegant.

656
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,700
I've kept

657
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,050
my relationship with my son hidden

658
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,700
and arranged for his private tutoring

659
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:19,900
because

660
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,900
I didn't want him to live the same life

661
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:24,010
of hiding and running that I've had.

662
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,090
The matter you want

663
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,980
must be related to your son, right?

664
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:30,180
That's correct.

665
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,620
I want Your Highness

666
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:34,700
to find him a position here

667
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,660
in the capital

668
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,140
so that

669
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:39,700
he can have a proper identity.

670
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:44,090
If I refuse,

671
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:49,050
will this business deal be off?

672
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,620
There are plenty of people

673
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,490
with large amounts of illegal salt.

674
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,140
Besides the Henan region,

675
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,250
other places also have illegal salt.

676
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:01,530
But Your Highness,

677
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,900
you can surely investigate for yourself.

678
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,010
Only I am bold enough

679
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,250

681
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,730
at such low prices.

682
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,900
What's more,

683
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,290
with my son involved,

684
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,810
our future dealings

685
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,250

686
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:18,730
more trustworthy.

687
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:20,380
Isn't that right?

688
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,380
With your sincere offer,

689
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,290
I can't refuse you.

690
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:25,980
It's not what a businessman will do.

691
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,140

693
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,810
where you will specialize
in recording the salt trade.

694
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:36,660
Would you accept this?

695
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,050

00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:14,530
Well done.

After so long, the alchemist

700
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,770

703
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,140
and burns fiercely.

705
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,250
fifty boxes of this?

706
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,140
About two months.

707
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,220
Miss Wu, be careful.

708
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,770
This is interesting.

709
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,660
I like it.

710
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,940

and not employing them]

713
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,180
So he's finally willing to submit.

714
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,530
Let's go to Yuan Mansion.

715
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:05,810
It's the first time

716
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:07,940
you've come to my mansion
after all this time.

717
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,820
You say I distance talents
without employing them.

718
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:12,050
What kind of talent
do you consider yourself to be?

719
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,170
Naturally, a cursed talent.

720
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,490
If I weren't cursed,

721
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,650
why would you have rejected me
from the start?

722
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,300
I heard

723
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:23,650
you've sent many people
throughout the city

724
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,130
to capture Ye Ping'an.

725
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,650
Have you made any progress?

726
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,050
Li Jun found Ye Ping'an today

727
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,490
in Guyuan Street.

728
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,210
That street is close
to the black market,

729
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:33,900
which means

730
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:35,380
Ye Ping'an has been

731
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:36,740
hiding there all along.

732
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:38,170

all deceived by Master Suxuan.

734
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,490
You were tricked,

735
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,570
yet you're still smiling?

736
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,780
If she were really that easy to catch,

737
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,380
I'd actually be a bit disappointed.

738
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:48,940
To be honest,

739
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,940
it's a fortunate thing in life

740
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:53,650
to have such an opponent.

741
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:56,860
It's a shame.

Enough of this.

Up until now,

748
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:13,490
you still won't tell me

749
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:14,900
the origin of those sets of armor?

750
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,010
I don't want to say
where they came from.

00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:21,740
OK.

for the throne.
