Governor of Jiangzhou,

72
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,140
is renowned for his incorruptibility

73
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,550
and has led the region

74
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,750
to rank first in tax collection
for three consecutive years.

75
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,430
So I recommend him

76
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,950
for the position of Minister of Revenue.

00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,780
Xue Zhongshan mentioned by Mr. Hai

80
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,580
does have some abilities,

81
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,430
but calling him incorruptible

82
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,750
might be an exaggeration.

83
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,190
As far as I know,

84
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,990
he already has five concubines.

85
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,780
Despite leading in tax revenue,

86
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,110
the number of refugees in Jiangzhou

87
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,310
has actually increased
compared to last year.

88
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,190
Mr. Li,

89
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,550
refugees

90
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,460
are present everywhere.

91
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,670
Xue Zhongshan's abilities make him

92
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,750
a worthy candidate for the role.

93
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,700
Focusing solely on abilities
and ignoring integrity

94
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,430
shouldn't be the way

95
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,700

96
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,780
should it?

97
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,580
As the Minister of Revenue

98
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,430

and resources,

99
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,190
they must possess
both moral integrity and capability.

100
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,820
I will not allow

101
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,380
any corrupt officials

102
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,580

103
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,430
to stir up trouble again.

104
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,220
Minister Hai, you say

105
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,990
that refugees are present everywhere.

106
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,110
Let me tell you this.

107
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,140
There are no refugees in Youzhou.

108
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,700
The Governor of Youzhou

109
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,110
is known by the locals

110
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,630
as Ji, the upright official.

111
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,510
He is a man

112
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,950
of unwavering integrity,

113
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,220
I

114
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,310
shall summon him to the capital

115
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,630
to take on the position

116
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,460
of Minister of Revenue.

117
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,310
Also, no one is perfect.

118
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,780
Xue Zhongshan's accomplishments

119
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,220
cannot go unrewarded,

120
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,430
so he will be appointed

121
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,900
as Vice Minister of Revenue.

122
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,510
- Your Majesty is wise.
- Your Majesty is wise.

123
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:20,820
Have you figured out

124
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,020
who ordered Cheng Hui to kill Du Liang

125
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,780
and frame you?

126
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,670
Could it have been the Li family?

127
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,750
After all, they would be the ones
most worried

128
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,950
if Du Liang exposed their connections.

129
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,630
Maybe

130
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,670
it's Hai Yiping,
the one who helped with our plan.

131
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:35,670
Him?

132
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,510
Why would it be him?

133
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,110
If Cheng Hui is really a pawn
of the Li family,

134
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,110
it makes sense
he'd want to eliminate Du Liang.

135
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,630
But my identity hasn't been exposed,

136
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,110
so why would they

137
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,190
want me dead?

138
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,550
As for Hai Yiping,

139
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,110
I once saw a painting

140
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,140
drawn by his sister,

141
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,340
in which the woman
in the painting has...

142
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:57,950
Has what?

143
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,870
The same Seven-Petal Epiphyllum mark

144
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,430
as Cailian.

145
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,630
Yet, Hai Yan has remained reclusive

146
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,670
all these years.

147
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,310
It's unlikely she has ever seen

148
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,220
the victims from back then.

149
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,190
So who is the woman in her painting?

150
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,430
That's why this remains
a suspicion for now.

151
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,460
After all, the censor case
involves many parties.

152
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,580
We must ensure
that no wrongdoer escapes,

153
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,670
yet we must also not falsely accuse
the innocent.

154
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,380
Regardless,

155
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,820
the cruel person

156
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,780
who branded those women

157
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,820
is close by.

158
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,670
Should we

159
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,700
tell Cailian about this?

160
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,870
Cailian tends to act on impulse.

161
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,110
We should hold off on telling her

162
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,870
until we know for sure

163
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,950
who the real perpetrator is,

164
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,460
or she might act recklessly.

165
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,430
I asked you before

166
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,750
about your trembling hands.

167
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,900
You told me it was just a lack of sleep

168
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,580
and that more rest would fix it.

169
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,870
But I don't think
it has gotten any better.

170
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,670
I remember you saying

171
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,580
that a troubled heart

172
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,340
can lead to

173
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,460
physical ailments over time.

174
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,260
Are you suffering from that too?

175
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,070
Come on.

176
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,580
I'm a psychiatrist.

177
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,700
Don't you believe me?

178
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,580
You have

179
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,310
this habit of going down
unconventional paths.

180
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,630
Sometimes,

181
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,310
I feel like

182
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,380
you're torturing yourself.

183
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,550
You might think that,

184
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,340
but the truth is,

185
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,500
I enjoy living this way.

186
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,980
I love the thrill of adventure.

187
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,460
If my enemies

188
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,430
fear me

189
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,340
just by thinking of me,

190
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,270
that's what makes it interesting,

191
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:49,950
don't you think?

192
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,580
I'm only

193
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,030
sharing this with you.

194
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,980
You don't think

195
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,270
I'm crazy, do you?

196
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,310
Oh, you.

197
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:02,950
Since

198
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,150
Du Liang is dead

199
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,070
and there's been years
of political instability,

200
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,580
we can't trace

201
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,500
the officials

202
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,460
he was in contact with.

203
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,910
If we can't find any leads
from the person,

204
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,070
we look at the objects
they leave behind.

205
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:15,980
What objects?

206
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,070
After a major case is closed,

207
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,100
the files are stored in the archives.

208
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,310
Perhaps we can find

209
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,700
some overlooked details inside.

210
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,270
We didn't have the chance before,

211
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,340
but now we do.

212
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,770
Yuan Shaocheng has been promoted

213
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,270
to Vice Minister
of the Court of Judicial Review.

214
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,430
He now has the authority
to access the case files.

215
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,310
When did you start plotting

216
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,500
to get your hands on the files?

217
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,270
I've had this on my mind

218
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,620
all along, you know.

219
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,980
But Yuan Shaocheng

220
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,270
is a man driven by self-interest.

221
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,100
Do you think he would agree
to something that offers

222
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,700
no benefits and is full of risks?

223
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:01,980
[Court of Judicial Review]

224
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,820
You all know

225
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,070
I'm from Mang Gutter,

226
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,860
and everyone calls me a rat.

227
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,580
But I've never been ashamed of it.

228
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,670
Rats are resilient.

229
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,550
It's hard to kill them

230
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,860
or wipe them out.

231
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,790
And because of that,

232
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,910
I stand before you today.

233
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,700
I remember that when I first joined
the Court of Judicial Review,

234
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,740
many of you

235
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,390
looked down on me,

236
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,070
and even raised your fists at me.

237
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:21,550
Right,

238
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,390
Erhu?

239
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,700
But now,

240
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,310
we stand together

241
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,340
as brothers.

242
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,220
I don't care whether you believe in

243
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:30,950
justice or not,

244
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,790
but remember this:

245
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,820
anyone who sees life as expendable,

246
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,070
whether it's me, Yuan Shaocheng,

247
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,910
or this Court of Judicial Review,

248
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,220
will never let them

249
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,860
live another day.

250
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:43,550
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

251
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,430
All of you,

252
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,430
come with me.

253
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,310
Sir,

254
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,310
the burly man you kept

255
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,700
is quite fierce.

256
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,150
This humble life

257
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,270
holds less value
than even a lowly creature,

258
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,070
yet it still serves

259
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,340
a purpose.

260
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,100
Bravo!

261
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,270
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

262
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,310
Get up!

263
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:24,790
Get up!

264
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,190
Keep fighting.

265
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,460
Quick, let's leave.

266
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,430
The Court of Judicial Review is here.

267
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,670
What are they here for?

268
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:36,950
What's going on?

269
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,390
There's no case here at Longmen Arena

270
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,270
that the Court of Judicial Review

271
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,430
should be handling.

272
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:44,700
What's with

273
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,700
the grand entrance?

274
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,910
Listen up.

275
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,980
The Court of Judicial Review

276
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,670
is shutting down Longmen Arena today.

277
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:51,790
Anyone not involved,

278
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,860
leave immediately.

279
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,460
Yuan Shaocheng,

280
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:55,860
[Li Qianzhao]
you think

281
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,910
[The son of the Prince of Langyang]
you have power now, huh?

282
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,500
What?

283
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,430
Now that you've just been promoted,

284
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,860
you think you can come
to Longmen Arena

285
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,390
and stand up

286
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,100
for these rats?

287
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,910
The Court of Judicial Review
has confirmed

288
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,070
that Qi Junshan
secretly colluded with Du Liang.

289
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,580
He was involved in corruption,

290
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,980
and all his gambling establishments,

291
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,310
including the Longmen Arena,

292
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,150
will be sealed
by the Court of Judicial Review.

293
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,430
Are you seriously that clueless?

294
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,220
How can Longmen Arena

295
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,270
possibly be compared

296
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,670
to Qi Junshan's other gambling houses?

297
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,550
It doesn't matter whose name it's under.

298
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,340
This place

299
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,790
was built by imperial decree
during the reign of Ruler Wen.

300
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,980
Who do you think you are

301
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,030
to demand its closure?

302
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,430
I am acting in accordance
with the laws of the nation

303
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,190
and the Great Feng legal code.

304
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,820
You are so audacious!

305
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,030
Do you even know

306
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,620
who Mr. Li's father is?

307
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,430
Shut up!

308
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,950
Listen closely.

309
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,820
Even if members
of the imperial family came today,

310
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,580
they would still be subject

311
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,790
to the laws of the Great Feng.

312
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,550
Does the law specify

313
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:49,860
that the only way for the lowly

314
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,070
to escape their status

315
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,700
is through mutual slaughter?

316
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,310
Or does it state

317
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,820
that Longmen Arena

318
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,100
is untouchable?

319
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,340
Ask everyone to exit Longmen Arena!

320
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,340
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

321
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,580
Hold on.

322
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,310
[Cui Yi, Vice Minister of Justice]
You are right, Mr. Yuan.

323
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,580
There is no clause in the law

324
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,740
regarding this.

325
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,310
However, Longmen Arena

326
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,620
was established by Ruler Wen.

327
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,190
To seal it,

328
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,500
according to the rules,

329
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,390
you must first seek permission
from Her Majesty.

330
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,190
Unauthorized action

331
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,270
would be a grave offense,
implicating the Ministry of Justice

332
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,980
in an act of disrespect.

333
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,150
Moreover,

334
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,700
even if permission

335
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,700
is granted by Her Majesty,

336
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:30,820
this place

337
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,190
can be sealed or demolished

338
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,550
as she sees fit.

339
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,500
If that happens, others
will simply find a new location

340
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,430
to build another Longmen Arena.

341
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,270
You make a good point, Mr. Cui.

342
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,500
There's no point in arguing

343
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,430
with a simpleton.

344
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,790
This location is far too remote anyway.

345
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,340
Tomorrow, I'll choose
a more impressive site

346
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,030
and build a grander,

347
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,740
more majestic venue.

348
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:49,740
Let's head out.

349
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,340
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

350
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,910
[Zhanlu Hall]

351
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,460
Your Majesty,

352
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,980
Mr. Yuan requests an audience.

353
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,580
Mr. Yuan,

354
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,620
you've just been promoted by two ranks,

355
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,460
yet I

356
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,700
have received several memorials

357
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,790
accusing you

358
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,580
of disregarding the protocol
of proper conduct,

359
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,430
repeatedly sending people to interfere

360
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,580
with the Longmen Arena,
which was established by Ruler Wen.

361
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,390
Is this true?

362
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:22,740
Your Majesty,

363
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,620
I have come today

364
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,820
precisely for this matter.

365
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,100
I have taken the liberty

366
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,100
to reserve the Longmen Arena
for tomorrow

367
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,430
and I humbly invite Your Majesty

368
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,820
to come and witness the Longmen Battle.

369
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,910
Mr. Yuan, be cautious with your words.

370
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,740
The Longmen Arena
is located in a remote area,

371
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,500
surrounded by filthy commoners,

372
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,340
with a stench in the air.

373
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,340
Her Majesty's health is too precious

374
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,700
to risk going to such a place.

375
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,430
Attendant Fan, that's not quite right.

376
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,030
It is precisely because Her Majesty
is the supreme ruler,

377
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,070
blessed with divine protection,

378
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,190
that all the foulness will retreat

379
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,740
at the mere presence of Her Majesty.

380
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,980
Why do you insist on having me

381
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,790
watch the Longmen Battle?

382
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,950
Because every time
the Longmen Battle is held,

383
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,700
someone ends up crippled

384
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:04,620
or dead.

385
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,220
Mr. Yuan,

386
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,790
you're exaggerating.

387
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,070
Though I've never been to Longmen Arena,

388
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,910
I know that the Longmen Battle

389
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:13,860
is just a casual contest

390
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,100
among the lower class,

391
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,460
involving wrestling,

392
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,430
strength comparison,

393
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,070
and perhaps a few minor scratches.

394
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,740
Attendant Fan,
since you've never been there,

395
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,270
what grounds do you have
to say such things?

396
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:21,910
Well...

397
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,310
Your Majesty,

398
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,860
Longmen Arena was built by Ruler Wen,

399
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,310
yet now,

400
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,310
it has become a place where lives
are deemed worthless.

401
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,340
This is truly an affront
to the great name of Ruler Wen.

402
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,100
Whether it is true or not,

403
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,580
Your Majesty,

404
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,070
you shall witness it yourself tomorrow.

405
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,100
Should I utter even a single falsehood,

406
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,190
Your Majesty

407
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,580
may punish me for deceiving the throne.

408
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,470
[Li Zongxu, the Prince of Langyang]

409
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:12,900
Father,

410
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,900
I don't know

411
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,660
what's gotten into Yuan Shaocheng.

412
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:17,900
He's been fixated

413
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,860
on Longmen Arena all day,

414
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,070
flaunting his authority.

415
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,380
Who's he trying to impress?

416
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,380
Your great-uncle sent word

417
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,470
that Her Majesty

418
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,900
will visit Longmen Arena tomorrow.

419
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,540
What?

420
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,310
That Yuan Shaocheng is something else.

421
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,350
He's secretly

422
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,620
going against all the noble families.

423
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,470
Zhao,

424
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,780
watch your words.

425
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,990
What do noble families
have to do with this?

426
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,780
I told you to distribute food
to the poor

427
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,470
and do some good deeds,

428
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,260
yet you left

429
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,260
the congee stand

430
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,500
and kept going to Longmen Arena.

431
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:42,900
I can't sit there all day

432
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,900
under the blazing sun

433
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,860
at the congee stand.

434
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,780
Your temperament is nothing like mine.

435
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,140
So impatient.

436
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,740
Keep a low profile these days.

437
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,950
Don't make a mess like last time

438
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:52,710
and cause a death.

439
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:53,590
In a couple of days,

440
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,500
come with me
to the feast for the people.

441
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:55,830
Report.

442
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:58,830
Master,

443
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,020
someone came with a letter for you.

444
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,230
Leave now.

445
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:04,990
Father,

446
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,190
forget about the congee stand

447
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,190
and the feast for the people.

448
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,870
The lives of the poor don't matter.

449
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,300
When will you let me have a say

450
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,300
in the transfer

451
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,260
of the official salt rights?

452
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,950
I asked you to manage the fabric shop.

453
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:18,670
Have you handled it properly?

454
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,300
Remember,

455
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,230
you need

456
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,990
to take things one step at a time

457
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,430
to go far.

458
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,190
I understand, Father.

459
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,100
Don't worry.

460
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,820
I'll definitely rise
above your achievements.

461
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,230
Bad news.

462
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:31,780
Master.

463
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,060
Master.

464
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,430
Little Master jumped down the stairs

465
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,020
and accidentally hurt its paw.

466
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,020
You useless fool!

467
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,430
You hurt its paw.

468
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,500
I'll break your legs!

469
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:44,990
Someone!

470
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:45,710
Zhao,

471
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,540
go check its injury first.

472
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:54,990
Master,

473
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,150
I am to blame.

474
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,060
It's all my fault.

475
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,630
Zhao was speaking out of anger,

476
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,190
but I've always been careful

477
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,580
with how I train you servants.

478
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,710
The punishment

479
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,580
is to teach you a lesson,

480
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,740
so you won't make
the same mistake again,

481
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,300
right?

482
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,260
You are right, Master.

483
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,150
It is

484
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,060
my blessing.

485
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,780
Since it's your blessing,

486
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,580
go ahead and enjoy it.

487
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,020
Keep the melody going.

488
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,740
I'm blessed.

489
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,260
I'm blessed.

490
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,710
I'm blessed.

491
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,390
I'm blessed.

492
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,820
I'm blessed.

493
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,300
I'm blessed.

494
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,670
I'm blessed.

495
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,260
Mr. Yuan is truly impressive.

496
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,260
He actually managed to get Her Majesty

497
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,020
to come watch the Longmen Battle.

498
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,500
This is unprecedented!

499
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,060
If the Empress enjoys the spectacle,

500
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,990
not only might those competing

501
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,740
be freed from their lowly status,

502
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,580
but there could also be rewards
for everyone.

503
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,670
We all still need to be cautious.

504
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,500
There must be no slip-ups

505
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,150
in tomorrow's Longmen Battle.

506
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,150
- Understood.
- Understood.

507
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:11,990
What's wrong?

508
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:12,910
After years

509
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,100
of navigating the officialdom,

510
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,950
I've seen too many underhand tactics.

511
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:16,990
The noble families

512
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,300
don't want Longmen Arena to be sealed.

513
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,150
Yet everything

514
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,470
is progressing so smoothly.

515
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,260
Now, I can't help but feel uneasy.

516
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:24,910
You've already done enough

517
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,580
for Longmen Arena.

518
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,580
Don't stress so much.

519
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:29,910
After tomorrow,

520
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,870
everything will get better.

521
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,230
It's the middle of the night.

522
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,340
All is well.

523
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,340
What's going on?

524
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,950
It's the middle of the night.

525
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,340
All is well.

526
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,380
Oh, my!

527
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,510
Ghost!

528
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:23,580
Ghost!

529
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,470
There's a ghost!

530
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,950
Help! Ghost!

531
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:26,270
Who's there?

532
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:26,820
Ghost...

533
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,670
I... I am the watchman.

534
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,580
Don't move.

535
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,060
There's a ghost.

536
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:33,780
There's a ghost.

537
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,230
I'm telling the truth.

538
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:36,820
Follow me.

539
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,270
There's a ghost.

540
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,380
There's no ghost.

541
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:51,780
It's all in his head.

542
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:54,950
Commander.

543
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,620
Commander. There's a ghost!

544
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,060
Unusual things never happen
without a cause.

545
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,950
We are the Empress's guards.

546
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:02,990
We can't back down.

547
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:03,820
Charge!

548
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:18,780
What's there to fear?

549
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,910
Stop with the ghost nonsense.

550
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,540
Come at me!

551
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,140
- Ghost!
- Help!

552
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,430
What's going on here?

553
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,030
I heard something interesting.

554
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,100
People say
that Yanqing Lane is haunted.

555
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,510
The residence in Willow Alley

556
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,540
was suddenly covered

557
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:13,990
in skulls overnight.

558
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,270
Who do you think

559
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,910
is behind this trickery?

560
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,670
Nice.

561
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,470
This is brilliant.

562
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,780
I knew

563
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,820
you'd be interested.

564
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,710
You're getting more and more thoughtful.

565
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,380
No way I'm missing out

566
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,780
on this fun.

567
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,710
This is downright creepy.

568
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,230
Look.

569
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,430
The skeletons are bleeding.

570
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:43,510
Yanqing Lane

571
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,430
must be cursed by some evil force.

572
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,540
These skulls…

573
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,910
Did they rise from the underground?

574
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:49,820
You might be haunted

575
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,270
by vengeful spirits
if you go out at night.

576
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,340
This is terrifying!

577
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,030
If you've got some money,

578
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,230
move out fast.

579
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,910
This place is way too eerie.

580
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:57,820
The Court of Judicial Review
is handling a case.

581
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,140
All unrelated persons, stand back.

582
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,100
Anyone who disobeys
will be considered an accomplice

583
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,300
and taken into custody.

584
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,510
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's go.

585
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:16,710
Get to the bottom of this!

586
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:17,910
I want to see

587
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,030
who dares to stir up trouble

588
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,030
in Yanqing Lane

589
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:21,950
with tricks and deception.

590
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,190
I will not let them off!

591
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:23,950
Yes, sir.

592
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,910
So what if you get to the bottom of it?

593
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,540
What brings you here
to add to the noise?

594
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,140
I'm not here to add to the noise.

595
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,270
I've come to strike a deal

596
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,340
with you.

597
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:40,580
It's always me

598
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,860
who goes to others to strike a deal.

599
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,670
No one has ever

600
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:45,820
had the audacity

601
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,670
to come to me.

602
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,500
You were supposed

603
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,300
to invite Her Majesty to watch
the Longmen Battle today.

604
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,260
But with the ghost disturbance
in Yanqing Lane last night,

605
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,620
there's no way

606
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,430
Her Majesty will come now.

607
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,540
Who wouldn't want Her Majesty to come?

608
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,510
The headless ghost has appeared,

609
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,230
and Yanqing Lane
is plagued with ominous signs.

610
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,620
This news reached the palace

611
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,670
early this morning,

612
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,190
and the stubborn old officials

613
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,470
all spoke in unison,

614
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,190
reporting to Her Majesty

615
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,990
that for her safety,

616
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:16,340
she must not venture

617
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,820
into Yanqing Lane.

618
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,270
This matter

619
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,910
doesn't need any investigation,

620
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,580
because it's not just one person

621
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,820
defending the Longmen Arena,

622
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,990
but all of the noble families.

623
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,470
They are truly vicious.

624
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:30,710
Vicious?

625
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,270
It's not that bad.

626
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,380
Indeed.

627
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,340
In terms of being vicious,

628
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,750
no one is your match, Miss Ye.

629
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,710
Now, tell me,

630
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:38,860
what kind of deal

631
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,300
are you trying to make with me?

632
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,910
I have a way

633
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,470
to get Her Majesty
to watch the Longmen Battle again,

634
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,510
but there's a condition.

635
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,060
You must take me into the archives

636
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,750
to check the files
of the censor case.

637
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,060
Of course,

638
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,060
if you're unwilling,
that's understandable.

639
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,190
After all, if anyone finds out

640
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,990
you're reviewing the files
of the censor case,

641
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:57,750
it could cause trouble.

642
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,510
You're turning something so minor

643
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,860
into a deal?

644
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:00,910
Fine.

645
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,060
But according to the rules,

646
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,620
I can enter the archives,

647
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,820
but you, Miss Ye,

648
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,340
cannot.

649
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,060
Is this a yes from you?

650
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,670
You're agreeing so easily.
This isn't like you at all.

651
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:13,620
Even a ruthless predator

652
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,340
can show justice sometimes.

653
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,510
Well then, I'll thank you in advance.

654
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:19,910
I'll take my leave now.

655
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,430
You figure things out here yourself.

656
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,540
The sense of justice is gone.

657
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,670
I told you.

658
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,510
As expected,

659
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,380
you'll make a deal with me after all.

660
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,030
You're quite bold,

661
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,820
sitting in that grand chair.

662
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:42,860
How do you know

663
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,820
that the people who sat there before

664
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,140
weren't the ones hanging above?

665
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,270
Because

666
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,340
I've seen scenes

667
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,780
far more terrifying than this.

668
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,380
Since they've set the stage,

669
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,910
let's make sure

670
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:03,910
we give them a great show.

671
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:17,340
Commander,

672
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,580
there's something

673
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,620
strange again tonight.

674
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:21,340
What are you afraid of?

675
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:22,270
Let's go.

676
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:29,910
What's that?

677
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:34,670
Look!

678
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,510
Something strange is happening again!

679
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,670
Pretending to be all mystical.

680
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,470
Are you done or not?

681
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,190
What... What should we do?

682
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,030
We are the guards of the Empress.

683
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:47,780
Go after it!

684
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,340
Yes, sir.

685
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,230
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

686
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,100
Commander,

687
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,670
why is it this place again?

688
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,670
Do we have to go in?

689
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,270
Maybe

690
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,580
we could pretend
that we didn't see anything.

691
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,270
Don't be such a coward.

692
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:01,820
Everyone, listen up.

693
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,270
Surround this residence.

694
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,710
You two stay on guard outside.

695
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:05,860
The rest of you, come in with me.

696
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,780
Stop acting all mysterious.

697
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:17,990
Show yourself!

698
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:31,030
Wait!

699
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,120
[Long live the Divine Empress.]

700
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,700
[May the imperial reign
flourish forever.]

701
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,430
Your Majesty has preserved my life,

702
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,860
and I've come to express my gratitude.

703
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,710
You've done well

704
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,270
with the military fund case.

705
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,430
How is your health now?

706
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,580
I was still feeling a bit off,

707
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,300
but after having a dream last night,

708
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,820
I woke up and surprisingly,

709
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,300
the pain wasn't as bad.

710
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,100
What kind of dream was it?

711
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,270
Tell me about it.

712
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:25,990
I dreamed

713
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,950
of a snow-white parrot

714
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,820
flying into Yanqing Lane.

715
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,580
Then,

716
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,430
it transformed

717
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,670
into a little golden figure
with a bald head.

718
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:36,580
I

719
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,950
once kept

720
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,710
a white parrot
that could chant Buddhist sutras.

721
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,540
How coincidental

722
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,140
that your dream mirrors that.

723
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,230
Greetings, Your Majesty.

724
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,580
I'm here to present
this auspicious sign.

725
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,580
Yesterday, you reported an ill omen,

726
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,670
and today, you presented
another auspicious one.

727
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,950
What's going on?

728
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,030
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

729
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,780
I don't know how to explain it.

730
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,540
The Imperial Guards were chasing
a small golden statue

731
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,190
and ended up in Yanqing Lane,

732
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,100
where they dug up

733
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,100
this good omen

734
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,380
from the haunted house.

735
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,890
[Long live the Divine Empress.]

736
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,750
[May the imperial reign
flourish forever.]

737
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,300
Since you have presented
the auspicious omen,

738
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:25,540
I

739
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,820
will reward you generously.

740
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,270
You may leave now.

741
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,580
Thank you, Your Majesty.

742
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,300
Oh, you.

743
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,910
It seems I must go

744
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,300
to the Longmen Arena

745
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,190
after all.

746
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:44,580
Go

747
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,380
and find me

748
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,190
a set of regular clothes at once.

749
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,270
Remember,

750
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,990
if this leaks out,

751
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,230
I will hold you responsible.

752
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:53,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

753
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:01,400
[Longmen Arena]

754
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,470
Wait.

755
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:21,670
You two

756
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,910
seem unfamiliar.

757
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:23,990
This is your first time here, right?

758
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:24,820
May I ask,

759
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,140
which family do you come from?

760
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:27,750
This is...

761
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,470
Mr. Sheng,

762
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,380
a rising star in the capital.

763
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,510
He lives in a mansion
adorned with golden lacquer.

764
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,230
There aren't many gold-plated mansions

765
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,030
in the capital, are there?

766
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,300
Didn't anyone tell you

767
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,340
that you have to pay an entry fee

768
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,750
for your first time
at the Longmen Arena?

769
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:43,580
I didn't bring any money.

770
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,860
The money is all carried
by the servants.

771
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,230
How could we have any on us?

772
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,030
If you want some,

773
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,910
go to the Mei Mansion and ask for it.

774
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:51,540
You...

775
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,800
[Longmen]

776
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,380
Welcome, honored guests,

777
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,780
to the Longmen Arena!

778
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,140
The Longmen Arena
is a place where people

779
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,270
of lower status can leap
into higher social ranks.

780
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,060
Today, we have two carefully selected

781
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:16,270
exceptional fighters,

782
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,030
who will surely

783
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,470
put on an exciting show.

784
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,990
Please welcome them to the stage.

785
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,670
Both of these lowborn individuals
from Mang Gutter

786
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,470
have children.

787
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:42,860
Can you guess

788
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,750
who will win?

789
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,950
Since you've both signed

790
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:47,860
the death warrant,

791
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,030
the old rules stand:

792
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,620
Participation is voluntary,
and your fate rests in your own hands.

793
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,230
The winner and their children

794
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,540
will be freed from their lowly status

795
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,470
and receive land.

796
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,470
Now, let the competition begin!

797
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,270
Fight!

798
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,710
Why aren't you hitting harder?

799
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,820
You are not fierce enough.

800
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,060
Hit like you're trying to kill!

801
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,540
Put some strength into it.
This is so boring.

802
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,030
This is no fun at all.

803
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:40,820
What's going on here?

804
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:41,620
Come on.

805
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,100
Why aren't you hitting him?

806
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,030
This is too dull.

807
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,060
Why aren't you getting up?

808
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:48,820
What a disappointment.

809
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,140
The Longmen Arena

810
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,750
has gotten more
and more boring recently.

811
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:52,470
Mr. Pei,

812
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,780
I think we'd be better off

813
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,100
heading to Wanguoxiang Tavern
to enjoy some music.

814
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:58,670
At this place,

815
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,750
let's refrain from addressing
each other by name.

816
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,190
Don't worry.

817
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,190
Given the ghostly disturbances,

818
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,540
the one from the palace

819
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,230
will never set foot here.

820
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:07,950
That's true.

821
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,710
I could recognize these old folks

822
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,780
just by looking at the back

823
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,470
of their heads.

824
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:15,540
Stop.

825
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:16,910
Stop.

826
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:25,910
Everyone,

827
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,060
these are the Iron Fist Rings.

828
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,060
Their fighting style

829
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,750
is different from that
of traditional barehanded combat.

830
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:32,580
Once these two lowly people wear it,

831
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,300
every punch will draw blood

832
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,950
and each strike will be fatal.

833
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,580
- Great!
- Great!

834
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,670
Now this is worth watching.

835
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,470
That's actually a great idea.

836
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:44,620
Put it on.

837
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:55,580
Please place your bets, gentlemen.

838
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,470
I'll also bet on the red one.

839
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:57,750
Please place your bets.

840
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:58,300
I'll bet on the red one.

841
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,060
Sir.

842
00:33:59,060 --> 00:33:59,710
I'll bet on the red one as well.

843
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,430
Please place your bets.

844
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:22,790
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

845
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:24,620
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

846
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,140
Get up.

847
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:27,260
Get up!

848
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,540
- Get up!
- Get up!

849
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:29,790
Get up.

850
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,180
Get up!

851
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:34,870
Get up!

852
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:35,700
Get up!

853
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:36,660
Get up!

854
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,700
- Get up!
- Get up!

855
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,740
Get up now!

856
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:40,910
Get up!

857
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,510
Get up!

858
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,060
Stand up!

859
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,950
Come on. Get up.

860
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:53,470
Continue.

861
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:54,870
Get up!

862
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,830
- Get up!
- Get up!

863
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,660
Is he about to lose? He's so weak.

864
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:01,990
Get up now.

865
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:02,830
Get up!

866
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:03,870
Get up!

867
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,540
Get up!

868
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,100
Mr. Wang.

869
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,310
What is Yuan Shaocheng doing?

870
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,060
Why is he causing trouble?

871
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,740
They've always fought with bare hands.

872
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,390
Why break the rules now?

873
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,220
Mr. Yuan,

874
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,430
in the Longmen Arena,

875
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,740
there's no such thing as rules.

876
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,700
The nobles spend money
for entertainment,

877
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:20,950
and my duty is to ensure

878
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:21,950
they're entertained.

879
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,140
That's the only rule.

880
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,060
Call off the competition now!

881
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:24,830
I...

882
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,060
Go on

883
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:36,870
and fight.

884
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,350
Bravo!

885
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:55,950
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

886
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,140
Bravo!

887
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,660
You need to put

888
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,830
more fat in the filling.

889
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,140
The ideal filling

890
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,620
is mostly lean with a bit of fat.

891
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,060
If it's too lean, it's dry,

892
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,350
and too much fat makes it greasy.

893
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,180
The best ratio is two parts lean meat

894
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,060
to one part fat.

895
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:23,870
Also,

896
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,060
I've told you this before.

897
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,790
Your meat stall
shouldn't just sell meat.

898
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:27,540
You should also sell vegetables.

899
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,580
It needs a good mix of both.

900
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:29,700
Since you don't sell vegetables,

901
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:30,470
I'll have to walk all the way

902
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,870
to the vegetable stand,

903
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,060
which is 167 steps away.

904
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:34,620
You are right.

905
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,100
You can tell the lady

906
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:35,950
about your feelings.

907
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,180
If she says yes,

908
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,180
I will take charge

909
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,390
of the wedding.

910
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,350
Here you go.

911
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,100
Take care.

912
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:43,830
Come again next time.

913
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,830
I'm packing up.
No more meat for sale today.

914
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,140
I'm not here to buy meat today.

915
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,910
Then why come here?

916
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:56,540
What's with that look?

917
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,260
I'm nervous.

918
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:01,950
Nervous?

919
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,790
Is there someone who wants
to pick a fight with you?

920
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,350
I'm nervous

921
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:08,740
because I've encountered

922
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,580
someone I have feelings for.

923
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,870
Someone you have feelings for?

924
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:12,540
Where is she?

925
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:13,310
Who is the girl?

926
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:13,950
You.

927
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,180
I've been pondering this for a while

928
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,470
and I'm unsure how to say it.

929
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,060
I'm afraid you might think
I'm being too forward.

930
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,140
The first time I saw you,

931
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:28,540
I felt like you

932
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,350
were different from others,

933
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:30,990
which is why I often come here
to buy meat.

934
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,390
I have so much I want to say,

935
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:32,990
but once I start...

936
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:33,470
Then,

937
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,470
stop talking for now.

938
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:36,510
In that case,

939
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,510
tonight at the Hour of Xu,

940
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:38,510
on the Qinglong Bridge,

941
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,220
whether you accept or reject me,

942
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,470
I'll be waiting there for you.

943
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,990
All our hard work could be for nothing

944
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,950
due to a minor mistake.

945
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,390
As a minister,

946
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:56,580
you can't even eliminate Ye Ping'an?

947
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,660
Are you keeping her alive

948
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,430
to ruin my grand plan?

949
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,510
Please calm your anger.

950
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:01,470
Ye Ping'an

951
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,990
will be eliminated

952
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,140
without a doubt.

953
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,790
But before she dies,

954
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,740
she can still be of use.

955
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,100
What do you mean?

956
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,260
Her Majesty has always had the intention

957
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,430
to promote those
from humble backgrounds.

958
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,430
Li Muyuan argued against my choice

959
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,620
of the new Minister of Revenue

960
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,100
because he would rather Her Majesty

961
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,060
promote a commoner

962
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,060
for the sake of balance

963
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,580
than let one of our people

964
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:21,830
take the position.

965
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:23,390
Ji, the upright official's reputation

966
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,990
is well-known.

967
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,260
During the Qianlong era,

968
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,140
he served as the Assistant Minister
of the Court of Judicial Review,

969
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,540
handling cases with exceptional skills.

970
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,350
In just one year, he adjudicated

971
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,260
over 17,000 accumulated cases,

972
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,580
none of which were misjudged.

973
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,790
With him around,

974
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,030
our plan to have Xue Zhongshan

975
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,030
control the salt tax

976
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,830
is effectively ruined.

977
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,060
What you said is true,

978
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,540
but if we look at it from another angle,

979
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,620
we'll discover who really controls

980
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,390
the salt trade in the capital.

981
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,620
As long as we can cut off

982
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,910
the Li family's source of income,

983
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:53,870
they will no longer

984
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,910
have the means

985
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:55,700
to fight us.

986
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,220
That's why, before this,

987
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,470
I deliberately let Ye Ping'an see

988
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,660
the Seven-Petal Epiphyllum painting.

989
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,430
It was all part of the plan.

990
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,540
Since she is a useful tool,

991
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:07,100
we shouldn't waste her.

992
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,790
Choosing the right people is crucial.

993
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:10,830
Du Liang

994
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:12,700
was promoted to the capital by you,

995
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,870
but he quickly switched allegiance

996
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,870
to the Li family.

997
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,310
You can rest easy.

998
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,700
Just observe the situation
as it unfolds.

999
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,790
When it's time to act,

1000
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:20,740
we won't have trouble

1001
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,430
finding a way to take Ye Ping'an's life.

1002
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,060
There are so many lanterns
and they look so pretty.

1003
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:29,540
But none of them
are as pretty as the ones you made.

1004
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:30,790
I only like the ones you made.

1005
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,620
