1
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,000
"Beijing Monster"

2
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,820
Luo Yueshi

3
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,120
- Luo Yueshi
- Oh yeah

4
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,330
Who sent this letter?

5
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,620
What's this?

6
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,830
Isn't this what you put on my desk?

7
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,750
no

8
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,220
Did you put little Park Shin on the table?

9
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,800
No, it wasn't me.

10
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,590
What's wrong?

11
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,390
What letter?

12
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,390
how?

13
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,390
Did the content of the letter upset you?

14
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,730
(I'll wait for you at the Moonlight Bar)

15
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,290
(Moonlight Bar)

16
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,790
You'd better not go in, Mr. Zhang

17
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:56,960
It's that woman

18
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,580
You still come to show your face

19
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,370
Since the end of the war

20
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,710
Haven't we seen each other for two years?

21
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,958
I thought you were back in Japan.

22
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,294
You didn't think I was dead?

23
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,344
Let me first hear why you came to see me.
What do you want from me?

24
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,474
Before that I want you to apologize to me first

25
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,810
You disrupted my husband's funeral.

26
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,570
And it hurt me.

27
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,240
We were just
Just expressing condolences to those who died in Wengcheng Hospital

28
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,370
You are rationalizing your own

29
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,750
An act of terror?

30
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,920
We call it "resistance"

31
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,670
I have always been sincere to you

32
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,890
I really think of you as a friend and I'm worried about you

33
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,350
So we help you

34
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,730
And you always reject me and insult me
In this way, I can "reward" you

35
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,860
True friendship is not about giving and receiving

36
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,950
It should be a relationship of mutual sharing and understanding

37
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,710
Please go back to your country, Mrs. Maeda.

38
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,460
Your time is over.

39
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,010
I hope we never see each other again.

40
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,160
(Jin Yu Tang)

41
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,540
Where are you now?

42
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,340
There's no going back

43
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,250
Mr. Zhang Taishang

44
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:54,970
Hurry up, Park!

45
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,120
Uncle Jia Ping!

46
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,880
Luo Yueshi

47
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,580
Get out of here you bastards.

48
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,790
Luo Yueshi

49
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,210
I just thought about what you said.

50
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,670
But I still think you are wrong

51
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:19,300
Friendship is really a relationship of give and take.

52
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,140
Luo Yueshi

53
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,690
Luo Yueshi

54
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,070
Luo Yueshi

55
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,190
Luo Yueshi

56
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,200
Luo Yueshi, wake up!

57
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,250
Luo Yueshi, open your eyes!

58
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,840
water

59
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,380
Find you some water first.

60
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,580
don't want

61
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,620
Jia Pingshu

62
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,660
Fanwu

63
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,080
Jia Pingshu

64
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,670
Jia Pingshu

65
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,590
Jia Pingshu

66
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,640
No, don't.

67
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,270
No no!

68
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,650
You bunch of bastards!

69
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,030
boss

70
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,250
boss

71
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,170
Are you okay?

72
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,170
Luo Yueshi, are you okay?

73
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,260
Are you hurt anywhere?

74
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,800
I feel weird

75
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,600
Feeling cold

76
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:02,730
Headache

77
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,950
Can you help me?

78
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,540
Luo Yueshi

79
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,380
I'll be there soon

80
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,620
Luo Yueshi

81
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,960
Taishang

82
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,430
Run away!

83
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,270
hurry up

84
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,400
Far away from me

85
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,700
It's ok, Tae-san

86
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,580
What about me

87
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:50,880
I'm fine

88
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:55,800
You understand

89
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,680
Do you understand what I mean?

90
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:26,210
The Border of Curse and Blessing of Beijing Monster

91
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:30,250
Part 5
Drama title: Monster

92
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:44,980
People often mistakenly believe

93
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,820
Having everything will make you happy

94
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,610
Disagree

95
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:59,780
If you have everything, you will feel bored.

96
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,950
Feeling bored

97
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,580
Feeling numb to everything

98
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:15,840
therefore

99
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,640
Only then will you choose to trample on others

100
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,690
Whenever I see the other person's fear and anger

101
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,560
I can experience it firsthand

102
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,440
Alive

103
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,610
Feel

104
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,910
haven't seen you for a long time

105
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,490
Ms. Yin Caiyu

106
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,080
How could you?

107
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:54,800
Maybe it's the same reason you're still alive.

108
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,930
It's really amazing

109
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,020
Was it Xingqin's doing?

110
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,450
So much time has passed

111
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,620
We meet again like this

112
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,870
Suddenly I felt
Everything seems to have happened two days ago.

113
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,160
Fresh in memory

114
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,670
About You, Xingqin

115
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:37,920
And the memory of Mr. Zhang

116
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,260
Why you

117
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,470
Still here?

118
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,690
Why can't we be here?

119
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:58,570
We are no longer your enemies.
I am not your perpetrator anymore.

120
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,410
So much time has passed

121
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,120
You should also be kind to us

122
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,790
Be grateful, eh?

123
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,630
Miss Yin Caiyu, you too

124
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,460
Thanks to it, we are still alive today, right?

125
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,840
Mr. Zhang is also

126
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,440
Was he also captured for experimentation?

127
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,860
I'm just being merciful.

128
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,320
Friends

129
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,290
Why do this?

130
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,000
Why did you do that?

131
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,630
Why do this?

132
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,550
Why didn't you let him go too?

133
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,590
You know

134
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:09,680
Why is hell scary?

135
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,730
Because it never ends

136
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,070
Since we can't be friends

137
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:26,660
I think I might as well be his hell.

138
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,730
Why did you suddenly drag her into the experiment?

139
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,440
Why are you asking this?

140
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,360
Let many variables
Constantly interrupting important plans is not a good thing

141
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:08,570
In this case
The possibility of unexpected situations also increases

142
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,790
I didn't capture her for experiments.

143
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,580
Seventy-nine years ago, I had a vengeance that I had yet to avenge.

144
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,340
This is revenge for that time.

145
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,410
Zhang Daizhu

146
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,800
Zhang the lender!

147
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,270
Are you okay? Mr. Zhang!

148
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:29,910
You make your choice

149
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,910
Do I have to go back to the way it was before?

150
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,990
still

151
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,460
Just die like this

152
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,630
How do you choose?

153
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,510
Should we go back to the past?

154
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,760
Die in front of that woman?

155
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,770
If I

156
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,770
Back to the past

157
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,700
Can it defeat you?

158
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,950
Maybe

159
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,910
By then, you can

160
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,710
Save that woman?

161
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,260
Maybe

162
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,140
You don't do anything, just stay there

163
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,520
I'll be there soon

164
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,020
You don't have to do anything, just stay there!

165
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,690
I'll be there soon

166
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,860
I'll be there now

167
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,900
don't want

168
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,990
don't want!

169
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,570
No!

170
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,250
No no!

171
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,210
don't want!

172
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:33,710
No no no

173
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,470
don't want

174
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:42,740
I'm looking for someone

175
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,120
In the cherry blossoms

176
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:49,830
Before Withering

177
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,090
That's my mother

178
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,340
Run

179
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,220
Let's make a pact.

180
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,680
You must not die

181
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,350
Will we have those good times too?

182
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,680
don't want!

183
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,060
Cherry blossoms

184
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,190
Withered

185
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,240
Zhang the lender!

186
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:24,240
Zhang the lender!

187
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,500
I'm going to him.

188
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,000
Too late

189
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,750
Even if you go, you can't do anything.

190
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,640
Stop her!

191
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,590
Yin Caiyu

192
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,470
Where is she?

193
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,250
Zhang Haocai escaped

194
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,380
It seems that what we worried about has happened.

195
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,760
Zhang Taisang is running around looking for that woman.

196
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:38,770
Please put him

197
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,440
Bring it to me

198
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,940
How does that woman deal with it?

199
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:54,740
Kill her.

200
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:58,370
Good to know

201
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,010
(Fuqiang Trading Company)

202
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,560
ah

203
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,810
I'm really going crazy

204
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,260
Who are you?

205
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,010
Then who are you?

206
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,090
I asked you first.

207
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,010
What about me

208
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,140
I'm familiar with both representatives here.

209
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:01,270
I occasionally bring them side dishes and cinnamon.

210
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,230
What about you?

211
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,270
What is your relationship?

212
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,900
I don't have such a deep relationship with them.

213
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,030
Why did you punch holes in people's walls?

214
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,870
Oh, that's not the hole I made.

215
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:19,120
Oh wait, what was the police call?

216
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,580
Oh, you don't have to. I'm the police.

217
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,040
I'm Detective No Ji-su from the Jongno Investigation Team 2

218
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,000
I'm tracking the suspect.

219
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:28,000
Suspect?

220
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,090
Who is the suspect?

221
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,260
Mr. Zhang Haocai

222
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:36,470
I have been unable to figure it out

223
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,470
Why did the police let the real murderer go?

224
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,810
Why do you have to torment innocent people?

225
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,230
I said this grandma

226
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,650
Don't talk nonsense, just dial the number

227
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,650
ah?

228
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,650
Let's call your squad leader first.

229
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:51,480
Call our squad leader? Why?

230
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,900
Do you want me to call myself?

231
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,950
Um Lu Detective

232
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,370
Oh, is it Mingjun?
It's my antenna grandma from Crescent Cave.

233
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,420
Hey, what's the matter with you calling?

234
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,000
I'm calling because of Mr. Zhang.

235
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:14,590
Where are you now?
Do you want me to come find you or do you want me to come here on my own?

236
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:20,810
Where are you now?

237
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,060
You let that woman escape?

238
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,440
sorry

239
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,610
Even if you have a cold once, you will develop antibodies.

240
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:31,400
She got fooled once because of nitrogen
How could I be fooled again?

241
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:33,360
You also know

242
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,860
Once Haocai gets angry, it's out of control

243
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,120
Who can stop Haocai now?

244
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,990
It should be just the eldest brother, right?

245
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,990
otherwise

246
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,540
Let the guy down there out.

247
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,330
I think it's number 71?

248
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,080
He's in his best form right now.

249
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,970
- Let the haters out
- yes

250
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:29,500
Uh no!

251
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:39,880
Where is that woman?

252
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,680
Tell me where she is.

253
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,850
Where is she?

254
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,410
I don't know when it started

255
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,120
Everything becomes blurry

256
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,950
My reasons and purpose for fighting

257
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,420
Even my anger

258
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,800
None of this can surpass a certain thought in my heart

259
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,530
Although alive

260
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,530
But I don't feel alive

261
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:37,590
I just want to see you

262
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:53,810
Just want to hug you

263
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:56,600
only

264
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:58,940
I want to hold you tightly

265
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,910
Zhang the lender!

266
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,450
Even just once

267
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,210
If I could see you

268
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,500
if

269
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I can touch you

270
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,140
Zhang Daizhu

271
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,780
It's me

272
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,370
I am coming

273
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,070
how's it going?

274
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,530
Both groups of black spots were completely wiped out

275
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:05,130
What's going on?

276
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:07,250
As you can see

277
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,170
It's all over.

278
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,380
You saw that I was also hurt.

279
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:13,800
Where is Jang Tae Sang?

280
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,300
Ran away with that woman

281
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,140
Looks like he ran off toward Channel 5.

282
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,430
how?

283
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,270
Do you want me to chase after him?

284
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,350
Go chase them and don't let them get away.

285
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:26,860
yes

286
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,590
No time

287
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,430
The haters will come after us soon.

288
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,100
I can

289
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,010
Should I entrust her to you?

290
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,690
Her condition
You can't run far before you're caught by the black guys.

291
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,820
I'll try to divert their attention.

292
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,940
You should let her out now.

293
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,990
Can you help with this?

294
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,450
Please, Sheng Zhao

295
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:03,790
Remember Aisle 5?

296
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,120
At the end of this corridor, turn right and go all the way to the end.

297
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:08,960
There is a small passage above.

298
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,840
That passage is not very noticeable and it is easy to miss.

299
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,670
So be careful

300
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,590
It'll be fine.

301
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,050
We'll meet outside

302
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,600
Didn't he flee in this direction?

303
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,150
There is no other exit except this one.

304
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,750
Bring Seung So here

305
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:52,850
So what

306
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:55,150
You really found it and didn't miss it?

307
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,070
She should be waiting for you at Exit 5

308
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:04,200
If you go out like this
It will soon attract people's attention

309
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,080
Replace this

310
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:18,630
Thank you, Seung So

311
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:20,340
well

312
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,970
I told you not to touch my head

313
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,180
How old am I?

314
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,050
Then I'm going back

315
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:28,350
If you leave for too long, people will be suspicious.

316
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,110
I couldn't go out a year ago.

317
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,780
I'm sorry about that.

318
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:43,400
elder brother

319
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,600
(Restricted Area)

320
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,280
(Exit 5)
