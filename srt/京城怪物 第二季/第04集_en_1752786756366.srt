00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:41,750
"Beijing Monster"

2
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,217
Where is this?

3
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:56,890
Please let me go.

4
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,641
Take me out too, please.

5
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,393
Please!

6
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,812
Please help me

7
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,066
Help me

8
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,318
Please help me

9
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,113
Don't come over here

10
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:19,079
I might attack you.

11
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,705
How did you get there?

12
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,540
So please run away, please.

13
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:24,751
hurry up!

14
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:37,639
Taishang!

15
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,034
Are you awake?

16
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,787
What's going on?

17
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,706
First I want to hear what happened yesterday

18
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,918
Who did you meet in that abandoned factory?

19
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,633
Where is everyone else?

20
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,427
Please call Brother Longji over for me first.

21
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,805
Mr. Quan Longji is currently in critical condition

22
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,767
He suffered a serious head injury

23
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,769
Caused cerebral hemorrhage

24
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,522
He had emergency surgery.
Currently in the intensive care unit

25
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,109
Where is the intensive care unit?

26
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,070
I have to go see Brother Longji to help me solve this.

27
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,363
Not now

28
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:38,575
I said I had to see it with my own eyes
What is his state and situation?

29
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:41,578
Unlock me now

30
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,247
I am Longji's guardian.

31
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,750
A suspected murder weapon was found at the scene

32
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,837
Only two traces were found on the murder weapon.

33
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,882
Looks like the hair and blood of Mr. Quan Longji

34
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,217
And Mr. Zhang Haocai's fingerprints

35
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,304
What do you mean by that?

36
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,389
You two were the only ones there.

37
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,349
Based on evidence and situation analysis

38
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,978
The attacker who attacked Mr. Kwon Yong-gil is likely

39
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:08,605
Mr. Zhang Haocai,

40
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,815
What kind of words are these?

41
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,278
How could I do that to my brother?

42
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,905
Is it because of money?

43
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:17,822
What?

44
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,741
I heard that Fuqiang Trading Company owes a lot of debts.

45
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,993
Do you want to start a conversation with this?

46
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,203
I said Detective Lu

47
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,496
Who is that woman with you?

48
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,040
What is her origin?

49
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,794
Please tell me, she was killed.
Are they the criminals of President Luo and Mr. Wu Qixun?

50
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:35,673
no

51
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,635
If she hadn't done it
So what is the relationship between her and the serial killer?

52
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,762
It doesn't matter at all!

53
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,681
So, tell me what happened there?

54
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,644
Ms. Yin Caiyu

55
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:54,692
Hello!

56
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,402
Wake up!

57
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,571
Wake up!

58
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,032
Wake up!

59
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,618
Hello!

60
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:17,340
The Boundary between Hypocrisy and Pseudo-evil in Beijing Monster

61
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,843
Part 4
Drama title: The Dark Side

62
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:28,851
Dominant
Is it conscious or unconscious?

63
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,199
Can change destiny

64
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,327
It's a day-to-day habit

65
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:51,124
Or is it an unexpected coincidence and test?

66
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:59,799
Determines who we are

67
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,635
It's our character

68
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,180
Or ability?

69
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,317
This is different for everyone, right?

70
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,570
Why are they all different?

71
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:27,702
Each individual has its own uniqueness
are constantly changing and unpredictable

72
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,996
It's not because it's unique.

73
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,707
Because it is incomplete

74
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:39,881
Most people
They neither belong here nor there.

75
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:47,305
They are all hovering on the border line
Incomplete existence

76
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:54,020
People seem to be constantly searching for answers to life

77
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:58,316
In fact, people just

78
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,361
Relieving the anxiety in my heart

79
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,697
so

80
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,492
It doesn't exist in humans at all.

81
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:11,746
The concept of "good intentions"

82
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:19,295
People only think about themselves from beginning to end

83
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,759
Making selfish choices for yourself

84
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:33,309
So what we do is more meaningful

85
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,105
That’s why we keep pushing forward.

86
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:44,987
Reasons to continue evolving

87
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:53,913
There's no time to fail like this anymore.

88
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,127
Sorry, I'll try harder.

89
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:04,882
Bring that person back.

90
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:12,390
But Mrs. Maeda has already...

91
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,183
Bring it back to me.

92
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,230
knew

93
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,230
Um Lu Detective

94
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,816
What about that guy? How's he doing?

95
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,985
He was completely broken down.

96
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,322
At first he wanted to see Quan Longji

97
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,074
But now he does nothing and says nothing

98
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,618
Just lie there

99
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,244
What did the hospital say?

100
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,705
The hospital said he wasn't seriously injured.

101
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,582
You can be discharged this afternoon.

102
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,375
Okay, let's get him discharged from the hospital first.

103
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,752
Then bring him here right away.

104
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,170
I have a lot of questions for him.

105
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:25,713
Yes I know

106
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,473
If Zhang Haocai is discharged from the hospital in the afternoon,
How should I go about the procedure?

107
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,934
Please wait a moment. Let me ask his attending physician.

108
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:05,836
Shhh

109
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:07,755
Keep quiet

110
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,508
I'm here to help you

111
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,226
This is all...

112
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,172
The search outside is almost complete.

113
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,341
Nothing special found, what's wrong?

114
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,384
- Help me lift it
- good

115
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,305
Oh well

116
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,806
Nitrogen?

117
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,892
Nitrogen

118
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,394
What is this?

119
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,149
Hey Heritage Biotech

120
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:09,609
It is Heritage Pharmaceuticals

121
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,110
- Heritage Pharmaceuticals?
- Yes

122
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,406
Let's get out of here first

123
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,033
I have a lot to say, bro.

124
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,534
What the hell are you kidding me?

125
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,078
You think I'll be fooled by you twice?

126
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,458
Don't you want to find her?

127
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,905
The attending doctor will be down soon.

128
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,240
Please wait in the hospital room.

129
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,533
Good to know

130
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,791
(Please keep quiet)

131
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,218
The suspect has escaped. Please call for assistance.

132
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,021
(No entry to the intensive care unit for unauthorized persons)

133
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,486
Hey, hurry up!

134
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,883
Are you the guardian of Mr. Kwon Yong-gil?

135
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,510
Please put on a mask and use hand sanitizer

136
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,512
The meeting time is five minutes

137
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,308
The patient is still in a coma
Just look at his face and it will come out immediately.

138
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,894
So what's going on? Still haven't found it?

139
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,729
Oh, the identification group took this and found it on top

140
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:55,024
Plus support team
We are searching the entire hospital.

141
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,609
We will find him soon.

142
00:12:58,944 --> 00:12:59,779
Oh damn!

143
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,294
elder brother

144
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:18,923
Why did you do that?

145
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:22,927
Why?

146
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,806
I should know the reason.

147
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,771
The ICU called.

148
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,981
Someone claims to be Mr. Quan Longji's guardian

149
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:36,899
Requested a meeting

150
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,661
Don't go back

151
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:52,832
Don't go back

152
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,794
Don't go back

153
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,004
Are you more awake?

154
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,550
Can you hear my voice? I'm Haocai.

155
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,051
Don't go back

156
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:08,055
Don't go back to the past

157
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:11,976
You continue to be

158
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:14,603
Haocai Bar

159
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,691
Like now

160
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,082
Well?

161
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,209
Damn

162
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,546
This is an X-ray.

163
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:24,924
I'll show you

164
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,426
This partial shadow will look like this

165
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,397
The way the Na people took root

166
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,650
Looks like Sheng Zhao

167
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,110
When the Na enters the brain in larval form

168
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,029
Usually they take root close to the top of the skull.

169
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,657
But for these two people
They are all rooted in the back of the head.

170
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:53,077
To say that Sheng Zhao learned from his mother
Implanted adult form

171
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,912
Then this woman is likely

172
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,748
It is implanted in the same way

173
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:14,848
Can't open

174
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:19,687
Who are you?

175
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,068
Do you know where this is?
What kind of place is this?

176
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,743
Are you okay?

177
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,834
They said they would give me treatment.

178
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,171
If I eat it

179
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,260
I will no longer be disabled.

180
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:55,514
This experiment is simple

181
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,725
Just put the water in front

182
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,977
Just drink until there is not a drop left.

183
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,604
After that, in your bankbook

184
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,898
Will remit 10 million won

185
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,572
Please ask

186
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,992
- Please speak
- If the experiment is successful

187
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,871
Will my leg heal too?

188
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,250
You have acquired polio.

I can be like a normal person

205
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,940
I can walk normally now.

Before the accident

207
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,029
Is there anything I need to know?

208
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:00,490
You are doing much better now than before the accident.

209
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,783
I'm here to confirm.

210
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,994

Is it true that your memory has completely disappeared?

Come here quickly. I have something to do.

221

Can you take a picture of me alone later?

Hey Yingchun, if you want to take photos alone, go to the photo studio.

223
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,219
Do you know that you can spend your own money to take the photo?

Hey, boss, what are you doing?

225
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,683

You won't be caught if you smile

How can you find that woman like this?

You bastard
Do you plan to keep hiding like this?

248
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,580
You think I'm hiding?

249
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,501
I'm right behind you.
