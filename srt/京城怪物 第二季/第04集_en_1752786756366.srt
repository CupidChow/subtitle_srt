00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:41,750
"Beijing Monster"

2
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,217
Where is this?

3
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:56,890
Please let me go.

4
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,641
Take me out too, please.

5
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,393
Please!

6
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,812
Please help me

7
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,066
Help me

8
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,318
Please help me

9
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,113
Don't come over here

10
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:19,079
I might attack you.

11
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,705
How did you get there?

12
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,540
So please run away, please.

13
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:24,751
hurry up!

14
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:37,639
Taishang!

15
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,034
Are you awake?

16
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,787
What's going on?

17
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,706
First I want to hear what happened yesterday

18
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,918
Who did you meet in that abandoned factory?

19
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,633
Where is everyone else?

20
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,427
Please call Brother Longji over for me first.

21
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,805
Mr. Quan Longji is currently in critical condition

22
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,767
He suffered a serious head injury

23
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,769
Caused cerebral hemorrhage

24
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,522
He had emergency surgery.
Currently in the intensive care unit

25
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,109
Where is the intensive care unit?

26
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,070
I have to go see Brother Longji to help me solve this.

27
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,363
Not now

28
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:38,575
I said I had to see it with my own eyes
What is his state and situation?

29
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:41,578
Unlock me now

30
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,247
I am Longji's guardian.

31
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,750
A suspected murder weapon was found at the scene

32
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,837
Only two traces were found on the murder weapon.

33
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,882
Looks like the hair and blood of Mr. Quan Longji

34
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,217
And Mr. Zhang Haocai's fingerprints

35
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,304
What do you mean by that?

36
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,389
You two were the only ones there.

37
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,349
Based on evidence and situation analysis

38
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,978
The attacker who attacked Mr. Kwon Yong-gil is likely

39
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:08,605
Mr. Zhang Haocai,

40
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,815
What kind of words are these?

41
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,278
How could I do that to my brother?

42
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,905
Is it because of money?

43
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:17,822
What?

44
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,741
I heard that Fuqiang Trading Company owes a lot of debts.

45
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,993
Do you want to start a conversation with this?

46
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,203
I said Detective Lu

47
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,496
Who is that woman with you?

48
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,040
What is her origin?

49
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,794
Please tell me, she was killed.
Are they the criminals of President Luo and Mr. Wu Qixun?

50
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:35,673
no

51
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,635
If she hadn't done it
So what is the relationship between her and the serial killer?

52
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,762
It doesn't matter at all!

53
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,681
So, tell me what happened there?

54
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,644
Ms. Yin Caiyu

55
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:54,692
Hello!

56
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,402
Wake up!

57
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,571
Wake up!

58
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,032
Wake up!

59
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,618
Hello!

60
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:17,340
The Boundary between Hypocrisy and Pseudo-evil in Beijing Monster

61
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,843
Part 4
Drama title: The Dark Side

62
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:28,851
Dominant
Is it conscious or unconscious?

63
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,199
Can change destiny

64
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,327
It's a day-to-day habit

65
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:51,124
Or is it an unexpected coincidence and test?

66
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:59,799
Determines who we are

67
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,635
It's our character

68
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,180
Or ability?

69
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,317
This is different for everyone, right?

70
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,570
Why are they all different?

71
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:27,702
Each individual has its own uniqueness
are constantly changing and unpredictable

72
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,996
It's not because it's unique.

73
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,707
Because it is incomplete

74
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:39,881
Most people
They neither belong here nor there.

75
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:47,305
They are all hovering on the border line
Incomplete existence

76
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:54,020
People seem to be constantly searching for answers to life

77
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:58,316
In fact, people just

78
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,361
Relieving the anxiety in my heart

79
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,697
so

80
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,492
It doesn't exist in humans at all.

81
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:11,746
The concept of "good intentions"

82
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:19,295
People only think about themselves from beginning to end

83
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,759
Making selfish choices for yourself

84
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:33,309
So what we do is more meaningful

85
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,105
Thatâ€™s why we keep pushing forward.

86
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:44,987
Reasons to continue evolving

87
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:53,913
There's no time to fail like this anymore.

88
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,127
Sorry, I'll try harder.

89
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:04,882
Bring that person back.

90
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:12,390
But Mrs. Maeda has already...

91
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,183
Bring it back to me.

92
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,230
knew

93
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,230
Um Lu Detective

94
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,816
What about that guy? How's he doing?

95
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,985
He was completely broken down.

96
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,322
At first he wanted to see Quan Longji

97
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,074
But now he does nothing and says nothing

98
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,618
Just lie there

99
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,244
What did the hospital say?

100
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,705
The hospital said he wasn't seriously injured.

101
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,582
You can be discharged this afternoon.

102
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,375
Okay, let's get him discharged from the hospital first.

103
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,752
Then bring him here right away.

104
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,170
I have a lot of questions for him.

105
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:25,713
Yes I know

106
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,473
If Zhang Haocai is discharged from the hospital in the afternoon,
How should I go about the procedure?

107
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,934
Please wait a moment. Let me ask his attending physician.

108
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:05,836
Shhh

109
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:07,755
Keep quiet

110
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,508
I'm here to help you

111
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,226
This is all...

112
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,172
The search outside is almost complete.

113
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,341
Nothing special found, what's wrong?

114
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,384
- Help me lift it
- good

115
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,305
Oh well

116
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,806
Nitrogen?

117
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,892
Nitrogen

118
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,394
What is this?

119
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,149
Hey Heritage Biotech

120
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:09,609
It is Heritage Pharmaceuticals

121
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,110
- Heritage Pharmaceuticals?
- Yes

122
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,406
Let's get out of here first

123
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,033
I have a lot to say, bro.

124
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,534
What the hell are you kidding me?

125
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,078
You think I'll be fooled by you twice?

126
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,458
Don't you want to find her?

127
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,905
The attending doctor will be down soon.

128
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,240
Please wait in the hospital room.

129
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,533
Good to know

130
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,791
(Please keep quiet)

131
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,218
The suspect has escaped. Please call for assistance.

132
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,021
(No entry to the intensive care unit for unauthorized persons)

133
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,486
Hey, hurry up!

134
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,883
Are you the guardian of Mr. Kwon Yong-gil?

135
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,510
Please put on a mask and use hand sanitizer

136
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,512
The meeting time is five minutes

137
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,308
The patient is still in a coma
Just look at his face and it will come out immediately.

138
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,894
So what's going on? Still haven't found it?

139
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,729
Oh, the identification group took this and found it on top

140
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:55,024
Plus support team
We are searching the entire hospital.

141
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,609
We will find him soon.

142
00:12:58,944 --> 00:12:59,779
Oh damn!

143
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,294
elder brother

144
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:18,923
Why did you do that?

145
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:22,927
Why?

146
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,806
I should know the reason.

147
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,771
The ICU called.

148
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,981
Someone claims to be Mr. Quan Longji's guardian

149
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:36,899
Requested a meeting

150
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,661
Don't go back

151
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:52,832
Don't go back

152
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,794
Don't go back

153
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,004
Are you more awake?

154
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,550
Can you hear my voice? I'm Haocai.

155
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,051
Don't go back

156
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:08,055
Don't go back to the past

157
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:11,976
You continue to be

158
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:14,603
Haocai Bar

159
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,691
Like now

160
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,082
Well?

161
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,209
Damn

162
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,546
This is an X-ray.

163
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:24,924
I'll show you

164
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,426
This partial shadow will look like this

165
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,397
The way the Na people took root

166
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,650
Looks like Sheng Zhao

167
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,110
When the Na enters the brain in larval form

168
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,029
Usually they take root close to the top of the skull.

169
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,657
But for these two people
They are all rooted in the back of the head.

170
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:53,077
To say that Sheng Zhao learned from his mother
Implanted adult form

171
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,912
Then this woman is likely

172
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,748
It is implanted in the same way

173
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:14,848
Can't open

174
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:19,687
Who are you?

175
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,068
Do you know where this is?
What kind of place is this?

176
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,743
Are you okay?

177
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,834
They said they would give me treatment.

178
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,171
If I eat it

179
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,260
I will no longer be disabled.

180
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:55,514
This experiment is simple

181
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,725
Just put the water in front

182
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,977
Just drink until there is not a drop left.

183
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,604
After that, in your bankbook

184
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,898
Will remit 10 million won

185
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,572
Please ask

186
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,992
- Please speak
- If the experiment is successful

187
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,871
Will my leg heal too?

188
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,250
You have acquired polio.

207
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,029
Is there anything I need to know?

208

You are doing much better now than before the accident.

209
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,783
I'm here to confirm.

210

Can you take a picture of me alone later?

Hey Yingchun, if you want to take photos alone, go to the photo studio.

223

Do you know that you can spend your own money to take the photo?

Do you plan to keep hiding like this?
