00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,569
Yeah, that

4
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:57,033
I'm here to see someone named Yin Caiyan

5
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:23,768
My son

6
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:28,022
There has been no news for more than ten days.

7
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,608
Your son ran away from home
Then you should go to the police station.

8
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:31,734
He didn't run away from home.

9
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:34,779
He is missing

Missing for about ten days

14
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:50,753
Do you accept the commission?

15
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,384
(accept)

16
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,311
How long are you going to persist?

17
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,610
It's about time we forget about the past, huh?

Looks like I can get it today
Yang Biqiu's customer's request for evidence

27
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,239
Hey, wait a minute.

28
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,658
Why didn't you say so earlier?

29
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,285
Hey, we have to go together.

30
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,496
- I have to go
- elder brother

31
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,623
It's your turn to go in today.

32
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,501
What kind of nonsense is this? Huh?

33
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,961
We try not to subvert traditions and rules

34
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,088
Let's stick to the old rules.

35
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:21,547
All right

36
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,175
Come on

- Satisfied?
- Um

41
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,812
Come on, drive away.

42
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,941

Let's go

46
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:14,642
Hey Haocai

47
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,603
You know we have to do it within this week.
Pay the bank interest, eh?

48
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,856
If we don't get the conclusive evidence photos today

49
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:21,941
Our reward will be gone.

50
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,276
Then we will be blocked

51
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,446
That building will be seized.
And we're both gonna end up on the streets

52
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,488
It will be a matter of moments

53
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,406
I said

54
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,200
- There's something I've always been curious about.
- Go ahead.

55
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,454
Why should I pay that debt with you?

56
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,663
That's not my debt.

57
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,332
How to say good question?

58
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,918
I am a representative of Fuqiang Trading Company.
You are the deputy representative?

59
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,504
When did it happen?

60
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,298
Hey, put this on first.

61
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:51,679
Hello, Fuqiang Trading Company
The last inheritance passed down by my grandfather

62
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:52,930
Who will inherit this?

63
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,225
You and I will inherit it together.

64
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,397
Strictly speaking, he's your grandfather.
Actually, it has nothing to do with me.

65
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,442
How much did your grandfather love you?

66
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,569
I can't remember this.

67
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:10,531
Besides, if it weren't for Fuqiang Trading Company
Where do you and I live? There's nowhere to go.

68
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,326
It's not like I have nowhere to go
There are many places for me to go.

69
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,579
Black and white! Guess

70
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,748
Do you admit defeat?

71
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:20,750
Take it

72
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,585
Go quickly and come back quickly before anyone finds you.

73
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,712
Go ahead, start taking action

74
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:26,672
Hurry up!

75
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,383
Hey, you can't just take half of the face like last time.

76
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,720
Hey, if the angle is not right
We can only charge less than half the price

77
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,597
The deputy representative loves you!

78
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,391
Only body shots don't count.
You have to include the face in the picture too!

80
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:20,995
Who is there?

81
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,030
Is the signal stable?

82
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,867
Hey, of course. Who assembled this?

83
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,817
Why is there no response?

84
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:16,777
Are they too focused?

85
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,654
What the hell are you talking about?

86
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,781
Hello, are you sure it's number 608?

87
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,784
Yes, it is No. 608

88
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:25,703
This is right.

89
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,604
Something doesn't feel right

90
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,063
How about I withdraw first?

91
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,274
Haocai, you can't retreat, okay?

92
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:58,027
If I can't pay the bank interest within this week,
You know that huh?

93
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,570
We have no way out.

94
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,615
We must get evidence today.

95
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,845
Why don't you just barge in?

96
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,598
Didn't I give you a master key?
You use that key to open the door and go in.

97
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,559
Well, take a picture and come out after that.
That completes the mission, right?

98
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,186
ah

99
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,480
- Oh damn.
- Haocai, please?

100
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,431
Why is there no one inside?

101
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,643
Bathroom, go to the bathroom.
Maybe those two people are taking a bath together.

102
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,951
Oh shit

103
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,875
What's going on?

104
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,934
I said that woman...

105
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,157
Uh huh?

106
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,418
Boss, something happened at No. 608

107
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,920
- What?
- Please hurry up

108
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,296
Hello Haocai

109
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:08,968
Hold

110
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,304
Oh shit

111
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,433
- This is all...
- Why are you here?

112
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:18,894
What are you doing here?

113
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:20,646
It's the number 608 you mentioned.

114
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,772
Where do I have it?

115
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,273
I mean number 809

116
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,575
Damn

117
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,871
Oh, damn it.

118
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,521
elder brother

119
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,986
(Defectors eliminated)

120
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,453
(Sunflower Hotel)

121
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,914
That guy is really an expert.

122
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,750
The punching power is at the level of a professional athlete

123
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,877
Any other impressions?

124
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,129
How could I have so much time?

125
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,715
It's pitch black and you can't see anything, right?

126
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,425
I have to deal with punches and kicks.

127
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,183
Anyway, that's all I remember.

128
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,851
You have to answer carefully, Haocai

129
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:27,147
Now this situation
If you're not careful, you'll be the one taking the blame.

130
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,235
- What does it mean that one person takes the blame?
- Why?

131
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:34,738
You originally planned to film the affair
Want to sell at a high price

132
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,950
But the parties fought each other.
Caused death

133
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,243
- I said
- That's not the case!

134
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:42,538
Fingerprints taken at the scene
They are all yours, Mr. Zhang Haocai.

135
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,207
When I went in, he was already dead.

136
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,460
Let me talk about your clothes.
The victim's blood was everywhere.

137
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,922
How many times have I said it?
That was left when I was fighting with the people who were there.

138
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:55,342
Isn't it?
Our Haocai does beat people up all the time.

139
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,553
- I saw this with my own eyes, didn't I?
- You shut up.

140
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,097
But he is definitely not the kind of person who kills people casually.

141
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,057
Mr. Monitor, you know this clearly.
Isn't it?

142
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,936
So I'm not calling you
Don't try to be a private detective?

143
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,106
Illegal wiretapping, illegal recording and illegal filming

144
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,650
These are all within the scope of punishment
I told you all this.

145
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,694
You told us.
But Mr. Monitor...

146
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,904
Look at these.

147
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,532
Look at the files stored here.

148
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,118
Isn't this all a scene of derailment?

149
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,912
Look, all of them are cheating photos
It's embarrassing to watch

150
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,665
He also said "I can't bear to watch"
I've read it several times.

151
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:28,584
You two boys

152
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,546
Just by illegal sneak shots
Did you know that I can send you two to jail right now?

153
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:35,424
Oh, you're exaggerating.

154
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,177
Mr. Monitor, why do you have to give us this?
You know it clearly.

155
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,597
Ah, we were originally that

156
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,308
People who trade in the global market

157
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,768
But now the global economy is in recession

158
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,021
Small business owners like us are completely crushed.

159
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,190
We just want to make a living.

160
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:55,152
I did a little side job but only for a short while

161
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:58,614
Oh, you know it clearly.
Our squad leader, you know it clearly.

162
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,162
I'll keep my words to myself and let the two of you talk.

163
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,377
Almost there
Just tell us what you want to say.

164
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,630
What?

165
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,674
Just using illegal sneak shots to scare us

166
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,801
That means you have something else to say, right?

167
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,387
Could you please tell me what happened?

168
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,024
Find out who that person is.

169
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,235
- What?
- What?

170
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:37,653
That monitor

171
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,238
I said catch the criminal

172
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,282
Isn't that the job of the police?
Why force it on us?

173
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,534
We have arrested two major suspects.

174
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,370
But aren't you two crying out for justice?

175
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,580
Since I feel wronged
So what if we have to run errands together?

176
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,499
That monitor

177
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,001
I say, no matter what the monitor says, this is too...

178
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,336
How come it can't be done?

179
00:20:55,337 --> 00:21:00,259
Then Zhang Haocai
You will be charged as the prime murder suspect.

180
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,304
Your face and name
It's only a matter of time before the news gets out.

181
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,515
I said I didn't kill him.

182
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,767
So you are so wronged.

183
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,102
It's obviously not you who killed him.

184
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,937
But was wrongly accused of being a criminal

185
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,898
And I always have to submit my work

186
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,485
You were at the scene when the victim died.

187
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:21,363
So you are the prime suspect right now.

188
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,367
We just need to tamper with the investigation report slightly
Submit it to be exempted from liability

189
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,664
Mr. Monitor, I really didn't expect this.

190
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:31,581
You

191
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,001
That's despicable, you know?

192
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,544
Of course I know

193
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,299
I'll give you ten days.
Find me something.

194
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,510
Find out who this guy is, male or female

195
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:46,888
I want to know what kind of stinky pervert he is.
That's how they kill people everywhere.

196
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,682
If you can't do it, tell me now.

197
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,475
I can make an emergency arrest.

198
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,601
What are you going to do?

199
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:09,328
Haocai, we are in big trouble, right?

200
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,620
Isn't it? Huh?

201
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,125
Is this really okay?
They are just ordinary people after all.

202
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,421
The opponent is a serial killer

203
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,132
Do you remember
Is this the pug that was captured two months ago?

204
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,218
You had just transferred to our serious crime unit.

205
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,971
Are you referring to the college girl rapist?

206
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,765
The case that has troubled you for more than three years?

207
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:30,682
Um

208
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,684
They were the ones who caught the criminal

209
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,186
What?

210
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:37,147
Zhang Haocai is much more capable than he looks.

211
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,317
So don't worry too much

212
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,613
(Jongno-gu serial murder case)

213
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,990

214
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:50,577

215
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,914

216
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:57,626
(Fifth case)

217
00:22:58,794 --> 00:22:59,836
It's not opening time yet

218
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,551
What do you want?

219
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:10,138
Let me meet the person named Yin Caiyan

220
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,725
Although your son's story is quite regrettable

221
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,644
But we were helpless.

222
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:20,315
The advance payment received previously has been credited back to your passbook

223
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,984
Please take that money back.

224
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:24,528
What?

225
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:27,239
I want to find another person

226
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,199
Who to look for?

227
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,701
I want to find the bastard who did that to my son.

228
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:35,205
I have to know who that bastard is.

229
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:36,623
Please

230
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,212
Are you going to pick it up?

231
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:47,134
Client please
The criminal who killed his son must be found

232
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:18,582
Haocai is not as good as us
Let's leave Seoul for a while, huh?

233
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,876
How about Osaka? Or Singapore is also OK

234
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,712
Or maybe we should just go to Hawaii for a while?

235
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,964
If you flee overseas

236
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,966
Doesn't that mean I'm admitting that I'm the suspect?

237
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:30,677
Brother, are you
Do you want me to be a wanted criminal worldwide?

238
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,888
No, that's not what I meant.

239
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:36,558
I mean, can we take shelter for a while?

240
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,477
I'm afraid you'll get into big trouble.

241
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,188
Do you have money to go to Hawaii?

242
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,232
Where do I have any money?
We have to work together to find a way to get the money.

243
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:49,029
So, brother, at this time
You should think of a solution instead of worrying about it.

244
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,740
Think of a more realistic approach

245
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,451
I mean, is there any realistic solution?

246
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,703
Are you really planning to catch the real murderer?

247
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:58,914
What's this?

248
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,083
Send that photo to all your contacts first.

249
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,128
Tell them
If you have seen or will see such a person in the future

250
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,505
You can report to us

251
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,299
I said, are you really going to do it?

252
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,676
Otherwise, after ten days
I'll be labeled a murder suspect.

253
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,428
My face will be exposed all over the country

254
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:17,349
I want to live a quiet life, Brother Longji

255
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:19,559
Brother, I'll leave it to you.

256
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,293
Grandpa, he is really
Why did you entrust all this to me in the first place?

257
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,593
(Hello, fellow antenna group members
Please search for the people in the photo)

258
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:02,394
(Seoul)

259
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,898
(Human flesh search for people in the photo)

260
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,195
- It's delicious.
- You brought this?

261
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,702
- Yeah, it's been hard work.
- Ouch

262
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,745
I've finished eating and have to start working again

263
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,331
- Well
- What's wrong?

264
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,666
Have you seen this photo?

265
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:25,584
What photo?

266
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,992
Discovery in Sinsa-dong, Ho-chae

267
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,578
Last week, the cleaning company came to

268
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,747
I accidentally took this photo when I was taking a photo of the building.

269
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,833
He said he saw it a few more times when he was cleaning later.

270
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,878
It is said that the man usually appears before sunset.
Then I sat there until dark.

271
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,424
Where is this Sinsa-dong?

272
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,219
(accept)

273
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,137
What?

274
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:26,931
(Calling Yin Caiyan)

275
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:30,935
Really?

276
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,438
Do you really want to accept this commission?

277
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:35,398
But I have a condition

278
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,526
After catching the criminal
I must hand the criminal over to the police.

279
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,280
Tell him I don't do this to avenge someone else.

280
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,742
Only he agreed to this.
I will accept this commission

281
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,827
What on earth do you think?

282
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,330
You didn't accept this commission.

283
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,458
Why did you suddenly decide to help someone find the murderer?

284
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,085
Because a few things also aroused my curiosity

285
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,484
Who are you?

286
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,242
Since you can't tell, there must be something fishy going on.

287
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,662
Let's talk face to face

288
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,581
If you don't want to hurt yourself, don't move.

289
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:24,669
Do you know Wu Qixun?

290
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:26,838
Are you a police officer?

291
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,256
Not the police.

292
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,510
But I am indeed looking for the suspect who killed Wu Qixun.

293
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,430
Then you got the wrong person. I didn't kill him.

294
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,056
So why were you there at the time?

295
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,226
At the time,

296
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,313
That's you, right?

297
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,383
What a good punch

298
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:59,055
You are indeed an expert, right?

299
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,313
Then I'm not polite.

300
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,732
Now I'm going to be serious

301
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,366
how...

302
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,208
I haven't done anything yet.
