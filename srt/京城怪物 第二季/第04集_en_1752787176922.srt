2
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,220
Where is this?

3
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,890
Please let me go.

4
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,640
Take me out too, please.

5
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,390
Please!

6
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,810
Please help me

7
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,070
Help me

8
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,320
Please help me

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,110
Don't come over here

10
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,080
I might attack you.

11
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,710
How did you get there?

12
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,540
So please run away, please.

13
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,750
hurry up!

14
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:27,640
Taishang!

15
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,030
Are you awake?

16
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,790
What's going on?

17
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,710
First I want to hear what happened yesterday

18
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,920
Who did you meet in that abandoned factory?

19
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,630
Where is everyone else?

20
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,430
Please call Brother Longji over for me first.

21
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,805
Mr. Quan Longji is currently in critical condition

22
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,767
He suffered a serious head injury

23
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,769
Caused cerebral hemorrhage

24
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,522
He had emergency surgery.
Currently in the intensive care unit

25
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,110
Where is the intensive care unit?

26
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,070
I have to go see Brother Longji to help me solve this.

27
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,360
Not now

28
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:28,580
I said I had to see it with my own eyes
What is his state and situation?

29
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,580
Unlock me now

30
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,250
I am Longji's guardian.

31
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,750
A suspected murder weapon was found at the scene

32
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,840
Only two traces were found on the murder weapon.

33
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,880
Looks like the hair and blood of Mr. Quan Longji

34
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,220
And Mr. Zhang Haocai's fingerprints

35
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,300
What do you mean by that?

36
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,390
You two were the only ones there.

37
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,350
Based on evidence and situation analysis

38
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,980
The attacker who attacked Mr. Kwon Yong-gil is likely

39
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,610
Mr. Zhang Haocai,

40
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,820
What kind of words are these?

41
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,280
How could I do that to my brother?

42
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,910
Is it because of money?

43
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,820
What?

44
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,740
I heard that Fuqiang Trading Company owes a lot of debts.

45
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,990
Do you want to start a conversation with this?

46
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,200
I said Detective Lu

47
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,500
Who is that woman with you?

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,040
What is her origin?

49
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,790
Please tell me, she was killed.
Are they the criminals of President Luo and Mr. Wu Qixun?

50
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,670
no

51
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,640
If she hadn't done it
So what is the relationship between her and the serial killer?

52
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,760
It doesn't matter at all!

53
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,680
So, tell me what happened there?

54
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,640
Ms. Yin Caiyu

55
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,690
Hello!

56
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,400
Wake up!

57
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,570
Wake up!

58
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,030
Wake up!

59
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,620
Hello!

60
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,340
The Boundary between Hypocrisy and Pseudo-evil in Beijing Monster

61
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,840
Part 4
Drama title: The Dark Side

62
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,850
Dominant
Is it conscious or unconscious?

63
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,200
Can change destiny

64
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,330
It's a day-to-day habit

65
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,120
Or is it an unexpected coincidence and test?

66
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,800
Determines who we are

67
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,640
It's our character

68
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,180
Or ability?

69
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,320
This is different for everyone, right?

70
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,570
Why are they all different?

71
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:17,700
Each individual has its own uniqueness
are constantly changing and unpredictable

72
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,000
It's not because it's unique.

73
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,710
Because it is incomplete

74
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:29,880
Most people
They neither belong here nor there.

75
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:37,310
They are all hovering on the border line
Incomplete existence

76
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:44,020
People seem to be constantly searching for answers to life

77
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,320
In fact, people just

78
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,360
Relieving the anxiety in my heart

79
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,700
so

80
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,490
It doesn't exist in humans at all.

81
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,750
The concept of "good intentions"

82
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:09,300
People only think about themselves from beginning to end

83
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,760
Making selfish choices for yourself

84
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:23,310
So what we do is more meaningful

85
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,110
Thatâ€™s why we keep pushing forward.

86
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:34,990
Reasons to continue evolving

87
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:43,910
There's no time to fail like this anymore.

88
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,130
Sorry, I'll try harder.

89
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,880
Bring that person back.

90
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:02,390
But Mrs. Maeda has already...

91
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,180
Bring it back to me.

92
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,230
knew

93
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,230
Um Lu Detective

94
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,820
What about that guy? How's he doing?

95
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,990
He was completely broken down.

96
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,320
At first he wanted to see Quan Longji

97
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,070
But now he does nothing and says nothing

98
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,620
Just lie there

99
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,240
What did the hospital say?

100
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,710
The hospital said he wasn't seriously injured.

101
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,580
You can be discharged this afternoon.

102
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,380
Okay, let's get him discharged from the hospital first.

103
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,750
Then bring him here right away.

104
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,170
I have a lot of questions for him.

105
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,710
Yes I know

106
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,470
If Zhang Haocai is discharged from the hospital in the afternoon,
How should I go about the procedure?

107
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,930
Please wait a moment. Let me ask his attending physician.

108
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,840
Shhh

109
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,760
Keep quiet

110
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,510
I'm here to help you

111
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,230
This is all...

112
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,170
The search outside is almost complete.

113
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,340
Nothing special found, what's wrong?

114
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,380
- Help me lift it
- good

115
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,310
Oh well

116
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:48,810
Nitrogen?

117
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,890
Nitrogen

118
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,390
What is this?

119
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,150
Hey Heritage Biotech

120
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,610
It is Heritage Pharmaceuticals

121
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,110
- Heritage Pharmaceuticals?
- Yes

122
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,410
Let's get out of here first

123
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,030
I have a lot to say, bro.

124
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,530
What the hell are you kidding me?

125
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,080
You think I'll be fooled by you twice?

126
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,460
Don't you want to find her?

127
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,910
The attending doctor will be down soon.

128
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,240
Please wait in the hospital room.

129
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,530
Good to know

130
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,790
(Please keep quiet)

131
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,220
The suspect has escaped. Please call for assistance.

132
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,020
(No entry to the intensive care unit for unauthorized persons)

133
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,490
Hey, hurry up!

134
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,880
Are you the guardian of Mr. Kwon Yong-gil?

135
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,510
Please put on a mask and use hand sanitizer

136
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,510
The meeting time is five minutes

137
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,310
The patient is still in a coma
Just look at his face and it will come out immediately.

138
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,890
So what's going on? Still haven't found it?

139
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,730
Oh, the identification group took this and found it on top

140
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,020
Plus support team
We are searching the entire hospital.

141
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:46,610
We will find him soon.

142
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,780
Oh damn!

143
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,290
elder brother

144
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:08,920
Why did you do that?

145
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:12,930
Why?

146
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,810
I should know the reason.

147
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:23,770
The ICU called.

148
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,980
Someone claims to be Mr. Quan Longji's guardian

149
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:26,900
Requested a meeting

150
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,660
Don't go back

151
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,830
Don't go back

152
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,790
Don't go back

153
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,000
Are you more awake?

154
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,550
Can you hear my voice? I'm Haocai.

155
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,050
Don't go back

156
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,060
Don't go back to the past

157
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,980
You continue to be

158
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:04,600
Haocai Bar

159
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,690
Like now

160
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,080
Well?

161
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,210
Damn

162
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,550
This is an X-ray.

163
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:14,920
I'll show you

164
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,430
This partial shadow will look like this

165
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,400
The way the Na people took root

166
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,650
Looks like Sheng Zhao

167
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,110
When the Na enters the brain in larval form

168
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,030
Usually they take root close to the top of the skull.

169
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,660
But for these two people
They are all rooted in the back of the head.

170
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,080
To say that Sheng Zhao learned from his mother
Implanted adult form

171
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,910
Then this woman is likely

172
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,750
It is implanted in the same way

173
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,850
Can't open

174
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:09,690
Who are you?

175
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,070
Do you know where this is?
What kind of place is this?

176
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,740
Are you okay?

177
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,830
They said they would give me treatment.

178
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,170
If I eat it

179
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,260
I will no longer be disabled.

180
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,510
This experiment is simple

181
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,730
Just put the water in front

182
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,980
Just drink until there is not a drop left.

183
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,600
After that, in your bankbook

184
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,900
Will remit 10 million won

185
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,570
Please ask

186
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,990
- Please speak
- If the experiment is successful

187
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,870
Will my leg heal too?

188
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,250

207
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,030
Is there anything I need to know?

208

You are doing much better now than before the accident.

209
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,780
I'm here to confirm.

210
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,990

Hey Yingchun, if you want to take photos alone, go to the photo studio.

223

Do you know that you can spend your own money to take the photo?

Do you plan to keep hiding like this?
