1
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:41,791
"Beijing Monster"

2
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:47,464
Say

3
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,633
Why do you still want to fight with them?

4
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,803
You know you can't beat them.

5
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,890
I don't fight them to win.

6
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,602
It's so they won't forget

7
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,522
I can't let them forget
What have they done to us?

8
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,359
Let them know that there are still people in this world who remember

9
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:09,944
What they do

10
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,448
I want them to feel sorry

11
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,284
If they don't have any apology

12
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,871
I want them to at least feel a little guilty.

13
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,209
If you don't even feel guilty

14
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,879
Then I want them to think I'm in the way and annoying.

15
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,507
I am inconvenienced because of me

16
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,053
Only in this way they won't forget

17
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,014
Can't you forgive them?

18
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,643
How can they be "forgiven" if they have no intention of apologizing?

19
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,853
They insisted they didn't do those things.

20
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,313
That's not the case at all

21
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,942
And I said to them, "I forgive you"
Isnâ€™t this ridiculous?

22
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,069
But no matter what

23
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,114
That's all in the past, isn't it?

24
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,450
In that era, people were helpless.

25
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,078
That's right

26
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,330
The times

27
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,792
To survive
They may have made a choice that was beyond their control.

28
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:06,793
After all, we are all human beings

29
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,754
But

30
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,091
When you know you've made a mistake
Able to correct one's own mistakes

31
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,676
It's what people should do.

32
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,847
If there is no such effort

33
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,434
Wouldn't the world be uglier then?

34
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,646
How much do you trust me?

35
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,774
What's the difference between trust and distrust?

36
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,152
Trust is trust

37
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:35,947
In the Beginning

38
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,658
I wish I hadn't met Haocai

39
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,203
In this case

40
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,958
Even if I become a complete monster
I won't care either.

41
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,311
What are you doing?

42
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,437
I told you

43
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,065
I don't want to die

44
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,080
There was a time when Haocai
I was immersed in fantasy

45
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,472
I fantasize that maybe I can live like him

46
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,267
uprightly

47
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:48,770
Live like a human

48
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:50,688
But

49
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:53,775
This is not true

50
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,570
I'm a monster

51
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,908
I don't care about anything outside of myself

52
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,035
There's no guilt.

53
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,205
I won't blame myself

54
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,998
Will kill if threatened

55
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,583
When you feel bored, look for prey

56
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,669
When you are hungry, you hunt.

57
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,090
And all this

58
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,636
It's very exciting for me

59
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,975
I heard your mother is Mingzi

60
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,353
But you know

61
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,692
How did your mother die?

62
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:39,904
Know

63
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,876
So what?

64
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,671
It's all in the past, what can I do?

65
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,924
The person who raised me was Mrs. Maeda

66
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,135
The person who protected me was also Mrs. Maeda

67
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,681
Don't you feel like you're being taken advantage of?

68
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,273
If you are a good son, you should answer "yes"

69
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,321
So you didn't know?

70
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,656
I took advantage of that woman.

71
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,409
To survive

72
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:30,955
so

73
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,336
Please die in my hands.

74
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,755
Please take that woman Yin Caiyu away

75
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:40,840
Bring it here

76
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,508
For Haocai

77
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,385
The one who let that woman die

78
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,804
It must be Mr. Zhang

79
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,306
You'll die here.

80
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,439
Don't move!

81
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,398
Otherwise I'll shoot!

82
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,750
If Zhang the lender knew, he would be so disappointed.

83
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,837
You decided to become a monster.

84
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,428
Wait a minute, that guy...

85
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,524
Who are they?

86
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,194
Run away or you will die.

87
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:45,780
What are you doing?

88
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,751
- Hello!
- You try to run away as far as possible

89
00:06:58,835 --> 00:06:59,669
hurry up

90
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,163
Who is it? Who sent you?

91
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,743
Even if you try your best, you can't win.

92
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:57,954
Then let's compete

93
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,126
See if I can win.

94
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,884
Mrs. Maeda

95
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,637
It will eventually kill everyone around you.

96
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,641
Mrs. Maeda wants

97
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,394
You end up being alone

98
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:28,901
What is my position?
It doesn't matter to me who wins.

99
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,696
I just hope this fight ends soon

100
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,367
To achieve this goal

101
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,869
Still, does this method work?

102
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:54,552
The Boundary between Symbiosis and Parasitism of Monsters in Beijing

103
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:58,556
Part 7
Drama title: Borderlander

104
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:04,895
Please spare my life, President

105
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,441
Please forgive our Haocai just once.

106
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,484
OK?

107
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,279
I'll keep him under control.

108
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,947
I will let him

109
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,867
Never appear in front of you again

110
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,078
I'll find a way to control him anyway.

111
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,916
Please forgive him this time.

112
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,335
You said this

113
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,921
Can you guarantee it with your life?

114
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,893
If you would spare his life

115
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:46,896
good

116
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,814
no problem

117
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,578
Haocai

118
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,473
Haocai

119
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,267
Haocai

120
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,188
Let's go home, okay?

121
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,610
Let's go home. Let's go home.

122
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,153
Okay? Let's go home.

123
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,550
I know. I'll be there right away.

124
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,847
No, you stay here.

125
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,056
- I can go alone
- ah?

126
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,349
Where are you going?

127
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,686
It is said that Quan Longji woke up and came to find me. I left.

128
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,080
(Detective Lu Zhixiu)

129
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,874
Hmm, how's Detective Lu doing?

130
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:34,879
Monitor

131
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:38,632
Monitor

132
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:40,968
Monitor!

133
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,062
What's up?

134
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,981
Mrs. Maeda seems to have figured out our plan.

135
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:35,916
welcome

136
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,836
I'm waiting for you.

137
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,107
I was wondering why it was so quiet along the way.

138
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:04,528
When an old friend returns, you still have to follow this etiquette

139
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,864
Are we still friends?

140
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,782
So much time has passed

141
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,410
A lot of things have changed

142
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,204
We still stand face to face

143
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:16,916
From this point of view, maybe

144
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,672
Maybe that's why

145
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,687
I've been forgotten by you

146
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,942
I didn't expect to feel such a sense of desolation.

147
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,655
If you knew in my memory
What kind of image are you?

148
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,992
You would definitely prefer that I don't remember it.

149
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,119
Compared to the endless emptiness

150
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,540
I'd rather have something to savor.

151
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,251
Painful memories

152
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,921
Your existence is no longer "pain" to me

153
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:06,715
But "ugly"

154
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:09,927
Do you still think

155
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,723
Are all human lives of equal value?

156
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,767
Don't you still think so?

157
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,394
What about Yin Caiyu's life?

158
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:25,109
Is her life included?

159
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,389
I've always been curious

160
00:16:56,473 --> 00:17:00,060
What do you think
To what extent is the value of human life equal?

161
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:02,771
for example

162
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,441
Your friend in the hospital

163
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,196
We will move you to the general ward now.

164
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:12,740
What?

165
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,074
or

166
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,952
Your police friend?

167
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,131
And the kid number 71 you are looking for

168
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,217
Their lives combined
Weigh it against Yin Caiyu's life

169
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,970
If you are asked to save only one life

170
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,724
Which side will you choose?

171
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,142
Wouldn't you...

172
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,436
Maeda, you are...

173
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,718
Yin Caiyu is not down there

174
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,179
Later

175
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,807
We'll remove her nails in the sink room.

176
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,227
There should be two possible results

177
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:28,065
Or like you were a year ago
Losing all my memories, I became a completely different person

178
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,653
Or failed to escape from the sink

179
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,531
Drowned there

180
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,493
Please choose

181
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,037
Which side do you want to save first?

182
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,207
Choose Yin Caiyu?

183
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,596
Put her in

184
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,183
still

185
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,270
Choose your friends?

186
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,737
Please make a choice, Mr. Zhang

187
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,449
You don't have much time left

188
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,910
How far do you have to go before you give up?

189
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,912
I just want to prove

190
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,999
Is what you said true?

191
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,710
Is this topic feasible?

192
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:32,671
How about it?

193
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:37,384
Do you still feel
Are all human lives of equal value?

194
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,724
Do you still think that all people are equal?

195
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:14,922
Mr. Zhang

196
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,331
Monitor!

197
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,553
Oh, don't come down.

198
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,022
Don't don't come down!

199
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:56,898
don't want!

200
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,384
Hey are you crazy?

201
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,219
Hey, what are you doing here?

202
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,220
What do you want?

203
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,107
I've fought it once before.

204
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,088
Give up

205
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,716
You can't escape from here no matter how hard you struggle

206
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,220
Where is the lender Zhang?

207
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:12,641
Just tell me this

208
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,898
Is he still alive?

209
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,987
Although he is still alive
But you may have a hard time meeting him again.

210
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,164
Zhang Taisang chose to rescue

211
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,542
It's someone else, not you.

212
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,712
Because this decision

213
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:47,342
He will be torn to pieces there.

214
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,392
And you're going to die in this sink

215
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:01,481
If you want to win, you should be more simple.

216
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,275
You are too emotional.

217
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:06,403
Too many miscellaneous and trivial reasons

218
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,659
Everyone has different reasons for living.

219
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,126
People decide to die for different reasons.

220
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,213
Aren't you afraid of death?

221
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,734
The real horror is not death.

222
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:58,079
But ended up alone
The state of being unable to die even if you want to

223
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,011
What a pity for these eyes

224
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:19,643
I like it.

225
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,460
What is that?

226
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,628
What is that?

227
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,296
Just be quiet, damn it!

228
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:53,468
Haocai!

229
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,306
Hey Haocai!

230
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,601
Haocai, are you okay?

231
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,103
Damn it!

232
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,108
Don't wait

233
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,776
Wait go away!

234
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,531
Run away!

235
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,575
- Quick cut
- good

236
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,951
Longji

237
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,495
Oh damn.

238
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,830
Legs My Legs

239
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,502
- Damn
- Cut it off quickly.

240
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:29,754
There is also Zong He

241
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,214
We have to bring Jong Hyuk along.

242
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,382
We have to go quickly

243
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,513
Okay, hurry up.

244
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:42,809
Haocai!

245
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,102
There is an elevator at the back

246
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,687
Go faster!

247
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,023
Oh damn

248
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,701
Go away!

249
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:02,912
Letâ€™s go faster!

250
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:44,829
How low should the temperature be lowered?

251
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,415
Reduce to 18 degrees

252
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,315
Stop

253
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:44,657
I know you're in pain now.

254
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,275
Nitrogen detected

255
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,820
Please evacuate

256
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,077
Nitrogen detected

257
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,037
Please evacuate

258
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,121
The elevator has arrived

259
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,086
Nitrogen detected

260
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,338
Haocai, come here quickly!

261
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,466
What the hell are you doing?

262
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,889
Wait a minute, Haocai!

263
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,493
How are you guys?

264
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,913
Haocai

265
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,998
Haocai, are you okay?

266
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:58,958
I don't have time to talk too much now.

267
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,836
Go up one more floor and you will see a long corridor

268
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,212
You must go all the way to the end

269
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:06,257
Walk to the end of the corridor and go out from the iron door on the right.

270
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,800
You will see the passage leading to the outside.

271
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:08,927
Wait a moment

272
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:10,970
Hey, what about you?

273
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,805
Miss Yin Caiyu is still here

274
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,474
No, no

275
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,309
No, you little bastard!

276
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,938
Call the police if you go out.

277
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,481
Yeah, got it.

278
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:22,398
Wait a minute, kid.

279
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,860
Would you mind coming out with us now?
Come out with us.

280
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:29,113
You have to stay alive, little brat!

281
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,284
You guys go out first.

282
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,578
I took her out with me

283
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,321
how's it going?

284
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,824
Current water temperature in the tank

285
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:55,908
It's down to 20 degrees.

286
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,619
It will drop to 18 degrees in two or three minutes.

287
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,456
Her heart will stop.

288
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,213
Zhang Daizhu

289
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,968
I want to be with you

290
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,181
I have a word

291
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,893
I want to tell you

292
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,439
I have many more

293
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,734
Things I want to do with you

294
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:01,891
What is that?

295
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,521
Didn't the Na people fall asleep?

296
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,132
Why did you do this?

297
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:36,884
Are you really going to

298
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,596
Want to kill me?

299
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,643
I should have killed you long ago.

300
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,604
One year ago

301
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,316
At that time you didn't choose me but Mr. Zhang

302
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,448
Even for a moment

303
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,955
Do you treat me as your son?

304
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,459
People always become weak sometimes

305
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:15,882
What mother-child relationship?
Colleague friendship, patriotism, etc.

306
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:21,304
When people indulge in
And limit yourself to these trivial relationships

307
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,307
It will become useless

308
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,101
Poor existence

309
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:29,812
It's easy to become

310
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,815
A trivial consumable item that is used by others

311
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,110
I didn't do it this way.

312
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,905
Raise you up

313
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,074
In order to train you to be free from any constraints

314
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,994
Become a perfect being on your own

315
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,330
I push you and train you

316
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,335
But you have been searching for your mother's presence.

317
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,921
Always rely on Jang Tae Sang

318
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:58,758
I am so disappointed.

319
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:16,442
I did it wrong

320
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,115
You are disappointed

321
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,161
It means you still have some expectations of me.

322
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:30,289
knew

323
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:32,792
I will behave well in the future

324
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,045
I won't pursue anyone anymore.

325
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,173
Who are you looking forward to?

326
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,092
so

327
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,602
Please acknowledge me.

328
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,190
I'm no longer bound by you.

329
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:00,903
I will become perfection on my own

330
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,287
What a nice view

331
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,029
Her heart stopped beating

332
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,951
I want that guy.

333
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:04,563
Say

334
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:09,485
Are we going to have good times too?

335
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,031
Will welcome

336
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:26,210
I will definitely do it

337
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:56,156
What's wrong?

338
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,202
What will happen to me in the future?

339
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:01,704
after all

340
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,164
Three people died.

341
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,709
You have to pay for it first when you get out.

342
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:09,962
What about me

343
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:13,257
I will do my best to help you
Let the court consider your criminal law

344
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:15,050
So don't worry too much

345
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:19,722
hurry up

346
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:20,639
Eh!

347
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:24,393
Oh, what's going on?

348
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,562
- Are you okay?
- What's going on?

349
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,314
- I'm fine
- How badly are you injured?

350
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:29,231
Can you move around?

351
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,233
- It feels like my leg bone is broken
- What can I do?

352
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:35,487
First, launch an emergency search of Chuan Cheng Pharmaceutical

353
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,406
Detective Lu, please go and apply for a search warrant

354
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:38,907
- Yes, I know.
- Ouch, damn.

355
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:40,743
Are you okay?

356
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,496
Uh, are you the only two who escaped?

357
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:53,839
What did you say?

358
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:55,799
I asked, are you two the only ones who escaped?

359
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:03,223
Yeah, just the two of us.

360
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,224
Oh, good.

361
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,154
Shield door about to open

362
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:06,412
(Chengdu Pharmaceuticals was raided)

363
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,580
(Prosecutors searched for illegal live experiments
Summon the president for investigation)

364
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,624
(Reports on illegal live experiments continue)

365
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,084
(The prosecutor summoned the president for investigation)

366
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,794
(It is unclear whether there is a living laboratory)

367
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:25,222
Mmm delicious

368
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,213
Come out to eat quickly. Be careful not to be late.

369
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:40,547
OK

370
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:43,300
Here it comes

371
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,097
Will school be over late today too?

372
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:50,974
Well

373
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:54,686
The club is holding a charity sale today
After that, there is a dinner party.

374
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:56,772
It will probably be late, right?

375
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:00,609
tasty

376
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:01,944
- Is it delicious?
- Um

377
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:10,536
Don't you have a boyfriend yet?

378
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:13,747
Boy friend?

379
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:18,460
That

380
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:22,840
It will happen naturally when the time comes, right?

381
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,638
Come and have some meat

382
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:35,811
Mmm delicious

383
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,232
Today's makeup is so beautiful

384
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:42,317
Today at the charity sale...

385
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:45,863
Oh, the clothes are very beautiful.

386
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:51,535
I sometimes dream

387
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:01,461
I dreamed that I was following someone's back

388
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:04,923
I obviously don't know who that is.

389
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,593
I can't remember anyone like this.

390
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:13,348
But this dream always makes me feel
My heart aches dully

391
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,311
Spring is about to pass

392
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,188
Summer is coming again

393
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:58,453
And then we'll be reborn, right?

394
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:08,875
(The crew of "Beijing Monster" misses
Our colleagues Kim Hyun-jung and Oh Hyo-jung)

395
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:40,907
Please continue

396
