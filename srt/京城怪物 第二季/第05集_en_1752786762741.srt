1
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:42,000
"Beijing Monster"

2
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:12,822
Luo Yueshi

3
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,117
- Luo Yueshi
- Oh yeah

4
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,330
Who sent this letter?

5
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,624
What's this?

6
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,834
Isn't this what you put on my desk?

7
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:25,752
no

8
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,215
Did you put little Park Shin on the table?

9
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:31,800
No, it wasn't me.

10
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:33,593
What's wrong?

11
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,386
What letter?

12
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:38,389
how?

13
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,391
Did the content of the letter upset you?

14
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,730
(I'll wait for you at the Moonlight Bar)

15
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,288
(Moonlight Bar)

16
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,791
You'd better not go in, Mr. Zhang

17
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:06,960
It's that woman

18
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,575
You still come to show your face

19
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,370
Since the end of the war

20
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,706
Haven't we seen each other for two years?

21
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,958
I thought you were back in Japan.

22
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,294
You didn't think I was dead?

23
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,344
Let me first hear why you came to see me.
What do you want from me?

24
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,474
Before that I want you to apologize to me first

25
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,811
You disrupted my husband's funeral.

26
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,565
And it hurt me.

27
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:18,239
We were just
Just expressing condolences to those who died in Wengcheng Hospital

28
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,367
You are rationalizing your own

29
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,745
An act of terror?

30
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,916
We call it "resistance"

31
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,669
I have always been sincere to you

32
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,885
I really think of you as a friend and I'm worried about you

33
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,346
So we help you

34
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,726
And you always reject me and insult me
In this way, I can "reward" you

35
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:54,859
True friendship is not about giving and receiving

36
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,947
It should be a relationship of mutual sharing and understanding

37
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,705
Please go back to your country, Mrs. Maeda.

38
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,459
Your time is over.

39
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:17,006
I hope we never see each other again.

40
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,155
(Jin Yu Tang)

41
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,541
Where are you now?

42
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,335
There's no going back

43
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,254
Mr. Zhang Taishang

44
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:04,971
Hurry up, Park!

45
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,123
Uncle Jia Ping!

46
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:00,878
Luo Yueshi

47
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,578
Get out of here you bastards.

48
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:37,790
Luo Yueshi

49
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,206
I just thought about what you said.

50
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,667
But I still think you are wrong

51
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:29,300
Friendship is really a relationship of give and take.

52
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,142
Luo Yueshi

53
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:22,687
Luo Yueshi

54
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,067
Luo Yueshi

55
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,194
Luo Yueshi

56
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,201
Luo Yueshi, wake up!

57
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,247
Luo Yueshi, open your eyes!

58
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,835
water

59
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,379
Find you some water first.

60
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,575
don't want

61
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,619
Jia Pingshu

62
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:20,661
Fanwu

63
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,081
Jia Pingshu

64
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:31,672
Jia Pingshu

65
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,591
Jia Pingshu

66
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,637
No, don't.

67
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,265
No no!

68
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,647
You bunch of bastards!

69
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,027
boss

70
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,247
boss

71
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,168
Are you okay?

72
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,172
Luo Yueshi, are you okay?

73
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,260
Are you hurt anywhere?

74
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,804
I feel weird

75
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,602
Feeling cold

76
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:12,732
Headache

77
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,946
Can you help me?

78
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:26,537
Luo Yueshi

79
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,375
I'll be there soon

80
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:08,621
Luo Yueshi

81
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:11,957
Taishang

82
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,428
Run away!

83
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,266
hurry up

84
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,396
Far away from me

85
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,695
It's ok, Tae-san

86
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,584
What about me

87
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:00,881
I'm fine

88
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:05,803
You understand

89
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:10,683
Do you understand what I mean?

90
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:36,208
The Border of Curse and Blessing of Beijing Monster

91
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:40,254
Part 5
Drama title: Monster

92
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:54,977
People often mistakenly believe

93
00:14:56,562 --> 00:15:01,817
Having everything will make you happy

94
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:04,612
Disagree

95
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:09,783
If you have everything, you will feel bored.

96
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,954
Feeling bored

97
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,583
Feeling numb to everything

98
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:25,841
therefore

99
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,636
Only then will you choose to trample on others

100
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,686
Whenever I see the other person's fear and anger

101
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,564
I can experience it firsthand

102
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,442
Alive

103
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,611
Feel

104
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,907
haven't seen you for a long time

105
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,494
Ms. Yin Caiyu

106
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,082
How could you?

107
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:04,797
Maybe it's the same reason you're still alive.

108
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:15,933
It's really amazing

109
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,021
Was it Xingqin's doing?

110
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,445
So much time has passed

111
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,616
We meet again like this

112
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,869
Suddenly I felt
Everything seems to have happened two days ago.

113
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,164
Fresh in memory

114
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,670
About You, Xingqin

115
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:47,923
And the memory of Mr. Zhang

116
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,261
Why you

117
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,474
Still here?

118
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,688
Why can't we be here?

119
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:08,569
We are no longer your enemies.
I am not your perpetrator anymore.

120
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,409
So much time has passed

121
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,120
You should also be kind to us

122
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,789
Be grateful, eh?

123
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,627
Miss Yin Caiyu, you too

124
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,464
Thanks to it, we are still alive today, right?

125
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,842
Mr. Zhang is also

126
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,437
Was he also captured for experimentation?

127
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,859
I'm just being merciful.

128
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,321
Friends

129
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,287
Why do this?

130
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:02,998
Why did you do that?

131
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,627
Why do this?

132
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,546
Why didn't you let him go too?

133
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,592
You know

134
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:19,681
Why is hell scary?

135
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,730
Because it never ends

136
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,068
Since we can't be friends

137
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,657
I think I might as well be his hell.

138
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,727
Why did you suddenly drag her into the experiment?

139
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,440
Why are you asking this?

140
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:14,361
Let many variables
Constantly interrupting important plans is not a good thing

141
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:18,574
In this case
The possibility of unexpected situations also increases

142
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,787
I didn't capture her for experiments.

143
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,584
Seventy-nine years ago, I had a vengeance that I had yet to avenge.

144
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,338
This is revenge for that time.

145
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,412
Zhang Daizhu

146
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,803
Zhang the lender!

147
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,270
Are you okay? Mr. Zhang!

148
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:39,905
You make your choice

149
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,908
Do I have to go back to the way it was before?

150
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,993
still

151
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,455
Just die like this

152
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:55,629
How do you choose?

153
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,508
Should we go back to the past?

154
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,762
Die in front of that woman?

155
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:09,768
If I

156
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:15,774
Back to the past

157
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,697
Can it defeat you?

158
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:24,950
Maybe

159
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,912
By then, you can

160
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:32,708
Save that woman?

161
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,257
Maybe

162
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,140
You don't do anything, just stay there

163
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,517
I'll be there soon

164
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,021
You don't have to do anything, just stay there!

165
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,689
I'll be there soon

166
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,858
I'll be there now

167
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,901
don't want

168
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:45,989
don't want!

169
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,574
No!

170
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:52,245
No no!

171
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,209
don't want!

172
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:43,713
No no no

173
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:46,466
don't want

174
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:52,741
I'm looking for someone

175
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,121
In the cherry blossoms

176
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,831
Before Withering

177
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,085
That's my mother

178
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,339
Run

179
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,218
Let's make a pact.

180
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,677
You must not die

181
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,347
Will we have those good times too?

182
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,681
don't want!

183
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,062
Cherry blossoms

184
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,191
Withered

185
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,238
Zhang the lender!

186
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,241
Zhang the lender!

187
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,498
I'm going to him.

188
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:42,999
Too late

189
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,753
Even if you go, you can't do anything.

190
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,640
Stop her!

191
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:15,592
Yin Caiyu

192
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,472
Where is she?

193
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,248
Zhang Haocai escaped

194
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,381
It seems that what we worried about has happened.

195
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,763
Zhang Taisang is running around looking for that woman.

196
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:48,768
Please put him

197
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,439
Bring it to me

198
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:56,943
How does that woman deal with it?

199
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:04,743
Kill her.

200
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,371
Good to know

201
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,010
(Fuqiang Trading Company)

202
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:32,562
ah

203
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,814
I'm really going crazy

204
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,255
Who are you?

205
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,008
Then who are you?

206
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,093
I asked you first.

207
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,011
What about me

208
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,139
I'm familiar with both representatives here.

209
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:11,267
I occasionally bring them side dishes and cinnamon.

210
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,227
What about you?

211
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:14,270
What is your relationship?

212
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,900
I don't have such a deep relationship with them.

213
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,029
Why did you punch holes in people's walls?

214
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,865
Oh, that's not the hole I made.

215
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:29,118
Oh wait, what was the police call?

216
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,579
Oh, you don't have to. I'm the police.

217
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:35,041
I'm Detective No Ji-su from the Jongno Investigation Team 2

218
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,001
I'm tracking the suspect.

219
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,002
Suspect?

220
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,088
Who is the suspect?

221
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,257
Mr. Zhang Haocai

222
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,469
I have been unable to figure it out

223
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,472
Why did the police let the real murderer go?

224
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,808
Why do you have to torment innocent people?

225
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,226
I said this grandma

226
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,645
Don't talk nonsense, just dial the number

227
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:56,646
ah?

228
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,648
Let's call your squad leader first.

229
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,484
Call our squad leader? Why?

230
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,902
Do you want me to call myself?

231
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:12,954
Um Lu Detective

232
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:16,374
Oh, is it Mingjun?
It's my antenna grandma from Crescent Cave.

233
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,419
Hey, what's the matter with you calling?

234
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,004
I'm calling because of Mr. Zhang.

235
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,591
Where are you now?
Do you want me to come find you or do you want me to come here on my own?

236
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:30,805
Where are you now?

237
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,058
You let that woman escape?

238
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,435
sorry

239
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:38,605
Even if you have a cold once, you will develop antibodies.

240
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:41,399
She got fooled once because of nitrogen
How could I be fooled again?

241
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:43,359
You also know

242
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,862
Once Haocai gets angry, it's out of control

243
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,115
Who can stop Haocai now?

244
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:50,992
It should be just the eldest brother, right?

245
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,994
otherwise

246
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,538
Let the guy down there out.

247
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,333
I think it's number 71?

248
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,084
He's in his best form right now.

249
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,966
- Let the haters out
- yes

250
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:39,499
Uh no!

251
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:49,884
Where is that woman?

252
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,679
Tell me where she is.

253
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,848
Where is she?

254
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,405
I don't know when it started

255
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,116
Everything becomes blurry

256
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,954
My reasons and purpose for fighting

257
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,415
Even my anger

258
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,800
None of this can surpass a certain thought in my heart

259
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,531
Although alive

260
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,534
But I don't feel alive

261
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:47,585
I just want to see you

262
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,810
Just want to hug you

263
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,604
only

264
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:08,940
I want to hold you tightly

265
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,910
Zhang the lender!

266
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,453
Even just once

267
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,206
If I could see you

268
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:04,495
if

269
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:06,998
I can touch you

270
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,140
Zhang Daizhu

271
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:37,778
It's me

272
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,369
I am coming

273
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:56,065
how's it going?

274
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,525
Both groups of black spots were completely wiped out

275
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,126
What's going on?

276
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,253
As you can see

277
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,171
It's all over.

278
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,383
You saw that I was also hurt.

279
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:23,801
Where is Jang Tae Sang?

280
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,303
Ran away with that woman

281
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,139
Looks like he ran off toward Channel 5.

282
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:30,433
how?

283
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,268
Do you want me to chase after him?

284
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,354
Go chase them and don't let them get away.

285
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:36,856
yes

286
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,591
No time

287
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,426
The haters will come after us soon.

288
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,095
I can

289
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,014
Should I entrust her to you?

290
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:57,686
Her condition
You can't run far before you're caught by the black guys.

291
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,815
I'll try to divert their attention.

292
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,942
You should let her out now.

293
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:04,985
Can you help with this?

294
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,447
Please, Sheng Zhao

295
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:13,786
Remember Aisle 5?

296
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,123
At the end of this corridor, turn right and go all the way to the end.

297
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,958
There is a small passage above.

298
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,835
That passage is not very noticeable and it is easy to miss.

299
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,671
So be careful

300
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,593
It'll be fine.

301
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,054
We'll meet outside

302
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,604
Didn't he flee in this direction?

303
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,150
There is no other exit except this one.

304
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:41,749
Bring Seung So here

305
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:02,853
So what

306
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,147
You really found it and didn't miss it?

307
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,069
She should be waiting for you at Exit 5

308
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:14,198
If you go out like this
It will soon attract people's attention

309
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,076
Replace this

310
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:28,629
Thank you, Seung So

311
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,339
well

312
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:31,966
I told you not to touch my head

313
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,176
How old am I?

314
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,053
Then I'm going back

315
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,347
If you leave for too long, people will be suspicious.

316
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,105
I couldn't go out a year ago.

317
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:50,776
I'm sorry about that.

318
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,404
elder brother

319
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:20,598
(Restricted Area)

320
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:37,281
(Exit 5)
