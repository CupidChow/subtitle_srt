1
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:41,708
"Beijing Monster"

2
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,825
I was a special kid when I was little.

3
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,284
Killing is okay

4
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:00,829
But it was discovered

5
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,039
It is not allowed

6
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,208
Why?

7
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,675
If you are a good son, you should answer "yes"

8
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:18,972
It's rude to ask "why?"

9
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,224
Katsuaki

10
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,896
It's the mother

11
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,160
I want my mother's approval.

12
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:01,723
Even just once

13
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,977
I want to feel comforted

14
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,958
Although it is not yet clear
Why is it that only child has tentacles?

15
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,794
But I have a guess in my mind

16
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,130
What kind of guess?

17
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,218
Different from other experimental subjects

18
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,931
Sheng Zhao inherited the Na people's

19
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,936
Are you a narrator?

20
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:53,983
The first person in the mother's womb
A lot of learning has been done

21
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,028
Then it entered the child's body

22
00:03:57,111 --> 00:04:01,866
This makes the synchronization phenomenon more active

23
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:05,578
Just like

24
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:15,421
Xingqin to protect his daughter
It's like my body suddenly activated

25
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,218
In that child's mind

26
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:26,599
Does Akiko's motherhood also exist?

27
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,894
Maybe

28
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,523
interesting

29
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,659
I knew then

30
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,787
I'm not something special.

31
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,415
I just

32
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,418
Just a special experimental subject

33
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,673
Have you met Mr. Zhang?

34
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:00,967
yes

35
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,594
Meet

36
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:08,057
I'll leave the next plan up to you.

37
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,351
Katsuaki

38
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,189
Did you get some sleep?

39
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,361
How is your injury?

40
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:31,701
how?

41
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,661
Is it still painful?

42
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:36,622
If this is a dream

43
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,378
I really hope I never wake up

44
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,238
I miss you so much

45
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,703
No matter how many times I say "I miss you"

46
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,623
Can't fill my thoughts

47
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,335
I miss you so much

48
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,155
How's No. 71?

49
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,074
Not found yet

50
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,166
You did it, didn't you?

51
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,964
What on earth are you thinking about?

52
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:10,883
Set him free

53
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,635
free

54
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:18,975
That's not freedom
That's chaos, make no mistake.

55
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:20,810
No matter what

56
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,190
At least it should be more fun than you think.

57
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,234
What do you mean?

58
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:29,777
I know all

59
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,949
I know what you want to do

60
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,307
Very hungry

61
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,547
Oh, how much did you drink tonight?

62
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,840
I haven't sobered up yet.

63
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,053
Hello sir

64
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:38,846
Very hungry

65
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,357
Something happened

66
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:10,378
The Border between Life and Death of Beijing Monster

67
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:14,382
Part 6
Drama title: Bait

68
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,687
It was you who ordered the arrest of President Zhang?

69
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,189
So what is it that I call people...

70
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:34,026
Aren't you the person in charge of this case?
Wasn't that what you did?

71
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,111
Tell me what I should do.

72
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,321
Murders happened one after another

73
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,989
At every crime scene

74
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,866
Zhang Haocai left behind a lot of physical evidence

75
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,993
Start with your grandfather

76
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,496
Three generations of your family
Always receiving favors from the lender Jin Yu Tang

77
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,417
How dare you list President Zhang as a wanted criminal?

78
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:55,047
Don't arrest innocent people.
Pretending to bring justice to society

79
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,218
Please look for our Zonghe.

80
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:00,928
What?

81
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,015
Our Zonghe is missing.

82
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:06,767
What's going on?

83
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,562
He went to the company for training

84
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:14,275
Then he sent me 10 million won out of the blue.
Then there was no news.

85
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:16,944
I called their company.

86
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,488
They said there was no such training.

87
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,323
Which company?

88
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:22,867
Heritage Pharmaceuticals

89
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,036
(Sung Jun-mo is 41 years old
Researcher at Heritage Biotech)

90
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,165
(Wu Qixun is 29 years old
Heritage Biotechnology Security)

91
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:34,295
(An Zonghe
Joined the Comprehensive Support Team of Seunghwa Pharmaceutical for one month)

92
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,714
(Jongno-gu serial murder case
ruptured eyeballs and hollowed-out brains)

93
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,718
So it's all about...

94
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,096
Is it related to Heritage Biotechnology?

95
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,516
- Do you want me to check it out?
- Oops, I was shocked.

96
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,810
Please make some noise when you come in.

97
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:53,105
You met that grandmother yesterday
Is nothing wrong?

98
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,571
What is your relationship like?

99
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,990
It seems like she has a close relationship with Zhang Haocai

100
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,200
Detective Park, let's have dinner.

101
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,160
Would you like some takeout of Grandma's soup and rice?

102
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,038
- What do you want to eat?
- Honestly

103
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,581
I felt something was wrong from the beginning

104
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,043
Even if Zhang Hao is a capable person

105
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,755
But not to the extent
Just ask him to find clues about the suspect.

106
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,341
You asked me to supervise him.

107
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,928
In addition, you
Staying up all night to guard the door of the intensive care unit

108
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:24,929
Arenâ€™t you hungry?

109
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,223
You have known each other for a long time, right?

110
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,516
We ordered takeout first.

111
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:31,852
Huh?

112
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,147
Hello, I'm Lv Mingjun from the Second Squad of the Serious Crime Unit

113
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,566
What?

114
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:41,529
That monitor

115
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,785
The escalator area of a subway station in Seoul
A random killing occurred

116
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,912
Three people died at the scene

117
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:51,288
One person is in critical condition

118
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,249
Now rushed to the emergency room

119
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,125
Yesterday morning at five o'clock

120
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,419
The Fire Safety Center received an alarm call
Someone is hallucinating...

121
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,220
According to the police

122
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,805
- Suspect A...
- Zong...

123
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,181
Random attack

124
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,685
B, a platform worker in his 50s

125
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:13,727
I know that kid.

126
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,105
This led to Seoul Railway Company employees and...

127
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,315
He is in the basement of Heritage Pharmaceuticals
They were experimented on

128
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,650
A female cleaner in her forties...

129
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,568
Is it true?

130
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,485
Um

131
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,571
He escaped from there this morning.

132
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,282
There are also men in their forties
He was taken to the emergency room...

133
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,199
I did it

134
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,410
After the incident...

135
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,078
I let him out.

136
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,289
Police arrived at the scene
Arrest him immediately as a criminal...

137
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,124
What on earth do you think?

138
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,208
The fact of ...

139
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:37,710
According to frontline reporters...

140
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:38,627
I want people to see

141
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,297
Modus operandi
With the recent Jongno serial murders...

142
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,050
If you can't see it with your own eyes
People nowadays don't believe anything.

143
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,845
I have less and less faith.

144
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,930
Three more people died.

145
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,182
There's a chance more people will die.

146
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,268
Did you know?

147
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,270
What does that mean?

148
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:58,856
Please explain clearly

149
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,441
Why are more people dying?

150
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,611
I don't know the details.

151
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,739
I just know

152
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,451
Mrs. Maeda seems to be planning something dangerous.

153
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,746
(The suspect is a male in his twenties
Randomly attacked a fifty-something station attendant)

154
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,165
(Citizens on their way to work are terrified
six casualties)

155
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,082
How dangerous is it?

156
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,752
You know that woman better.

157
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,588
Whatever she does, she will do it perfectly.

158
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,507
It should be like this

159
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,802
The current situation
Is that part of the plan as well?

160
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:34,266
Using him as bait to catch both of us?

161
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,019
I see you really don't like me, don't you?

162
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,270
I don't trust you.

163
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,564
Who took you out of that place?

164
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,484
I know it very well.
Who stabbed me, kidnapped me?

165
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,804
Oh, don't even mention how strong he is.

166
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,806
Ten people rushed forward but were thrown out.

167
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,182
It's just a bull.

168
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:18,477
What else can we do?
I had to stun him with a stun gun.

169
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,104
Then he fell

170
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,815
Look at him. Look at him.

171
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,817
Then is it still called people?

172
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:26,568
Zonghe

173
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,949
Look at me, An Zonghe

174
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,119
What's wrong with you? Huh?

175
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,997
- Ah, what's going on!
- Monitor

176
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,749
Are you okay?

177
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,378
I'll get you some emergency medicine first.

178
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,255
Do you know him?

179
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,094
(Fuqiang Trading Company)

180
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,432
Hello?

181
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,475
It's me, squad leader Lu

182
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,603
Hey, how are you?

183
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,398
I'm still alive, don't worry.

184
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,692
Are you using this number again?

185
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:07,735
Well

186
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,237
I'm back again

187
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,533
Uh okay

188
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,244
Can you explain to me the current situation?

189
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,371
It's Jong Hyuk

190
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,373
Crescent Cave Antenna Grandma and her grandson

191
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,375
He is a criminal

192
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,171
The company he just joined is...

193
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,088
Um

194
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,007
Heritage Pharmaceuticals

195
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,181
You're a piece of trash

196
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,808
They didn't even manage the experimental subjects properly.

197
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,020
Haven't you seen that the news is all over the place right now?

198
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,527
It seems that Sheng Zhao did it.

199
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,945
Why did he do that?

200
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,492
Should I ask Mrs. Maeda?

201
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,037
You mean
Was this all Mrs. Maeda's plan?

202
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,881
Didn't I tell you?

203
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,348
When she wanted to turn him back into Jang Tae Sang

204
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,768
I told you I didn't like this plan.

205
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,188
Although it is impossible to guess

206
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,440
What was Mrs. Maeda thinking when she gave such instructions?

207
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:32,027
But this is clearly the one who asked us to inherit the pharmaceutical industry.
Do you know that this is a dangerous move?

208
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:40,369
Yes, the former chairman
Implant a Nazi in my brain

209
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,954
So that I can keep the legacy

210
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:45,207
It is right to contribute wholeheartedly to the realization of great achievements

211
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:53,590
What if this incident threatens the peace of the inheritance?

212
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,387
Then I will
Ruthlessly eliminate the risk factor

213
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,140
Regardless of the risk factor
Is it Jang Tae-sang or your incompetence?

214
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,686
Or maybe it was Mrs. Maeda's arbitrary behavior.

215
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:12,776
Don't forget

216
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:14,736
first

217
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,030
You go clean up this mess first.

218
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,409
First, capture No. 71.

219
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,371
Then we'll talk to Mrs. Maeda.

220
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,165
Is this okay?

221
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:15,756
What are you doing?

222
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,718
You're not going alone, are you?

223
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:21,970
I want to go alone

224
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,432
What are you going to do as a wounded person?

225
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:26,767
Your body hasn't recovered yet.

226
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:33,815
Did you see it?

227
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,944
Can we go together at this level?

228
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,696
- Still no
- Zhang Daizhu

229
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,198
What about me

230
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,243
I don't want to see Miss Yin Caiyu get hurt again.

231
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:49,039
I don't want to see you in danger.

232
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,959
I don't want to put you in danger.
Then regret it later

233
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,294
I don't want to tolerate this anymore

234
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,505
It's the 21st century now

235
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:02,261
I guess you won't say anything.
You want to protect me or something cliche?

236
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:03,679
That's right

237
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:08,725
Don't look at my appearance.
I am a man over a hundred years old.

238
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,229
My thinking is pretty old-fashioned.

239
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,774
I still believe that men have to protect women

240
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,820
I want to fight or am I better than you?

241
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,197
Well, that won't work either.

242
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:23,699
Besides

243
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,370
I won't die either.

244
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:31,748
What about me

245
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,711
Rather than being the woman you protect

246
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,590
I would rather be the woman who is inseparable from you

247
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,428
so

248
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,181
Let's stay together, Mr. Zhang

249
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:52,811
Um?

250
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,827
How can I refuse you when you smile at me like this?

251
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,250
you

252
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,209
Give me another smile

253
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,109
Um

254
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,654
Where? Who are you talking about?

255
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,407
They are from the company that produces traditional pharmaceuticals.

256
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,293
Are you crazy? Where are you going?

257
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,211
Go find that kid

258
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,046
I said, what are you doing there?

259
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,049
I know that kid.

260
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,050
What's wrong with knowing each other?

261
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:08,011
He has been arrested by the police, what can you do?

262
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,680
The inheritance will not give up

263
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,350
They'll find a way to deal with him.

264
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,559
There should be only two possibilities, right?

265
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,561
Either capture him or kill him.

266
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:20,190
Before he encountered this accident
We have to do everything we can.

267
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,233
It's been like this all my life

268
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:23,860
Aren't you bored?

269
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,782
Fight with that gang and be defeated
Even through the gates of hell

270
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,118
But do you still have the patience to fight them?

271
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,246
How can people live like this?

272
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,415
Is it time to stop all this now?

273
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,418
- Sheng Zhao
- You might as well just run away.

274
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,628
You go anywhere with that woman.

275
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:44,047
Then just live your own life, ok?

276
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,093
I also thought about my own life

277
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,596
Live a happy life with her

278
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,182
But this is not achieved by running away

279
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,353
A life bought by running away

280
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,149
The non-existent Sheng Zhao

281
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,992
- Who are you?
- It's me, No Ji-su

282
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,495
Now a large group of people from Heritage Pharmaceuticals have come

283
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,956
They said they were going to take the prisoner away.

284
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,043
What does that mean?

285
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,088
You guys came to visit me so suddenly?
You want to take the prisoner away?

286
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,631
That person is infected

287
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,551
- Infect?
- I heard that the Second Division of the Major Crime Unit of the Jongno Police Station

288
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,803
Called our company

289
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:33,847
And asked about this nitrogen issue

290
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,764
Yes

291
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,350
We still haven't heard any response

292
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:41,021
This is for uniforms
Portable nitrogen bombs made for violent infected people

293
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,482
It was developed by our pharmaceutical company

294
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,443
Infected people are generally very aggressive

295
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,113
The Department of Disease Control has issued an official letter

296
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,241
The leadership of the National Police Agency has unanimously agreed.

297
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,578
Hand over the infected first.

298
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,413
What do you regard the investigative agency as?

299
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:04,002
It happened within the last two months.
Suspect in six serial murders

300
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,464
Today
Three people died at the same place.

301
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,885
With a piece of torn paper
You're going to take away a violent criminal like that?

302
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,565
Compared to investigating cases

303
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,026
What matters most at this moment is the safety and lives of the citizens.

304
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,863
If the infectious disease spreads, things will get out of control.

305
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,491
Police Inspector Lu Mingjun, will you be in charge when the time comes?

306
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,499
They moved faster than we expected.

307
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:43,917
We're too late anyway, right?

308
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,753
The police station with jurisdiction over the case
It's less than ten minutes away. There's still time.

309
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,255
So what if I have time?

310
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,798
What can you do when you go there?

311
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,508
You know there's one thing I'm good at.

312
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:53,426
make trouble

313
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,181
I'm ready, let's go.

314
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:00,850
I'll go with you

315
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,272
I said I'd go too.

316
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,126
Are you driving too fast?

317
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,128
Speed 50 mph. Didn't you see the sign?

318
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,045
Saw it

319
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,755
But I didn't follow the rules

320
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:38,805
Have you confirmed it?

321
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,726
Yes, the CDC says these are all facts.

322
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:47,814
There are several
There are also cases of infected people with similar symptoms.

323
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,733
Because it is an important case

324
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,651
These are all considered confidential

325
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:55,822
We also confirmed
Heritage Pharmaceuticals is studying the cause of infection

326
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,657
Hey Captain

327
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,327
They blocked the camera.

328
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,288
Oh shit

329
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,628
Do I need to release the nitrogen first?

330
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,630
It's too troublesome. Just open it.

331
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:49,959
(Heritage Biotech)

332
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,943
(Hello, Jongno Police Station)

333
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:27,956
(Heritage Biotech)

334
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,884
(Lv Mingjun, squad leader of the Second Serious Crime Squad)

335
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,218
Yes Captain

336
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,553
Um where are you?

337
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,265
Hello, where are you?

338
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:30,018
I am following Heritage Biotech

339
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,062
- What?
- Feel sorry

340
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,647
I know the criminal was caught at the crime scene.

341
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,983
I know this case can be closed like this.

342
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,235
But I always feel something is wrong

343
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,654
I know you think I'm unreliable.

344
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:44,032
This time I want to act on my instincts.

345
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:45,450
sorry

346
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,703
You can finally help.

347
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,623
Don't lose it

348
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,375
Keep reporting to me after a while.

349
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,378
I have to find out something no matter what.

350
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,713
That's it.

351
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:24,155
I heard that our Zong He came here?

352
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,700
Can you let me meet him?

353
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,203
It's that

354
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,247
Not now

355
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:35,792
No, our Zonghe won't do that.

356
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,044
Our Zonghe is not that kind of child

357
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,421
Squad Leader Lu, you know

358
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,548
Yes, that one...

359
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,646
There was a motorcycle and two cars following behind.

360
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:58,439
Step on the gas

361
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:12,787
Well?

362
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:37,937
you

363
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:40,857
How much do you like my brother?

364
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,655
Why should I tell you?

365
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,782
Because I like him too

366
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,871
I also know
The story behind his ill-fated relationship with Mrs. Maeda

367
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:57,749
Also know

368
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,377
The reason why he hates Heritage Pharmaceuticals

369
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,339
So a year ago

370
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,383
When he said he wanted to raze the lab

371
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,846
I didn't hesitate for a second.

372
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,934
Just say I want to stand on Haocai's side

373
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:20,939
I was

374
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,527
I really feel like I could die for him.

375
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:30,573
But

376
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,163
Actually, it's not like that

377
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,417
One year ago

378
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,465
Actually, I didn't miss the scene.

379
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:52,553
Say it again

380
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,767
You said you could die for Mr. Zhang?

381
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,689
Did you just say that?

382
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,525
He was the first person to recognize me.

383
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:07,652
He said that I was originally

384
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,363
It's already good

385
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:13,783
He made me understand

386
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,743
I am a human being

387
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:19,789
So I felt for the first time

388
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,836
Life is not painful

389
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:26,796
I also

390
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:29,590
I recognize you.

391
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,053
Although you were born of a lowly prostitute
But I recognize you as my son

392
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:38,224
Even though everyone opposes
I insisted on adding you to my account

393
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:40,977
But you actually

394
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,396
Betray me?

395
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,399
Sorry, Mom.

396
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:51,738
Please let me go

397
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,369
Lift your head

398
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,665
Lift your head

399
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,084
hurry up

400
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,637
Within 24 hours from now

401
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,223
The Na people will enter a deep sleep state

402
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:28,691
No matter what happens
No one will protect you.

403
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,988
If you get stabbed, the wound will bleed naturally.

404
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:38,117
If you get shot, the bullet will go through your body and kill you.

405
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,371
You lose your ability to recover

406
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:47,001
No longer able to regenerate

407
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,478
If you want to go, go ahead.

408
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,523
I hope you understand after you leave.

409
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:12,527
How fragile and tormented the human body is

410
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,489
I hope you understand
Human kindness and justice in the face of death

411
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,617
How pale and powerless

412
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,041
You choose

413
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,169
I'll keep the door open for you

414
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,300
Actually, one year ago

415
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:18,843
I'm also there

416
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,053
But

417
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:22,930
I can't help my brother.

418
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:29,896
Because I'm afraid

419
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,065
I am afraid of death

420
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,696
You don't have to

421
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,200
Sorry for being scared

422
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,247
Some people are afraid of death

423
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:56,172
Some people are afraid to live

424
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,973
Everyone has different feelings of fear.

425
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:13,940
Let's talk about that matter

426
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,234
The lender never pursued the matter.

427
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,864
This means he understands your feelings.

428
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,328
So don't feel sorry.

429
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,538
Within 24 hours from now

430
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,582
The person will enter a sleeping state

431
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,042
Start now

432
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,044
Whether it's being stabbed

433
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,131
Still shot

434
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:23,426
You will all die

435
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:26,095
Why exactly?

436
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,514
I told you

437
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:31,809
I was scared

438
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:37,690
I'm afraid I'll die

439
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,357
I met you again.

440
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,358
yes

441
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,443
Haven't seen you for a year?

442
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,154
You're such a difficult guy.

443
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:29,075
I don't have any advantages except tenacity.

444
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,702
You finally met the woman you love again

445
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:35,164
How nice it is to be with her
Why appear here again?

446
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,082
donâ€™t worry

447
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,710
I'll go back after I finish my work here.

448
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,588
Do you still believe in Sheng Zhao?

449
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:10,491
Um

450
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:12,868
believe

451
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,123
That woman is a pity.

452
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:22,586
You worry about yourself.

453
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:40,438
It is said that Zhang Taisang has been lured away
And Seung So and Yoon Chae Ok are together

454
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,267
elder brother

455
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,575
Say

456
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,620
After I had the surgery

457
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,373
Can I continue playing the cello?

458
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:42,374
Of course.

459
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,670
You will play better than before the accident.

460
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:49,882
When can I have a transplant?

461
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,512
We are choosing the most suitable match for you.

462
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,389
After three to six months

463
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,975
You will learn most of the principles

464
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:03,062
If you do a transplant at this time
It won't have much impact on the body

465
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:07,191
Definitely better than when they were larvae
Is there a higher chance of success?

466
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:08,651
After transplanting the adults

467
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,321
There have been no deaths so far.

468
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,120
Then choose this one

469
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,207
Three months later, the transplant was performed

470
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,460
You wait three more months

471
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,005
Then you can walk again.

472
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:31,966
Eat now

473
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:41,238
