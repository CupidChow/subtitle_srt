I need food

I need food

00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,360
I need food

8
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,530
I need food

9
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,050
This is dangerous

10
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,580

Would you like something to drink?

Would you like coffee? Or any other drink?

21
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:02,779
Let's talk business first

22
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,992
Before that, let's exchange names.

23
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:13,373
I told you my name before
What is your name?

24
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,584
I don't have a name

25
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:10,130
You didn't even tell me your name
How do we start this? Is this still considered a team-up?

26
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,590
Because we are teammates

27
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,130
This unnecessary form should be avoided.

28
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,890
How is your injury?

29
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,310
Are you okay?

00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,900
That day

31
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,940
You are seriously injured.

32
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,780
Let's just follow two rules.

33
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,830
First, don't ask personal questions

34
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,950
Second, you do as I say.

35
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,130
Neither want to tell me my name nor let me say hello

36
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,040
Isn't this too stereotyped between teammates?

37
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,630
I'm calling President Luo's cell phone now.

38
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,420
Isn't President Luo dead?

39
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,090
The guy who killed President Luo had her phone

40
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,800
The last person to initiate the commission

41
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:00,890
This guy too

42
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,310
What did he commission?

43
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,830
Who do you think he looks like?

44
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,570
What are you doing?

45
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,360
Who allowed you to move around freely during the confinement period?

46
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,280
What

47
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,780
Are you going to lock me up?
Can't you just watch me become a vegetable?

48
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,950
If you do this, you can control it.
I'd rather do it if you're the uncertainty factor

49
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,710
What are you afraid of?

50
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,960
You try so hard to suppress me and control me

51
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,640
Isn't it because of fear?

52
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,600
You're afraid I'll threaten you

53
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,270
Is this also the reason why Haocai had surgery?

54
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,480
I think he's in the way.

55
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,190
I'm afraid he'll hold me back.

56
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:37,990
Feeling annoyed

57
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:39,860
that's all

58
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,160
Do you think you can control us by doing this?

59
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,830
At least I know how to control the Nazi in your brain

60
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,090
Go back to your room now.

61
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,970
I actually saw someone like him outside.

62

(Yin Caiyan)

63
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,310
It's her

64
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:19,900
Hello?

65
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,490
I heard you were looking for me?

66
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,530
Do you know me?

67
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,240
How did you meet?

68
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,870
Are you with that woman?

69
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,170
Oh my god

70
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,290
He was beaten like that but he's still alive

71
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,550
She is indeed the same

72
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,420
What are you talking about?

73
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,720
You can't possibly not know?

74
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,390
I really don't know
So please make it clear.

75
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:47,890
What does it mean exactly?

76
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:50,930
I'm asking you

77
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,870
who?

78
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,500
Haocai

79
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,040
He was with that woman.

80
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,040
What should we do? Call again?

81
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,050
Let's wait and see

82
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:23,970
Say

83
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,510
What did that guy just say about "the same kind"?

84
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,760
What does that mean? Do you know anything?

85
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:33,770
you

86
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,810
It turns out that he is the same as me.

87
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,400
have no idea

88
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,200
(President Luo, see you tonight)

89
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,120
It's that guy

90
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,330
He wants to meet

91
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,340
(You decide the location)

92
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,220
OK

93
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,300
There's nothing to do with you now.

94
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,510
What's wrong with me?

95
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,260
I can go alone.

96
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:12,810
Are you kidding me?

97
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,520
I'll help you meet him.
You're saying I have nothing to do with you now?

98
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,020
I was the one the police accused of being a suspect.

99
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,360
I'm also the person that guy wants to see

100
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,280
There are a few things that people must avoid in their lifetime.

101
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,280
If you get involved with that guy
Life will fall into hell in just a moment

102
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,740
Nothing can be undone by then.

103
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,960
There's no going back.

104
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,670
Maybe I'll have to live a nightmare life forever.

105
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,590
Are you trying to scare me or are you worried about me?

106
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,180
I'm sincerely advising you.

107
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,220
You're no match for that guy.

108
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,760
Then let's call the police.

109
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,850
My goal is to catch that guy.
Rather than making things bigger

110
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,940
If we rashly call the police
So what happened to that guy who was hiding?

111
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,650
There really won't be anything we can do then.

112
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,490
That guy is looking for me.

113
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,910
It's me, not you, that he wants to see.

114
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:12,780
You shouldn't understand
The difference between recklessness and courage, right?

115
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,870
Someone wants to die alone

116
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,000
I can't just stand by and watch.

117
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,920
You said you wanted to join forces

118
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,040
Then we have to go together.

119
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,010
So are they meeting?

120
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,010
Yes, they seem to be today
We need to meet the suspect who has President Luo's cell phone.

121
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,180
- Tell me the time and place
- I haven't figured this out yet.

122
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,350
So I'm going to follow them.

123
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,310
I'll apply for support first.

124
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,400
If they start, follow them immediately.

125
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,230
I said, what do you want?

126
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,650
Who did you say you were going to meet?

127
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,070
The murderer who killed the president of Nightingale Bar

128
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,240
It is said that the hotel murder may also be done by that guy

129
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,200
Hey, you have to call the police first.
What are you going there for?

130
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,160
If you call the police

131
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,240
If he is discovered by that guy, he will hide even more.

132
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,450
There really won't be anything we can do by then.

133
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,910
- Who said that?
- That woman said

134
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,580
Hey, you believe whatever she says?
How many times have you met her?

135
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,090
I can't remember, maybe twice.

136
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,340
Hello

137
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,840
Do you know what that woman's name is?

138
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,260
- Yin Caiyan?
- What does she do?

139
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,640
She helps find missing people.

140
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,970
Take a look, huh?

141
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,810
There is no clear one from beginning to end
Nothing is certain, everything is vague

142
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:21,440
You don't pay attention and want to follow her blindly?

143
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,440
Aren't you Zhang Haocai?

144
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,480
That is to say

145
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,110
It's strange that I believe everything she says.

146
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,030
Wow

147
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,610
You kid
You said you don't look at the face when choosing a girl.

148
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,070
Hey, wake up, kid!

149
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,570
What if she's an accomplice?

150
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:37,120
What if she teamed up with the murderer to frame you?

151
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,750
Her best friend was murdered.

152
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,750
Brother, please change your perspective.

153
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,710
If I was murdered

154
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,330
Then you won't be mad?

155
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,670
Why are you trying to match us up?

156
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,420
It's really unlucky

157
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,550
Tell me, will you go crazy?

158
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,930
Of course I'll be mad, boy!

159
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,930
Then would you look for the criminal with blazing eyes?

160
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,390
Of course I will look for you, little brat!

161
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,810
Will you cover us later?

162
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:58,850
Of course I have to cover.

163
00:13:58,930 --> 00:13:59,770
Thank you bro

164
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:03,810
Damn it, I'm going crazy! Oh my god!

165
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,190
It's cold outside

166
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,440
etc.

167
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,570
Actually three times

168
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,320
I've seen you three times.

169
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,720
Zonghe is coming?

170
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,600
Grandma, I'm back.

171
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,900
Ouch, are you exhausted?

172
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,060
- No
- Thanks for your hard work

173
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,410
- Go wash your hands. Let's eat first.
- OK

174
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,130
The new employee training will start tomorrow, right?

175
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,210
Well, I will start training tomorrow for a month.

176
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,710
What kind of training lasts for a month?

177
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,010
They said that all new employees need to undergo a month of training.

178
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,300
Grandma, what is this?

179
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,010
ah?

180
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,140
You're still asking? This is a new suit.

181
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,400
Grandma received the bonus

182
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,270
Really? Was it given by President Luo?

183
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,780
It was not given by the lender Zhang.

184
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,190
who?

185
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,530
You don't know me, come sit down and eat.

186
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,450
good

187
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,250
Wow, you prepared so much food?

188
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,630
(Comprehensive Support Team An Jong-hyuk)

189
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:56,420
Start tomorrow
You won't be able to eat grandma's cooking for a while.

190
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,220
(Inheritance)

191
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,820
I said Haocai

192
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,740
I'll say a few more words...

193
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,650
Bro, I'll be back soon.

194
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,670
Are you scared?

195
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,050
No, I'm not afraid at all.

196
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,380
Are you well prepared?

197
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,010
Can send and receive signals

198
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:27,680
Oh and this

199
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,730
If things go wrong
You throw it hard on the ground

200
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,860
It will explode automatically

201
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,400
(Under maintenance, no entry)

202
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,490
Where did you get all this equipment?

203
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,410
You are a retired military member
Or a national intelligence agent or something?

204
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,370
The effect will last about two to three minutes.

205
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,370
If the interval is blown up

206
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,910
There is time to return to the car.

207
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,790
I've been confused.

208
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,630
Are you worried about me or are you trying to scare me?

209
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,800
I want to avoid pulling each other back.

210
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,530
Why do you want to keep your name secret?

211
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,120
Is your name embarrassing to say?

212
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,670
or

213
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,040
What secrets do you have that you can't tell?

214
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:42,050
ah

215
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,420
Ms. Yan Caiyan

216
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,050
Can you hear me?

217
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,430
Hello?

218
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,430
- Test signal test...
- Please focus.

219
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,270
Good Finish

220
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,530
(Unknown number)

221
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,660
He seems to be waiting for us.
Let's go to R2 area

222
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,010
Miss Yin Caiyan, are you following me?

223
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,520
Where are you now?

224
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,230
Ms. Yan Caiyan

225
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,590
What is happening?

226
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,760
Looks like we fell into his trap.

227
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,840
You get out of there quickly

228
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,140
immediately!

229
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,130
Miss Yin Caiyan, where are you? Are you okay?

230
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,930
I'm on my way, run!

231
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,040
Wait that...

232
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,960
Alas, Zhang Haocai is really fucking

233
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,330
This side

234
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,850
What the hell are those? Are they human?

235
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,480
Let's get out of here first

236
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,410
Now I'm on my own to deal with them

237
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:03,910
What do you mean?

238
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:06,460
If you're here, I won't be able to concentrate on fighting them.

239
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,370
What?

240
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,540
sorry

241
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,570
Who are you?

242
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,240
hello

243
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:23,870
Haocai

244
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,990
haven't seen you for a long time

245
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,410
No, not right.

246
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,870
We met a few days ago

247
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,750
That was the day I stabbed her.

248
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,640
Are you Yin Caiyan?

249
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,800
Reveal your origins first

250
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,770
Who are you guys?

251
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,150
You and the bastards who killed President Luo
Are they in the same group?

252
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,490
You bastard, look how scared you are

253
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:08,950
Just now a swarm of bees
Who are those guys rushing up?

254
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,320
I heard they performed surgery on you.

255
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,830
I'm here to confirm.

256
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,660
I want to see
Is it true that your memory has completely disappeared?

257
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,380
Yes or no

258
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,500
I really don't remember anything.

259
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,170
These damn guys

260
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,720
What he said doesn't count

261
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,350
What? It's really boring.

262
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:04,600
That's not going to work?

263
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,900
You try again

264
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,070
If you hit me again, you little brat

265
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:58,450
People who came here today

266
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,410
They'll all die.

267
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:08,540
don't want

268
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,960
Stop it you bastard!

269
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,300
Zhang Daizhu

270
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,860
don't want

271
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:42,790
Are you okay huh?

272
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,290
Zhang Daizhu

273
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:48,790
No, don't

274
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:50,460
Wake up

275
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,800
don't want!

276
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,300
You should start now

277
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,510
You have to wake up.

278
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,180
No, wake up.

279
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:11,690
Haocai, get in the car quickly!

280
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,710
- Catch up!
- never mind

281
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:36,920
No need to chase

282
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,640
Soon they will understand

283
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,470
What kind of existence did they save?

284
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,990
She's dead? I'm asking you, is she dead?

285
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:04,830
Oh, I'm really going crazy!

286
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,490
What is going on?

287
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,620
Brother, let's go to the hospital first.

288
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,250
- What? Hospital?
- Speed up!

289
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:11,210
- Hey, hurry up!
- Hospital? Wait.

290
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:16,550
What's going on?

291
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,340
What's going on?

292
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:20,470
How are you?

293
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:25,510
She probably hasn't yet
Fully recovered from the injury sustained two days ago

294
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,810
I need food

295
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:30,230
Plus I got the same injury today.
Causes severe bleeding

296
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:34,060
The accompanying symptoms of appetite and thirst
Absolutely unbearable.

297
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,530
I need food

298
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,910
You are bleeding badly. We need to stop the bleeding first.

299
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:50,040
Stop the car, stop the car for me!

300
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,040
- Stop the car!
- Hey, what are you doing?

301
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,420
- Stop the car!
- You are crazy!

302
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,500
- Let go!
- Don't do this!

303
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,070
elder brother

304
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,740
Bro, are you okay?

305
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:26,030
Brother, wake up

306
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:46,260
I need food

307
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,850
Need food

308
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,640
I need food

309
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,020
I need food

310
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:55,690
So dangerous

311
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:56,730
Ms. Yan Caiyan

312
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,150
I need food

313
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:04,900
- I need food
- Whatâ€™s wrong with you?

314
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:05,820
Don't follow me, get out of here!

315
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,200
sorry

316
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,250
Stay away from me

317
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,840
Stay away from me

318
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:22,960
Don't come over here

319
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,470
You have to go to the hospital first.

320
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,800
You'll really die if you keep going like this.

321
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:30,970
Until then!

322
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,230
Before that

323
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,860
I might kill you first.

324
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:45,070
I might attack you.
So please

325
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,830
Please go away quickly.

326
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:52,700
Please

327
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,920
I don't know why this happened.

328
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,170
But

329
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,510
I just remembered a name.

330
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,550
Ms. Yin Caiyu
