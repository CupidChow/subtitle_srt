1
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,790
Gyeong seong Creature S2

2
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,460
Say

3
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,630
Why do you still want to fight with them?

4
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,800
You know you can't beat them.

5
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,890
I don't fight them to win.

6
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,600
It's so they won't forget

7
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,520
I can't let them forget
What have they done to us?

8
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,360
Let them know that there are still people in this world who remember

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:00:59,940
What they do

10
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,450
I want them to feel sorry

11
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,280
If they don't have any apology

12
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,870
I want them to at least feel a little guilty.

13
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,210
If you don't even feel guilty

14
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,880
Then I want them to think I'm in the way and annoying.

15
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,510
I am inconvenienced because of me

16
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,050
Only in this way they won't forget

17
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,010
Can't you forgive them?

18
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,640
How can they be "forgiven" if they have no intention of apologizing?

19
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,850
They insisted they didn't do those things.

20
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,310
That's not the case at all

21
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,942
And I said to them, "I forgive you"
Isn’t this ridiculous?

22
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,069
But no matter what

23
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,114
That's all in the past, isn't it?

24
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,450
In that era, people were helpless.

25
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,080
That's right

26
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,330
The times

27
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,790
To survive
They may have made a choice that was beyond their control.

28
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,790
After all, we are all human beings

29
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,750
But

30
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,090
When you know you've made a mistake
Able to correct one's own mistakes

31
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,680
It's what people should do.

32
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,850
If there is no such effort

33
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,430
Wouldn't the world be uglier then?

34
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,650
How much do you trust me?

35
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,770
What's the difference between trust and distrust?

36
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,150
Trust is trust

37
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,950
In the Beginning

38
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,660
I wish I hadn't met Haocai

39
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,200
In this case

40
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,960
Even if I become a complete monster
I won't care either.

41
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,310
What are you doing?

42
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,440
I told you

43
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,070
I don't want to die

44
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,080
There was a time when Haocai
I was immersed in fantasy

45
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,470
I fantasize that maybe I can live like him

46
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,270
uprightly

47
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,770
Live like a human

48
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,690
But

49
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,780
This is not true

50
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,570
I'm a monster

51
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,910
I don't care about anything outside of myself

52
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,040
There's no guilt.

53
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,210
I won't blame myself

54
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,000
Will kill if threatened

55
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,580
When you feel bored, look for prey

56
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,670
When you are hungry, you hunt.

57
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,090
And all this

58
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,640
It's very exciting for me

59
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,980
I heard your mother is Mingzi

60
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,350
But you know

61
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,690
How did your mother die?

62
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,900
Know

63
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,880
So what?

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,670
It's all in the past, what can I do?

65
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,920
The person who raised me was Mrs. Maeda

66
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,140
The person who protected me was also Mrs. Maeda

67
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,680
Don't you feel like you're being taken advantage of?

68
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,270
If you are a good son, you should answer "yes"

69
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,320
So you didn't know?

70
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,660
I took advantage of that woman.

71
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,410
To survive

72
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,960
so

73
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,340
Please die in my hands.

74
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,760
Please take that woman Yin Caiyu away

75
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,840
Bring it here

76
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,510
For Haocai

77
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,390
The one who let that woman die

78
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,800
It must be Mr. Zhang

79
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,310
You'll die here.

80
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,440
Don't move!

81
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,400
Otherwise I'll shoot!

82
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,750
If Zhang the lender knew, he would be so disappointed.

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,840
You decided to become a monster.

84
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,430
Wait a minute, that guy...

85
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,520
Who are they?

86
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,190
Run away or you will die.

87
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,780
What are you doing?

88
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,750
- Hello!
- You try to run away as far as possible

89
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,670
hurry up

90
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,160
Who is it? Who sent you?

91
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,740
Even if you try your best, you can't win.

92
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,950
Then let's compete

93
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,130
See if I can win.

94
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,880
Mrs. Maeda

95
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,640
It will eventually kill everyone around you.

96
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,640
Mrs. Maeda wants

97
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,390
You end up being alone

98
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,900
What is my position?
It doesn't matter to me who wins.

99
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,700
I just hope this fight ends soon

100
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,370
To achieve this goal

101
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,870
Still, does this method work?

102
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:44,550
The Boundary between Symbiosis and Parasitism of Monsters in Beijing

103
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,560
Part 7
Drama title: Borderlander

104
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,900
Please spare my life, President

105
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,440
Please forgive our Haocai just once.

106
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,480
OK?

107
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,280
I'll keep him under control.

108
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:04,950
I will let him

109
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,870
Never appear in front of you again

110
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,080
I'll find a way to control him anyway.

111
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,920
Please forgive him this time.

112
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,340
You said this

113
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,920
Can you guarantee it with your life?

114
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,890
If you would spare his life

115
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:36,900
good

116
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,810
no problem

117
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,580
Haocai

118
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,470
Haocai

119
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,270
Haocai

120
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:19,190
Let's go home, okay?

121
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,610
Let's go home. Let's go home.

122
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,150
Okay? Let's go home.

123
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,550
I know. I'll be there right away.

124
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,850
No, you stay here.

125
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,060
- I can go alone
- ah?

126
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,350
Where are you going?

127
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,690
It is said that Quan Longji woke up and came to find me. I left.

128
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,080
(Detective Lu Zhixiu)

129
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,870
Hmm, how's Detective Lu doing?

130
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,880
Monitor

131
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,630
Monitor

132
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:30,970
Monitor!

133
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,060
What's up?

134
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,980
Mrs. Maeda seems to have figured out our plan.

135
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,920
welcome

136
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,840
I'm waiting for you.

137
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,110
I was wondering why it was so quiet along the way.

138
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,530
When an old friend returns, you still have to follow this etiquette

139
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,860
Are we still friends?

140
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,780
So much time has passed

141
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,410
A lot of things have changed

142
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,200
We still stand face to face

143
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,920
From this point of view, maybe

144
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,670
Maybe that's why

145
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,690
I've been forgotten by you

146
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,940
I didn't expect to feel such a sense of desolation.

147
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,660
If you knew in my memory
What kind of image are you?

148
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,990
You would definitely prefer that I don't remember it.

149
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,120
Compared to the endless emptiness

150
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,540
I'd rather have something to savor.

151
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,250
Painful memories

152
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,920
Your existence is no longer "pain" to me

153
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,720
But "ugly"

154
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,930
Do you still think

155
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:04,720
Are all human lives of equal value?

156
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,770
Don't you still think so?

157
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,390
What about Yin Caiyu's life?

158
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,110
Is her life included?

159
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,390
I've always been curious

160
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:50,060
What do you think
To what extent is the value of human life equal?

161
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,770
for example

162
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,440
Your friend in the hospital

163
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,200
We will move you to the general ward now.

164
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,740
What?

165
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,070
or

166
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,950
Your police friend?

167
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,130
And the kid number 71 you are looking for

168
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,220
Their lives combined
Weigh it against Yin Caiyu's life

169
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,970
If you are asked to save only one life

170
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,720
Which side will you choose?

171
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,140
Wouldn't you...

172
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,440
Maeda, you are...

173
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,720
Yin Caiyu is not down there

174
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,180
Later

175
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,810
We'll remove her nails in the sink room.

176
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,230
There should be two possible results

177
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:18,070
Or like you were a year ago
Losing all my memories, I became a completely different person

178
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,650
Or failed to escape from the sink

179
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:25,530
Drowned there

180
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,490
Please choose

181
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,040
Which side do you want to save first?

182
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,210
Choose Yin Caiyu?

183
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,600
Put her in

184
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,180
still

185
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,270
Choose your friends?

186
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:05,740
Please make a choice, Mr. Zhang

187
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,450
You don't have much time left

188
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,910
How far do you have to go before you give up?

189
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,910
I just want to prove

190
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,000
Is what you said true?

191
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,710
Is this topic feasible?

192
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,670
How about it?

193
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:27,380
Do you still feel
Are all human lives of equal value?

194
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,720
Do you still think that all people are equal?

195
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:04,920
Mr. Zhang

196
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,330
Monitor!

197
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,550
Oh, don't come down.

198
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,020
Don't don't come down!

199
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:46,900
don't want!

200
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,380
Hey are you crazy?

201
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,220
Hey, what are you doing here?

202
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,220
What do you want?

203
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,110
I've fought it once before.

204
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,090
Give up

205
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,720
You can't escape from here no matter how hard you struggle

206
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,220
Where is the lender Zhang?

207
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,640
Just tell me this

208
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,900
Is he still alive?

209
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,990
Although he is still alive
But you may have a hard time meeting him again.

210
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,160
Zhang Taisang chose to rescue

211
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,540
It's someone else, not you.

212
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,710
Because this decision

213
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:37,340
He will be torn to pieces there.

214
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,390
And you're going to die in this sink

215
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:51,480
If you want to win, you should be more simple.

216
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,280
You are too emotional.

217
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,400
Too many miscellaneous and trivial reasons

218
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,660
Everyone has different reasons for living.

219
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:11,130
People decide to die for different reasons.

220
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,210
Aren't you afraid of death?

221
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,730
The real horror is not death.

222
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,080
But ended up alone
The state of being unable to die even if you want to

223
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,010
What a pity for these eyes

224
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,640
I like it.

225
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,460
What is that?

226
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,630
What is that?

227
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,300
Just be quiet, damn it!

228
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,470
Haocai!

229
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,310
Hey Haocai!

230
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,600
Haocai, are you okay?

231
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,100
Damn it!

232
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:58,110
Don't wait

233
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,780
Wait go away!

234
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,530
Run away!

235
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,580
- Quick cut
- good

236
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,950
Longji

237
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,500
Oh damn.

238
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,830
Legs My Legs

239
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,500
- Damn
- Cut it off quickly.

240
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,750
There is also Zong He

241
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,210
We have to bring Jong Hyuk along.

242
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,380
We have to go quickly

243
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,510
Okay, hurry up.

244
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:32,810
Haocai!

245
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,100
There is an elevator at the back

246
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,690
Go faster!

247
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,020
Oh damn

248
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:49,700
Go away!

249
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,910
Let’s go faster!

250
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,830
How low should the temperature be lowered?

251
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,420
Reduce to 18 degrees

252
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,320
Stop

253
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,660
I know you're in pain now.

254
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,280
Nitrogen detected

255
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,820
Please evacuate

256
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,080
Nitrogen detected

257
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,040
Please evacuate

258
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,120
The elevator has arrived

259
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,090
Nitrogen detected

260
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,340
Haocai, come here quickly!

261
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,470
What the hell are you doing?

262
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,890
Wait a minute, Haocai!

263
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,490
How are you guys?

264
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,910
Haocai

265
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Haocai, are you okay?

266
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:48,960
I don't have time to talk too much now.

267
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,840
Go up one more floor and you will see a long corridor

268
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,210
You must go all the way to the end

269
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:56,260
Walk to the end of the corridor and go out from the iron door on the right.

270
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,800
You will see the passage leading to the outside.

271
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,930
Wait a moment

272
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,970
Hey, what about you?

273
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,810
Miss Yin Caiyu is still here

274
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,470
No, no

275
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,310
No, you little bastard!

276
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,940
Call the police if you go out.

277
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,480
Yeah, got it.

278
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,400
Wait a minute, kid.

279
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,860
Would you mind coming out with us now?
Come out with us.

280
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:19,110
You have to stay alive, little brat!

281
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,280
You guys go out first.

282
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,580
I took her out with me

283
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,320
how's it going?

284
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,820
Current water temperature in the tank

285
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:45,910
It's down to 20 degrees.

286
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,620
It will drop to 18 degrees in two or three minutes.

287
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,460
Her heart will stop.

288
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,210
Zhang Daizhu

289
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,970
I want to be with you

290
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,180
I have a word

291
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,890
I want to tell you

292
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,440
I have many more

293
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:19,730
Things I want to do with you

294
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:51,890
What is that?

295
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,520
Didn't the Na people fall asleep?

296
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,130
Why did you do this?

297
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:26,880
Are you really going to

298
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,600
Want to kill me?

299
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,640
I should have killed you long ago.

300
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,600
One year ago

301
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:42,320
At that time you didn't choose me but Mr. Zhang

302
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,450
Even for a moment

303
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,960
Do you treat me as your son?

304
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,460
People always become weak sometimes

305
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:05,880
What mother-child relationship?
Colleague friendship, patriotism, etc.

306
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,300
When people indulge in
And limit yourself to these trivial relationships

307
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,310
It will become useless

308
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,100
Poor existence

309
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:19,810
It's easy to become

310
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,820
A trivial consumable item that is used by others

311
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,110
I didn't do it this way.

312
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,910
Raise you up

313
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,070
In order to train you to be free from any constraints

314
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,990
Become a perfect being on your own

315
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,330
I push you and train you

316
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,340
But you have been searching for your mother's presence.

317
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,920
Always rely on Jang Tae Sang

318
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,760
I am so disappointed.

319
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:06,440
I did it wrong

320
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,120
You are disappointed

321
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,160
It means you still have some expectations of me.

322
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,290
knew

323
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,790
I will behave well in the future

324
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,050
I won't pursue anyone anymore.

325
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:29,170
Who are you looking forward to?

326
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,090
so

327
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,600
Please acknowledge me.

328
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,190
I'm no longer bound by you.

329
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:50,900
I will become perfection on my own

330
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,290
What a nice view

331
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,030
Her heart stopped beating

332
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,950
I want that guy.

333
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:54,560
Say

334
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:59,490
Are we going to have good times too?

335
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,030
Will welcome

336
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:16,210
I will definitely do it

337
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,160
What's wrong?

338
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,200
What will happen to me in the future?

339
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:51,700
after all

340
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,160
Three people died.

341
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,710
You have to pay for it first when you get out.

342
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,960
What about me

343
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:03,260
I will do my best to help you
Let the court consider your criminal law

344
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,050
So don't worry too much

345
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:09,720
hurry up

346
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:10,640
Eh!

347
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:14,390
Oh, what's going on?

348
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:16,560
- Are you okay?
- What's going on?

349
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:18,310
- I'm fine
- How badly are you injured?

350
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,230
Can you move around?

351
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,230
- It feels like my leg bone is broken
- What can I do?

352
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,490
First, launch an emergency search of Chuan Cheng Pharmaceutical

353
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,410
Detective Lu, please go and apply for a search warrant

354
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:28,910
- Yes, I know.
- Ouch, damn.

355
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:30,740
Are you okay?

356
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,500
Uh, are you the only two who escaped?

357
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:43,840
What did you say?

358
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:45,800
I asked, are you two the only ones who escaped?

359
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,220
Yeah, just the two of us.

360
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:54,220
Oh, good.

361
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,150
Shield door about to open

362
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:56,410
(Chengdu Pharmaceuticals was raided)

363
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,580
(Prosecutors searched for illegal live experiments
Summon the president for investigation)

364
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:00,620
(Reports on illegal live experiments continue)

365
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:02,080
(The prosecutor summoned the president for investigation)

366
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:03,790
(It is unclear whether there is a living laboratory)

367
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:15,220
Mmm delicious

368
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,210
Come out to eat quickly. Be careful not to be late.

369
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:30,550
OK

370
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:33,300
Here it comes

371
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:39,100
Will school be over late today too?

372
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:40,970
Well

373
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:44,690
The club is holding a charity sale today
After that, there is a dinner party.

374
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,770
It will probably be late, right?

375
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:50,610
tasty

376
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:51,940
- Is it delicious?
- Um

377
00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:00,540
Don't you have a boyfriend yet?

378
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:03,750
Boy friend?

379
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:08,460
That

380
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:12,840
It will happen naturally when the time comes, right?

381
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:19,640
Come and have some meat

382
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:25,810
Mmm delicious

383
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:30,230
Today's makeup is so beautiful

384
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,320
Today at the charity sale...

385
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:35,860
Oh, the clothes are very beautiful.

386
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:41,540
I sometimes dream

387
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:51,460
I dreamed that I was following someone's back

388
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:54,920
I obviously don't know who that is.

389
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,590
I can't remember anyone like this.

390
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:03,350
But this dream always makes me feel
My heart aches dully

391
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:07,310
Spring is about to pass

392
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,190
Summer is coming again

393
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:48,450
And then we'll be reborn, right?

394
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,880
(The crew of "Beijing Monster" misses
Our colleagues Kim Hyun-jung and Oh Hyo-jung)

395
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:30,910
Please continue
