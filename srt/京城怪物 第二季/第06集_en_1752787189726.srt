1
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,710
Gyeong seong Creature S2

2
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,830
I was a special kid when I was little.

3
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,280
Killing is okay

4
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,830
But it was discovered

5
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,040
It is not allowed

6
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,210
Why?

7
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,680
If you are a good son, you should answer "yes"

8
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,970
It's rude to ask "why?"

9
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,220
Katsuaki

10
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,900
It's the mother

11
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,160
I want my mother's approval.

12
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,720
Even just once

13
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,980
I want to feel comforted

14
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,960
Although it is not yet clear
Why is it that only child has tentacles?

15
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,790
But I have a guess in my mind

16
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,130
What kind of guess?

17
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,220
Different from other experimental subjects

18
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,930
Sheng Zhao inherited the Na people's

19
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,940
Are you a narrator?

20
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,980
The first person in the mother's womb
A lot of learning has been done

21
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,028
Then it entered the child's body

22
00:03:57,111 --> 00:04:01,866
This makes the synchronization phenomenon more active

23
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:05,578
Just like

24
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:15,421
Xingqin to protect his daughter
It's like my body suddenly activated

25
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,220
In that child's mind

26
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:16,600
Does Akiko's motherhood also exist?

27
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,890
Maybe

28
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,520
interesting

29
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,660
I knew then

30
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,790
I'm not something special.

31
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,420
I just

32
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,420
Just a special experimental subject

33
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,670
Have you met Mr. Zhang?

34
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:50,970
yes

35
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,590
Meet

36
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,060
I'll leave the next plan up to you.

37
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,350
Katsuaki

38
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,190
Did you get some sleep?

39
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,360
How is your injury?

40
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,700
how?

41
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,660
Is it still painful?

42
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,620
If this is a dream

43
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,380
I really hope I never wake up

44
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,240
I miss you so much

45
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,700
No matter how many times I say "I miss you"

46
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,620
Can't fill my thoughts

47
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,340
I miss you so much

48
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,160
How's No. 71?

49
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,070
Not found yet

50
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,170
You did it, didn't you?

51
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,960
What on earth are you thinking about?

52
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:00,880
Set him free

53
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,640
free

54
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,980
That's not freedom
That's chaos, make no mistake.

55
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:10,810
No matter what

56
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,190
At least it should be more fun than you think.

57
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,230
What do you mean?

58
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,780
I know all

59
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,950
I know what you want to do

60
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,310
Very hungry

61
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,550
Oh, how much did you drink tonight?

62
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,840
I haven't sobered up yet.

63
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,050
Hello sir

64
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:28,850
Very hungry

65
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,360
Something happened

66
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,380
The Border between Life and Death of Beijing Monster

67
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,380
Part 6
Drama title: Bait

68
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,690
It was you who ordered the arrest of President Zhang?

69
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:20,190
So what is it that I call people...

70
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:24,030
Aren't you the person in charge of this case?
Wasn't that what you did?

71
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,110
Tell me what I should do.

72
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,320
Murders happened one after another

73
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,990
At every crime scene

74
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,870
Zhang Haocai left behind a lot of physical evidence

75
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,990
Start with your grandfather

76
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,500
Three generations of your family
Always receiving favors from the lender Jin Yu Tang

77
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:39,420
How dare you list President Zhang as a wanted criminal?

78
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:45,050
Don't arrest innocent people.
Pretending to bring justice to society

79
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,220
Please look for our Zonghe.

80
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:50,930
What?

81
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,020
Our Zonghe is missing.

82
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:56,770
What's going on?

83
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,560
He went to the company for training

84
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:04,280
Then he sent me 10 million won out of the blue.
Then there was no news.

85
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,940
I called their company.

86
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,490
They said there was no such training.

87
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,320
Which company?

88
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:12,870
Heritage Pharmaceuticals

89
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,040
(Sung Jun-mo is 41 years old
Researcher at Heritage Biotech)

90
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,170
(Wu Qixun is 29 years old
Heritage Biotechnology Security)

91
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:24,300
(An Zonghe
Joined the Comprehensive Support Team of Seunghwa Pharmaceutical for one month)

92
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,710
(Jongno-gu serial murder case
ruptured eyeballs and hollowed-out brains)

93
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,720
So it's all about...

94
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,100
Is it related to Heritage Biotechnology?

95
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:37,520
- Do you want me to check it out?
- Oops, I was shocked.

96
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,810
Please make some noise when you come in.

97
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:43,110
You met that grandmother yesterday
Is nothing wrong?

98
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,570
What is your relationship like?

99
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,990
It seems like she has a close relationship with Zhang Haocai

100
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,200
Detective Park, let's have dinner.

101
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,160
Would you like some takeout of Grandma's soup and rice?

102
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,040
- What do you want to eat?
- Honestly

103
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,580
I felt something was wrong from the beginning

104
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:04,040
Even if Zhang Hao is a capable person

105
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,760
But not to the extent
Just ask him to find clues about the suspect.

106
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,340
You asked me to supervise him.

107
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,930
In addition, you
Staying up all night to guard the door of the intensive care unit

108
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:14,930
Aren’t you hungry?

109
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,220
You have known each other for a long time, right?

110
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,520
We ordered takeout first.

111
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:21,850
Huh?

112
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,150
Hello, I'm Lv Mingjun from the Second Squad of the Serious Crime Unit

113
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,570
What?

114
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,530
That monitor

115
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,790
The escalator area of a subway station in Seoul
A random killing occurred

116
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,910
Three people died at the scene

117
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,290
One person is in critical condition

118
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,250
Now rushed to the emergency room

119
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,130
Yesterday morning at five o'clock

120
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,420
The Fire Safety Center received an alarm call
Someone is hallucinating...

121
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,220
According to the police

122
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,810
- Suspect A...
- Zong...

123
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,180
Random attack

124
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:02,690
B, a platform worker in his 50s

125
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:03,730
I know that kid.

126
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,110
This led to Seoul Railway Company employees and...

127
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,320
He is in the basement of Heritage Pharmaceuticals
They were experimented on

128
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,650
A female cleaner in her forties...

129
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,570
Is it true?

130
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,490
Um

131
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,570
He escaped from there this morning.

132
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:16,280
There are also men in their forties
He was taken to the emergency room...

133
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:17,200
I did it

134
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,410
After the incident...

135
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,080
I let him out.

136
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,290
Police arrived at the scene
Arrest him immediately as a criminal...

137
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,120
What on earth do you think?

138
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,210
The fact of ...

139
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,710
According to frontline reporters...

140
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,630
I want people to see

141
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,300
Modus operandi
With the recent Jongno serial murders...

142
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,050
If you can't see it with your own eyes
People nowadays don't believe anything.

143
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,850
I have less and less faith.

144
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,930
Three more people died.

145
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,180
There's a chance more people will die.

146
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,270
Did you know?

147
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,270
What does that mean?

148
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,860
Please explain clearly

149
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,440
Why are more people dying?

150
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,610
I don't know the details.

151
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,740
I just know

152
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,450
Mrs. Maeda seems to be planning something dangerous.

153
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,750
(The suspect is a male in his twenties
Randomly attacked a fifty-something station attendant)

154
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,170
(Citizens on their way to work are terrified
six casualties)

155
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,080
How dangerous is it?

156
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,750
You know that woman better.

157
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,590
Whatever she does, she will do it perfectly.

158
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,510
It should be like this

159
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,800
The current situation
Is that part of the plan as well?

160
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,270
Using him as bait to catch both of us?

161
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,020
I see you really don't like me, don't you?

162
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,270
I don't trust you.

163
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,560
Who took you out of that place?

164
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,480
I know it very well.
Who stabbed me, kidnapped me?

165
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,800
Oh, don't even mention how strong he is.

166
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,810
Ten people rushed forward but were thrown out.

167
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,180
It's just a bull.

168
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:08,480
What else can we do?
I had to stun him with a stun gun.

169
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,100
Then he fell

170
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,820
Look at him. Look at him.

171
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,820
Then is it still called people?

172
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:16,570
Zonghe

173
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,950
Look at me, An Zonghe

174
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,120
What's wrong with you? Huh?

175
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,000
- Ah, what's going on!
- Monitor

176
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,750
Are you okay?

177
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,380
I'll get you some emergency medicine first.

178
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,260
Do you know him?

179
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,090
(Fuqiang Trading Company)

180
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,430
Hello?

181
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,480
It's me, squad leader Lu

182
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Hey, how are you?

183
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,400
I'm still alive, don't worry.

184
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,690
Are you using this number again?

185
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,740
Well

186
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,240
I'm back again

187
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,530
Uh okay

188
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,240
Can you explain to me the current situation?

189
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,370
It's Jong Hyuk

190
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,370
Crescent Cave Antenna Grandma and her grandson

191
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,380
He is a criminal

192
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,170
The company he just joined is...

193
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,090
Um

194
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,010
Heritage Pharmaceuticals

195
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,180
You're a piece of trash

196
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,810
They didn't even manage the experimental subjects properly.

197
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,020
Haven't you seen that the news is all over the place right now?

198
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,530
It seems that Sheng Zhao did it.

199
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,950
Why did he do that?

200
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,490
Should I ask Mrs. Maeda?

201
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,040
You mean
Was this all Mrs. Maeda's plan?

202
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,880
Didn't I tell you?

203
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,350
When she wanted to turn him back into Jang Tae Sang

204
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:12,770
I told you I didn't like this plan.

205
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,190
Although it is impossible to guess

206
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,440
What was Mrs. Maeda thinking when she gave such instructions?

207
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,030
But this is clearly the one who asked us to inherit the pharmaceutical industry.
Do you know that this is a dangerous move?

208
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,370
Yes, the former chairman
Implant a Nazi in my brain

209
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,950
So that I can keep the legacy

210
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,210
It is right to contribute wholeheartedly to the realization of great achievements

211
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,590
What if this incident threatens the peace of the inheritance?

212
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,390
Then I will
Ruthlessly eliminate the risk factor

213
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:51,140
Regardless of the risk factor
Is it Jang Tae-sang or your incompetence?

214
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,690
Or maybe it was Mrs. Maeda's arbitrary behavior.

215
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,780
Don't forget

216
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,740
first

217
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,030
You go clean up this mess first.

218
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,410
First, capture No. 71.

219
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,370
Then we'll talk to Mrs. Maeda.

220
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,170
Is this okay?

221
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,760
What are you doing?

222
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,720
You're not going alone, are you?

223
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:11,970
I want to go alone

224
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,430
What are you going to do as a wounded person?

225
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,770
Your body hasn't recovered yet.

226
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,820
Did you see it?

227
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,940
Can we go together at this level?

228
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,700
- Still no
- Zhang Daizhu

229
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,200
What about me

230
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,240
I don't want to see Miss Yin Caiyu get hurt again.

231
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,040
I don't want to see you in danger.

232
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,960
I don't want to put you in danger.
Then regret it later

233
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,290
I don't want to tolerate this anymore

234
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,510
It's the 21st century now

235
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:52,260
I guess you won't say anything.
You want to protect me or something cliche?

236
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,680
That's right

237
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,730
Don't look at my appearance.
I am a man over a hundred years old.

238
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:02,230
My thinking is pretty old-fashioned.

239
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:05,770
I still believe that men have to protect women

240
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,820
I want to fight or am I better than you?

241
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,200
Well, that won't work either.

242
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,700
Besides

243
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:18,370
I won't die either.

244
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:21,750
What about me

245
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,710
Rather than being the woman you protect

246
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:30,590
I would rather be the woman who is inseparable from you

247
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,430
so

248
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,180
Let's stay together, Mr. Zhang

249
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,810
Um?

250
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,830
How can I refuse you when you smile at me like this?

251
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,250
you

252
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,210
Give me another smile

253
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,110
Um

254
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,650
Where? Who are you talking about?

255
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,410
They are from the company that produces traditional pharmaceuticals.

256
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,290
Are you crazy? Where are you going?

257
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,210
Go find that kid

258
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,050
I said, what are you doing there?

259
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,050
I know that kid.

260
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,050
What's wrong with knowing each other?

261
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,010
He has been arrested by the police, what can you do?

262
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,680
The inheritance will not give up

263
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,350
They'll find a way to deal with him.

264
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,560
There should be only two possibilities, right?

265
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,560
Either capture him or kill him.

266
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,190
Before he encountered this accident
We have to do everything we can.

267
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,230
It's been like this all my life

268
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,860
Aren't you bored?

269
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,780
Fight with that gang and be defeated
Even through the gates of hell

270
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,120
But do you still have the patience to fight them?

271
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,250
How can people live like this?

272
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,420
Is it time to stop all this now?

273
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,420
- Sheng Zhao
- You might as well just run away.

274
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,630
You go anywhere with that woman.

275
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,050
Then just live your own life, ok?

276
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,090
I also thought about my own life

277
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:41,600
Live a happy life with her

278
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,180
But this is not achieved by running away

279
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,350
A life bought by running away

280
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,150
The non-existent Sheng Zhao

281
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:01,990
- Who are you?
- It's me, No Ji-su

282
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,500
Now a large group of people from Heritage Pharmaceuticals have come

283
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,960
They said they were going to take the prisoner away.

284
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,040
What does that mean?

285
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:15,090
You guys came to visit me so suddenly?
You want to take the prisoner away?

286
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,630
That person is infected

287
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,550
- Infect?
- I heard that the Second Division of the Major Crime Unit of the Jongno Police Station

288
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,800
Called our company

289
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,850
And asked about this nitrogen issue

290
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:24,760
Yes

291
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,350
We still haven't heard any response

292
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:31,020
This is for uniforms
Portable nitrogen bombs made for violent infected people

293
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,480
It was developed by our pharmaceutical company

294
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,440
Infected people are generally very aggressive

295
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:40,110
The Department of Disease Control has issued an official letter

296
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,240
The leadership of the National Police Agency has unanimously agreed.

297
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,580
Hand over the infected first.

298
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,410
What do you regard the investigative agency as?

299
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
It happened within the last two months.
Suspect in six serial murders

300
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,460
Today
Three people died at the same place.

301
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:01,890
With a piece of torn paper
You're going to take away a violent criminal like that?

302
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,570
Compared to investigating cases

303
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:18,030
What matters most at this moment is the safety and lives of the citizens.

304
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,860
If the infectious disease spreads, things will get out of control.

305
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,490
Police Inspector Lu Mingjun, will you be in charge when the time comes?

306
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,500
They moved faster than we expected.

307
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,920
We're too late anyway, right?

308
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,750
The police station with jurisdiction over the case
It's less than ten minutes away. There's still time.

309
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,260
So what if I have time?

310
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,800
What can you do when you go there?

311
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,510
You know there's one thing I'm good at.

312
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,430
make trouble

313
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,180
I'm ready, let's go.

314
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:50,850
I'll go with you

315
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,270
I said I'd go too.

316
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,130
Are you driving too fast?

317
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,130
Speed 50 mph. Didn't you see the sign?

318
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,050
Saw it

319
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,760
But I didn't follow the rules

320
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:28,810
Have you confirmed it?

321
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,730
Yes, the CDC says these are all facts.

322
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:37,810
There are several
There are also cases of infected people with similar symptoms.

323
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,730
Because it is an important case

324
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,650
These are all considered confidential

325
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:45,820
We also confirmed
Heritage Pharmaceuticals is studying the cause of infection

326
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,660
Hey Captain

327
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,330
They blocked the camera.

328
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,290
Oh shit

329
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,630
Do I need to release the nitrogen first?

330
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,630
It's too troublesome. Just open it.

331
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,960
(Heritage Biotech)

332
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,940
(Hello, Jongno Police Station)

333
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,960
(Heritage Biotech)

334
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,880
(Lv Mingjun, squad leader of the Second Serious Crime Squad)

335
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,220
Yes Captain

336
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,550
Um where are you?

337
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,270
Hello, where are you?

338
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,020
I am following Heritage Biotech

339
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,060
- What?
- Feel sorry

340
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,650
I know the criminal was caught at the crime scene.

341
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,980
I know this case can be closed like this.

342
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,240
But I always feel something is wrong

343
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,650
I know you think I'm unreliable.

344
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,030
This time I want to act on my instincts.

345
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,450
sorry

346
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,700
You can finally help.

347
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,620
Don't lose it

348
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,380
Keep reporting to me after a while.

349
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,380
I have to find out something no matter what.

350
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,710
That's it.

351
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:14,160
I heard that our Zong He came here?

352
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:17,700
Can you let me meet him?

353
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:20,200
It's that

354
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,250
Not now

355
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,790
No, our Zonghe won't do that.

356
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,040
Our Zonghe is not that kind of child

357
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,420
Squad Leader Lu, you know

358
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,550
Yes, that one...

359
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,650
There was a motorcycle and two cars following behind.

360
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,440
Step on the gas

361
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:02,790
Well?

362
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:27,940
you

363
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,860
How much do you like my brother?

364
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,660
Why should I tell you?

365
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:39,780
Because I like him too

366
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,870
I also know
The story behind his ill-fated relationship with Mrs. Maeda

367
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,750
Also know

368
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:51,380
The reason why he hates Heritage Pharmaceuticals

369
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,340
So a year ago

370
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,380
When he said he wanted to raze the lab

371
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,850
I didn't hesitate for a second.

372
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,930
Just say I want to stand on Haocai's side

373
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:10,940
I was

374
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:16,530
I really feel like I could die for him.

375
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,570
But

376
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,160
Actually, it's not like that

377
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:31,420
One year ago

378
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,470
Actually, I didn't miss the scene.

379
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,550
Say it again

380
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,770
You said you could die for Mr. Zhang?

381
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,690
Did you just say that?

382
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,530
He was the first person to recognize me.

383
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:57,650
He said that I was originally

384
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,360
It's already good

385
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,780
He made me understand

386
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:05,740
I am a human being

387
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,790
So I felt for the first time

388
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,840
Life is not painful

389
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,800
I also

390
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,590
I recognize you.

391
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:24,050
Although you were born of a lowly prostitute
But I recognize you as my son

392
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:28,220
Even though everyone opposes
I insisted on adding you to my account

393
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:30,980
But you actually

394
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,400
Betray me?

395
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:36,400
Sorry, Mom.

396
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,740
Please let me go

397
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,370
Lift your head

398
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:52,670
Lift your head

399
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,080
hurry up

400
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,640
Within 24 hours from now

401
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,220
The Na people will enter a deep sleep state

402
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:18,690
No matter what happens
No one will protect you.

403
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,990
If you get stabbed, the wound will bleed naturally.

404
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:28,120
If you get shot, the bullet will go through your body and kill you.

405
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:32,370
You lose your ability to recover

406
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:37,000
No longer able to regenerate

407
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,480
If you want to go, go ahead.

408
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,520
I hope you understand after you leave.

409
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,530
How fragile and tormented the human body is

410
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,490
I hope you understand
Human kindness and justice in the face of death

411
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,620
How pale and powerless

412
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,040
You choose

413
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,170
I'll keep the door open for you

414
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,300
Actually, one year ago

415
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,840
I'm also there

416
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,050
But

417
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,930
I can't help my brother.

418
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:19,900
Because I'm afraid

419
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,070
I am afraid of death

420
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,700
You don't have to

421
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,200
Sorry for being scared

422
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:38,250
Some people are afraid of death

423
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:46,170
Some people are afraid to live

424
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,970
Everyone has different feelings of fear.

425
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:03,940
Let's talk about that matter

426
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,230
The lender never pursued the matter.

427
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,860
This means he understands your feelings.

428
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,330
So don't feel sorry.

429
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,540
Within 24 hours from now

430
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,580
The person will enter a sleeping state

431
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,040
Start now

432
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,040
Whether it's being stabbed

433
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,130
Still shot

434
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,430
You will all die

435
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:16,100
Why exactly?

436
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,510
I told you

437
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:21,810
I was scared

438
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,690
I'm afraid I'll die

439
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,360
I met you again.

440
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,360
yes

441
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:12,440
Haven't seen you for a year?

442
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:15,150
You're such a difficult guy.

443
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:19,080
I don't have any advantages except tenacity.

444
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,700
You finally met the woman you love again

445
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:25,160
How nice it is to be with her
Why appear here again?

446
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,080
don’t worry

447
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:29,710
I'll go back after I finish my work here.

448
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:32,590
Do you still believe in Sheng Zhao?

449
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,490
Um

450
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:02,870
believe

451
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,120
That woman is a pity.

452
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,590
You worry about yourself.

453
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:30,440
It is said that Zhang Taisang has been lured away
And Seung So and Yoon Chae Ok are together

454
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:08,270
elder brother

455
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,580
Say

456
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,620
After I had the surgery

457
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:31,370
Can I continue playing the cello?

458
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,370
Of course.

459
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:36,670
You will play better than before the accident.

460
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,880
When can I have a transplant?

461
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,510
We are choosing the most suitable match for you.

462
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,390
After three to six months

463
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,980
You will learn most of the principles

464
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:53,060
If you do a transplant at this time
It won't have much impact on the body

465
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,190
Definitely better than when they were larvae
Is there a higher chance of success?

466
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:58,650
After transplanting the adults

467
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,320
There have been no deaths so far.

468
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,120
Then choose this one

469
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,210
Three months later, the transplant was performed

470
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,460
You wait three more months

471
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,010
Then you can walk again.

472
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:21,970
Eat now

473
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:31,240
