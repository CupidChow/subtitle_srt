5
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,056
I need food

I need food

7
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,359
I need food

8
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,527
I need food

9
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,049
This is dangerous

10
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,580

Would you like something to drink?

20
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,984
Would you like coffee? Or any other drink?

21
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:02,779
Let's talk business first

22
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,992
Before that, let's exchange names.

23
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:13,373
I told you my name before
What is your name?

24
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,584
I don't have a name

25
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:20,129
You didn't even tell me your name
How do we start this? Is this still considered a team-up?

26
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:21,589
Because we are teammates

27
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,133
This unnecessary form should be avoided.

28
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:29,889
How is your injury?

29
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,309
Are you okay?

30
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:36,896
That day

31
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:38,940
You are seriously injured.

32
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,780
Let's just follow two rules.

33
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,825
First, don't ask personal questions

34
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,953
Second, you do as I say.

35
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,125
Neither want to tell me my name nor let me say hello

36
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,043
Isn't this too stereotyped between teammates?

37
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,629
I'm calling President Luo's cell phone now.

38
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,423
Isn't President Luo dead?

39
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,092
The guy who killed President Luo had her phone

40
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,803
The last person to initiate the commission

41
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:10,888
This guy too

42
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,310
What did he commission?

43
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:32,827
Who do you think he looks like?

44
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,566
What are you doing?

45
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,361
Who allowed you to move around freely during the confinement period?

46
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,279
What

47
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,782
Are you going to lock me up?
Can't you just watch me become a vegetable?

48
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:15,953
If you do this, you can control it.
I'd rather do it if you're the uncertainty factor

49
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,708
What are you afraid of?

50
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,964
You try so hard to suppress me and control me

51
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:30,635
Isn't it because of fear?

52
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:32,595
You're afraid I'll threaten you

53
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,265
Is this also the reason why Haocai had surgery?

54
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,476
I think he's in the way.

55
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,188
I'm afraid he'll hold me back.

56
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:47,985
Feeling annoyed

57
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:49,862
that's all

58
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,159
Do you think you can control us by doing this?

59
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:59,830
At least I know how to control the Nazi in your brain

60
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,086
Go back to your room now.

61
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,967
I actually saw someone like him outside.

62
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,395
(Yin Caiyan)

63
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,312
It's her

64
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:29,902
Hello?

65
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,487
I heard you were looking for me?

66
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,532
Do you know me?

67
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,242
How did you meet?

68
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,869
Are you with that woman?

69
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,165
Oh my god

70
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,294
He was beaten like that but he's still alive

71
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,546
She is indeed the same

72
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,424
What are you talking about?

73
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,718
You can't possibly not know?

74
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,387
I really don't know
So please make it clear.

75
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:57,888
What does it mean exactly?

76
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:00,933
I'm asking you

77
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:19,869
who?

78
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:21,495
Haocai

79
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,041
He was with that woman.

80
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,044
What should we do? Call again?

81
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,047
Let's wait and see

82
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:33,966
Say

83
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,511
What did that guy just say about "the same kind"?

84
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,764
What does that mean? Do you know anything?

85
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:43,768
you

86
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:45,811
It turns out that he is the same as me.

87
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,397
have no idea

88
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,198
(President Luo, see you tonight)

89
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,115
It's that guy

90
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,326
He wants to meet

91
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,336
(You decide the location)

92
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,217
OK

93
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,302
There's nothing to do with you now.

94
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,512
What's wrong with me?

95
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,263
I can go alone.

96
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:22,807
Are you kidding me?

97
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,519
I'll help you meet him.
You're saying I have nothing to do with you now?

98
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,021
I was the one the police accused of being a suspect.

99
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,357
I'm also the person that guy wants to see

100
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,276
There are a few things that people must avoid in their lifetime.

101
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,281
If you get involved with that guy
Life will fall into hell in just a moment

102
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,743
Nothing can be undone by then.

103
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,956
There's no going back.

104
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,670
Maybe I'll have to live a nightmare life forever.

105
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,590
Are you trying to scare me or are you worried about me?

106
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,175
I'm sincerely advising you.

107
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,221
You're no match for that guy.

108
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,764
Then let's call the police.

109
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,851
My goal is to catch that guy.
Rather than making things bigger

110
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,938
If we rashly call the police
So what happened to that guy who was hiding?

111
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,650
There really won't be anything we can do then.

112
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,485
That guy is looking for me.

113
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,905
It's me, not you, that he wants to see.

114
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,783
You shouldn't understand
The difference between recklessness and courage, right?

115
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,869
Someone wants to die alone

116
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,996
I can't just stand by and watch.

117
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:30,916
You said you wanted to join forces

118
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,043
Then we have to go together.

119
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,008
So are they meeting?

120
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:43,012
Yes, they seem to be today
We need to meet the suspect who has President Luo's cell phone.

121
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,181
- Tell me the time and place
- I haven't figured this out yet.

122
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,349
So I'm going to follow them.

123
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,310
I'll apply for support first.

124
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,395
If they start, follow them immediately.

125
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,230
I said, what do you want?

126
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,649
Who did you say you were going to meet?

127
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,067
The murderer who killed the president of Nightingale Bar

128
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,237
It is said that the hotel murder may also be done by that guy

129
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,199
Hey, you have to call the police first.
What are you going there for?

130
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,158
If you call the police

131
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,243
If he is discovered by that guy, he will hide even more.

132
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,453
There really won't be anything we can do by then.

133
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,914
- Who said that?
- That woman said

134
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,584
Hey, you believe whatever she says?
How many times have you met her?

135
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,085
I can't remember, maybe twice.

136
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,338
Hello

137
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,840
Do you know what that woman's name is?

138
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,259
- Yin Caiyan?
- What does she do?

139
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,636
She helps find missing people.

140
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,971
Take a look, huh?

141
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,808
There is no clear one from beginning to end
Nothing is certain, everything is vague

142
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,435
You don't pay attention and want to follow her blindly?

143
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,436
Aren't you Zhang Haocai?

144
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:34,480
That is to say

145
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,107
It's strange that I believe everything she says.

146
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,025
Wow

147
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,611
You kid
You said you don't look at the face when choosing a girl.

148
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,071
Hey, wake up, kid!

149
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,573
What if she's an accomplice?

150
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,117
What if she teamed up with the murderer to frame you?

151
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,745
Her best friend was murdered.

152
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,747
Brother, please change your perspective.

153
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,707
If I was murdered

154
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,334
Then you won't be mad?

155
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,670
Why are you trying to match us up?

156
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,421
It's really unlucky

157
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,549
Tell me, will you go crazy?

158
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,925
Of course I'll be mad, boy!

159
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,927
Then would you look for the criminal with blazing eyes?

160
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,387
Of course I will look for you, little brat!

161
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,805
Will you cover us later?

162
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:08,848
Of course I have to cover.

163
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:09,765
Thank you bro

164
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,811
Damn it, I'm going crazy! Oh my god!

165
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,188
It's cold outside

166
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,442
etc.

167
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:22,570
Actually three times

168
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,322
I've seen you three times.

169
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,722
Zonghe is coming?

170
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,599
Grandma, I'm back.

171
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,895
Ouch, are you exhausted?

172
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,063
- No
- Thanks for your hard work

173
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,414
- Go wash your hands. Let's eat first.
- OK

174
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,126
The new employee training will start tomorrow, right?

175
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,211
Well, I will start training tomorrow for a month.

176
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,714
What kind of training lasts for a month?

177
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,008
They said that all new employees need to undergo a month of training.

178
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,303
Grandma, what is this?

179
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,013
ah?

180
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:36,143
You're still asking? This is a new suit.

181
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,395
Grandma received the bonus

182
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,272
Really? Was it given by President Luo?

183
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,775
It was not given by the lender Zhang.

184
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,194
who?

185
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,530
You don't know me, come sit down and eat.

186
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,448
good

187
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,251
Wow, you prepared so much food?

188
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,628
(Comprehensive Support Team An Jong-hyuk)

189
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:06,423
Start tomorrow
You won't be able to eat grandma's cooking for a while.

190
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,217
(Inheritance)

191
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:06,817
I said Haocai

192
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,737
I'll say a few more words...

193
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,654
Bro, I'll be back soon.

194
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:22,666
Are you scared?

195
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,045
No, I'm not afraid at all.

196
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,384
Are you well prepared?

197
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,011
Can send and receive signals

198
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,681
Oh and this

199
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,728
If things go wrong
You throw it hard on the ground

200
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:44,855
It will explode automatically

201
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,398
(Under maintenance, no entry)

202
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,485
Where did you get all this equipment?

203
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:54,406
You are a retired military member
Or a national intelligence agent or something?

204
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,367
The effect will last about two to three minutes.

205
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,369
If the interval is blown up

206
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,914
There is time to return to the car.

207
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:04,792
I've been confused.

208
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,628
Are you worried about me or are you trying to scare me?

209
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,798
I want to avoid pulling each other back.

210
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,534
Why do you want to keep your name secret?

211
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:42,121
Is your name embarrassing to say?

212
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,665
or

213
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,042
What secrets do you have that you can't tell?

214
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,047
ah

215
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:53,423
Ms. Yan Caiyan

216
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,051
Can you hear me?

217
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:57,427
Hello?

218
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,429
- Test signal test...
- Please focus.

219
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,270
Good Finish

220
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,531
(Unknown number)

221
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,661
He seems to be waiting for us.
Let's go to R2 area

222
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,012
Miss Yin Caiyan, are you following me?

223
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,515
Where are you now?

224
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,226
Ms. Yan Caiyan

225
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,585
What is happening?

226
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,756
Looks like we fell into his trap.

227
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,842
You get out of there quickly

228
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,137
immediately!

229
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,131
Miss Yin Caiyan, where are you? Are you okay?

230
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,927
I'm on my way, run!

231
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,038
Wait that...

232
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,958
Alas, Zhang Haocai is really fucking

233
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,334
This side

234
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,850
What the hell are those? Are they human?

235
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,476
Let's get out of here first

236
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,408
Now I'm on my own to deal with them

237
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:13,910
What do you mean?

238
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,455
If you're here, I won't be able to concentrate on fighting them.

239
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,372
What?

240
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,544
sorry

241
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,569
Who are you?

242
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,238
hello

243
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:33,865
Haocai

244
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,993
haven't seen you for a long time

245
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:38,411
No, not right.

246
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:40,872
We met a few days ago

247
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,751
That was the day I stabbed her.

248
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,635
Are you Yin Caiyan?

249
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,803
Reveal your origins first

250
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,765
Who are you guys?

251
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,145
You and the bastards who killed President Luo
Are they in the same group?

252
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,485
You bastard, look how scared you are

253
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,947
Just now a swarm of bees
Who are those guys rushing up?

254
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,323
I heard they performed surgery on you.

255
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:23,827
I'm here to confirm.

256
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,664
I want to see
Is it true that your memory has completely disappeared?

257
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,375
Yes or no

258
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:32,502
I really don't remember anything.

259
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,173
These damn guys

260
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:20,717
What he said doesn't count

261
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,352
What? It's really boring.

262
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,604
That's not going to work?

263
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:18,900
You try again

264
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:24,072
If you hit me again, you little brat

265
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,449
People who came here today

266
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,411
They'll all die.

267
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,543
don't want

268
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,962
Stop it you bastard!

269
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,297
Zhang Daizhu

270
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:40,857
don't want

271
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:52,785
Are you okay huh?

272
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,289
Zhang Daizhu

273
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:58,791
No, don't

274
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:00,460
Wake up

275
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:02,795
don't want!

276
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,297
You should start now

277
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,507
You have to wake up.

278
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,178
No, wake up.

279
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,689
Haocai, get in the car quickly!

280
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,711
- Catch up!
- never mind

281
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:46,923
No need to chase

282
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:52,637
Soon they will understand

283
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,474
What kind of existence did they save?

284
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,991
She's dead? I'm asking you, is she dead?

285
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,826
Oh, I'm really going crazy!

286
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,494
What is going on?

287
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:17,620
Brother, let's go to the hospital first.

288
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,247
- What? Hospital?
- Speed up!

289
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,207
- Hey, hurry up!
- Hospital? Wait.

290
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:26,546
What's going on?

291
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,339
What's going on?

292
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:30,466
How are you?

293
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:35,513
She probably hasn't yet
Fully recovered from the injury sustained two days ago

294
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:36,806
I need food

295
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:40,226
Plus I got the same injury today.
Causes severe bleeding

296
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:44,063
The accompanying symptoms of appetite and thirst
Absolutely unbearable.

297
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:49,527
I need food

298
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,907
You are bleeding badly. We need to stop the bleeding first.

299
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:00,038
Stop the car, stop the car for me!

300
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,040
- Stop the car!
- Hey, what are you doing?

301
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,417
- Stop the car!
- You are crazy!

302
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,501
- Let go!
- Don't do this!

303
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,068
elder brother

304
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,738
Bro, are you okay?

305
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,032
Brother, wake up

306
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,260
I need food

307
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,846
Need food

308
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,641
I need food

309
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,017
I need food

310
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:05,686
So dangerous

311
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,729
Ms. Yan Caiyan

312
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,152
I need food

313
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:14,904
- I need food
- What’s wrong with you?

314
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:15,822
Don't follow me, get out of here!

315
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,202
sorry

316
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,252
Stay away from me

317
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:30,837
Stay away from me

318
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:32,964
Don't come over here

319
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,469
You have to go to the hospital first.

320
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,804
You'll really die if you keep going like this.

321
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:40,972
Until then!

322
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,225
Before that

323
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,855
I might kill you first.

324
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:55,069
I might attack you.
So please

325
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,825
Please go away quickly.

326
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:02,702
Please

327
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,919
I don't know why this happened.

328
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,172
But

329
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,508
I just remembered a name.

330
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:20,553
Ms. Yin Caiyu
