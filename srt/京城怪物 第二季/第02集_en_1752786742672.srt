00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:41,875
"Beijing Monster"

2
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,852
No, don't kill us.

3
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,249
Please don't kill us

4
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,587
What is going on?

5
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,506
Don't kill us

6
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,805
Did I make this happen?

7
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:41,638
Long live the independence of Korea!

8
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,139
Long live!

9
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,194
Long live!

10
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,320
Capital

11
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,117
Is a new spring coming soon?

12
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:21,761
But my winter is reluctant to leave

13
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:39,570
I'm imprisoned alone in this perfect dungeon

14
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,202
Forgotten by the whole world

15
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,208
But

16
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,673
How come?

17
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,801
How could this happen again?

18
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:07,724
Zhang Daizhu

19
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,853
Why are you here?

20
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:33,708
that

21
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,836
You seem to have the wrong person.

22
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,591
Who is Zhang the loan owner?

23
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,095
I'm sorry, I don't know who you're talking about.

24
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,440
Aren't you Mr. Zhang?

25
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,358
I am not

26
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,361
My name is Zhang Haocai

27
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,080
How are you?

28
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,166
How could I be like this?

29
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:17,960
This is obviously impossible

30
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,629
Hello

31
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,257
This person can't be him

32
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,301
Hello

33
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,140
Wait a moment

34
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,061
You haven't answered me yet.

35
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,566
What to answer?

36
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,318
Who are you?

37
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,322
Why were you there that day?
And what is the relationship with the late Wu Qixun?

38
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,367
Why should I tell you this?

39
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,244
to be honest
I might have to take the blame for this case.

40
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:56,124
Blame it on me that I happened to meet you in that hotel that day
I could be charged with murder.

41
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:58,709
Can you tell me?

42
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,753
Why did you go there?

43
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,091
I went there on a commission.

44
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,510
Someone asked me to find a missing person.

45
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,930
I went there to look for the missing person Wu Qixun.

46
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,474
But when I arrived, he was already dead.

47
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,769
Are you saying that you are in the same situation as me?

48
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,229
You can't say that.

49
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,648
You are the suspect, not me.

50
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,944
The police have your video.

51
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,782
I think you will be wanted soon.

52
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:30,992
so what?

53
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:33,744
Do you want to join forces?

54
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,665
You are not a criminal and neither am I.

55
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,419
But we are all regarded as suspects by the police

56
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:42,670
Then we should help each other

57
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,465
You're obviously asking me for help.
But you are too arrogant.

58
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,634
You won't suffer if you join forces with me.

59
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,555
I feel a little embarrassed to say it myself

60
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:56,184
But I am quite famous in this field.

61
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,853
I work alone

62
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,690
I hate having anything to do with other people.

63
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,196
I don't like getting involved with other people either.

64
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,991
After all, someone died, right?

65
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,121
I won't be beaten twice.

66
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:22,877
I warn you

67
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:27,215
Even if you know who the murderer is, you can't resist

68
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,967
I will judge for myself whether I can handle it or not.

69
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,052
Then you try it

70
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,263
Don't rely on me

71
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,015
Depend on you? Who are you talking about?

72
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:37,558
Me?

73
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,476
I mean

74
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,481
Solve your own problems
Let's find our own way.

75
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:28,025
The boundary between facts and distortions of Beijing monsters

76
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,487
Part 2
Drama title: "Traces"

77
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,242
Are you back? How are things going?

78
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,619
Did you find that woman? Did you see her?

79
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,871
Don't ask me. I'm not in the mood to talk now.

80
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,254
Brother, do you know someone called Zhang Daizhu?

81
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,757
- who?
- Zhang Daizhu

82
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,468
I don't know. I've never heard of this name.

83
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,387
What's wrong?

84
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,681
That woman called me that name.
She thought I was the loan shark.

85
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,391
so what?

86
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,310
I told her I wasn't

87
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,187
But the name doesn't sound strange

88
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,648
So I'm thinking
Have you mentioned this name to me before?

89
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,442
Me?

90
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,778
This isn't the first time I've heard of this name.

91
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,741
I'm cooking instant noodles.
Do you want to eat it? Or should I add some more water?

92
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,159
No, I have no appetite.

93
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,021
Hello, I'm Zhang Haocai from Fuqiang Trading Company.

94
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,442
Who are you?

95
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,716
(President Luo)

96
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,512
Missing person commission
Missing person's name: Zhang Haocai, age: early 30s

97
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,848
Missing for about a year

98
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:08,728
The client does not have a photo of the missing person
So I can only post this picture. Do you think it's okay?

99
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,303
please

100
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,054
Thanks

101
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,603
oh

102
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:51,729
Ethiopian coffee

103
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,063
That's Paraguayan coffee.

104
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,236
I don’t really know much about coffee.
I just guessed

105
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,655
I don’t really know much about coffee.
I just read what it said on the package

106
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:03,657
oh

107
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,828
You came here specially
It shouldn't be to understand my coffee preferences, right?

108
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,331
Let's get back to the point. What do you want to see me about?

109
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:11,916
actually

110
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,339
I'm here to give you this.

111
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,966
(Jongno-gu serial murder case)

112
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,136
(Case Report)

113
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,390
This is the past two months
Serial murders that occurred within our jurisdiction

114
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,727
The fifth victim was Mr. Wu Qixun

115
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,564
The modus operandi of these five cases is exactly the same

116
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:40,027
Victims found at the crime scene
Missing an eyeball and a brain

117
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:40,945
brain?

118
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,156
Is this the brain inside?

119
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,202
to be honest
This is the first time that our police have encountered this kind of killing method.

120
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,205
So we are also confused

121
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:55,459
Currently no way to find out
What weapon did the murderer use to suck out the brain?

122
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,922
Are you saying this was all done by one person?

123
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,883
Yes, it was done by one person.

124
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,223
No reply after waiting so long?

125
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,727
Oh, if you are busy
Leave your contact information and you can go back

126
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,355
We will send you a message later
Do you accept the commission?

127
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,608
How long have you been working with Yin Caiyan?

128
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,114
I will not answer any questions about Yin Caiyan

129
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,741
I only accept missing persons requests.

130
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,286
Regarding Qi Xun's commission

131
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,539
You accepted it too?

132
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:39,879
oh

133
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:43,757
So to speak

134
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:46,886
This is like a reception desk.

135
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,556
Right?

136
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,108
(Wait for me, I'll be there soon)

137
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,697
(Don't come)

138
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,460
I'm curious.

139
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,545
What do you mean?

140
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,880
You open the survey content to me

141
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,757
There must be some reason and purpose, right?

142
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,133
That's fair.

143
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,428
I think I should make it clear to you.
What kind of case are you involved in?

144
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,556
What a dangerous and brutal criminal you are facing.

145
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,767
You should at least be aware of these.

146
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,894
You have been transferred to the serious crime unit for a short time, right?

147
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,395
I've just been here for two months.

148
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,939
How many cases have you solved?

149
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,941
Just one or two miscellaneous cases

150
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,901
But now he's in charge of a serial murder case?

151
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,028
I didn't pick this case.

152
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,613
I'm just following the instructions.

153
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,490
So why did you put that there?

154
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,623
It's so obvious to put it in that place, right?

155
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:02,670
Feel sorry

156
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,172
It's okay to be startled, right?

157
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,090
Yes

158
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,387
(Another victim appears
Similar to the recent serial murders)

159
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,181
There's another murder. This is the sixth one.

160
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,724
Let's go together

161
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,393
What?

162
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,395
Well?

163
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:50,926
Please cooperate

164
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:54,388
Please step back. Photography is prohibited here. Please step back.

165
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,349
Please step back

166
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,352
You can't go in. This is a crime scene.

167
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,312
- Please stand back
- Is anyone hurt?

168
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,230
This is the crime scene.

169
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,441
Please move aside. Please move aside.

170
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,998
I'm really going crazy

171
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,419
I never thought our president would encounter such a thing.

172
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,588
I mean, what can I do about this?

173
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,468
She is usually very nice to me.

174
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,111
(President Luo)

175
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,215
Who are you?

176
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,219
How did you get to know Zhang Haocai?

177
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,223
Did you kill President Luo?

178
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,977
Don't interrupt me when I ask you a question.

179
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,854
So what?

180
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,277
You crazy guy

181
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,280
Where are you now?

182
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,993
Tell me where are you now?

183
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,830
- I asked first.
- Photography is prohibited here

184
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,123
You have to answer me first

185
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,083
Please move aside

186
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:58,679
Please step back

187
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,097
Please step back. This is a crime scene.

188
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:01,723
Please step back

189
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,023
Thank you. It didn't take you long to get here.

190
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:01,862
strangeness

191
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,407
Why don't you die?

192
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,367
Generally speaking, around this time

193
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,579
You should break your neck.
Or die from internal organs exploding.

194
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,790
If you were human

195
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:21,965
Where are you from, bastard?

196
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,468
Why did you kill President Luo?

197
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,305
Did you also kill Wu Qixun?
Did you do all this?

198
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:33,643
you

199
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:36,897
It turns out that he is the same as me.

200
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:11,640
Confirmed

201
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,562
Where are you from, bastard?

202
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,483
Hello, are you okay?

203
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,401
Did you get hurt...

204
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,785
Hey, someone got stabbed here.

205
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,078
Please come quickly!

206
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:42,629
How are you?

207
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,464
Hold on

208
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,216
The ambulance is coming. Please hold on a little longer.

209
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,261
Hello!

210
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,722
Hey, you have to stay awake!

211
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,477
You can't pass out. Wake up!

212
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:14,995
Are you awake?

213
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,754
I see you are sleeping soundly

214
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:26,965
So I didn't wake you up on purpose

215
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:36,808
Zhang Daizhu

216
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:42,898
What's wrong?

217
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,651
Are you having a nightmare?

218
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,784
I had a terrible dream

219
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:00,832
Very scary

220
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,171
Very lonely

221
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,512
It's just a dream

222
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,723
Don't worry too much.

223
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,236
Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere.

224
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,030
I will always be like this

225
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,783
Stay with you

226
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:08,483
Please let go of the patient

227
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,360
She is bleeding excessively and needs urgent treatment.

228
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:28,295
(Emergency Room)

229
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:52,277
(Inheritance)

230
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,494
Is it the president? I am at the first level.

231
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,914
yes

232
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,126
Last night?

233
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,967
(Jazz Bar in Nonhyeon-dong, Gangnam District
A woman in her forties was killed

234
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,218
(Corpse eye damage)

235
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,429
Let me find out what's going on.

236
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,391
No, don't worry, I won't bother you.

237
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:24,851
yes

238
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:30,565
You call Sheng Zhao

239
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:32,525
Yes I know

240
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,224
Do you know where the emergency patient just went?

241
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:05,725
No, I didn't see it.

242
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,855
How is it going?
Has the lady just now recovered?

243
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,566
The patient is missing

244
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,611
We are searching for hospitals

245
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,990
But it looks like she's left the hospital.

246
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:22,659
this

247
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,120
How is that possible?

248
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,514
Why bother to mobilize me?

249
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,310
This kind of scare tactics is too old-fashioned...

250
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:15,086
Don't cause trouble anymore and don't act on your own.

251
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,588
Thanks to my insistence

252
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,048
I just dealt with Wu Qixun.

253
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,009
You know this and still do this?

254
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,887
When I'm talking, just shut up and listen to me

255
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,638
Doesn’t this kind of life feel boring?

256
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:28,266
How long will this secret last?

257
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,103
With our strength
Now you can live the life you want.

258
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:39,652
Uncontrollable force
This is not real power, Sheng Zhao

259
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,948
That's just
Just disorderly inertia and violence

260
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,661
You stay here for now.

261
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:54,334
Before the muddy waters you stirred up subside

262
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,835
Don't act rashly

263
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,381
If you cause trouble again

264
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,426
You will have to explain to the president in person.

265
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:06,137
If you want that, it's up to you.

266
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,479
Haocai

267
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,024
Is he really dead?

268
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,070
I'm asking you, is he really dead?

269
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:37,001
Sheng Zhao, don't mention this name again.

270
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,128
Be careful or you may die

271
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,137
(Jongno Police Station)

272
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,517
This is the sixth victim.

273
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,270
The criminal left no trace.

274
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,397
In addition to the murder

275
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,149
The victims were not related

276
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,150
There is no rule

277
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,952
Did you find out anything there?

278
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:13,580
Detective Lu

279
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,123
No Ji-soo!

280
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,627
Did you find out anything?

281
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,130
No, I didn't find anything.

282
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,047
So what's wrong with you?

283
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:24,591
What?

284
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,885
You didn't find out anything.

285
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,303
What are you still doing sitting there?

286
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,265
I told you to keep an eye on Zhang Haocai.

287
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:35,768
Who told you to sit at your desk and listen to music?

288
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:40,440
Then I'll go out.

289
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:51,117
(Euljiro)

290
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,952
Hasn't he returned yet?

291
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:20,063
Where does Yin Caiyan live? I don't know.

292
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,441
I guess President Luo doesn't know either?

293
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,865
It seems that they usually contact each other by sending messages

294
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,619
Only call when it's urgent

295
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,790
No one has seen her
So no one knows what Yin Caiyan looks like.

296
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,088
Why is this place so deserted?

297
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,218
well

298
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:53,262
Life is unpredictable.

299
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,682
Who could have expected that President Luo would leave like this?

300
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,320
Why give so much?

301
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,782
I heard your grandson graduated this year.
Buy him some clothes.

302
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:18,246
He went to take a recruitment exam not long ago.

303
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,583
I even passed the interview.

304
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,335
He got the job so soon?

305
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,380
He joined Heritage Pharmaceuticals

306
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,218
I was thinking of buying him some clothes.

307
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:34,971
Thank you, Representative Zhang

308
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,265
Longjige is the representative

309
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,143
Well, our antenna group members all know

310
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,353
The one who really supports Fuqiang Trading Company is Zhang Daizhu

311
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,360
who?

312
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:51,738
ah?

313
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,326
What did you call me just now?

314
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,537
Ah, that...

315
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:05,752
That location used to be a pawn shop.

316
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,295
The pawnshop is called Jin Yu Tang

317
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:10,381
Zhang Daizhu is the owner of the pawnshop.

318
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:14,260
My mother's generation knows this.
Mr. Zhang is really a good man.

319
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:17,972
so

320
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:20,641
Who is he?

321
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,102
There was a person before

322
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,022
Zhang Daizhu

323
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,318
Zhang Daizhu

324
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,856
This is the result of the recent A0-67 experiment.

325
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,275
How much progress has been made this time?

326
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,362
Still in the second stage or not crossed

327
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:38,302
Don't be afraid if it senses that you are afraid of it

328
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,929
Will attack you

329
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:22,972
Don't move, hold on.

330
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,064
Help!

331
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,233
Don't avoid its gaze, hold on tight.

332
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,320
I can't do it, I can't do it!

333
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:10,102
Do you intend to keep submitting failure reports?

334
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:13,564
If you can't control it well
Those guys down here

335
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,524
We can't proceed to the next stage.

336
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:19,028
If we continue to stagnate like this

337
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,490
Maybe we need to summon that guy again.

338
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,368
I'll find a way

339
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,913
The old president implanted a Na

340
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:30,957
So that you can keep the heritage

341
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:34,460
Contribute wholeheartedly to the realization of great achievements

342
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,881
But if we continue to make such ridiculous mistakes

343
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:43,010
Don't forget you can only be abolished

344
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,429
I never forget this

345
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:47,807
Not even a moment

346
00:37:58,317 --> 00:37:59,151
Where is Seung So?

347
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,571
I advised him and he should have understood.
I don't think he'll cause any more trouble recently.

348
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,532
Tell him if he causes trouble again

349
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,534
Will be locked up forever

350
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,495
How can you kill someone?

351
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,039
What era is this?

352
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:51,579
Why did you buy it if you don't want to eat it?
What a pity that the noodles are about to burst

353
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,585
I heard this used to be a pawn shop?

354
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,502
Jin Yutang

355
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,755
Yeah?

356
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,382
It is said that the owner of the pawnshop is Zhang Daizhu

357
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,478
Even the Antenna Grandma knows this, don't you?

358
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,022
Not sure

359
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,608
It's possible that I forgot after I heard it.

360
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,320
What happened again?

361
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:27,490
I said brother

362
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,743
Among the things that happened before the accident a year ago

363
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,412
Is there anything I need to know?

364
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:35,956
No, no.

365
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:39,502
What you should know
I probably told you everything, what's wrong?

366
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,003
What else do you want to know?

367
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:44,548
How do I know what else I need to know?

368
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,635
What I remember

369
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,179
Only after the accident

370
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,141
Memories before the accident
You filled it all for me.

371
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,148
Haocai, you believe me, right?

372
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:02,566
Of course I believe

373
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,903
You also know that on Earth
No one cares about you and thinks about you more than me, right?

374
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:07,530
Yes, I know

375
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:08,906
Then you listen to me.

376
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:13,077
You are doing much better now than before the accident.

377
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:15,496
Um

378
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,749
Remembering everything is not necessarily a good thing

379
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,377
I can feel it when I look at you

380
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,962
Forgetting is actually a gift to people.

381
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:24,588
Now that your memory has been reset

382
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:28,050
It's not bad to just get rid of the past and start a new life

383
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,055
Was my life so bad before?

384
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,724
Look, here you are again, being serious again

385
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,518
How could I mean that?

386
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:41,397
Hey, you said that since my memory has been reset
Just let go of the past and start a new life

387
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,566
Doesn't this mean that before the accident

388
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:47,570
My life is unfortunate or bad.
Is that roughly what it means?

389
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:51,365
Anyway, the accident has happened and you have lost your memory.

390
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,242
And those memories...

391
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,330
Makes me curious bro

392
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,624
Haocai

393
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:04,545
Can you tell me?

394
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:07,840
What kind of person was I before?

395
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,969
How bad is it?
What makes you speechless?

396
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:14,930
Um?

397
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:19,477
Your life

398
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:24,982
It was a fucking mess before.

399
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,194
Very gloomy, very tragic, very unfortunate

400
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,863
It's fucking terrible.

401
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,865
You had paranoid delusions before
Anxiety disorders and insomnia

402
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:34,742
Every day is like having one foot in the door of hell

403
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:38,287
Plus intermittent explosive disorder
He always goes out to cause trouble and smash things.

404
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:42,291
So,
There's nothing to miss about your past life.

405
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:43,876
There's nothing to be curious about.

406
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:45,419
You

407
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:49,924
You just believe everything you see.
Just look at these, think about these, and enjoy these.

408
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,259
Now you have this bowl of noodles in front of you

409
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,678
Then you will be happy
Just eat this bowl of noodles.

410
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,784
Brother, it seems that you have been worried a lot these days.

411
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,204
That Haocai

412
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,374
(No caller ID)

413
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,292
Hello

414
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,005
Hello?

415
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,007
It's me

416
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,093
Where are you?

417
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:36,929
How is your injury? Are you okay?

418
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,890
Can I go in now?

419
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:44,687
how...

420
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,116
What's going on?

421
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:00,536
Your previous suggestion

422
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,206
Is it still valid now?

423
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,294
I want to ask

424
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,340
Is the proposal to join forces still valid?

425
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:40,719
Hello?

426
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:25,050
