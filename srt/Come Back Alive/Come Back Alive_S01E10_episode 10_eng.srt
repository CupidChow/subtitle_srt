1
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:12,220

2
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:39,590
Regardless of what he said, don't make us waver since we are just barely trying to live on.

3
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,610
It's up to us... to live without Yeong Soo.

4
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,310
Who will take that spot?

5
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,310
That's not something you should be wo—

6
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:55,590
Can't I do it? Can't I like you, ajumma?

7
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,290
Did Yeong Soo tell you to make me laugh like this?

8
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:15,370
I feels as if I've loved you long before we ever met.

9
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,830
Why do you like me?

10
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:24,130
I'm also looking for that reason, about why I can't hate you.

11
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:45,530
You said you wanted us to become like family right? You don't like me,

12
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,370
you just need someone by your side.

13
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,190
I was like that once before.

14
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,410
You needed someone by your side?

15
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:01,730
Yes. That's why you feel like that, you don't like me.

16
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:09,830
Then let's do this. Whether I'm mistaken or you're mistaken,

17
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,050
let's go out together.

18
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:19,020
You think that I'm a better person that you thought I was? Be careful that you don't fall for me.

19
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,980
Alright, I'll be careful.

20
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:29,510
Ajumma, I'd like to pay for our table. Also, can I get chicken feet to-go?

21
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,070
You'll have to be really careful.

22
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,790
 Episode 10

23
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:47,350
There are a lot of young and pretty ladies out there. Why are you being like this to me?

24
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,070
I don't have time to put up with your nonsense.

25
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,630
I also don't have time.

26
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,170
Don't be like that. You're not my style, Branch Manager.

27
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,190
What's wrong with me? What style do you like then? A style similar to Kim Yeong Soo?

28
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,130
Isn't this style a lot better than that style?

29
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:12,350
You wouldn't understand a woman like me. Don't play around.

30
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,670
What's wrong with you, Ajumma?

31
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,030
If you find out, you'll get hurt.

32
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,070
I want to know.

33
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,290
I won't tell you.

34
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,670
I need to make you more drunk.

35
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:34,210
I bet Kim Yeong Soo didn't know your true feelings.

36
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,130
Was he that indifferent toward you?

37
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,870
He was the most considerate person of anyone I've ever met.

38
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,110
Yeong Soo never asked about someone's past.

39
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,690
He never said anything that could wound someone.

40
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,870
That's what I liked about him and so I married him, but

41
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:02,650
after time his behavior felt like ignorance. I couldn't talk about any deep feelings.

42
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:09,010
You know... Those kinds of talks you can only have between married partners.

43
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,690
Let's start over from the beginning.

44
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:29,390
Hello, my name is Lee Hae Joon. What is your name?

45
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,850
It's Shin Da Hye.

46
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,970
What's your favorite food? Chicken feet?

47
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,390
Stop that!

48
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,530
You hands are hot (strong)!

49
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,570
Where are you going?

50
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,350
Why?

51
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:52,350
♫  The hand that called me, that road  ♫

52
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,970
♫  It's now time to part  ♫

53
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:01,590
♫  The painful memories that came from letting you go stay with me  ♫

54
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:07,650
♫  In my memory, it's a big regret. My eyes miss you  ♫

55
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:13,330
♫  The tears tell me to find you  ♫

56
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:18,650
♫  The image of you that goes away as I turn around  ♫

57
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,290
 Thank you for treating my friend so well.

58
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:30,730
♫  Why haven't I been able to forget?  ♫

59
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:39,590
♫  Deep inside my heart. I know I need you  ♫

60
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,630
Where did all of my high heels go?

61
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,350
Where did they go?

62
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,670
Excuse me!

63
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:13,830
Will you be okay going to work in slippers, Shin Da Hye?

64
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:27,720
Can't you throw away that bag? Let me see this.

65
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,800
How long have you used this to create this smell of Ajusshi?

66
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,140
What do you mean it's an ajusshi smell?

67
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,190
Use this.

68
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,150
What's this?

69
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,810
 Lamatt

70
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,830
A bag.

71
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,170
Is this a gift?

72
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,350
Not particularly.

73
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,510
Are you crying?

74
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:08,850
Feeling embarrassed at a time like this.

75
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:16,930
Receiving a gift is this kind of feeling, huh?

76
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,950
What kind of girl are you

77
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:25,430
I will never let this bag part from my body.

78
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:29,930
Right, you made a good decision. Come over here.

79
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,630
You are at the peak of your beauty.

80
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,550
If I were you, I would brush my hair to make it pretty...

81
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:42,850
Stop acting so stiff!

82
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:48,490
And put on some pink blush to make yourself prettier.

83
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,890
How do you apply this?

84
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:18,530
What!? What a waste.

85
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,550
Wow I'm pretty.

86
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,670
 Big Brother is critical.

87
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,630
Aish...

88
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,410
Seung Jee!

89
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:43,430
Seung Jae!

90
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,410
What are you doing here, pretty lady?

91
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,910
Na Seok Cheol, you bastard!

92
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,550
You... How did you come here...

93
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,690
Is this what our Seung Jae is so worried about?

94
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,430
Stop right now!

95
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,970
What's your identity?

96
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,850
- I am Han Gi Tak's—
-No!

97
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,530
Han Gi Tak's little sister.

98
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:13,470
Why did Han Gi Tak's little sister appear here?

99
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:18,430
Your organization is low on money. I came to get my money.

100
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:24,470
All the money that person skimmed from the top and entrusted to Han Gi Tak,

101
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,910
I came to find that.

102
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:32,530
I was wondering where that money went. So it went to Han Gi Tak in the end.

103
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:38,110
That's right. If you cooperate with us, then I'll give you half.

104
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,230
- Cooperate? 
- My brother,

105
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:46,090
also that Song Yi Yeon who ruined our family. I'm going to take her to the top and throw her down alone.

106
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:52,920
Aigoo, so scary! While you're doing this, do you think Cha Jae Gook will let you do as you please?

107
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:59,370
Cha Jae Gook has a different adversary. Lee Hae Joon. That half brother is going to stomp on him.

108
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,950
It's your choice which side you'll stand behind.

109
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:15,090
That's right. Song Yi Yeon is the reason behind your scar.

110
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,030
Does Cha Jae Gook know that?

111
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,920
So it's revenge for Han Gi Tak.

112
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,430
Gi Tak taught his juniors well, huh?

113
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,680
You made a good decision.

114
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:37,890
If I bite once, I won't let go. I'm a crazy dog so keep that in mind.

115
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,950
I know that.

116
00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:04,340

117
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:13,580
Choi Seung Jae, I have a good eye for people.

118
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:20,360
That's right. There's no way you'd betray Han Gi Tak.

119
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,590
You're a charming person.

120
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,230
Hey, you like that pretty girl right?

121
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:36,640
"Nanny nanny boo boo."

122
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:44,300
If that girl finds the money, then you bring it to me.

123
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,120
That is, if you don't want her pretty face to end up like mine.

124
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,790
Do you understand?

125
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,930
Then work hard.

126
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,110
It doesn't matter whether Han Gi Tak's sister attacks Cha Jae Gook

127
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,620
or Cha Jae Gook attacks Han Gi Tak's sister.

128
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,210
Play both sides.

129
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,800
All I have to do is observe from the sidelines.

130
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,450
This is exciting! This is fun!

131
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,680
Hyungnim, we keep getting calls by peons looking for Song Yi Yeon.

132
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,310
Connect the calls.

133
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:30,210
Also create a meeting time with the reporters.

134
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:34,500
If both sides are going to get ready to go at each other,

135
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,530
don't you think I should make the process go smoother by greasing it?

136
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,820
What are you doing?

137
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,470
Give it here.

138
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,600
Is your back okay?

139
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,900
Are you crazy? Don't pretend you know at the company.

140
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,520
Then make it so that I don't have to notice.

141
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,040
You carry heavy stuff like this. I know you're a strong woman,

142
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,070
but you'll hurt your back this way.

143
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,210
I don't need your help.

144
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,820
Who do you think I became like this for?

145
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,780
Then I'll take responsibility.

146
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,750
What nonsense are you talking about?

147
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,880
- Oh right...
- What now?

148
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,500
You didn't forget about our date today, right?

149
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,830
Do you want to get hit again? Get out of my way, please.

150
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,560
I was about to call you. I guess it all worked out.

151
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,390
When you see the employee lounge, you will know the quality of the department store.

152
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:47,130
If a company serves its employees, then the employees will grow the company. That is my principle.

153
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,180
I didn't know you have that kind of principle.

154
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,790
Make a good employee lounge as big as a school yard.

155
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,490
Also make an employee nap room. Are you writing this all down?

156
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,890
And Jade mat with few massage chairs.

157
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,360
How hard it must have been.

158
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,040
Yesterday, I found that her waist is so slim

159
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,040
I could reach around her with one arm.

160
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,750
What?

161
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,390
Can you take care of this, Department Head Jeong?

162
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,780
What is this?

163
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:24,360
I purchased a pair of shoes yesterday. I forgot to get reward points for them. Those shoes!

164
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:32,420
Look at the shoes! Who purchased those shoes. What a great sense of style!

165
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,090
I don't think its time for you to be idle right now.

166
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,400
Before the company serves its employees,

167
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,130
Branch Manager should first treat the employees like human beings.

168
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:01,160
Jeong Ji Hoon, what did you do now?

169
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,770
It's not me, it's something that you created.

170
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,690
- What?
- Now everything...

171
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,010
We all got to know who you really are.

172
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,440
Did you see the anonymous comment on the company website?

173
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,780
The Branch Manager said to fire us all.

174
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,940
What?

175
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,480
He brought over a woman and told us to play,

176
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,800
and he's going to stab us in the back like this?

177
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,940
I know, right?

178
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,620
Laying off 50% of our workforce in an effort to reduce costs.

179
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,210
Transitioning permanent employees to temporary employees.

180
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,130
There was a reason why you were not interested in increasing the revenue.

181
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,260
I sent this?

182
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,290
Anyway it is impossible to increase the revenue.

183
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,550
Lay off your employees by your own hands.

184
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,630
How funny. I'm not doing it.

185
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,750
By doing it, isn't it better that you save your reputation?

186
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,560
I will sell the department store for a good price.

187
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:17,810
No, I can't sell it. You know why?

188
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,240
I will make the price of the department store crap.

189
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,590
Don't get in my way.

190
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:28,260
This won't do. I wasn't going to work, but now I'll have to work hard

191
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,700
to get in your way.

192
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:39,610
No. I mean, why did you have to choose a bastard like him? I'm about to flip out.

193
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,620
I'm the one who is about to flip out.

194
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,300
Lee Hae Joon is the person who works with data and numbers.

195
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,580
He doesn't know at all how much affection you have for this department store.

196
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:54,100
No, I— I have to work now.

197
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,270
I don't care if this company goes bankrupt or not.

198
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,270
Shin Da Hye.

199
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,590
♬   Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you   ♬

200
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:09,230
What's with that look? Are you suspecting me?

201
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,560
You want me to go get the elevator again?

202
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,350
- The rumor about you firing the employees...
- Yes, that's right.

203
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,850
- It's right?
- It's right, but it's not.

204
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:19,750
Lee Hae Joon did it but I didn't do it.

205
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,000
What?

206
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,620
I am me but I am not the me from my past.

207
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:30,380
Anyway, I will not lay people off. There are no layoffs as long as I am here.

208
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,400
I already knew it.

209
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,520
You believed in me?

210
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:42,720
♬   Who cares if we're trashed got a pocket full of cash we can blow oh oh oh   ♬

211
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,200
♬   Shots of patron, and it's on, girl   ♬

212
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,870
You're already falling for me.

213
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,790
You're as big as a mountain.

214
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:01,910
Do you think I came here to see this look?

215
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:05,770
Are you crazy? What are you trying to do by saying you're his little sister?

216
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:09,300
I told you, if something happens, just hand me over to him.

217
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,590
How could I hand you over?

218
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,490
 If that wench finds the fund, bring it to me.

219
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:20,300
 If you don't want her pretty face to end up like mine, that is.

220
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,180
 Do you understand?

221
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,530
Do you really know where the fund is?

222
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:29,610
If I knew, I would've found it already.

223
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:34,620
 I can't watch you get hurt, Seung Jae.

224
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,440
I don't have much time left.

225
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,030
What do you want to do? Do you want to work together with me?

226
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,940
- Revenge?
- No!

227
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:47,360
Don't say the word revenge so lightly!

228
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,480
If you take revenge, you'll be over.

229
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:06,140
Resolve Han Gi Tak's resentment, find the fund and exonerate Song Yi Yeon.

230
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,610
Our Big Hyungnim has to wake up again.

231
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:15,820
Find the law again so you guys can live a lawful life again.

232
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,960
Whose son is this? He is so good-looking.

233
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:44,690
You guys! What a scene!

234
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,860
I knew this would happen.

235
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,360
You already got beat up by Hong Nan!

236
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,210
She can fight like a rooster in a cock fight!

237
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:03,440
This won't do, I'll be late. Let's go to the filming site.

238
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:13,000
Da Hye, what are you doing with the branch manager?

239
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,210
What's this about your back and what are those high heels?

240
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:20,220
I can understand you feeling thankful to him for looking into your husband's death, but

241
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,940
why do you keep giving him openings?

242
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,610
He is boarding. He is boarding at my house.

243
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:29,360
Why a single man— Why?

244
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,920
What are you thinking?

245
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,250
Then, as a single man, what do you care?

246
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:40,060
Da Hye... My words are... Do you know what kind of person he is?

247
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,270
- What kind of person is he then?
- He's trying to fire his employees,

248
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,170
and that's why he came. He's a cruel human being.

249
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,950
It seems that I know him better than you do.

250
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,110
This is the branch manager.

251
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,310
It's a bit hot so turn down the air conditioning about 1 degree, no 2 degrees lower?

252
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,690
Raise the volume of the music as well.

253
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,150
What are you doing right now?

254
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,520
- Taking care of my employees.
- Please stop fooling around.

255
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,160
She's not a woman who you can do that to.

256
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,950
If you're allowed to, then why am I not allowed to? I'm also a hundred times better looking than you are.

257
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,670
You have no clue.

258
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,100
That... That jerk!

259
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:22,030
 I want to hit that jerk. I want to beat the daylights out of him.

260
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:32,000
 Employees of Sunjin, this is Branch Manager Lee Hae Joon.

261
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,860
Employees who are on their break right now come to the rooftop please.

262
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,320
I, Branch Manager, Lee Hae Joon

263
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,080
will sacrifice myself to relieve your stress.

264
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,730
Throwing away all the notion of rank...

265
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,050
Now, the first candidate is...

266
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,630
Department Head Jeong Ji Hoon.

267
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,980
 Alright!

268
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,740
 Fighting!

269
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:15,240
Department Head Jeong! Department Head Jeong!

270
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,430
  You're dead now.

271
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,330
I'm counting on you, chocolate bar.

272
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,800
Don't worry about rank and let's have a fair play.

273
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,700
This is just a game.

274
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,560
Alright then.

275
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:44,460

276
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,200
 Wow!

277
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,060
I'm warning you. Stop playing around with Da Hye.

278
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:16,050
- What if it's not a joke?
- Are you saying that you really like Da Hye?

279
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,720
It's better than a previous boyfriend wanting to meet her again.

280
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,520
I can do everything that Da Hye wants.

281
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,670
- What would that be?
- You see.

282
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,450
You don't know anything about Da Hye.

283
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,480
Branch Manager! Branch Manager! Branch Manager!

284
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,530
Yes, I will get to know about her from now on.

285
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,530
 Maya, stop time for me!

286
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,050
 Oh, My!

287
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,950
Director! Director!

288
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,660
Director! Director!

289
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,530
At least, I should get hit like this. Your stress has been relieved, right?

290
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,980
I'm okay, Department Head Jeong.

291
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,220
Okay. Next?

292
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,970
Who's the next player?

293
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,180
 Maya, please help me.

294
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:50,550
Maya, you really have to help me!

295
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:05,790
The chairman wanted me to give you this.

296
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,900
You really come after me at the filming site?

297
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,880
Why did you have to come here?

298
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:20,480
Uncle, who's does this belong to?

299
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,630
This is Gi Tak Hyung's picture.

300
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,650
He had a younger brother?

301
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,420
Yong Chan.

302
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,910
My baby. Listen to Dad well. Okay?

303
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,410
Okay, bye Mom.

304
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:43,480
Yeah. Get in the car.

305
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,270
 Request for child custody

306
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,370
Reasons for request: Financial inability. Due to alcoholism, instability, unstable...

307
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,500
What should I do for you?

308
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,610
Should I steal Yong Chan away and put him in your arms?

309
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:12,510
Or you want me to sucker punch Cha Jae Gook's face?

310
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:15,330
- Really?
- Yes, really.

311
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:21,030
So don't hold it in and cry by yourself anymore.

312
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,620
It's best to ignore these kinds of things.

313
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,970
I'm the one who is upright.

314
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:31,780
Since I'm the one who is upright, I have no reason to cower.

315
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:35,390
Let's go. They'll start filming soon.

316
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:48,260
Hello! Drink this, please take care of Actress Song.

317
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,410
Thank you.

318
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,500
Hello there! Actress Song—

319
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,620
Extras stand by there.

320
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,640
For how many hours have we been waiting here? They don't give us any food because we are extras.

321
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,470
How can you discriminate against people like this?

322
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,720
What? What do you want?!

323
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,740
Since while ago, your stare has been crass.

324
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,500
Oppa, are you an aspiring actor?

325
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,110
We came at dawn and have been waiting since filming started at ten.

326
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:33,270
But since the main actress is over four hours late, we are stuck here like this.

327
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:35,660
That wench, Wang Joo Yeon!

328
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,560
- But Unni, you're an aspiring actor?

329
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,680
Kids, this unni is the celebrity.

330
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,600
Actress Song Yi Yeon.

331
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,650
Who?

332
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:48,520
Kiddos, what were you doing in 1995?

333
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,260
I was born in 1999.

334
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,200
Be more careful!

335
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,490
Are you alright?

336
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,830
The filming schedule has been cancelled so you may all leave.

337
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:07,340
What? You made us wait for this long and now this?!

338
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,380
Forget it.

339
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,820
What should we do?

340
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:24,320
What is this? Did something happen?

341
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,300
The head ajusshi told us he'll pay us the month's wage today.

342
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,920
Since we didn't act properly, he won't pay us.

343
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,180
He says he won't pay us for today since we didn't get to act.

344
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:39,320
What? If I stand idle by in this unjust circumstance

345
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,280
Han...

346
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,440
Who is that head ajusshi?

347
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:04,110
That tickles the throat doesn't it?

348
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:07,550
You're doing well, right?

349
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,550
No, I am not doing well.

350
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:15,950
You overwork my kind and you're just sitting here—

351
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,860
I want to use bad language...

352
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,530
Hey, Mister.

353
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:26,810
If you used them for work, isn't proper to pay them?

354
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:29,930
Why? Is there some problem with money?

355
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:33,040
Yes. I have no money right now so next month when I get some money—

356
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:38,090
I have the money to buy luxury goods but no money to pay part-timers?

357
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:40,250
This is the Labor Department, right?

358
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:47,690
There is a vicious employer who abuses innocent part-time workers.

359
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:56,240
It's because I feel so bad for them that...

360
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,070
Ah Director, this is Song Yi Yeon.

361
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:02,130
Do you know Ah Jae Agency who supplies staff members?

362
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,230
I don't think it's a good place. Don't use them.

363
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,620
Anyway, don't use them. You know my personality right?

364
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:11,850
Reporter Park, you said you want to investigate that part-time agency that abuses the workers, right?

365
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,770
It's right here! Here!

366
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:16,650
I'll give it!

367
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:22,640
You should've done that from the beginning.

368
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:32,270
 Sunjin VIP Lounge

369
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:39,070
Excuse me, I'm from the Fashion Department.

370
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,650
Sit down, I called for you.

371
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:59,590
Don't do these things. This is a place my livelihood is dependent upon.

372
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:02,310
Just sit for now and drink some tea. Enjoy some cookies as well.

373
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:06,070
- If you're going to take me on a date, do it properly. How could you do it like this—
- This isn't a date.

374
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:09,800
O-Oh, so it wasn't.

375
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,990
Lounge. Dessert. Taste.

376
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:15,210
It's because you keep saying weird things about a date.

377
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,680
Oh my! What are you doing?!

378
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:30,860
Shin Da Hye. I told you that I'm working right now.

379
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:34,510
You should receive services from a customers' perspective so that you know.

380
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,510
Sit down.

381
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,320
This won't do. I'll clean my own feet.

382
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,300
Stay still.

383
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:11,020
♬   Wherever I am filling me with   ♬

384
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:16,090
♬   A memory which was lost in space   ♬

385
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:26,330
♬   The memories of a time I turned far away from   ♬

386
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:32,360
♬   Whether it was a matter of something which was forgotten   ♬

387
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:37,290
♬   or whether it was matter of going toward somewhere   ♬

388
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:47,930
♬   I’m spending a day once again among the days I dreamed of   ♬

389
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:53,080
Shin Da Hye, why do you remain at this department store?
♬   It might be too late   ♬

390
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:57,370
There are plenty of other places that you could work.
♬   Maybe in a place that I can’t even go back to   ♬

391
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,550
Isn't it tedious?
♬   Maybe in a place that I can’t even go back to   ♬

392
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:04,190
It is. My legs hurt all the time,
♬   My whole love is alive and breathing.   ♬

393
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:07,910
The small pay and crappy customers, too.

394
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:11,760
The women whisper gossip too.

395
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:17,050
Although I think about quitting about twelve times a day,

396
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:25,550
this department store that he gave his life for,

397
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:31,330
I feel I have to find what that is and acknowledge it.

398
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:37,650
For me, this is a painful place, but

399
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:41,320
if it's not here, then there's nowhere else that I can remember him.

400
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,690
 We're going up.

401
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:51,310
♬   A breath which always silently covered and hugged me   ♬

402
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:54,330
♬   With you   ♬

403
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:59,210
Today, I heard something that made me angry.

404
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:06,930
I know nothing really about the woman named Shin Da Hye.

405
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:11,930
What you want, what you need...

406
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:18,090
I want to know everything, but
♬   It might be too late   ♬

407
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:23,350
right now it's difficult.
♬   Maybe in a place that I can’t even go back to   ♬

408
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:26,560
♬   Maybe in a place that I can’t even go back to   ♬

409
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:32,390
I now know one thing...
♬   My whole love is alive and breathing.   ♬

410
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:35,370
I'll protect you.
♬   With you   ♬

411
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:41,210
Since you want to remain here, I'll protect you
♬   With you   ♬

412
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:43,490
at this department store.

413
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:06,310

414
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:20,690
Cha Yong Chan. Why isn't your Mom calling?

415
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:26,710
Someone's excited.

416
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:34,210
Yeah, did you get what I sent you?

417
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:36,250
Let me speak with Yong Chan.

418
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:38,840
My son, did you eat?

419
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:43,170
Yep, Mom ate too and is working hard.

420
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:51,230
But Yong Chan, since Mom is so busy,

421
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:53,890
I think you'll have to stay with Dad for few days because I can't pick you up.

422
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:58,460
Can you play with Dad and Grandpa until then?

423
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,330
You're so kind, my baby.

424
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,410
I understand.

425
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:12,140
What is it? Did she hang up? Did your Mom hang up?

426
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:16,710
Yeah, she said to play with you.

427
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:22,190
 That's right. Since Cha Jae Gook knows anyway, I'll save the department store and

428
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:24,330
ruin Cha Jae Gook and

429
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:27,170
we'll restore Song Yi Yeon.

430
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:35,090
♬   Oh Yes I've shaken off the boring reputation   ♬

431
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:36,170
♫  To me  ♫

432
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:42,250
- I won't leave you be in peace.
- Cha Jae Gook!

433
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:44,200
Stop!
♬   I'm getting ready to run   ♬

434
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:50,090
Fighting! Let's go and destroy everything! Fighting!
♬   to the climax of my life Flawless to the end perfectly  ♬

435
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:52,310
Hey!
♬   I want to escape the world which confined me   ♬

436
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:56,530
 I'm working overtime today so bring me a boxed lunch.

437
00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:03,210
He could buy and eat but why is he making me go back and forth? Just wait until he gives out all of the stickers.

438
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:10,330
♬   A new beginning Feel so right alive I'm flying high  ♬

439
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:15,450
♬   I say I'm going to the sky Oh ohohohoh   ♬

440
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:19,250
♬   Oh ohohohoh yeah   ♬

441
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:22,830
♬   Oh ohohohoh   ♬

442
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:27,150
♬   Oh ohohohoh yeah  ♬

443
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,150
You're here?

444
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,130
I brought you a boxed lunch.

445
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:41,110
Put it here and go.

446
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,610
You're here, Da Hye?

447
00:38:56,610 --> 00:39:00,990
I didn't know that you two here together and only brought one boxed lunch.

448
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:05,110
It's fine, we can eat it together. Thank you.

449
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:09,990
Then work hard.

450
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,690
Thank you.

451
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,790
What is it?

452
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,650
Why are you taking this back?

453
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:40,250
It's nothing.

454
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,430
What is it?

455
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,630
N-No.

456
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:46,070
Give it to me.

457
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,730
Just give it.

458
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:56,290
Thank you. I needed it.

459
00:39:56,290 --> 00:40:00,450
Yeah, then work hard.

460
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:03,990
What's wrong with your face? It's really red.

461
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,410
It's not red.

462
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:08,090
Is it menopause already?

463
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:10,110
What did you say?

464
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,970
Then, are you jealous?

465
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:17,970
I can't believe what I'm hearing. Hurry and go, I'm busy.

466
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:20,160
Let's go then, I'll take you to the front.

467
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:25,340

468
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,220
I haven't seen any taxis.

469
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:42,900
Do you want to eat this? If you do, your whole body will have a strawberry aroma.

470
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,950
Really?

471
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:52,750
How's it? Can you smell that?

472
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:57,330
I can't smell it.

473
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,680
I can smell it. Why?

474
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,650
Yummm!

475
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:03,670
- Does it smell?
 - Yes.

476
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:07,160
What are you doing?

477
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,810
My gosh.

478
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:13,830
The car's here.

479
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:17,150
♬  I keep getting dizzy when I think of you ♬

480
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:20,200
- I'll offer my ride.
- Thank you.

481
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:27,750
♬  My heart which didn't react to you is now full of you ♬

482
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:35,900
♬  I like when you smile at me and even your seemingly indifferent expression ♬

483
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:40,240
♬  I'm warmed by just looking at you ♬

484
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:46,980
♬   I think of you even when you're not here. I'm wanting you like this ♬

485
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:51,930
♬  When I'm falling in love, when I'm falling in love ♬

486
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:57,440
♬  I don't know when I started to ♬

487
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,520
♬  When I'm failling in love ♬

488
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,650
Omo.
♬  When I'm falling for you ♬

489
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:06,040
Shin Da Hye, you must be crazy about getting bonus stickers from him.

490
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,620
♬   Oh yeah   ♬

491
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:11,740
It is a piece of cake for my wife to make.

492
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,290
It takes her only two hours to cook for a big party.

493
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:17,300
- This is a killer taste! 
- What are you doing? Give it to me!

494
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:21,090
You're so stingy.

495
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:23,550
Anyway, would it be alright?

496
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:26,820
During this precious time when there's not even enough to spend with sister-in-law.

497
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,820
This time I really want to protect her.

498
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,490
The promises that I couldn't keep last time.

499
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:35,400
Father and Han Na.

500
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,400
I'm going to do everything for Dae Hye before I leave.

501
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,790
Oh my!

502
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:43,270
Almost half of the time is gone? I'm sitting here working overtime.

503
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:45,690
What the heck?

504
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:50,540
I also think to myself, what am I doing here?

505
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,640
What's with you again?

506
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:59,410
After seeing Song Yi Yeon's life that has fallen completely to the bottom,

507
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:06,360
I'm responsible for that.

508
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:10,290
Are you talking about that thing that happened ten years ago?

509
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:15,640
I was so sick of my life as a gangster,

510
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,910
I wanted to commit suicide back then.

511
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:21,310
That was when

512
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:24,340
Yi Yeon came into my life.

513
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:31,580
That girl who lived way above me

514
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:35,360
She asked me to take her anywhere.

515
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,610
Back then,

516
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:40,250
the flame that was about to go out

517
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:44,160
felt as if I was completely restored.

518
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,320
Yes. Let's run away.

519
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:51,620
"If you're with me, I can start fresh again,"

520
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,980
I said to her.

521
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:58,820
The next day, her manager found us.

522
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:03,290
That's how Yi Yeon was sent away.

523
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:05,050
Aigoo.

524
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:09,440
Yi Yeon thinks she betrayed me back then,

525
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,210
but it was I who called

526
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:14,530
her manager.

527
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,310
I'm a bastard.

528
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:22,200
What an idiot I was, don't you think?

529
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:27,370
Still, I cannot tell her the truth.

530
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:32,550
What a coward I am!

531
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:37,010
What am I so afraid of! I am the one who's dead.

532
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:45,360
Aiyoo.

533
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:50,390
It must have been very difficult for you, Han Hyung. I would have done the same thing.

534
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:54,590
It's not because of you so don't feel so guilty.

535
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,670
Song Yi Yeon sent me.

536
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,700
I'm a little tired, so I'm going to rest first.

537
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:36,580
Are you okay?

538
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:41,560
As for me, I feel as though my tiredness is going away.

539
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:47,330
Let him go! Let him go, Maya!

540
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:50,590
No, not Seung Jae!

541
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:54,410
He's never been married or had a woman yet.

542
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:56,880
Oh you are so damn strong!

543
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,500
No!

544
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:09,490
Welcome.

545
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,830
Oh Jae Song, Happy Birthday!

546
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:41,210
How did you know? Thank you so much!

547
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:50,870
Look at the time. I'm just too busy.

548
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:54,190
How'd he know?

549
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,540
I am sorry.

550
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:17,190
Cut! Okay!

551
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:19,600
 Applause. Applause.

552
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,650
Wow, you're a great actress.

553
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:25,670
Wasn't that completely real?

554
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:29,490
You were great actress Song!

555
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:32,120
How many times did I die today?

556
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:36,280
Am I going to get typecast as dying person? What is the next scene?

557
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,480
You fall and due to concussion...

558
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,020
Oh, really!

559
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:45,190
What is this about concussion? Then, what's next? With a hot soup or something?

560
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:48,200
You'll be a different person.

561
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,630
Yes,

562
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:54,120
please get me ten concert tickets.

563
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,760
Mom, I thought ajussi ran away but he came to my school.

564
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:06,150
What?

565
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:25,530
He bought us hamburgers and gave us an extra ten concert tickets.

566
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,780
He's the best!

567
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,040
That's what happened.

568
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,170
He reminds me

569
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:37,560
of someone dad would have sent.

570
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:03,910
♬   Wherever I am filling me with   ♬

571
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:07,950
- I'm back.
- You did well today. 
 ♬   A memory which was lost in space   ♬

572
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:09,730
♬   The memories of a time I turned far away from   ♬

573
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:11,780
I was getting a sip of water and-- 
 ♬   The memories of a time I turned far away from   ♬

574
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:19,570
♬   The memories of a time I turned far away from   ♬

575
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:26,310
♬   Whether it was a matter of something which was forgotten   ♬

576
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:29,930
I'm so tired. 
 ♬   or whether it was matter of going toward somewhere   ♬

577
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:36,110
♬   I’m spending a day once again among the days I dreamed of.   ♬

578
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:39,310
 Good job today.

579
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:42,380
 Yes, I did well today.

580
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:46,190
♬   It might be too late   ♬

581
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:51,210
♬   Maybe in a place that I can’t even go back to   ♬

582
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:58,690
♬   My whole love is alive and breathing.   ♬

583
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:03,590
During those days I was too busy to even talk.

584
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:05,890
♬   That you are my everything   ♬

585
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:08,480
I missed you, ajumma.

586
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:16,200
♬   will stay within us   ♬

587
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:23,050
♬   While being conscious of that and considering that I will hug you   ♬

588
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:31,050

00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:34,340
♬   “We” is the name which was kept next to me   ♬

590
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,690
Rest then.
♬   “We” is the name which was kept next to me   ♬

591
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:44,030
♬   “We” is the name which was kept next to me   ♬

592
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:49,590
♬   With you   ♬

593
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:57,900
♬   With you   ♬

594
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:18,210
There, there.

595
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:22,370
Our Han Na got heavier. Did you get fat or did you get taller?

596
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,460
How can you say that one got fat to a lady?

597
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:28,730
This little bean-sized girl. You have be as old as your mom to be a lady.

598
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:31,440
Forget it. Don't touch me.

599
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,390
Alright, Miss. Let us sit down.

600
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:50,080
Father-in-law, your meal is ready.

601
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,690
Oh.

602
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:01,000
Gang Ja's food has run out, Yeong Soo.

603
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,810
Yes, Father. I'll buy it on my way home.

604
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:12,690
What did I say just now?

605
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:16,020
You called Dad's name.

606
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:21,490
I'm sorry, it's a habit of mine. It happens when you get old like me.

607
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:27,730
It's okay, Father! You can think of me as a son. I like that.

608
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:31,670
You can call me a punk. It's okay.

609
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:43,190
"One punk can't stay quiet because of a scandal and the other punk blows off the fashion show."

610
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:46,590
"Do you guys see how the mall is being viewed in the public's eye?!"

611
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:51,420
"What are you two even doing?!" is what he says.

612
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:56,230
Like Branch Manager Lee Hae Joon has mentioned before, raising the sales up by 130%.

613
00:52:56,230 --> 00:53:02,200
Even so, we need to do something so that Sunjin Mall can get something out of it, right?

614
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,800
If not, there's no method but to put it up for sale.

615
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:06,860
We can't put it up for sale.

616
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:09,470
Don't just say we can't. Take action.

617
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:13,960
I told him to cut employees and he makes longer contracts with them.

618
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,250
I told him to make budget cuts and what did he say again?

619
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:22,300
Massage chair, games, karaoke, sauna, sleeping room, coffee shop for workers,

620
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,510
free and open cafeteria for all employees.

621
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:28,620
From now on, no more buying beer with that money.

622
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:30,250
You have a lot of money.

623
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:36,590
The things written on here are very easy. If we follow even 1/10 of what is on it, the sales will rise.

624
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:48,600
Branch Manager Lee, are you running for election or something?

625
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:55,260
If we reduce our luxury marketing budget and provide higher employee benefits, we can improve the quality of our service.

626
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:58,510
Why? Does this sound absurd?

627
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:01,790
Yes, this much is not enough.

628
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:07,680
For now, we have to change the image of our Sunjin Department Store.

629
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:13,580
Why do you think the image of our Sunjin Department Store, with its long history, was dirtied? Why?

630
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:15,310
Because of whom?

631
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:23,200
Luxury, the kind you and I all know, is not enough.

632
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:28,480
We need reverse marketing. We need to become the hot issue, most talked about and positive image.

633
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,870
And so? What is this reverse marketing that you speak of?

634
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:34,850
Good timing! That's a good question.

635
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:40,900
The sole, aggressive, and unconventional marketing that will raise our Sunjin Department Store again.

636
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:45,660
We'll use Song Yi Yeon as our model.

637
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:02,650
Recently, she earned the nickname justice's goddess, Song Crush, and became

638
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:08,080
the hot issue that grabbed the attention of not just our target customers, women aged 20-50, but also women in their teens.

639
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:12,430
The icon of reversal, who transformed from being hated to the goddess of justice.

640
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:17,510
Anything she wears becomes the "it" item and is sold out.

641
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:25,340
The clothing and accessories she wore today are selling out.

642
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:28,780
These results were created all through word-of-mouth, without any advertising.

643
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:31,390
Branch Manager Lee Hae Joon! Are you joking around right now?!

644
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:32,830
Cha Jae Gook!

645
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:38,570
Song Yi Yeon's scandal... Rumor... And suicide.

646
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:41,370
These are all things involved with Sunjin Department Store.

647
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:46,750
The only person who can break us out of this negative stigma is who? Only Song Yi Yeon can.

648
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:52,890
Realistically, using the divorcee as a model doesn't make any sense!

649
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:56,730
Emphasizing that it's a good relationship, a relationship in which they trust each other as parents.

650
00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:00,720
Didn't you also use the media in the same way?

651
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,540
Even a single parent with a child is still a family.

652
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:09,120
Song Yi Yeon and Sunjin's collaboration will make us look better.

653
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,490
You bastard. Are you crazy!?

654
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:21,020
"Bring Song Yi Yeon as the model", is what he says.

655
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:22,690
Father...

656
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,970
That is an excellent decision!

657
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:34,180
That is an excellent decision!

658
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:45,670
Will you be alright?

659
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:50,780
A pathetic guy who can't even win over a woman's heart and is doing reckless things.

660
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:53,990
We can use this opportunity to reunite them and bring him back to his senses.

661
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:56,180
 The icon of reversal, who transformed from being hated to being the goddess of justice! Anything Song Yi Yeon sells out!!!

662
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,840
Scared me!

663
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:08,390
Explain. No matter how I look at this, this kid is a boy.

664
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:10,130
 How did he get this picture?

665
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:13,800
How? It looks exactly like me!

666
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,540
What's your real identity?

667
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:18,610
It really is me!

668
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,020
The truth is...

669
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:27,880
I completely changed my face.

670
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:28,780
What?

671
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:33,090
I completely changed my face (through plastic surgery). You're too much.

672
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:35,340
So cruel!

673
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:44,650
No... That's not what I...

674
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:49,100
I don't know, I don't know. It hurt.

675
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:53,020
It's a secret from Song Yi Yeon, okay?

676
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:55,520
It hurts my pride.

677
00:58:12,410 --> 00:58:16,900
You had a younger sibling? Why didn't you say anything?

678
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:21,840
When I was younger, my Mother passed away,

679
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:28,250
"for the sake of his safety, raising the kid in private to protect him."

680
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:31,780
This ad lib didn't come out of nowhere.

681
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:35,370
And so? You're not going to find him?

682
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:40,630
I've already buried him in my heart. What would I do if I find him?

683
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:46,320
He's probably living well somewhere.

684
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:57,450
That bastard... Should I beat him up?

685
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:02,590
No thank you! Stop doing that "nananana" thing too!

686
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,330
Did Han Gi Tak really have a younger sibling?

687
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:12,720
Ah yes, I have time. When should I come see you?

688
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:14,960
One moment please.

689
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:43,350

690
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:48,450
 Epilogue

691
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,030
 What are you doing over there?

692
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:05,010
 What is your identity?

693
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,590
 Who sent you? Who?!

694
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:11,820
 Did Cha Jae Gook send you?! Or perhaps my father? Or my Ex?!

695
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:21,950
  Sexy...

696
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,880
 That's nice.
