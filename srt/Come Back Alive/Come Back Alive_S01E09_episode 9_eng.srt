1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,030

2
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,600
Get out this instant!

3
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,540
Why? You said you were lonely! I'll make sure you are not lonely.

4
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,340
Live with me, huh?

5
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,340
Let's live together.

6
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,660
Do you think I came here just to receive my money? I'm the Sunjin Department Store's Branch Manager.

7
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,280
Also, I don't know if you know

8
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,840
- I am Sunjin Group's CEO Cha's hidden son.
- Ohhhh.

9
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,680
As suspected, Yeong Soo's concern is this deep.

10
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,820
He even kept my existence a secret from your family.

11
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:27,080
Yeong Soo Hyungnim's family was like an ideal for me, someone who has lived his entire life as a loner. I've been jealous.

12
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,820
That's why you didn't reveal your true identity.

13
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:35,180
Yes, Father. How could I ignore Hyungnim Yeong Soo's situation?

14
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:41,340
I can gain a place to rest easy, and you guys don't need to move. It's a win-win for all!

15
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,160
You have a lot money. Just go to a hotel!

16
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,640
As a branch manager, I have to realize what it means to live a modest life.

17
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,260
I don't like it. It's uncomfortable having guests here...

18
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,840
- And I can't match Branch Manager's needs, even at home.
- Nuh uh.

19
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:03,120
If I am satisfied with your service, I can give you a bonus. Or if I'm in a good mood, I could pay more rent

20
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,800
or lessen your debt.

21
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:11,540
Then, does that mean I don't have to move or transfer to a new school? Right? Right, mom?

22
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,760
Great!

23
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:21,380
But, isn't that "degree of satisfaction" too subjective?

24
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,820
I'm not super stingy with my compliments.

25
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,040
Ah!

26
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,540
Whenever Ajusshi is feeling good, you can put a compliment sticker on, right?

27
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,290
Sounds good, if I use all these stickers, I'll pay the interest and rent in full.

28
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,290
I'm not that attached to my money.

29
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,900
Mom. Mom...

30
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:53,280
Fine. Instead, if you use all those stickers, you have to leave this house.

31
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,760
Since I'm really picky, eat the foods you regularly eat.

32
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:07,540
Also, treat me like a family member. That's all I want.

33
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:21,260
♬  How much will it change? Will you give a smile as bright as moonlight?   ♬

34
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:29,040
♬  You were always beautiful   ♬

35
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,140
♬  It’s only you who left just me alone. Moonlight   ♬

36
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:41,480
♬  Even though the sleepless times are too long   ♬

37
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,940
♬  I want to experience the day that will get better   ♬

38
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,240
Here. 
 ♬  cuz I’m still waiting for you   ♬

39
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,300
What? Take it quickly. 
 ♬  cuz I’m still waiting for you   ♬

40
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,720
What is this?

41
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,200
It's two month's of advance rent. For now, pay the loan.

42
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,820
There has to be a house for me to live here.

43
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:11,540
Excuse me. 
 ♬  you appear in my sweet dream and I welcome you in my arms   ♬

44
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,240
Thank you, anyway.

45
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,800
What's with the "anyway"?

46
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,140
♬  I wanna stay up all night   ♬

47
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,780
♬   Even though the sleepless times  ♬

48
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:31,060
Well, if you're thankful, make me a cup of cold brew?

49
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:40,220
♬  Cuz I’m still waiting for you   ♬

50
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,450
 Episode 9

51
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,300
What are you doing?

52
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:59,400
Ohh. Good thing you came. Don't go easy on me, and let's fight! Come on!

53
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,540
I heard you went to Cha Jae Gook's house. Please don't make a fuss.

54
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:14,180
You stop making a fuss. You were the one who turned over Yoo Hyeuk to Na Seok Cheol, right?

55
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,340
Mind your own business.

56
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,780
You dragged a man who barely made the decision to live a clean life back into the mud.

57
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:24,740
Don't you feel guilty? I would tell you to find your own life,

58
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:30,900
but I don't know what would happen to Song Yi Yeon. Though I have a lot of thoughts,

59
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,960
just wait a little. I'll get your restaurant back.

60
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:41,700
What is this? Is being nosy your siblings' specialty? Go back.

61
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:47,940
Don't worry. In a month, even if you tell me not to leave, I'm leaving.

62
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,540
That's good.

63
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,280
What is this. Why is she so quiet?

64
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,220
She's such a mom.

65
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:10,800
♬  Even if I close my eyes. Even if I close my eyes again ♬

66
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,840
♬  I can't erase our short memory together ♬

67
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:24,760
♬  I just keep blankly calling your name ♬

68
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:30,780
♬  I love you, I love you  ♬

69
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:36,620
♬  Don't leave me. Don't leave me  ♬

70
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:44,040
♬  A day without you, I feel like I'm going to cry   ♬

71
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:52,560
♬  It hurts so much, I feel like crying honestly   ♬

72
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,020
♬  If I close my eyes again  ♬

73
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:20,460
Good. It feels so good. It feels so good.

74
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:27,200
♬  Another day, another day, I try to get by  ♬

75
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,500
 - Father-in-law, I got water for you already.
- Okay.

76
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,800
Okay, go to bed.
♬  Was I lacking? ♬

77
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,200
Good night, Father.
♬  I'm sorry. ♬

78
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,040
Yeah.

79
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:43,300
♬  I'm sorry. Don't leave me ♬

80
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,220
 This miser, are you going to get at your Mom again?

81
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,600
 I won't! You can't! I'm not going to...

82
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,040
- Are you going to be like that?
- I really won't!

83
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,140
I missed this sound...

84
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:02,280
♬  I feel like crying honestly  ♬

85
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:08,580
♬  When I close my eyes again ♬

86
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:15,440
♬  I love you. I love you. Even if you can't hear me ♬

87
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,560
♬  My heart always love you ♬

88
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,740
♬  You're the only person. I only have you ♬

89
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:36,060
♬  Now, I don't need anything but you ♬

90
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:42,100
♬  Don't send me. Don't leave me ♬

91
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:49,300
♬  A day without you, just makes me want to cry ♬

92
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:55,860
♬  It's hurts too much. It feels like you will come ♬

93
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:01,240
♬  Really, if I close my eyes again ♬

94
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:09,050
♬   If close my eyes again, ♬

95
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,230
♬   I see you  ♬

96
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,960
Look here. Excuse me.

97
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,560
Oh?

98
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,740
I really can't do this.

99
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,180
My Honey. What dream did you have last night?

100
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,500
In my dream, I died.

101
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,580
Are you alright?

102
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:38,010
 I feel like this scary dream where you can't recognize who I am will never end.

103
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,080
 Because I am dead.

104
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,120
You really are too much. Who told you to prepare a grand meal?

105
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,760
Prepare what you usually eat and just add another spoon.

106
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,900
This is what we usually eat.

107
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,940
How funny! The table looks like it's going to break like this, are you going to continue like this?

108
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,690
Excuse me. My daughter-in-law cooked this since early morning. Don't be so hard on her.

109
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:21,430
That's what I mean, Father. Why would she do such a wasteful thing. If I were a family member, would she do the same thing?

110
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,440
Are you satisfied now?

111
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,780
Ahjusshi, what about the grape compliment sticker?

112
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,720
What grape sticker?!

113
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,040
Since when did there was fish and meat for breakfast in this household?

114
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,420
You shouldn't treat a person like he is a stranger.

115
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,420
Is this your car, Ahjusshi?

116
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,120
Of course! Get in.

117
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,920
Amazing, this is exciting!

118
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,860
Excuse me! Han Na!

119
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,880
- How exciting!
- This is exciting!

120
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:21,190

121
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,180
But... Are these my clothes?

122
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,240
"Anyway, I gained 5 Kg."

123
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,630
When was it you said that and gave it to me? Why? Is it wasteful?

124
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,000
Take them off.

125
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,030
You're pretty, Lightning Girl!

126
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,080
Let's change.

127
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,980
Wow.

128
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:12,180
But you know, the place seems familiar.

129
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,810
What?

130
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,220
 Sunjin Department Store

131
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,160
This damn...

132
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,270
Wang Joo Yeon!!

133
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,840
Thanks for the filming location, President.

134
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,260
It wasn't me who did it.

135
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,740
Lee Hae Joon made the decision...

136
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,220
Branch Manager, I think you have a misunderstanding about us.

137
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,680
Since I was born, I have never once taken a bribe, but

138
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,360
since I was migratory bird's Father, just once, I mean just once...

139
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,540
Tell those kind of excuses to President Cha, but in any case,

140
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:12,140
even if you die by working hard, our company takes no responsibility for it.

141
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,960
Hello Branch Manager.

142
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,540
Now! Everyone, play! Play.

143
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:26,400
"This damn department store. What's the use in working hard for the store? Who told you to work hard?" That's all you are going to hear.

144
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,760
So, let's take it easy. Easy.

145
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,690
We are living in a world where hardworking people are suckers.

146
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:36,380
CEO, you can't say those kinds of things here as a part of the  Royal Family.

147
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,960
- Yeong Eun.
- Yes, Branch Manager?

148
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,220
Here. Sit down. Are your back discs okay?

149
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,250
No. I mean, yes.

150
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,460
Branch Manager, our employees cannot sit down in the store.

151
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,340
Have you ever stood for ten hours in a department store?

152
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,020
No.

153
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,620
Rest. Rest well.

154
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,140
Yes.

155
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,630
Here, eat this and live. Say ah.

156
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:08,200
Branch Manager, eating is— Eat only a little.

157
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,380
Branch Manager...!

158
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,280
If you die, it's all over. Take care of yourself first.

159
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,420
If your legs hurt, you sit down. If you're hungry, then eat.

160
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,950
If you want to sleep, you sleep. Rest.

161
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,420
Just what he is up to?

162
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,850
Because he wanted to become the president, he was using the deceased guy...

163
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,220
What do you mean? He is the just one who revealed the wrongful deed.

164
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,060
He's just my style!

165
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,800
A superior who was concerned about my back, it was the first time.

166
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,380
Are you still angry with me?

167
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,520
Wang Joo Yeon.

168
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:08,400
If you have the time to be doing this, go practice your acting skills

169
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,560
so you won't just repeat the script line by line.

170
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,800
There should be a special guest today. Come have a look.

171
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,180
Hello Director.

172
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,320
Oh Actress Song. Are you really okay with this kind of a role?

173
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:36,360
Of course. Since the debut, because I got so famous all of a sudden, I always wanted to get a role like this.

174
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,120
Are you really okay at this department store?

175
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,700
I am okay. That's okay. I'm really okay.

176
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,620
Me too.

177
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,580
Why is this woman so late?

178
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,780
Branch Manager, I brought the gift.

179
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,320
We're late. Come here.

180
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,120
- Where? Where are we going?
- For now, get in.

181
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,420
Today, I'm going to throw a really grand lunch.

182
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,660
There are no spots open if we're late, so let's depart.

183
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,820
 Hong Ik Restaurant

184
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,180
What are you doing? Why aren't you coming in?

185
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,340
Welcome.

186
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:33,300
Is this the place that you ate with that Jeong bastard? What did you eat? Let's order the exact same thing.

187
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,920
What are you doing?

188
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,000
I didn't come to play.

189
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,660
You should know my taste preference so that you can give me proper service.

190
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,620
Understand?

191
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,060
Excuse me.

192
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,340
Enjoy.

193
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,060
Let's eat.

194
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,720
It's been a long time since the two of us ate together.

195
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,140
But it's our first time.

196
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:19,600
When I ate, there was always a person who watched over me.

197
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,620
Meat. Meat.

198
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:36,050
♬  Do I know you?   ♬

199
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:42,180
♬  The time I saw you, the time I talked to you  ♬

200
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:47,980
From now on, let's eat together more often.

201
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,740
♬  Everyday is  ♬

202
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:55,240
♬  The things you have  ♬

203
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,090
♬  Your bright smile. Like a winter night  ♬

204
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:04,540
♬  It melts me, and things I'm unsure about  ♬

205
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:08,950
♬  I smile all day because of you  ♬

206
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:12,780
♬  For you and for me   ♬

207
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:20,060
♬  I will protect you forever. No matter how much time passes  ♬

208
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,380
♬  No matter what happens   ♬

209
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:28,220
♬  I won't lose you   ♬

210
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:38,560
What's with that look? You're going to walk around my department store looking like that?

211
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:43,440
What's wrong with this look? Is it too beautiful?

212
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,960
Now you don't have any shame and have thrown away your dignity, huh?

213
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,180
I've never thrown away my dignity.

214
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,800
What are you so confident about all the time?

215
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,760
Good work everyone! I am the branch manager.

216
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,180
Han Hyung.

217
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:09,050
Hi. How's the new living arrangement?

218
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,140
No well, it's okay.

219
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:15,970
Are you... staying up all night?

220
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:20,850
I made some progress. We just had lunch together.

221
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,410
That's amazing. What did you eat?

222
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,540
Spicy beef and vegetable soup.

223
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,770
You dumbass.

224
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:30,860
Why? Da Hye said she liked it but couldn't eat it because we don't have it.

225
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,760
Do you want to get your act together after I beat you up? Get over here, you punk.

226
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,450
- Why are you doing this?
- Punk!

227
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,380
The kid is watching!

228
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,750
Where did you throw the child away that you're walking around looking like this?

229
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,580
Dad!

230
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,710
C-Cha Yong Chan!h

231
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:08,430
W-Well, how did this happen?

232
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:12,630
Our Yong Chan came over to see Mom and Dad's workplace, right?

233
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:17,610
Uncle gave me this. This.

234
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:24,640
He did? He gave you something great.

235
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:30,560
I'll do the filming well, so don't worry and go.

236
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,600
Let's go.

237
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:50,820
Don't mess with my family.

238
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:56,640
If you know how valuable your family is, how could you do that to Kim Yeong Soo?

239
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,950
Ready? Action!

240
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,730
Just give me a chance.

241
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,770
You look good, those clothes suit you.

242
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,810
Don't be discouraged and live diligently.

243
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:34,590
But don't ever appear before my eyes again.

244
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:42,010
Why these people— I'll just!

245
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,350
What are you going to cause this time?

246
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,320
Let go!

247
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,440
Those clothes suit you.

248
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,850
Don't be discouraged and live diligently.

249
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:59,720
Huh what's this? Cut cut cut!

250
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:05,140
You over there, get out of there.

251
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:12,690
Come out from there!

252
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:21,830
Actress Song! You are beautiful! Fighting!

253
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:24,990
You're beautiful!

254
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:30,260
Ready? Action!

255
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,220
Director!

256
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,890
Cut, cut, cut!

257
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,860
- Pay attention!
- I understand.

258
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,390
I'm sorry!

259
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:12,180
You're a distracting minor character.

260
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:15,540
You are so much prettier than the main character.

261
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:21,020
You're sexy, adorable, elegant, and confident!

262
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:25,620
You're the best!

263
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,450
You're so pretty.

264
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:31,210
Should I kick them off the set?

265
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:37,000
No, let them enjoy themselves for now.

266
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,370
- Can you get this here?
- Here?

267
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,930
So sour!

268
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,320
Ahjumma, what's the menu for tonight's dinner?

269
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,670
What are you saying, Branch Manager?

270
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:17,670
What should I do? When you go home tonight, should we go together?

271
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,830
No, I'm fine.

272
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:24,170
Aren't you scared to go by yourself? Won't you be lonely?

273
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:32,100
Isn't this sexual harassment?

274
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:32,730
What?

275
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:36,920
Can I see you for a moment? Follow me.

276
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,590
F-Fine then.

277
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,710
- Hey, Lee Hae Joon.
- Hey?

278
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:56,310
Am I easy? Am I so easy that you can follow me around annoying me?

279
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,210
Annoying you?

280
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:02,060
Yes, annoying me.

281
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,630
Are all rich people certified to be rude punks?

282
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:09,460
My husband owed you money, not me! I have nothing to be ashamed in front of you.

283
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,530
Do you have a problem?

284
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:16,360
If you're bothered then fire me or get out of my house!

285
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,790
No, Ma'am.

286
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:23,190
Also, you. How old are you anyway?

287
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,850
A little bit younger than you...

288
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:30,100
You don't even look old and you're talking to me informally. Be careful.

289
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:40,230

290
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,480
Get out of my way! I need to leave.

291
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,230
Yes, Ma'am.

292
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,350
She's so cool. No, no.

293
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:23,170
Good job, Shin Da Hye. Show him that you're not so easy to get.

294
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:27,340
But he's not going to fire me, is he?

295
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,700
Are you alright?

296
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,230
Yes, I'm fine.

297
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,940
Work hard then.

298
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,760
Ah yes. You too.

299
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,320
It's an honor to have you call me to the department store.

300
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,240
What's Hong Nan's identity?

301
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,880
What's her relationship with Lee Hae Joon and Song Yi Yeon that the three of them are around together.

302
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,840
The truth is, there was a guy under Han Gi Tak—

303
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,950
Han Gi Tak?

304
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:50,960
Yes, they say that she's a younger sister that grew up in the same orphanage.

305
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,670
I will look into it right away.

306
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:58,720
But President, how is the sale of the department store going?

307
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,630
That doesn't seem like a question that you should be asking me.

308
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:11,790
But you need to succeed in order for me the succeed. That's the business matter that you promised, too.

309
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:16,000
We began as a construction company and have a strong—

310
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,700
That may work among your rough friends. Also,

311
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:26,010
if you have the time to come here and get on my nerves, just watch the kids well.

312
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,330
Useless.

313
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,060
I'll see you again.

314
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:38,960
Also, don't appear out of nowhere.

315
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:43,290
I thought you were a thrown out newspaper and almost stepped on it.

316
00:30:56,110 --> 00:31:00,520
He sure does step over me with kindness even today.

317
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,940
But how am I a thrown out newspaper? I might be a thrown out refrigerator.

318
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,800
That bastard sure is charming.

319
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,090
This is my first time eating rice cake at a place like this.

320
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,490
It's really good. Yong Chan, say ah.

321
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,030
- How is it?
- Wow, it's really delicious!

322
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,890
Is that so? Eat a lot, my baby.

323
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,230
You guys get so excited over nothing.

324
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:45,470
Our actress Song, you worked hard today. Eat a lot. Eat!

325
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:49,700
Eat! Here, eat more. Say ah.

326
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,880
So pretty!

327
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,500
Stop giving me so much.

328
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,870
Aigoo, my Seung Jae too. Say ah!

329
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,780
Department Head...
- Let's go.

330
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,990
 Hey, aren't you hungry?

331
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,370
Have a seat.

332
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,430
Just one moment.

333
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:47,210

334
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:58,240
Because of my husband's matter, I imposed a lot on you, Department Head Jeong.

335
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,950
It was my mistake. If I made you think otherwise, I'm sorry.

336
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:15,440
Does she think she's Cinderella or something?

337
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,980
So did you turn away stupidly, Kim Yeong Soo?

338
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,730
What else can I do?

339
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:26,340
At the time when Yi Yeon ran off to that guy,

340
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,130
ten years ago, that day...

341
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:31,120
Is it tasty, my child?

342
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:35,680
If I had been a guy with a bit more courage, how different it could have been...

343
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,900
That's what I regret.

344
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,970
Hey! Getting her stolen away by another man,

345
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:44,580
are you going to cry blood tears like I did?

346
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,830
Stolen? Who had her stolen?

347
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,070
 Like a man, let it out.

348
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:51,220
You're not even in a woman's body.

349
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:54,160
Hello Branch Manager.

350
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:02,370
Right, I am no longer Kim Yeong Soo. I am Lee Hae Joon.

351
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,100
Shin Da Hye.

352
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,510
That person, why is he...

353
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,870
Listen carefully to what I'm about to tell you.

354
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:21,590
Yes, yes. I planned to prepare dinner with vegetables.

355
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,940
I'm not going to wait for you to look at me any longer.

356
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:28,470
Don't wait. I'm not going home together with you.

357
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,430
Shin Da Hye.

358
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:36,160
I have a request, please stop being so interested in me.

359
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:00,040
If I was going to stop, I wouldn't have come.

360
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:08,270
♬   Moonlight  ♬

361

362
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,190

♬  I want to experience the day that will get better   ♬

363
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,620
Get off...

364
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:25,900
That's not it.
♬  cuz I’m still waiting for you   ♬

365
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,500
Why are you being like this to me?

366
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,410
Didn't you like it?

367
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,830
This crazy...

368
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,510
You swore! You swore!

369
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:26,390
This is driving me crazy.

370
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:30,630
Han Hyung, I did what you told me to do and I almost broke my wife's back!

371
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:34,040
I said to do it like a man, not to break her back.

372
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,570
- Really? Then what do I do? 
 - Doing things by step by step,

373
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:42,590
we don't have time for that. You should do things that you weren't able to do, at all cost.

374
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:11,770
♬  Lovin' you is easy 'cause you're beautiful   ♬

375
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:19,410
♬   Makin' love with you is all I want to do  ♬

376
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:27,140

377

♬  And everything that I do   ♬

378
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:32,060
It's just a dream but it tastes good.

379
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,720
♬  is out of lovin' you   ♬

380

382
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,530

  ♬

383
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,310
Good morning.

384
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:15,130
What is all of this? What are you doing?

385
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:19,440
It's a gift to you. Since the mall is closed today, just rest with ease.

386
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,860
Here, here. Prepare food and clean the living room.

387
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,860
Do things on you own. This goes to the living room. No, not there.

388
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:31,240
There's no room in the living room, take it upstairs. Move move move!

389
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:44,630
When your back hurts you need this.

390
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:47,740
Sit down, put your arms in...

391
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:52,420
Feels refreshing!

392
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:55,670
Father, if your back hurts, come upstairs whenever you want.

393
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:59,700
Excuse me! I don't like it when strangers disturb our way of living.

394
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,870
Kick everyone out!

395
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,620
We'll take care of everything so rest.

396
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:21,700
Daughter-in-law, we'll do everything!

397
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:26,310
It looks tasty.

398
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:28,360
Should we eat?

399
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:39,630
It's bland.

400
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:42,020
- No, it's not! 
- No, it's not salty.

401
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,680
- It's not salty.
- No!

402
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,070
Let's take a look!

403
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,290
Next we need to put Han Na inside.

404
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,520
Go in.

405
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:07,400
Hey. Fight me. I said fight me!

406
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,420
Are you scared?

407
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:13,070
Have a taste of my fist.

408
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,250
Here.

409
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,730
Oh, Honey.

410
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:25,930
What? You put mayonnaise in soy bean paste soup?

411
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:29,880
How do we save that? Crazy. That's dead.

412
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,320
Even if Maya came, she wouldn't be able to save it.

413
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:36,740
You mess up her back first and now you want to mess up her stomach?

414
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:40,310
Forget it, I'll take responsibility for that meal.

415
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:41,860
I'm on my way right now.

416
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:46,750
Aren't you crazy? Are you saying you're going to his house to cook for him?

417
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:49,960
No. You and the Cha's Family can't work.

418
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:55,060
It's not that. I need to save that ignorant cook.

419
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,050
It's like loyalty.

420
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:58,760
Loyalty, my butt.

421
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,550
This won't do.

422
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:05,060
I need to confirm with my own eyes how that guy really is.

423
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:08,820
No wait.,

424
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:12,570
You two. Where are you going?

425
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:18,050
Hello, Father.

426
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:19,880
Ah yes.

427
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:25,330
This is the nationally known Actress Song. You know her right?

428
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:26,490
Hello.

429
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:29,080
Ah yes.

430
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,700
This person is not a stranger per se, but if I were to say it in one word...

431
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:37,100
To put it in other words. She's like a family friend. My only friend.

432
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:41,840
Yes, sister-in-law. We're just friends.

433
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,540
I did well right Honey?

434
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,190
Ta da!

435
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,720
This person doesn't like flowers.

436
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,350
Oh my! They're so pretty!

437
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:59,880
So she likes flowers!

438
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:03,900
Then should I start with what I came for?

439
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,290
The kitchen is...

440
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:54,290

441
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,670
Wow, you're very fast.

442
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:03,690
Well I'm actually a chef— I mean I have the chef's blood flowing in my veins.

443
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:06,500
- Isn't that right?
- But...

444
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,100
Why do you live here, Branch Manager?

445
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,680
Ah... That's...

446
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,190
He's a loan shark. He's afraid we'll sell the house and run away.

447
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:16,220
That family obsesses really hard.

448
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:20,700
Ah n-no. I know this person very well, and

449
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,700
this person is very...

450
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,200
You can't go easy.

451
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:30,200
is very... very...

452
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,400
Very... Very...!

453
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,300
Handsome.

454
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,830
He got taller and

455
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:46,100
got chocolate abs!

456
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:50,180
That's the most important thing. Right here is really

457
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:53,740
the body of a mode—

458
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,700
Why are you doing this?

459
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:58,390
This is a bird's name.

460
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:02,580
Goose. Ibis. Pigeon.

461
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:07,110
Wild goose. Wood pecker.

462
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:09,350
Bulbul. (In this sense, porn.)

463
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:14,780
Food tastes the best when you make it yourself!

464
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:20,610
They're straight up filming a melodrama here.

465
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:22,000
It's delicious.

466
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,150
Mom, what is a bulbul?

467
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:28,790
- What do we do?
- Bulbul?

468
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:31,640
What did you say?

469
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:36,200
It's sparrow's good friend.

470
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:40,560
Those men.

471
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:47,320
No no! You can't look at it!

472
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,300
No! Share it first, then delete it.

473
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,700
No! It's a matter of honor.

474
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:53,870
What do you mean?!

475
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:55,720
No!

476
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:01,980
No!

477
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:04,500
Get out of my way!

478
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:07,070
This isn't right.

479
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:09,050
You punk!

480
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,500
What kind of move is this?

481
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,040
So...

482
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,590
What are you doing here?

483
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:35,310
Do you want to drink alcohol with me?

484
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:37,040
You can't.

485
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:43,730
What's this sound?

486
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,550
Ah Roxy.

487
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,840
Don't be like this.

488
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,320
Don't delete it.

489
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:18,400
What? Why are you doing this?

490
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,630
Share it...with me.

491
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:28,320
Don't do this. I already have a mate.

492
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,880
Do you want to be friends with me?

493
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,790
Pardon?

494
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:34,620
You don't have friend right? I don't either.

495
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,150
Alright.

496
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:42,830
I asked for us to watch it together! Is that so hard to do!?

497
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:45,310
Nooooo!

498
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:56,010
It's something I really need. I'm getting confused about my identity.

499
00:47:56,010 --> 00:48:02,990
Look at me. I keep going back and forth.

500
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:07,610
I promise that I'll get you something different. Don't cry.

501
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:10,000
Who's crying?

502
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:37,730
Eighteen plus,

503
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:41,350
five is...?

504
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:43,390
Twenty three!

505
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,570
You are correct!

506
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:50,450
Our Han Na sure is good at playing with younger kids.

507
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:56,350
Yong Chan is so cute! I wanted a younger sibling like this.

508
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:03,540
My dad said that I didn't need a sibling.

509
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:07,380
He said that he didn't want to split his love between children and just give it all to me.

510
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:10,660
He said he only needed Han Na (could also mean just one child).

511
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:13,860
I see.

512
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:18,450
Then be Yong Chan's older sister.

513
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:20,490
Really? Can I?

514
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:24,970
Of course! You're fine with it right, Yong Chan?

515
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,350
Time to eat! Let's eat!

516
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:32,540
Father, here's your rice tea.

517
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,970
Right, thanks.

518
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:40,550
Eat this, Han Na.

519
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,280
Yes.

520
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,130
Eat a lot.

521
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:47,700
Okay.

522
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,340
Is it good?

523
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:59,680
Eat a lot and grow.

524
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,500
Grow and grow.

525
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:11,400
Eat a lot, Ahjusshi!

526
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,460
Thanks.

527
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:17,460
What? You don't like carrots?

528
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:24,270
No, I'm good at eating.

529
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:27,280
Here, our Han Na too. Eat a lot.

530
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,270
Okay.

531
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:34,060
Tastes good.

532
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,780
Father, eat this too.

533
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:52,010
Aigoo, our Han Na needs to eat this delicious food.

534
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:53,220
You like fish.

535
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:58,530
Since your back hurts, eat a lot, Mom.

536
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:03,350
Aigoo, so pretty. You eat it, Han Na.

537
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:06,690
No, you eat it, Mom.

538
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:12,380
What are you doing instead of eating, when you are at growing age.

539
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:14,120
Eat up.

540
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,200
Yes.

541
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:26,020
Father, if he grows any more he'll pierce through the ceiling!

542
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:28,730
We can use him as a pole then.

543
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:31,930
Then I'll leave him and you can use him as a pole.

544
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,650
Eat a lot!

545
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:54,260
Did your husband, by chance, work at Sunjin Department Store?

546
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:55,600
Yes.

547
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:59,160
While I was a star and a divorced person,

548
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,040
he was the only one who treated me the same.

549
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:08,260
Oh, there's one other person. Lee Hae Joon.

550
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:17,720
That's right, you're doing well, Han Na.

551
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:21,060
There we go. No that's too short.

552
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:23,970
Once more. There we go. Here too.

553
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:26,700
Wow, you're good!

554
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,650
I'll say farewell here.

555
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:44,820
Let's be friends—those weren't empty words.

556
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:47,100
Please come over again.

557
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,710
See you again, Sister-in-law.

558
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:51,150
You won't see her again.

559
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:54,240
Let's go.

560
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,420
Get home safely.

561
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,930
Rest well.

562
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,830
Go home safely.

563
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:13,650
Let's go back too.

564
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:16,510
Let's go get a drink somewhere.

565
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:21,160
Don't worry about the kid and Father, since he falls asleep as soon as his head touches the pillow.

566
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,380
I don't want to drink by myself.

567
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:29,880
Then I'll decide on the menu.

568
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,930
Okay.

569
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:37,560
Hae Joon seems to be a good person.

570
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:41,290
He's a great guy.

571
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:44,020
- But he won't do.
- What won't do?

572
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,430
Don't get involved with Sunjin.

573
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:49,200
Once you get involved with Sunjin—

574
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:56,750
Me? Be with Hae Joon?

575
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:58,040
Never.

576
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:02,290
Then, what is it? The woman he likes is...

577
00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:03,860
Is it that woman?

578
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:08,030
The truth is, he and her late husband

579
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:10,270
were very close.

580
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:14,180
Is it like, "My Mother and Her Guest"?

581
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:30,220
Ahjussi, do you like boiled eggs too?

582
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:42,910

583
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:47,820
I like boiled eggs too.

584
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:53,480
After a long time, they're holding each other.

585
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:57,510
Ahjusshi, I think my ribs broke.

586
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:00,850
Let's date. Come here.

587
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:03,430
You are so cool.

588
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:06,830
I will embrace you.

589
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:08,720
My ribs!

590
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:13,300
I'll hold you until your ribs break!

591
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:15,960
Come here!

592
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:21,430
The tender pork bones are good here.

593
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:23,380
I don't like pork.

594
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:25,060
You like pork belly though.

595
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:26,800
Pork belly?

596
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,880
My husband liked it, I don't really like it.

597
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,490
- Give us chicken feet over here! 
- Okay!

598
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,980
Don't you have a family?

599
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:05,620
My mother passed away when I was very young.

600
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:07,880
My father is around but...

601
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:12,070
I can't call him my father.

602
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:16,690
Do you have someone you love?

603
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,920
There was one.

604
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:25,090
For ten years, I thought we were a good match.

605
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:28,060
I realized that it wasn't the case for that person.

606
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:31,210
If everything I knew was a lie

607
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:35,360
what becomes of my love?

608
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:38,530
One side was accommodating everything for you.

609
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:43,620
If it was for ten years, wasn't it really hard?

610
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:57,390
You're also different from what I've heard.

611
00:56:57,390 --> 00:56:59,190
What did he say about me?

612
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:00,900
That you can't drink at all.

613
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:04,750
It's not that I can't, I just didn't.

614
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:09,520
When I can't fall asleep, three shots is good enough.

615
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,000
One, two!

616
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:49,090
It hurts!

617
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:25,690
Regardless of what he said, don't make us waver since we are just barely trying to live on.

618
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:27,380
Don't waver.

619
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:31,160
You may like being nice to us for the time being,

620
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,690
but to us, it's our daily lives.

621
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:40,500
It's up to us... to live without Yeong Soo.

622
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:45,100
Who will take that spot?

623
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:48,360
- That's not something you should be wo—
- Can't I do it?

624
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:54,730
Can't I like you, ajumma?

625
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:16,370
♬  The image of me crying  ♬

626
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:19,020
♬  The foolish image of myself  ♬

627
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:24,380
♬  I hate the sun that shines so brightly  ♬

628
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:27,020
♬  If anyone recognizes me  ♬

629
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:29,660
♬  If they ask why I'm crying  ♬

630
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:33,940
♬  I hated that I couldn't answer them  ♬

631
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:37,750
♬  Because I wanted to avoid the sun  ♬

632
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:41,170
♬  No matter how hard I ran  ♬

633
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:44,670
♬  The sun was always overhead  ♬

634
00:59:44,670 --> 00:59:48,340
♬  I really wanted to forget you   ♬

635
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:54,790
It's fire!
♬   No matter how hard I tried  ♬

♬  I want to live properly   ♬

637
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:15,940
 Please Come Back, Mister
 ~Preview~

638
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:19,210
 I don't have much time left. Will you do it with me?

639
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:20,610
 - Revenge?
- No!

640
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:23,100
 You can't say the word revenge so lightly!

641
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:25,640
 - I can do everything that Da Hye wants.
- What would that be?

642
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,530
 - Stop!
- Why did you appear here?

643
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:28,570
 I came to find that.

644
01:00:28,570 --> 01:00:30,330
 If I bite once, I never let go.

645
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:32,220
 Why isn't your mom calling?

646
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:34,130
 - Song Yi Yeon!
- I'm sorry.

647
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,360
 No!

648
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:40,340
 I was so busy I forgot to say it. I missed you, Ajumma.
