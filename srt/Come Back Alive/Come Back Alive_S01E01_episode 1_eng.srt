1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,970

2
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:06,993
I guess I went a little too far yesterday.

3
00:01:06,993 --> 00:01:10,373
No wait. I didn't even drink a single drop.

4
00:01:12,023 --> 00:01:14,293
Where is my cellphone?

5
00:01:14,293 --> 00:01:17,853
My wallet? I think I got robbed.

6
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:21,433
My wife will kill me for this.

7
00:01:24,593 --> 00:01:29,003
Either way, I am in big trouble. There is a bargain sale going on.

8
00:01:29,003 --> 00:01:31,013
 - Episode 1 - 
I am in big trouble for being late. How can I lose my wallet at a time like this?

9
00:01:31,013 --> 00:01:34,523
Where in the heck am I anyway?

10
00:01:44,423 --> 00:01:46,833
What killer weather this is?

11
00:01:47,963 --> 00:01:52,383
Wait a minute. The weather report said it will be snowing all over the country today.

12
00:01:57,713 --> 00:02:01,113
Excuse me. You there.

13
00:02:01,113 --> 00:02:05,933
Ahjusshi. Excuse me sir.

14
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:07,953
Excuse me, Ahjusshi.

15
00:02:18,543 --> 00:02:20,433
Who the hell are you?

16
00:02:25,183 --> 00:02:26,993
You bastard. Tell me where I am now.

17
00:02:26,993 --> 00:02:29,773
You are the one that railed me, right? Who sent you? Tell me.

18
00:02:29,773 --> 00:02:32,063
Why the heck am I here?

19
00:02:32,063 --> 00:02:33,823
I would like to ask that question myself.

20
00:02:33,823 --> 00:02:36,563
I don't know either, so please let go of me because it hurts.

21
00:02:36,563 --> 00:02:38,133
What is this?

22
00:02:52,283 --> 00:02:54,673
Ah seriously.

23
00:03:03,543 --> 00:03:08,653
Excuse me sir. I would like to know where this is.

24
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:14,963
 Bardo (In Buddhism, a state of transtion between life and death) 
 ←This life. Afterlife. →

25
00:03:14,963 --> 00:03:18,733
"Bardo"? What kind of place is this anyway?

26
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:20,913
He says we are in the nether world.

27
00:03:25,463 --> 00:03:27,323
 Heaven
Hell

28
00:03:27,323 --> 00:03:30,683
We are apparently dead.

29
00:03:55,603 --> 00:04:02,103
On January 25th, 2016, I was perfectly dead.

30
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:39,033
 Kim Young Soo.
2 days before death

31
00:04:58,003 --> 00:05:02,833
You shouldn't be like this. How many times do I have to tell you to give me a refund!?

32
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:06,453
Look at my eyes while I'm talking to you. What is your name anyway?

33
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:07,863
I wore this only once.

34
00:05:07,863 --> 00:05:10,113
It was already like this when I originally bought it. If I knew that it was gonna get dirty so fast,

35
00:05:10,113 --> 00:05:11,683
I wouldn't have bought this in the first place.

36
00:05:11,683 --> 00:05:13,443
Customer, I'm so sorry for the inconvenience,

37
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:16,493
but it would be difficult for you to get a refund since you only wore it once.

38
00:05:16,493 --> 00:05:19,013
It would be difficult? Am I talking about female literary works right now?

39
00:05:19,013 --> 00:05:22,113
I want a refund! I said to return my money right now!

40
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:25,763
- I cannot do that, Customer.
- You laugh? Do I look funny to you?

41
00:05:25,763 --> 00:05:29,353
- No ma'am. 
- I am so flipping mad right now.

42
00:05:29,353 --> 00:05:34,153
Okay, why don't we go have a talk somewhere. Come here. I said come here!

43
00:05:34,153 --> 00:05:37,103
- Hurry up and come here!
- Please calm down, Customer and...

44
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,753
- Hey You!
- Please calm down ma'am.

45
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,653
"Sales have hit the bottom

46
00:05:55,653 --> 00:05:59,953
and all you are doing is pouring money into all sorts of places! What in the world are you doing?!"

47
00:05:59,953 --> 00:06:03,673
"Are you playing house with my mall here?!". That is what he is saying.

48
00:06:03,673 --> 00:06:06,253
I am doing my best on my own but...

49
00:06:15,313 --> 00:06:18,903
He doesn't want to hear any more talk from you, but he would like you to show some results instead.

50
00:06:18,903 --> 00:06:21,273
- How is the open bar going?
- Not so good.

51
00:06:21,273 --> 00:06:23,973
It's alright, man, this is only the beginning.

52
00:06:27,023 --> 00:06:30,653
Aigoo, quit that. Be careful with the way you stare.

53
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:32,933
What you are doing is almost like a disease, Hyung.

54
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:36,603
I am so stressed because of brand name-seeking customers, so all I'm able to see is our women's clothing.

55
00:06:36,603 --> 00:06:39,843
Then what about that woman and the kid over there?

56
00:06:39,843 --> 00:06:41,603
What?

57
00:06:46,253 --> 00:06:49,263
Let's see here.

58
00:06:49,263 --> 00:06:52,013
Even the surface seems so... Hmmm...

59
00:07:06,443 --> 00:07:07,853
-Excuse me ma'am
- Oh, Hon--

60
00:07:07,853 --> 00:07:10,433
- Daddy.

61
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:13,863
Continue walking please. What brings you here?

62
00:07:13,863 --> 00:07:16,113
- That is...
- Did you come here to get the toilet paper?

63
00:07:16,113 --> 00:07:17,983
I told you not to do this here.

64
00:07:17,983 --> 00:07:21,653
I won't make it obvious that I am your wife, who is looking for a handsome man, so go back and do your job.

65
00:07:21,653 --> 00:07:23,433
I was able to get stuff on sale because I came to visit here.

66
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:26,153
If they see the toilet paper, then they would think that I brought you here to get them on sale.

67
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:30,183
I was going to go before I got caught by you anyway.

68
00:07:37,303 --> 00:07:40,003
You acting like this is making it more obvious you know.

69
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:47,253
Stop it already. Look at mom's face. Nobody would think that you guys are a couple when Dad looks like that.

70
00:07:47,253 --> 00:07:50,403
- Hey, are you really my daughter or what?
- Humph.

71
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:53,083
You should leave now. I have to go back to work.

72
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:57,753
Oh yeah,. Is this the only kind of clothes you have at home?

73
00:07:57,753 --> 00:08:01,243
Okay, let's hurry up and get moving.

74
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,193
Oh sorry, sir.

75
00:08:06,773 --> 00:08:09,143
Sorry, Mr. President.

76
00:08:11,413 --> 00:08:13,093
Get out.

77
00:08:14,063 --> 00:08:15,363
Sorry, sir.

78
00:08:15,363 --> 00:08:19,473
It's okay, it was just an accident.

79
00:08:34,353 --> 00:08:36,663
Ah seriously. I should just.

80
00:08:46,373 --> 00:08:48,153
Hurry up and go.

81
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:04,693
What?
 Wedding Anniversary. I should live!

82
00:09:05,843 --> 00:09:09,953
What is it? Is this why they came?

83
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,923
Oh my goodness. What to do?

84
00:09:13,923 --> 00:09:17,983
What to do? I didn't even make a restaurant reservation. What am I to do now?

85
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:21,683
Should I go get some pork belly or something?

86
00:09:21,683 --> 00:09:25,863
Forget that. I will recommend a place that's HOT instead.

87
00:09:27,653 --> 00:09:31,183
 LET'S LIVE WITH LEGITIMACY.

88
00:09:35,773 --> 00:09:37,183
 Han Gi Tak

89
00:09:45,613 --> 00:09:48,593
There we go. Here you are.

90
00:09:50,053 --> 00:09:51,343
- Hey Boss.
- What?

91
00:09:51,343 --> 00:09:52,723
They said the meat was too too tough to chew.

92
00:09:52,723 --> 00:09:54,473
Just tell them to chew it well.

93
00:09:54,473 --> 00:09:55,433
- Hey Boss.
- What?

94
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:56,823
They said that the soup is too hot.

95
00:09:56,823 --> 00:09:58,873
Just tell them blow on it to cool it down and then eat it.

96
00:09:58,873 --> 00:10:01,993
- Hey Boss. 
- Ah s*it! Now what?!

97
00:10:01,993 --> 00:10:04,173
They said that it's delicious.

98
00:10:04,173 --> 00:10:06,613
They said that it's good!

99
00:10:12,643 --> 00:10:15,743
- Excuse me.
- Yes, Customer.

100
00:10:15,743 --> 00:10:18,323
I have a favor to ask.

101
00:10:18,323 --> 00:10:22,693
Table number 7 is a strange guest.

102
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:25,693
He wants us to make a dessert with this thing here.

103
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:28,133
How are we going to make it when we don't even have any dessert here?

104
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:31,273
What should we do with this? Should we stir fry it or steam it?

105
00:10:31,273 --> 00:10:33,443
- Just enjoy the moment.
- Hyungnim.

106
00:10:33,443 --> 00:10:37,273
On my path to life, I, to accommodate other...

107
00:10:37,273 --> 00:10:38,473
Yes, President.

108
00:10:38,473 --> 00:10:43,363
Boil that just a bit since it's too tough to chew.

109
00:10:57,813 --> 00:10:59,873
Number 7?

110
00:11:00,783 --> 00:11:07,753

111
00:11:11,873 --> 00:11:17,553
This is such expensive food but they give you that much? 
We'll be done eating in just a few bites.

112
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:19,143
Really...

113
00:11:19,143 --> 00:11:23,883
I know right? For this amount, our family of four can eat enough pork belly that our stomachs would burst.

114
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:27,683
Right? With this kind of money, we can eat until our stomach is full, even with domestic Korean pork belly.

115
00:11:27,683 --> 00:11:32,033
All these are probably imported; these are even subject to duty.

116
00:11:32,033 --> 00:11:36,803
This is all part of the service. Let's order a lot of water.

117
00:11:39,293 --> 00:11:42,463
What? You want more water?

118
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,673
- Should I order more? 
- You have such a strange skill.

119
00:11:45,673 --> 00:11:49,883
When I'm with you, even if I am eating escargot in France,

120
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:53,333
it will feel like I'll be eating conch at home.

121
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,203
That's right. You're saying that you want to eat pork belly from now on, right?

122
00:11:56,203 --> 00:11:58,863
Yeah, that's right.

123
00:11:58,863 --> 00:12:01,453
As expected, it's my wife...

124
00:12:12,463 --> 00:12:14,143
Let's eat, eat.

125
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:20,013
K-K-Keep on eating.

126
00:12:20,013 --> 00:12:24,103
The department store can't function without me.

127
00:12:24,103 --> 00:12:26,273
Really... Keep on eating.

128
00:12:37,783 --> 00:12:41,443
 Oppa, it's Yi Yeon. Pick up the phone please.

129
00:12:58,643 --> 00:13:03,333
What? Does Department Head Ma want you to drive him somewhere?

130
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,753
- It's a notice of death.
- A funeral notice?

131
00:13:05,753 --> 00:13:08,993
It's Park Hwan Cheul's relative.

132
00:13:08,993 --> 00:13:10,693
His first uncle.

133
00:13:13,613 --> 00:13:15,873
Aiyoo, don't worry!

134
00:13:15,873 --> 00:13:19,513
It's our wedding anniversary so I wouldn't go to a funeral hall.

135
00:13:19,513 --> 00:13:22,833
Honey, enjoy your food.

136
00:13:25,213 --> 00:13:27,443
The food is okay.

137
00:14:00,503 --> 00:14:04,653
This person... For this guest...

138
00:14:04,653 --> 00:14:08,153
- Not this size! 
- Yes, Boss.

139
00:14:08,153 --> 00:14:11,773
This one. Next to this one, this one in the front!

140
00:14:11,773 --> 00:14:13,253
Those are my wife's shoes.

141
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:16,743
The one in front. The one with style. This one!

142
00:14:16,743 --> 00:14:18,663
This one is mine.

143
00:14:18,663 --> 00:14:21,403
- I'll worker harder.
- Don't try too hard.

144
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:25,433
Good. Good. Just do a good job.

145
00:14:27,023 --> 00:14:30,313
You're here? Come.

146
00:14:32,753 --> 00:14:34,843
Aigoo, what are you doing?

147
00:14:36,363 --> 00:14:37,943
Right.

148
00:14:43,013 --> 00:14:44,723
It just ended up that way. Go in.

149
00:14:44,723 --> 00:14:46,343
Go in. Go in.

150
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:51,023
- Have you been preparing for the test?
- Yes!

151
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,973
If you guys pass the GED, go to college.

152
00:14:53,973 --> 00:14:56,163
- Don't worry about the tuition.
- What?

153
00:14:56,163 --> 00:15:00,203
Whether it's getting a certificate or studying for something, if you work hard, I'll help you.

154
00:15:00,203 --> 00:15:03,603
Do I have a family or kids to support?

155
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:06,053
You are all my children.

156
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:10,773
What I mean is, if I get old and smear poop on the wall,(because of dementia)

157
00:15:10,773 --> 00:15:13,603
I am asking you to take care of me.

158
00:15:13,603 --> 00:15:17,073
After I die, give me a funeral and

159
00:15:17,073 --> 00:15:21,103
make sure you give me some nice hot beef soup.

160
00:15:21,103 --> 00:15:22,613
Make sure it's Korean beef.

161
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:32,043
 ...making it go around and around.

162
00:15:32,043 --> 00:15:34,503
We're closed for the night.

163
00:16:05,653 --> 00:16:09,913
 Youth Star Song Yi Yeon. 10 years after, a scandal comeback goddess

164
00:16:12,943 --> 00:16:16,003
 Divorced after only three months

165
00:16:16,003 --> 00:16:18,463
 With younger model, a passionate love.

166
00:16:31,313 --> 00:16:34,163
You're the same as you were a long time ago, Oppa.

167
00:16:35,513 --> 00:16:38,093
I changed a lot right?

168
00:16:38,093 --> 00:16:40,163
Not enough for me to not recognize you.

169
00:16:40,163 --> 00:16:44,103
Why are you being so awkward? You can talk to me informally.

170
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:47,233
You only do that to people you're comfortable with.

171
00:16:50,953 --> 00:16:54,483
Manager Kim's family is suffering a lot.

172
00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:57,813
You met your husband at work? You were an employee at the information desk, weren't you?

173
00:16:57,813 --> 00:17:00,433
There was a ruckus because they were saying that it was a marriage between beauty and the beast,

174
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:03,233
while the bachelors were crying.

175
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:10,243
Miss Shin.

176
00:17:10,243 --> 00:17:13,423
Bring some more meat and alcohol.

177
00:17:15,303 --> 00:17:17,153
Oh...

178
00:17:17,153 --> 00:17:19,333
I'm sorry. It's a habit.

179
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,423
I'm sorry, Sister-in-law.

180
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:46,363
The one called my lover in the news, this kid.

181
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:50,543
Even his name, I too, don't really know.

182
00:17:51,353 --> 00:17:54,063
Because he was threatened by my ex-husband,

183
00:17:54,063 --> 00:17:56,643
he is lying right now.

184
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:58,153
That person...

185
00:17:59,103 --> 00:18:01,403
is trying to bury me

186
00:18:02,173 --> 00:18:04,873
so that I can't do anything in this world.

187
00:18:07,463 --> 00:18:10,603
The weird thing is,

188
00:18:10,603 --> 00:18:14,763
there's no one who believes what I say.

189
00:18:17,443 --> 00:18:19,663
Except for one, that is.

190
00:18:22,353 --> 00:18:25,803
Help me, Oppa.

191
00:18:38,573 --> 00:18:43,383
I don't know what to do or how to help you.

192
00:18:43,383 --> 00:18:47,663
Are you asking me to beat up that model bastard or something?

193
00:18:47,663 --> 00:18:52,623
♬  We are strangers now   ♬

194
00:18:54,553 --> 00:18:56,833
♬   I can't believe it  ♬

195
00:18:56,833 --> 00:19:00,803

♬   This was how we said farewell  ♬

203
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:39,043
 Asking me a favor, except there is nothing?

204
00:19:39,043 --> 00:19:42,893
 I know that you resent me.

205
00:19:42,893 --> 00:19:49,063
 It's okay if you think I'm a shameless bitch.

206
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,313
I'm sorry.

207
00:19:51,313 --> 00:19:55,303
- I'm really sorry...
- If you're really sorry,

208
00:19:55,303 --> 00:19:57,733
you shouldn't have come here.

209
00:19:57,733 --> 00:20:00,363
♬  Come back to me   ♬

210
00:20:00,363 --> 00:20:03,483
I don't want to spend my golden years in prison.

211
00:20:03,483 --> 00:20:06,933
♬  Come here, back to your spot   ♬

212
00:20:06,933 --> 00:20:08,953
You should go.

213
00:20:12,063 --> 00:20:19,903
♫  I'll be the one waiting for you and only you.  ♫

214
00:20:29,573 --> 00:20:31,163
Yes, my son?

215
00:20:33,193 --> 00:20:38,963
Did you eat? Oh, I see. What did you eat?

216
00:20:41,203 --> 00:20:44,333
Mom's in the middle of work.

217
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,503
Yeah. Go to sleep first.

218
00:20:47,503 --> 00:20:50,973
Good night. Yeah.

219
00:20:56,853 --> 00:21:02,343
I don't care about what people say about me.

220
00:21:02,343 --> 00:21:06,843
But without Yeong Chan,

221
00:21:06,843 --> 00:21:10,753
without this child,

222
00:21:10,753 --> 00:21:13,923
I'll die.

223
00:21:13,923 --> 00:21:20,843
At this rate, whether it's child custody or not, I'll end up losing those.

227
00:21:33,643 --> 00:21:35,773
Why aren't you asking?

228
00:21:35,773 --> 00:21:39,663
What?
♬  Always walk away  ♬

229
00:21:39,663 --> 00:21:43,883
Aren't you curious about what I talked about with Song Yi Yeon?

230
00:21:43,883 --> 00:21:51,663
Isn't it about privacy? As for me, I'm on your side.

231
00:21:51,663 --> 00:21:58,373
Love is timing. If you lose your first love like this...

232
00:21:58,373 --> 00:21:59,423
Who said that?

233
00:21:59,423 --> 00:22:03,773
It's just that we don't say anything. All of our family members already know.

234
00:22:03,773 --> 00:22:06,623
President, you are a legend to us.

235
00:22:07,853 --> 00:22:13,333
Is that so?

236
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:17,423
Aigoo.

237
00:22:17,423 --> 00:22:24,133
Seung Jae, you don't miss the mom who abandoned you?

238
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:26,193
I'm not really sure.

239
00:22:26,193 --> 00:22:29,483
Your mom would be missing you.

240
00:22:29,483 --> 00:22:32,233
Ah...

241
00:22:32,233 --> 00:22:37,373
I miss my mom a lot. I'm getting pissed.

242
00:22:38,763 --> 00:22:41,293
♬   Why?  ♬

243
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:46,773

244
00:22:50,023 --> 00:22:52,573
Well if it isn't my favorite curry.

245
00:22:52,573 --> 00:22:55,563
I'm sorry for making curry so much, Father-In-Law.

246
00:22:55,563 --> 00:22:58,993
No. I also like curry.

247
00:23:07,643 --> 00:23:14,173
Does my family want to go to the amusement park this Sunday? We can eat out too.

248
00:23:15,573 --> 00:23:17,753
What's with this response? I worked hard to take time off.

249
00:23:17,753 --> 00:23:22,823
You did well to take time off that day. It's your mother's death anniversary.

250
00:23:23,753 --> 00:23:25,873
This curry tastes good.

251
00:23:25,873 --> 00:23:27,973
Yes, yes. Eat.

252
00:23:41,423 --> 00:23:43,043
So good.

253
00:23:44,053 --> 00:23:46,983
My wife—

254
00:23:48,073 --> 00:23:49,903
Really good.

255
00:23:49,903 --> 00:23:54,333
How long is the sentence this time? Six months?

256
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,823
One year?

257
00:23:55,823 --> 00:23:58,453
Then? What?

258
00:23:58,453 --> 00:24:00,513
Death sentence.

259
00:24:01,923 --> 00:24:05,433
Your mom said she wanted to go first. Really!

260
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:07,773
So what? Are you trying to say now that you did a good job?

261
00:24:07,773 --> 00:24:09,083
It's not that I did a good job...

262
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:12,363
Anyway, me being born, in itself, is a miracle.

263
00:24:12,363 --> 00:24:17,633
- What?
- Just do things as you usually do. Don't come home.

264
00:24:17,633 --> 00:24:21,123
Whenever you come home, everything becomes noisy.

265
00:24:21,123 --> 00:24:28,193
You rascal, seriously... That's why you should help me, Daughter. Hm?

266
00:24:28,193 --> 00:24:30,913
Oh, it's Jang Seok!

267
00:24:30,913 --> 00:24:34,393
Let me out. Let me out, let me out.

268
00:24:38,053 --> 00:24:40,393
Give me my fare for the ride.

269
00:24:40,393 --> 00:24:42,483
You're such an ugly octopus.

270
00:24:42,483 --> 00:24:44,763
Seriously.

271
00:24:44,763 --> 00:24:47,333
Hey, you're already throwing your dad away for a guy?

272
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:48,693
Don't stalk me.

273
00:24:48,693 --> 00:24:54,693
You! Seriously! You bad brat!

274
00:25:03,613 --> 00:25:06,263
 You want me to tell you how to get out of the death sentence?

275
00:25:07,963 --> 00:25:10,463
Kim Yeong Soo!

276
00:25:12,503 --> 00:25:15,053
What do you think you're doing?!

277
00:25:15,053 --> 00:25:16,943
How could you do this to me?

278
00:25:16,943 --> 00:25:18,993
What is it? Why are you like this?

279
00:25:18,993 --> 00:25:22,733
You said we were grossing the best revenue yesterday!

280
00:25:22,733 --> 00:25:25,143
- Let go and talk.
- How can you do this to me!?

281
00:25:25,143 --> 00:25:29,113
Let me go! Hey, Kim Yeong Soo, don't live like that!

282
00:25:29,113 --> 00:25:34,333
Let go of me! I said let go! Kim Yeong Soo! Let me go. Kim Yeong Soo!

283
00:25:36,483 --> 00:25:38,383
What's wrong?

284
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:40,883
Do it well, please.

285
00:25:40,883 --> 00:25:42,683
Adjust it.

286
00:25:42,683 --> 00:25:44,883
What is this? What happened?
  Kong Gui Moo Reu

287
00:25:44,883 --> 00:25:48,453
The Director ordered that Kong Gui Moo Reu be moved to the center.

288
00:25:48,453 --> 00:25:50,303
You didn't know?

289
00:25:52,413 --> 00:25:57,343
So who is it? Who? Who instigated this?

290
00:25:57,343 --> 00:26:01,563
I guess you didn't hear, but we took the proper steps.

291
00:26:01,563 --> 00:26:05,323
I'm telling you that I'm the one who's responsible. Enough.

292
00:26:05,323 --> 00:26:09,593
Our mall decided to remove Kong Gui Moo Reu already, so take care of it immediately.

293
00:26:09,593 --> 00:26:11,393
Manager. Manager.

294
00:26:12,873 --> 00:26:15,963
You can't do that now.

295
00:26:21,053 --> 00:26:22,203
What is this?

296
00:26:22,203 --> 00:26:27,943
 Someone gave it to me. At least I got one thing from our wedding anniversary.

297
00:26:31,233 --> 00:26:33,773
 Honey, where's the rice cake?

298
00:26:33,773 --> 00:26:36,783
That rice cake. That rice cake you received at the funeral.

299
00:26:36,783 --> 00:26:38,153
Where is it? Did you just leave it as is?

300
00:26:38,153 --> 00:26:39,813
Yes, in the freezer.

301
00:26:39,813 --> 00:26:41,333
 Goodness. You are such...

302
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,803
You don't even know what it was for! Why did you accept it!?

303
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:45,983
What's the matter?

304
00:26:45,983 --> 00:26:50,993
That's not ours. It's for the department head. Anyway, bring it here.

305
00:26:59,983 --> 00:27:04,703
Yes, Reporter. Regarding the earlier contact about the Sunjin Department Store...

306
00:27:04,703 --> 00:27:06,423
Boss.

307
00:27:09,313 --> 00:27:11,163
Hyungnim?

308
00:27:12,353 --> 00:27:16,813
I might be late so you guys take care of the store.

309
00:27:16,813 --> 00:27:18,523
Hyungnim.

310
00:27:20,963 --> 00:27:23,323
Don't worry, punk.

311
00:27:27,653 --> 00:27:30,113
- Manager Kim?
- Oh, yes.

312
00:27:30,113 --> 00:27:35,073
- I was finally able to get a reservation at a restaurant for Lucia tonight.
- But I have an engagement tonight.

313
00:27:35,073 --> 00:27:37,033
- Is it an important engagement?
- With my wife...

314
00:27:37,033 --> 00:27:39,083
- Don't you about Lucia?
- I do know.

315
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:43,183
For a person who knows, did I reserve as a VIP for nothing?

316
00:27:43,183 --> 00:27:45,693
I have something to tell you, Department Head.

317
00:27:45,693 --> 00:27:52,693
If you tell me to, I'd drink alcohol but

318
00:27:52,693 --> 00:27:56,023
to eat rice cake. I couldn't do it.

319
00:27:56,023 --> 00:27:58,453
What are you saying, without any reference?

320
00:28:01,673 --> 00:28:02,533
Listen here, Manager Kim.

321
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:04,593
I will return that rice cake to you.

322
00:28:04,593 --> 00:28:07,343
Do you think anything will change by returning the rice cake that you ate from?

323
00:28:07,343 --> 00:28:12,493
Why can't you be productive? Don't always think about firing anyone or think about bringing somebody in.

324
00:28:12,493 --> 00:28:15,553
If we succeed this time, raising the revenue is only matter of time.

325
00:28:15,553 --> 00:28:17,303
But Department Head...

326
00:28:19,353 --> 00:28:23,383
Haven't you figured out why you are slipping from the managerial position?

327
00:28:25,193 --> 00:28:30,083
If you don't want to, forget it! I should have asked Manager Jeong to the meeting instead, damn!

328
00:28:37,313 --> 00:28:40,173
What time is the dinner?

329
00:28:42,163 --> 00:28:46,513
Hurry and give it to the department head.

330
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:51,963
- Earlier...
- I'm sorry for taking someone else's rice cake.

331
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:54,563
Don't be. It's my fault.

332
00:28:55,253 --> 00:29:02,663
- But about dinner today...
- What, you have another important meeting?

333
00:29:02,663 --> 00:29:05,143
I'm really sorry, Honey.

334
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:10,893
Honey, it may be hard now but if you bear with it,

335
00:29:10,893 --> 00:29:14,143
everything will come around later. Can you let it go just this once?

336
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:21,183
On next year's wedding anniversary, let's take an overseas trip with our family members. I definitely promise.

337
00:29:29,383 --> 00:29:30,953
I went to the hospital.

338
00:29:30,953 --> 00:29:32,993
Why? Are you sick?

339
00:29:32,993 --> 00:29:38,933
What's the point of me doing this myself when your interests have changed this much.

340
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:43,623
Every day working overtime. When you somehow make it home, you're drunk.

341
00:29:43,623 --> 00:29:48,843
I kept this to myself but we already have one. Why do you want a second child?

342
00:29:48,843 --> 00:29:54,003
Exactly what am I to you?

343
00:29:54,003 --> 00:29:56,783
Alright, I'm sorry. I did wrong. Next time, I'll definitely...

344
00:29:56,783 --> 00:30:02,713
Next time, next time! I told you not to make promises like that! Or to say you're sorry.

345
00:30:02,713 --> 00:30:04,033
What's wrong with you today?

346
00:30:04,033 --> 00:30:08,213
I want to stop having to understand and bear everything by myself now.

347
00:30:08,213 --> 00:30:11,813
We're a family. You can't understand something like this?

348
00:30:11,813 --> 00:30:17,133
It's not like I'm playing around. It's hard for me, too.

349
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:18,953
Who do you think I'm living for?

350
00:30:18,953 --> 00:30:24,153
For whom? Don't live for our sake.

351
00:30:32,563 --> 00:30:34,583
Let's talk at home.

352
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:38,563
Does the president know that you're living like this?

353
00:30:38,563 --> 00:30:41,503
- Let's stop it.
- When you are neglecting the family while you are devoting your life to the company,

354
00:30:41,503 --> 00:30:44,133
aren't you suppose to get salary on time as if your life depended on it?

355
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,983
Enough! Enough!

356
00:30:47,033 --> 00:30:53,133
♬  Every single day, I couldn't do anything   ♬

357
00:30:53,133 --> 00:30:59,963
♬   Was it tiring? I must have been unfit  ♬

358
00:30:59,963 --> 00:31:04,963
♬  I'm sorry, I'm sorry   ♬

359
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:08,603
That's why I said we should stop!

360
00:31:08,603 --> 00:31:13,253
You! What on Earth do you think you know about making a living?!

361
00:31:13,253 --> 00:31:15,603
Goodness!

362
00:31:16,563 --> 00:31:18,923
Why are you doing this to me?!

363
00:31:18,923 --> 00:31:23,173
What did I do wrong to deserve this?!

364
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:24,933
♬  I might cry  ♬

365
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:27,833
Did you want to get married,

366
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:30,553
so that you can do this?

367
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:37,353
♬  If I close my eyes again   ♬

368
00:31:37,973 --> 00:31:42,353
♬   I see you  ♬

369
00:32:01,033 --> 00:32:03,463
Who are you?

370
00:32:08,113 --> 00:32:12,203
For a guy who lies, the best medicine is getting beat up. Why?

371
00:32:12,203 --> 00:32:16,983
What? Are you set on making fun of me?

372
00:32:18,593 --> 00:32:22,033
We've stopped the article for now.
  LALA

373
00:32:24,803 --> 00:32:30,263
However, because of Kong Goo Moo Reu's relocation, lower revenue is expected.

374
00:32:30,263 --> 00:32:34,603
They will make a small mistake expand into an atrocity.

375
00:32:36,443 --> 00:32:40,543
This means that our talented secretary Go

376
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:45,593
wiped the poop that one of you secreted.

377
00:32:46,453 --> 00:32:52,153
YOU who are bringing down the value of my mall.

378
00:32:52,153 --> 00:32:56,643
If you don't want your necks cut,

379
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:58,763
surely...

380
00:32:59,663 --> 00:33:02,503
Cut your tail.

381
00:33:12,593 --> 00:33:17,823
I'll give you a choice. If you tell me the truth, this is yours.

382
00:33:17,823 --> 00:33:23,153
To give the precious money that I earned with my blood and sweat to a trash like you , my heart aches.

383
00:33:23,153 --> 00:33:28,353
If I'm not in a good mood, I can't control my mind. When I can't control my mind,

384
00:33:28,353 --> 00:33:30,903
what would happen if, that kind of a person attacked a person with hate?

385
00:33:30,903 --> 00:33:33,483
Please spare me.

386
00:33:36,983 --> 00:33:38,873
That's right.

387
00:33:38,873 --> 00:33:42,663
Your face is everything to you.

388
00:33:42,663 --> 00:33:48,903
Lucia...Forever. Forrrr ever

389
00:33:48,903 --> 00:33:51,253
Let's go!

390
00:33:51,253 --> 00:33:53,663
Bravo!

391
00:33:54,883 --> 00:33:58,213
Director! Chevaux Red.

392
00:33:58,893 --> 00:34:00,633
He can't drink alcohol.

393
00:34:00,633 --> 00:34:04,103
He also doesn't like women.

394
00:34:04,103 --> 00:34:07,563
Oh my. How can he not like women?

395
00:34:09,293 --> 00:34:11,563
Mr. Chae!

396
00:34:11,563 --> 00:34:13,793
How can you just leave like this, Director Chae?

397
00:34:13,793 --> 00:34:16,953
I wanted to see some talent in Sunjin Department Store.

398
00:34:16,953 --> 00:34:19,423
- I guess I was too greedy.
- You weren't that greedy...

399
00:34:19,423 --> 00:34:21,393
Director Chae!

400
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,323
Director Chae!

401
00:34:24,173 --> 00:34:27,173
- Director Chae!!
- D-Director...

402
00:34:27,173 --> 00:34:29,213
Jeez...

403
00:34:31,983 --> 00:34:35,493
Can you even do anything properly?

404
00:34:35,493 --> 00:34:37,543
Can you!? Huh!?

405
00:34:38,603 --> 00:34:40,523
Dang!

406
00:34:48,143 --> 00:34:52,973
 Come back alive today. Dad, fighting!

407
00:35:22,003 --> 00:35:26,803
 The end to an event is threefold.

408
00:35:28,343 --> 00:35:31,553
 No. Okay?

409
00:35:54,243 --> 00:35:56,523
 I'm sorry. Please just let it go this one time.

410
00:35:56,523 --> 00:36:00,713
 For this year's marriage anniversary, our family of four should go on a trip abroad. I will definitely promise you that.

411
00:36:00,713 --> 00:36:02,233
 Don't even make promises like that!

412
00:36:02,303 --> 00:36:07,603
 I want to stop having to understand and bear everything by myself now.

413
00:36:30,853 --> 00:36:33,043
Director!

414
00:36:33,043 --> 00:36:36,233
What do you think you're doing?!

415
00:36:36,233 --> 00:36:40,253
Director... Please... Give us another chance.

416
00:36:40,253 --> 00:36:46,303
We are also getting ready for our luxury exhibition hall.

417
00:36:46,303 --> 00:36:49,513
- Let us depart.
- Wait...!

418
00:36:49,513 --> 00:36:55,593
It's my wedding anniversary. I left breaking my promise to my wife to come and greet you.

419
00:36:55,593 --> 00:36:59,263
I came here while shaming my family.

420
00:36:59,263 --> 00:37:03,363
This is my last chance, Director. Please give me another chance.

421
00:37:03,363 --> 00:37:08,053
If not for you, Director, I have no way to negotiate...

422
00:37:11,903 --> 00:37:13,073
Look here, Mister...

423
00:37:13,073 --> 00:37:16,123
I-I-I-I'm okay.

424
00:37:18,683 --> 00:37:21,423
Director please give me another chance. If you do,

425
00:37:21,423 --> 00:37:25,433
For Lucia, I will do my best.

426
00:37:25,433 --> 00:37:28,653
- I understand.
- I will work very hard. I'll do my best!

427
00:37:28,653 --> 00:37:33,153
- Please give me another chance.
- I said I understand.

428
00:37:33,153 --> 00:37:36,553
Let's schedule a meeting during the daytime.

429
00:37:36,553 --> 00:37:40,603
Really?! Is that so?

430
00:37:41,573 --> 00:37:43,813
Thank you! Thank you, Director!

431
00:37:43,813 --> 00:37:47,353
Can you stand? Do you need to go to the hospital?

432
00:37:47,353 --> 00:37:50,143
No, I'm fine.

433
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:52,113
Oh, my.

434
00:37:52,113 --> 00:37:57,473
It's the video that model bastard confessing to fabricating the story about your ex-husband.

435
00:37:57,473 --> 00:38:04,043
End it with that—about your previous scandal and your previous husband. 
 ♬   A memory which was lost in space, ♬

436
00:38:04,043 --> 00:38:05,333
Thank you.

437
00:38:05,403 --> 00:38:10,503
Also, let's not meet again. 
 ♬   The memories of   ♬

438
00:38:10,603 --> 00:38:14,883
You shouldn't have come to find me. 
 ♬   a time I turned far away from  ♬

439
00:38:14,883 --> 00:38:17,323
I know.

440
00:38:17,323 --> 00:38:21,193
I don't resent you. 
 ♬   Whether it was a matter of  ♬

I never did.

442
00:38:24,043 --> 00:38:26,743
So live peacefully.

Please... 
 ♬   going toward somewhere   ♬

444
00:38:29,943 --> 00:38:32,883
I don't want us to meet for this kind of reason ever again.
 ♬  Once again  ♬

445
00:38:32,883 --> 00:38:36,863
If we do, I'll resent you to death.

446
00:38:36,863 --> 00:38:40,173
♬  Within the days I dreamed of  ♬

00:38:40,173 --> 00:38:45,473
Oppa. 
 ♬  It might be too late.   ♬

00:38:45,473 --> 00:38:47,753
I'm sorry.

00:38:47,803 --> 00:38:53,993
Oppa, I... 
 ♬   Maybe, in a place I can't even go back to  ♬

450
00:38:53,993 --> 00:38:57,593
- Oppa, I...
- Just live well. That's good enough for me.

451
00:38:57,593 --> 00:39:01,463
♬  My whole love is alive and breathing.  ♬

452

00:39:26,143 --> 00:39:27,903
You punk.

455
00:39:27,903 --> 00:39:33,073
♬  will stay within us.  ♬

456
00:39:33,103 --> 00:39:43,803
♬  While conscious of that and considering that I will hug you  ♬

457
00:39:43,803 --> 00:39:49,553
♬   With you  ♬

458
00:39:53,063 --> 00:39:55,713
It's a paparazzi!

459
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:21,323
Oh Seung Jae, let's talk later.

460
00:40:21,323 --> 00:40:24,963
- What happened, President? Police came by earlier.
- What?

461
00:40:24,963 --> 00:40:29,403
President, there's a ruckus. Assault? What on Earth—

462
00:40:36,473 --> 00:40:39,433
 Song Yi Yeon's lover: threatened and even assaulted by a gangster.

463
00:40:49,993 --> 00:40:52,153
No, it can't be!

464
00:40:54,203 --> 00:40:56,203
It must be Jae Hoon Ha!

465
00:40:57,293 --> 00:40:59,523
 The 2016 International Fireworks Festival is ongoing

466
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:03,193
 so the local traffic will be difficult.

467
00:41:05,403 --> 00:41:10,003
 The fireworks will start soon.

468
00:41:27,293 --> 00:41:34,413

469
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:45,683
It's pretty.

470
00:41:57,923 --> 00:41:59,613
 My happiness Han Na

471
00:42:03,003 --> 00:42:04,683
My daughter?

472
00:42:04,683 --> 00:42:06,553
 Dad, where are you now?

473
00:42:06,553 --> 00:42:08,493
 Mom said that she was by herself.

474
00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:10,893
 Did you break your promise again?

475
00:42:12,453 --> 00:42:15,473
 You drive me crazy! Just crazy.

476
00:42:15,473 --> 00:42:17,733
 Where are you? Did you drink alcohol again?

477
00:42:17,733 --> 00:42:21,483
No, I didn't drink.

478
00:42:21,483 --> 00:42:23,323
Not even one glass.

479
00:42:23,323 --> 00:42:26,193
 Liar. You're in big trouble now.

480
00:42:26,193 --> 00:42:29,803
 Even if you come now, you can't redeem yourself.

481
00:42:30,593 --> 00:42:34,543
 Grandfather even said he wants to go to his friend's house for safety's sake.

482
00:42:34,543 --> 00:42:36,643
 Stop drinking and come home, quickly!

483
00:42:36,643 --> 00:42:38,883
Alright.

484
00:42:38,883 --> 00:42:42,423
Dad's on the way right now.

485
00:42:42,423 --> 00:42:45,473
I'll be there soon.

486
00:43:48,503 --> 00:43:52,293
 Do you even know how to do anything properly?

487
00:44:00,203 --> 00:44:04,543
 Did you want to get married so that you can do this?

488
00:44:17,393 --> 00:44:19,683
 Hey, you...

489
00:44:51,643 --> 00:44:53,513
Is anybody there?

490
00:44:54,603 --> 00:44:56,443
Is somebody there?

491
00:45:43,503 --> 00:45:46,713
 I can't leave now!

492
00:45:46,713 --> 00:45:49,273
 To heaven
To hell

493
00:45:49,273 --> 00:45:52,203
 What about my baby?

494
00:46:01,453 --> 00:46:02,803
 To hell

495
00:46:06,603 --> 00:46:08,443
 To heaven

496
00:46:08,443 --> 00:46:10,253
Excuse me, Miss.

497
00:46:10,253 --> 00:46:12,353
Isn't this a bit strange?

498
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:16,523
I'm sorry but I think there's something wrong with my ticket.

499
00:46:18,533 --> 00:46:19,553
Han Gi Tak?

500
00:46:19,553 --> 00:46:20,183
Yes?

501
00:46:20,183 --> 00:46:21,743
Your ticket to heaven is correct.

502
00:46:21,743 --> 00:46:23,603
You did commit a lot of sins but

503
00:46:23,603 --> 00:46:25,493
you continued to take care of yourself lately in life, so it's done.

504
00:46:25,493 --> 00:46:27,053
So it's okay?

505
00:46:27,663 --> 00:46:28,413
Are you sure?

506
00:46:28,413 --> 00:46:32,153
Hell is well suited, but it's not a place for just anyone.

507
00:46:32,153 --> 00:46:34,853
In the real world, should I describe it as a prison?

508
00:46:34,853 --> 00:46:36,143
Then...!

509
00:46:36,143 --> 00:46:38,753
Why am I going to hell?

510
00:46:38,753 --> 00:46:41,483
As for me, never mind jail.

511
00:46:41,483 --> 00:46:44,203
Even for civil matters, I was a person who stringently followed the rules.

512
00:46:44,203 --> 00:46:45,383
Kim Yeong Soo?

513
00:46:45,383 --> 00:46:46,693
Yes?

514
00:46:47,503 --> 00:46:48,733
You committed suicide.

515
00:46:48,733 --> 00:46:49,653
What?!

516
00:46:49,653 --> 00:46:52,343
Suicide is not good, you know.

517
00:46:53,743 --> 00:46:56,053
That doesn't make sense!

518
00:47:00,303 --> 00:47:02,773
Who killed me?

519
00:47:02,773 --> 00:47:05,193
I cannot check for you.

520
00:47:05,193 --> 00:47:10,033
Which means that it wasn't just an accident.

521
00:47:12,903 --> 00:47:15,873
I cannot check for you.

522
00:47:15,873 --> 00:47:19,463
I've always wanted to say that kind of thing!

523
00:47:19,463 --> 00:47:23,003
Didn't I seem like Al Pacino just now?

524
00:47:28,103 --> 00:47:30,583
No matter how I look at it, it was a suicide.

525
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:33,353
I was just trying to change the played card...

526
00:47:33,353 --> 00:47:35,423
Why did you try to do it yourself? Are you Superman?

527
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,893
I just thought that I should do it.

528
00:47:36,893 --> 00:47:41,913
It seemed to me like you were planning to commit suicide for quite some time now.

529
00:47:41,913 --> 00:47:43,983
From December 3rd to 5th, for two days.

530
00:47:43,983 --> 00:47:46,273
For twenty years, two meals.

531
00:47:46,273 --> 00:47:49,603
You ate ramyun, triangle kimbap, and hamburger?

532
00:47:49,603 --> 00:47:53,123
You were substituting junk for meals.

533
00:47:53,123 --> 00:47:55,633
Were you set on overworking yourself to death?

534
00:47:55,633 --> 00:47:58,273
No, it was because I was busy because there were seasonal sales.

535
00:47:58,273 --> 00:48:00,653
You got drugs on the fourth of January.

536
00:48:00,653 --> 00:48:02,353
- That was...
- Wasn't it an addiction?

537
00:48:02,353 --> 00:48:04,123
No. It was...

538
00:48:04,123 --> 00:48:06,873
a pill to reduce my eating. My wife told me to lose weight so...

539
00:48:06,873 --> 00:48:09,273
You joined a health club on a six-month membership and how many times did you go?

540
00:48:09,273 --> 00:48:10,853
I went twice.

541
00:48:10,853 --> 00:48:13,413
You drank alcohol every day from February 14th to 22nd.

542
00:48:13,413 --> 00:48:14,313
That was...

543
00:48:14,313 --> 00:48:16,073
That's a cowardly excuse!

544
00:48:16,073 --> 00:48:20,703
Kim Heyong Soo, the total of cocktail bombs you drank in your life time is 45,800 ounces.

545
00:48:20,703 --> 00:48:22,703
The western whiskey is 23,500 bottles.

546
00:48:22,703 --> 00:48:27,203
If I were to add soju, beer and other alcoholic drinks, it's one third of the Pacific ocean.

547
00:48:27,203 --> 00:48:29,753
This is far worse than global warming!

548
00:48:29,753 --> 00:48:31,643
Why would you be talking about global warming?

549
00:48:31,643 --> 00:48:33,963
You had a stroke and cirrhosis of the liver!

550
00:48:33,963 --> 00:48:35,873
Even high blood pressure, and hemorrhoids!

551
00:48:35,873 --> 00:48:38,963
You have fifteen illnesses so why did you disregard your health?

552
00:48:38,963 --> 00:48:40,783
It was a perfect suicide attempt!

553
00:48:40,783 --> 00:48:42,893
It's deliberate!

554
00:48:42,893 --> 00:48:45,053
No... I...

555
00:48:46,903 --> 00:48:49,413
I... That is...

556
00:49:01,033 --> 00:49:03,123
I did wrong.

557
00:49:06,563 --> 00:49:08,773
I...

558
00:49:08,773 --> 00:49:11,093
I did all of that.

559
00:49:11,093 --> 00:49:14,233
I thought I worked hard in life.

560
00:49:14,233 --> 00:49:16,393
But I guess I lived wrong.

561
00:49:17,933 --> 00:49:19,763
I'm sorry.

562
00:49:21,943 --> 00:49:24,573
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

563
00:49:32,253 --> 00:49:35,553
 To hell

564
00:49:35,553 --> 00:49:36,923
 To heaven

565
00:49:41,973 --> 00:49:44,693
If you understand that you were wrong, that's fine.

566
00:49:47,723 --> 00:49:50,843
 To heaven

567
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:54,013
Go on.

568
00:49:54,013 --> 00:49:56,283
It's almost time for the train to arrive.

569
00:49:56,283 --> 00:49:59,153
Late arrival Kim Yeong Soo.

570
00:50:02,603 --> 00:50:04,843
Thank you.

571
00:50:05,933 --> 00:50:07,633
Thank you.

572
00:50:16,003 --> 00:50:19,903
But could my family

573
00:50:19,903 --> 00:50:23,423
think that I committed suicide?

574
00:50:23,423 --> 00:50:28,203
Life's work should be left to the people who are left behind.

575
00:50:28,203 --> 00:50:30,303
What does that mean?

576
00:51:42,503 --> 00:51:46,273
Since we are alumni in the nether world, let me introduce myself.

577
00:51:46,273 --> 00:51:48,543
I died due to an unknown cause, Han Gi Tak.

578
00:51:48,543 --> 00:51:51,183
I am Kim Yeong Soo who died of cerebral hemorrhage.

579
00:51:52,763 --> 00:51:54,853
Seems like the road to heaven won't be lonely.

580
00:51:54,853 --> 00:52:00,583
Though this seems out of place to say... It's nice to meet you.

581
00:52:40,253 --> 00:52:45,333
♬  Where ever I am, filling me with  ♬

582
00:52:45,403 --> 00:52:51,703
♬  A memory which was lost in space  ♬

583
00:52:51,703 --> 00:53:01,463
♬  The memories of a time I turned far away from  ♬

584
00:53:01,463 --> 00:53:06,703
♬  Whether it was a matter of something which was forgotten  ♬

585
00:53:06,703 --> 00:53:11,803
♬ or whether it was matter of going toward somewhere  ♬

586
00:53:11,803 --> 00:53:22,503
♬ I’m spending a day once again among the days I dreamed of.  ♬

587
00:53:22,513 --> 00:53:27,853
♬  It might be it is too late  ♬

588
00:53:27,903 --> 00:53:35,923
♬  Maybe in a place that I can't even go back to  ♬

589
00:53:35,923 --> 00:53:43,293
♬  My whole love is alive and breathing.   ♬

590
00:54:17,403 --> 00:54:26,403
♬   Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam   ♬

591
00:54:26,403 --> 00:54:34,603
♬   Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home.   ♬

592
00:54:34,603 --> 00:54:42,803
♬   A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there.   ♬

593
00:54:42,803 --> 00:54:50,783
♬   Which seek thro' the world, is ne'er met elsewhere.   ♬

594
00:54:50,783 --> 00:54:55,973
♬   Home! Home !   ♬

595
00:54:55,973 --> 00:55:02,403
♬  Even if I close my eyes, even if I close my eyes  ♬

596
00:55:02,403 --> 00:55:09,333
♬  I can't erase the memories of us  ♬

597
00:55:09,333 --> 00:55:16,063
♬ I only look at your names  ♬

598
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:22,393
♬  I love you. I love you ♬

599
00:55:22,393 --> 00:55:28,403
♬  Don't leave me. Don't go leaving me alone ♬

600
00:55:28,403 --> 00:55:32,723
♬  Today, I'm crying again  ♬

601
00:55:32,723 --> 00:55:36,623
 Bok Dong, are you comfortable?

602
00:55:36,623 --> 00:55:39,833
 If there's something you want to eat, tell Mom.

603
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:43,033
 I'm just down counting the days until I can finally meet you.

604
00:55:43,033 --> 00:55:50,833
 Oh, right. This is your father.

605
00:55:50,833 --> 00:55:57,103
♬   Don't leave me. Don't leave me ♬

606
00:55:57,103 --> 00:56:04,143
Oh, what is this...?

607
00:56:04,143 --> 00:56:07,543
♬  Love,  ♬

608
00:56:07,543 --> 00:56:12,573
♬  I might cry. It's really...  ♬

609
00:56:12,573 --> 00:56:16,193
♬  If I close my eyes again  ♬

610
00:56:16,193 --> 00:56:22,653
♬  If I close my eyes again, you  ♬

611
00:56:22,653 --> 00:56:26,953
No!

612
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:35,773
Stop! Stop, stop, stop!

613
00:56:35,773 --> 00:56:38,403
Stop the train! I want to get off.

614
00:56:38,403 --> 00:56:39,783
Is this a taxi?

615
00:56:39,783 --> 00:56:42,093
There's so much I have to do!

616
00:56:42,093 --> 00:56:48,103
Kim Yeong Soo. Do you want to exchange the ticket to heaven that you already worked hard to exchange?

617
00:56:48,103 --> 00:56:50,583
Still, if I just die like this,

618
00:56:50,583 --> 00:56:55,443
my poor daughter is only nine years old. How is she going to live without a father?

619
00:56:55,443 --> 00:56:57,933
I'm the only breadwinner in my family. What happens to them?

620
00:56:57,933 --> 00:57:01,623
I can't. I have to go back. I have lots to do.

621
00:57:01,623 --> 00:57:05,123
I have to delete my porn, too. This won't do.

622
00:57:05,123 --> 00:57:08,403
Kim Yeong Soo. You'll have to leave with me.

623
00:57:09,283 --> 00:57:12,363
Wait. I just remembered. I got a loan behind my wife's back.

624
00:57:12,363 --> 00:57:15,273
I wasn't even able to properly act as a filial son to my father.

625
00:57:15,273 --> 00:57:17,753
I promised my wife to go on an overseas trip for our wedding anniversary next year.

626
00:57:17,753 --> 00:57:20,523
I have to fulfill that promise

627
00:57:20,523 --> 00:57:24,123
because I've never kept my promises before.

628
00:57:24,123 --> 00:57:25,523
Ah, I can't! I can't!

629
00:57:25,523 --> 00:57:26,863
For now, don't yell.

630
00:57:26,863 --> 00:57:28,803
Hold on!

631
00:57:32,653 --> 00:57:36,853
- What is it?
- If Han Gi Tak stands still in such an unjust situation,

632
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:41,933
how can I eat the beef soup that that the underlings have prepared for me?

633
00:57:59,753 --> 00:58:03,483
Car #14, there is a ruckus.

634
00:58:03,483 --> 00:58:07,143
A commotion? Is this a disturbance?

635
00:58:07,903 --> 00:58:12,493
You're telling me this is a commotion? Tuna fish can!

636
00:58:15,683 --> 00:58:17,763
What?

637
00:58:21,753 --> 00:58:25,433
♬  The moment I opened my eyes, feel like  ♬

638
00:58:25,433 --> 00:58:29,073
♬  my luck is exploding.  ♬

639
00:58:29,073 --> 00:58:32,793
♬  Let's start anew, feel so right  ♬

640
00:58:32,793 --> 00:58:36,303
♬  We will fly up like that  ♬

641
00:58:36,303 --> 00:58:42,733
Now, wow!

642
00:58:42,733 --> 00:58:45,853
Ah, this is seriously too much.

643
00:58:47,043 --> 00:58:51,453
- What do you plan to do?
- What more could happen than dying and being chased?

644
00:58:52,593 --> 00:58:57,073
You can't! Really! Whether it's heaven or not, I don't know.

645
00:58:57,073 --> 00:58:59,953
You die once, not twice.

646
00:59:01,623 --> 00:59:08,803

647
00:59:10,483 --> 00:59:14,393
I want to go back!

648
00:59:16,323 --> 00:59:17,863
 Have you arrived safely?

649
00:59:17,863 --> 00:59:19,593
 Maya?

650
00:59:19,593 --> 00:59:23,383
 What's wrong with my voice? Who...?

651
00:59:23,383 --> 00:59:25,903
♬  One  ♬

652
00:59:25,903 --> 00:59:28,443
♬  Two  ♬

653
00:59:28,443 --> 00:59:30,723
♬  Three, get set, go  ♬

654
00:59:30,723 --> 00:59:35,543
♬ Bye, bye, bye. Good Bye, no, no, no ♬

655
00:59:35,543 --> 00:59:40,443
♬  Yes, you. Won't you get your head straight?  ♬

656
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:45,053
♬  Because I like you  ♬

657
00:59:45,053 --> 00:59:48,313
 Don't you forget that you are not living in this world.

658
00:59:48,313 --> 00:59:51,123
 The eyes don't look like him at all.

659
00:59:51,123 --> 00:59:52,183
 It's destiny. Destiny!

660
00:59:52,183 --> 00:59:55,343
 - I already have a family.
- Shhhh!

661
00:59:55,343 --> 00:59:58,753
 Stop it. Before I beat you up.

662
00:59:58,753 --> 01:00:01,343
 - Are you really going to act like this?
- Then, what I'm suppose to do?

663
01:00:01,343 --> 01:00:02,503
 Do you want to rescind?

664
01:00:02,503 --> 01:00:05,363
 You. Who are you?

665
01:00:05,363 --> 01:00:11,033
 I love you. Thank you.
