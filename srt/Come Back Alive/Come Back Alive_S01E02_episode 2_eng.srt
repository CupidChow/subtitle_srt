1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,980

2
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,870
I was so excited that I got a ticket to go relax.

3
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:45,330
But out of nowhere these troublemakers showed up, something which hasn't happened in the last few hundred years. Geesh.

4
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,750
What's up with this? I was looking forward to taking a vacation already.

5
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,990
Oh man, why aren't you opening up?

6
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,610
 Return Request Form 
Please fill this out and sign here.

7
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:32,710
 Return Request form. 
What is this?

8
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,890
I saw all kinds of mayhem with dead people who didn't want to die,

9
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,270
but you're the first to jump out of the train going to heaven.

10
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:47,350
Anyways, the chance that will be given for you to put things back in order in the current world is called Return Experience.

11
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,990
If you really don't want to do it, then you can take the next train going to heaven.

12
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,130
Current world?

13
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,830
So does that mean I can go back home?

14
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,950
Didn't you say you wanted to go back?

15
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,370
Of course I do. Give me the paperwork please.

16
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,090
 Return Request Form

17
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,450
I want to tell you that this is very dangerous.

18
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,450
Do you really have to go?

19
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:14,950
How can I go to heaven by myself when my family is suffering down there because of me?

20
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,710
I am telling you this ahead of time.

21
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:23,430
Please make this decision carefully. If you possibly break the rules

22
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,590
then you would possibly experience something really frightening.

23
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,810
What's the frightening thing we'd be experiencing?

24
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,780
It's something VERY scary.

25
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,690
- Is it Hell?
- You scared me.

26
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,950
It's so scary that you won't be able to compare it with anything.

27
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,550
It's scarier than hell, huh?

28
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,250
Oh...

29
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:48,090
There are a lot of people who choose the Return Experience but end up regretting it later.

30
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,790
Okay, well...

31
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:55,710
Let's say that's the case... I will be careful.

32
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,620
Why would you want to go back when you don't even have any family left down there?

33
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,190
Don't you want to go to heaven?

34
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:12,550
Heaven is a really nice place, you know. It's so... so awesome over there.

35
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:18,030
Why wouldn't I want to go to heaven when I was given a chance to, despite the fact that I was just a guy punching people for a living.

36
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,390
So many people are probably in ruins now because of me.

37
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,670
So how can go I to heaven and rest in peace all by myself?

38
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,510
I usually don't say this much,

39
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,240
but she is not even your wife nor girlfriend.

40
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,110
Did that woman say that she loves you or something?

41
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,530
If that is the case, why would you want to go back like an idiot?

42
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,230
If she also gets into an unfortunate situation because of me,

43
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:55,630
then my life would basically become nothing.

44
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,130
I shouldn't have asked.

45
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:10,070
Go ahead and fill that out. It looks like my vacation tour is no more.

46
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,150
This pen doesn't work.

47
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,290
You can dab a little a bit of saliva on it.

48
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,630
  The above is confirmed as truthful.

49
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:33,770
 Dammit, it's so noisy. Honey, answer the phone already.

50
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,530
 Where is this place?

51
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,570
 Good Morning. Did you get there okay?

52
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:06,250
Miss Maya?  What's wrong with my voice?

53
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,730
Who am I?

54
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,490
Oh crap, my chest is moving. Is it okay for it to be this big?

55
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:51,410
Look at these abdominal muscles. How many packs do I have here?

56
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:59,530
Look at all this. I have so much hair now. Look at my toes too.

57
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:06,330
 Mr. Kim Yeong Soo. Kim Yeong Soo.

58
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,290
Did you see it all? Did you see my genitals?

59
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:12,500
Yes, I did. I was able to see everything so well since earlier.

60
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,290
I thought you were dead because you seemed to be in such shock.

61
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,290
What do you think? Do you like it?

62
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:21,850
My body is like a sculpture. How can my body look like this?

63
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,550
According to your usual character chart,

64
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,350
I made a change that was not so distinct.

65
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,790
What do you mean I was distinct? What the heck was wrong with me?

66
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,690
Wasn't this the look you wanted on a day to day basis?

67
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,170
When I look at the records of your dreams and your unconscious states,

68
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,730
Jang Dong Gun and Won Bin appeared a lot.

69
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:39,310
You work so hard unnecessarily.

70
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,850
Starting from now on I will tell you a little bit about the precautions.

71
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:49,110
Please tell me. Oh my chin here. I thought I was going to scratch it or something.

72
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,170
You couldn't let go of the past, so you turned down a trip to heaven

73
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,530
that could've been a smooth sailing for you.

74
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:00,290
But instead, you chose to come back to the current world.

75
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,250
Oh crap, I don't have anything down there.

76
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,830
The thing that I'm supposed to have is no longer there.

77
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:18,650
So therefore, you have to confirm and accept the fact that you are dead now.

78
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,550
That is the only way for you to rest in peace in the other world.

79
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,570
There are three rules that you'll need to keep in mind that must be strictly observed.

80
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,410
First thing is, you must maintain your secret identity.

81
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:35,030
You must not ever reveal who you are to anyone.

82
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:39,470
Second, revenge is strictly prohibited.

83
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,290
Thirdly, do not interfere with the life or death of any person.

84
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,930
If you violate these rules then you will have to experience something very horrible.

85
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,850
 Do you understand what I'm telling you, Han Gi Tak?

86
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,870
How could this be?!

87
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:10,650
Hey look here miss. You didn't tell me any of this. Man, I'm about to go crazy here!

88
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,120
If I knew that I was going to come back in this crappy way,

89
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,030
then I wouldn't have filled out that request form in the first place.

90
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,750
Omo! So you thought that you were going to come back exactly as yourself?

91
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,070
Is my nose blocked, or what?

92
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,390
I think you have watched too many dramas.

93
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,590
What did you say?

94
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,990
Would you like to cancel? It's not too late for you to come back.

95
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:32,430
Look here, Miss. I came here because I  must  do something important.

96
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:42,030
But with the body I have, how am I supposed to accomplish the task? Don't you think so?

97
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:46,250
What are you doing now? Are you feeling them?

98
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:54,030
Anyway, I have a role that I play in society here. This would be a bit difficult for a person like me.

99
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,730
Why is this thing constantly buzzing anyway?

100
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,730
My charm is all about balance you know.

101
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,970
That's your problem. Should I make a request for you to come back or not?

102
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,170
Hey you!!!

103
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:14,850
It's so well done. Please take a look at the device there.

104
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,970
Always bring your mobile phones that connect to our office, which operates 24 hours,

105
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,050
and also your watch that tells you your return time.

106
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:25,690
The thing that's special about this is the fact that we pay you in advance.

107
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,390
Only when you need it though.

108
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:39,050
Welcome to the woman's world.

109
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,690
Hey you! Come down here!

110
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:50,070
Come down here! Come down here! G* damnit!

111
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:05,850
Look how lively I look. I love these triceps.

112
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,650
Oh thank you, GOD.

113
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:15,010
You'll be so blessed. This is so perfect.

114
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:19,790
Look at this body, perfect measurements all over. Look at the lively butt.

115
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:24,590
Look at these hips too.

116
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,810
Oh my goodness.

117
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,580
Dammit.

118
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:06,720

119
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,500
Young people these days...

120
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,140
That scared me.

121
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:24,050
Thank you, Mr. Gorgeous.

122
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,580
Mr. Handsome.

123
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,900
Thank you, Sexy.

124
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:38,930
Yes. I am Mr. Gorgeous. I'm Mr. Handsome.

125
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,370
I'm Mr. Sexy.

Song Yi Yeon's man is Yoo Hyeuk.

150
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,220
 I don't blame her. My love was genuine.

151
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,230
What happened to Song Yi Yeon?

152
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,000
- What?
 - That person who was a chaebol's wife who got divorced because she had an affair.

153
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,270
She's the girlfriend of a thug now.

154
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,000
I also heard that she posed nude as well.

155
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,680
Her boyfriend's probably broke.

156
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,960
- Do you like them?
 - What?

157
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,280
Well, they are nice right?

158
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:11,530
The way I see it, this is more useful.

I understand. I get it. I won't cause problems.

161
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:11,460
Please. Don't forget you're not supposed to be in this world.

162
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,240
I said I get it. You know...

163
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,440
 Oh, I forgot to tell you this but...

However if you want to give up and really die, hold the hash button for a long time please.

You're always welcome here.

169
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,790
Let me speak as well!

170
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,580
What is it?

171
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:41,030
Do I have to put them on or climb aboard?

172
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:06,520
 A journey in Bardo represents a month in real life. 
(Bardo: concept of a transitional state in Buddhism)

173
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:12,340
 If you go back now, one month will have passed.

174
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:17,390
Guys, your boss came.

 Pub &amp; Lounge

00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,630
 Big Wolf is not that kind of wolf!

177
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,170
Welcome! How many people?

178
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:51,710
Eun Yeong Sil, where is Manager Chae? And what about Jae Gil?

179
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:55,210
Secretary Chae is over there.

180
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,910
- Secretary Chae!
- Yeah?

181
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,480
Aren't you that Seok Cheol's bastard?

182
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,840
Who are you that you'd say our Boss's name so lightly like that?

183
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,740
Who do you think you are?!

184
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,400
Stop right there!

185
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:36,110
You bastard... This store is worth more than this...

186
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,360
 The next train to heaven is in two days.

187
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,850
 In the current world's time, it is two months. You must return within that time.

188
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:53,000
If you miss that train... you can expect that...

189
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,030
scary things will happen.

190
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:41,250
 Even if I die, the world still carries on.

191
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,540
I have nothing else to say to you.

192
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:51,550
What do you think is the reason Kim Yeong Soo, who worked here for fifteen years, committed suicide?

193
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:55,880
Why are you doing this when the truth is clear? You saw the report.

194
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:01,150
So Kim Yeong Soo, who was facing termination, committed suicide so that he could cover up the bribery?

195
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,740
It's a shame, but if it's the truth. What can I do?

196
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,250
That bast...

197
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,880
 - I have something to tell you, Department Head.
- Listen here, Manager Kim.

198
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,760
 I will return that rice cake to you.

199
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,090
 Do you think anything will change by returning the rice cake that you ate from?

200
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,680
That's according to the company's version.

201
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,450
According to the employees, Kim Yeong Soo was always a dedicated worker.

202
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,680
Also, he suffered from unreasonable work pressure.

203
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,330
Wait a minute. Are you saying the company contributed to his death?

204
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,510
This could have happened.

205
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:34,040
To tell you the truth, Manager had lot of stress because he was passed over for many promotions.

206
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:39,580
Frankly speaking, with his background and education, where else could he have worked, if not here?

207
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:45,850
Although it feels like I'm badmouthing a dead person, Manager Kim was nice but also timid.

208
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:51,450
I think he realized his wrongdoing and made a wrong decision in that moment.

209
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,830
I also feel bad for him.

210
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,820
Chairman. Well, if it isn't the chairman!

211
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,500
Hello, Chairman. Could I ask you about one thing?

212
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,560
Did you perhaps receive information about the person who committed suicide?

213
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,910
That information...

214
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:12,690
 Chairman, I worked for fifteen years sacrificing my whole body.

215
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,270
 How can you do this to me? Bribery, and on top of that, suicide.

216
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,440
 I feel really wronged.

217
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:22,110
Chairman! Please give us a statement!

218
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:26,030
What do you think about the employee who committed suicide? Please give us a comment.

219
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:30,160
Do you know about Manager Kim Yeong Soo? Please say something!

220
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:35,250
Just one word is enough, please! Chairman, I'm asking you for just one comment.

221
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,170
Chairman. Chairman.

222
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,460
 Let's take some good pictures, okay?

223
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:54,450
That's right. I already knew that it wasn't going to be easy from the beginning.

224
00:20:54,450 --> 00:21:00,250
Don't get nervous. Opportunties will present themselves one by one.

225
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:12,930
 Kyeong Ho's Grandmother. Manager Yoon.

226
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:20,160
♬  It feels familiar. Stop as is, in this place.  ♬

227
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:25,300
 Yeong Won... Dae Hee...

228
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:32,530
 Ji Yeong. Sa Mi. You're all well, right?

229
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,700
He look at me!

230
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,920
- Who is that man?
- I was so surprised.

231
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,400
- He's so handsome.
- Right?

232
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,860
He's totally cool.

233
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:47,990
♬   You're the only one.   ♬

234
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:53,090
♬  Moon Light. Thinking about you...   ♬

235
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,020
 I came out here while shaming my family.

236
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,180
 If you give Sunjin Department Store a chance, for that grace

237
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:03,600
 I will do my best. I'll work hard.

238
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:11,290
- Ah, sorry.
- I'm sorry.

239
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:17,010
Honey.

240
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:22,500
♬   It'll get better eventually. I miss you.  ♬

241
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,080
Are you... Are you alright?

242
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,540
 Why are you here?

243
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:32,480
I'm sorry. Are you okay? You didn't get hurt?

244
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,470
Yes, I'm okay.

245
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:38,310
I'm sorry. I'm still unfamiliar with it.

246
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,810
Thank you. I'm sorry, customer.

247
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,880
 I'm really sorry.

248
00:22:54,910 --> 00:23:01,100
 You know, Honey. It may be hard now but it'll all come around if you endure a little.

249
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,250
 For our next wedding anniversary let's go travel abroad.

250
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,680
 I promise for sure.

251
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,740
 She's been doing housework for ten years. How did she...

252
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:23,640
 I have a lot of sins.

253
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,910
So that person who died, Han Gi Tak...

254
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:42,480
He fell for a divorcee, punched out Nam Bong Jil and gave all of his wealth away?

255
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:48,130
Well gosh. What can you do? I guess you lost what was owed to you.

256
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,570
What about my kids?

257
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,710
Where are my kids?!

258
00:23:54,710 --> 00:24:00,440
I guess this pretty one is filled with a broken heart. Do you want this oppa to do some of this?

259
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:09,650
If you knew who I was, you'd immediately want to stick your nose in dishwater.

260
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,350
What?

261
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:19,060
Who are you? Right now the place I want to put my nose is on these cute lips.

262
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:26,170
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

263
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:30,560
I guess women's beauty is tiring.

264
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,520
What blood? I guess this nagging wench is rather tough.

265
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,140
It's making me all riled up.

266
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:53,070
To those who can't distinguish heaven and earth, I guess the best medicine is a beating.

274
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:12,700
I am not making these sounds with my mouth.

275
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,350
You're going to dance now?

276
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,250
What are you doing?

277
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:26,880
Do you think that this can pierce a hole in your head? Or not?

278
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,600
If you keep doing this, you are going to get scolded by me! Got it!

279
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,860
- Let go!
- Shut up!

280
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:42,210
Let go! Let me go! Hey!

281
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,520
Let me go!

282
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,480
Go elsewhere to look for what is owed to you.

283
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,910
Hey! You come here! Come at me, come at me!

284
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,570
Hey, If you use try to cook secretly again,

285
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:15,960
I'll cut you in pieces and make meat out of you! Got it?

286
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,360
Stick to the dishes. You little piece of...

287
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,950
This not what it tastes like. It's not the taste.

288
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,740
- Jae Gil.
- Yes,...

289
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,010
Me?

290
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:55,190
I told you to boil it a bit, because it's hard to chew.

291
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,980
But, who are you?

292
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:08,960
Hyungnim.

293
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:16,720
How can you leave this pretty young sister behind and leave the world.

294
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:22,760
It's so unfair. So unfair!

295
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,940
 It's said that a man cries three times after he is born.

296
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:31,110
 Because I used all three opportunities, I can't even cry now.

297
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:41,460
How can their faces look so different?

298
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:48,460
Jae Gil, do you want to eat this or end your life?

299
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,220
Eh?

300
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,050
Anyway, where are your Hyungs? Why are you here alone?

301
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:02,160
What happened to Seung Jae?

302
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,260
Chae Seung Jae that betraying bastard. Don't even talk about him.

303
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:10,000
He is the worst bastard in the world. How can he with Na Seuk Cheul...

304
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,780
How can he work for Na Seuk Cheul?

305
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,440
What? Who?

306
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:23,620
Under Na Seuk Cheul, he is working as a manager or bodyguard to Song Yi Yeon.

307
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:36,730

308
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,850
 No. Please.

309
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:09,530
 Go! Hurry, go, Song Yi Yeon! Go!

310
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,430
 Hurry, go!

311
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,320
 What, bastard?!

312
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,500
 Hurry, go!

313
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,360
 Go already!

314
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,660
Now you have become a family member of 9 Entertainment.

315
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,500
Thank you.

316
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:54,220
It's been so long since I've pressed a seal, my heart flutters.

317
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,600
Oh right. Our boss has come back from a business trip.

318
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,560
He's always wanted to see you so he's coming here.

319
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,080
Ah, here he comes.

320
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,380
- Hello.
- Hello.

321
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:14,570
My name is Na Seuk Cheul.

322
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,620
I'm Song Yi Yeon.

323
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,680
Wow.

324
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:27,330
To finally meet Yi Yoon, it sure has been a while.

325
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:31,360
I'm sorry, but have I seen you before?

326
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,230
Ah, this...

327
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:36,580
What the heck?

328
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,060
I'm really disappointed.

329
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,410
You don't remember me?

330
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:46,310
I wouldn't forget me even if I died.

331
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:01,740

332
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,530
 Are you Gi Tak's girlfriend?

333
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,840
 No!

334
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,610
You made the correct decision.

335
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,630
Now you have to make a comeback.

336
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:07,500
To see the mighty Song Yi Yeon living in a monthly rental worrying about her next meal,

337
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,600
who would believe that?

338
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,110
What is your reason for doing this?

339
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,030
What do you mean a reason?

340
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:16,160
Because you are a hometown friend, I was just helping you.

341
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,110
And also to your dead father,

342
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,500
I've had a debt for a long time.

343
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,240
What are you talking about?

344
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:59,980
 Madam, it's your fault that Gi Tak became that way.

345
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,580
 Don't you have any conscience?

346
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:08,390
 You should live well with respect for a dead person.

356
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,600
 Beethoven's Destiny? It's an alarm! 
(Another name for the famous Fifth Symphony)

357
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,620
What's wrong, customer?

358
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,700
Shin Da Hye, it's destiny.

359
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,650
- What? 
- Destiny! Destiny, I said!

360
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,320
Destiny!

361
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,850
I'm a woman who already has a family. I'm sorry.

362
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,280
We don't have time for this.

363
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,900
What's wrong, customer? Please let go of me and talk.

364
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,240
Ah, seriously, so frustrating!

365
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,420
Please open your ears.

366
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,580
We don't have the time to be doing this!

367
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,240
Oh!

368
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,980
- It's an alarm!
- Shh!

369
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,810
Are you crazy?!

370
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:05,900
Where did the fire start?

371
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,200
What?

372
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,380
 There was an accident in the broadcasting room.

373
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,810
 There's no problem.

374
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:13,630
Aigoo.

375
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:16,550
I almost lost ten years of my life.

376
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:21,160
The person who pulled the alarm obviously didn't pay attention during the safety classes.

377
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:26,000
When that happens, you should take the customers to a safe place, right?

378
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,440
Shin Da Hye.

379
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,760
When you work in a department store,

380
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,400
don't panic during those situations, be calm. Okay?

381
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,500
Y-Yes, I'm sorry.

382
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,310
But, who are you?

383
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,290
Hello?

384
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,710
Yes.

385
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,190
Da Hye, who is that person?

386
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,450
I can't say. He probably works here...?

387
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:02,840
He was asking where the fire started and was fussy about the safety classes.

388
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,490
He was checking the outfits and looking thoroughly everywhere.

389
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,440
He also asked if we changed the sale products.

390
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,530
He asked about the people working in the basement.

391
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:12,150
It doesn't look like he's just an employee...

392
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:14,190
Perhaps...

393
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,440
It's almost next week. Did you look into it?

394
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,590
Yes. From what I found out, it seems to be either Mr. Park or Mr. Kim from marketing.

395
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:23,130
Or even Mr. Han from the business planning team.

396
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,230
Is that all?!

397
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,520
The president loves our department store.

398
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,500
It's a war between father and son. The chairman already wanted to sell the store.

399
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,110
If the income deficit continues, the chairman won't have anything to lose.

400
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:36,040
Moreover, he wouldn't fire his son, right?

401
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,030
He's not the only son, you know.

402
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:44,410
Anyway, we launched our premium branch and did some remodeling. Aren't we doing enough?

403
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:48,510
That's the last wish of the chairman. It's a 30-year-old landmark. So what?

404
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,470
The deficit is even bigger.

405
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,260
Then...

406
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,220
The new manager is a clean-up person.

407
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:57,820
A person who is in charge of ending our agonizing lives with death.

408
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,490
He has already been appointed.

409
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,660
Who is it?

410
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,590
That...

411
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:10,400
The chairman said that he stopped by the market in front of the department store today,

412
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,730
and his heart was really heavy.

413
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:16,530
If Sunjin Department Store goes bankrupt like this, the business at the marketplace will be ruined.

414
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:20,700
If the marketplace shops close, where would the chairman...

415
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:26,160
get his king sized steamed buns that he loves so?

416
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:31,270
Collapse? I'm working hard to save it.

417
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:35,510
"You think I don't know what you're planning?! You want to sell it at a higher price!"

418
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:38,740
Honestly, the longer we wait, the worse the situation will become.

419
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:44,170
For someone good with figures, why are you so into that department store?

420
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:47,810
Yes, I know very well why. This department store is Father's roots.

421
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:53,910
Aside from his personal feelings, if something is not useful, it's not a solution to sell it to someone else.

422
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:58,660
The world is watching Sunjin Group. Because of the suicide of an employee,

423
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,030
and also your love affairs being all over the newspapers,

424
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:06,700
the timing is bad. Will we receive a class action lawsuit from the employees now?

425
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,770
You little— Do you want to destroy the house just because the roof is leaking?!

426
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:14,160
He says.

427
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,310
I'm sorry.

428
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:19,100
I'm so embarrassed. We need to change the store's image.

429
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,770
This crisis has to change into a chance!

430
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:25,600
I won't allow ineffective, do-nothing mismanagement any longer!

431
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:30,120
We are wasting money and making no progress. I can't bear this any longer!

432
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:34,560
We have to make new reforms.

433
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,700
He says to let that person take charge.

434
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,990
That person? By that, do you mean...

435
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:46,910
He is on his way back, right now, from the United States. It's confidential.

436
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,560
By only looking at his face and hand, she knows what he thinks.

437
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,100
Rumor has it that Miss Wang is a mind reader or that her mom is a fortune teller.

438
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,620
If the chairman is only with her, they seem to converse a lot.

439
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,020
No one knows what the secret is.

440
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:02,730
I heard that Lee Hae Joon was an illegitimate child...

441
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:08,510
Want to get sued, huh? From what I know, he's the official heir.

442
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:11,190
Is he that great of a person?

443
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:21,350
 Of course. He's a graduate from Stanford University with a high IQ.

444
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:23,300
 His nickname was the Genius of Management Consulting, wasn't it?

445
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:29,100
 The Genius of Management Consulting, he restored the landmark of a failing mall.

446
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:33,870
The war of the half brothers. President Cha is probably going to freak out.

447
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:37,560
Still, if Lee Hae Joon becomes the manager, we might be able to avoid bankruptcy.

448
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,660
What are you saying? No matter how hard he tries, we won't ever be able to save this store.

449
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:44,640
Don't worry. I've already started to look for a new job for you at the headquarters.

450
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,220
It's handy to be from the same school.

451
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,440
Hello.

452
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,850
You're working hard.

453
00:40:51,850 --> 00:41:00,350

454
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:03,790
It drives me crazy that I get reminded of Manager Kim whenever I see her.

455
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:09,450
The president must have had some plan. The other employees don't know that she's Manager Kim's wife.

456
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:12,220
I don't know. I don't know. You take care so that she doesn't create some kind of ruckus.

457
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,700
Be sure that the reporters don't get near her and get rid of her after a while.

458
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:20,760
I can't do that. She's an employee from our partner.

459
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,200
She sure is tenacious. Tenacious.

460
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,840
How can she come to a place where her husband died?

461
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,340
Because a person must live to live.

462
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:46,190
 I knew he was that kind of a person. but this dirty and uncouth human being...

463
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:49,090
 It's not enough that you take my effort away and make me into trash.

464
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:52,510
 You alone ate well and lived well, huh?

465
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:15,420
What seems to be the problem, customer?

466
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,120
Customer?

467
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,750
Ah right. I'm a customer.

468
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:24,270
- Where's the president's office?
- What seems to be the problem?

469
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:28,380
To complain that the manager treats his customer in such unpleasant ways.

470
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,940
Yeah, that's you. You.

471
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:33,740
When did I look down on you?

472
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:37,940
Just now you tried to avoid me. Am I dirty? Am I poop?

473
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,390
What is wrong with this department store?

474
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:44,830
I'm sorry about that, customer. For now, please calm down.

475
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:50,060
If I seemed like that to you, I am sincerely sorry.

476
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,780
Is that the kind of posture a sorry person has?

477
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,190
- I am so sorry.
- More. More.

478
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:59,340
I am very sorry.

479
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,750
More.

480
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,350
I am very sorry.

481
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:05,890
More. More.

482
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:12,860
 Do you want something bad to happen to you?

483
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:15,160
When did I reveal my identity? I'll be careful.

484
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,940
He looks familiar. Is he a celebrity?

485
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:21,630
- Not sure. 
- Look at him. Where do you see people with long legs like his?

486
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:25,280
Ever since the beginning, he's been looking at me with a glare. He's been trying to get me to notice him.

487
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,040
I should have recognized him first and asked for an autograph. I should have given him a celebrity discount.

488
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,810
He's doing all of this just because I didn't notice. Celebrities are so obvious.

489
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,460
The one thing I hate the most in this world is celebrities.

490
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,820
Wait.

491
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:41,040
Nobody noticed yet. Doing this is going to make me more suspicious.

492
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,010
 Keep up your spirits. This is just the beginning.

493
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:47,690
Whew. The more I think about it, the bleaker it gets.

494
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:52,750
Did you hear? The person from up there?

495
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:55,570
Of course. The new shop manager?

496
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:57,470
It can't be...

497
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:02,630
Already?

498
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:05,020
Father becomes more and more cunning.

499
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:09,260
He's been acting up since the day after Mother's first death anniversary. Like he was waiting for this day.

500
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:12,300
Isn't destiny ironic?

501
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:17,160
Although you both were born with the same father, one came out with a silver spoon in his mouth

502
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,920
and the one had to fight for everything.

503
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,020
What if you two were to switch positions?

504
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:32,210
Yeah, it sure would be interesting.

505
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:36,640
There's no law that says it can't happen.

506
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:44,730
He is a person who came up here after he used to shine shoes.

507
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:47,750
He likes turning things around.

508
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:52,980
A while ago, he received a Jin Do dog from the Blue House, but

509
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:58,250
it got into a fight with a previous male Poong San dog who was living there before.

510
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:02,030
Skin ripped and blood flowed out from wounds.

511
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:05,790
It was a brutal fight for rank.

512
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:09,120
What do you think happened?

513
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:14,160
The chairman hugged the winner.

514
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,620
Dad!

515
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:24,270
Oh, Cha Yeong Chan.

516
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:28,640
Poong Soon gave birth to babies. Isn't it cute?

517
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,920
Ah, really? You're right.

518
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,290
He's as cute as you, Yeong Chan.

519
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:39,580
 Song Yi Yeon

520
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:44,220
 The person you have called is unavailable.

521
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,410
 The person you have called is unavailable.

522
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:58,270
Move. You won't move?

523
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:00,700
- I'm sorry.
- What are you?

524
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,590
What are you?

525
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:06,150
If you are my manager, go get me some work and stop following me around like a mutt.

526
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:08,060
Please calm down.

527
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,040
Fine.

528
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:14,470
Before I go insane, get Yeong Chan.

529
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:18,000
You have to follow the visit procedures. If you don't follow those, you'll be the one who is going to lose out.

530
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,260
He's not sending my kid without one phone call or text.

531
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:27,760
The boss said to give this to you.

532
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:51,660
Don't worry too much. It's something that hasn't been revealed to the world yet.

533
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,950
You...

534
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:56,490
You really...

535
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:58,500
 We're in a relationship where we shared a bed once

536
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:03,120
Isn't it polite to just ask about what happened?

537
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,570
Unlike what the strangers are saying,

538
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:09,600
- you aren't the reckless type of woman?
- For all this time, why were you holding back?

539
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,510
How did you hold back?

540
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:14,500
You should've revealed my secret to the world so you could insult me. Why hesitate?

541
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,600
Why? Are you afraid that crap water I've made could possibly splash onto you?

542
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,820
Yeah.

543
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:22,370
- Even if it's dirty, that's too dirty. 
 - What?

544
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:26,190
  Although rumors can be considered the truth, they are only rumors.

545
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:28,720
But with that one photo,

546
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:34,760
the pure Song Yi Yeon will immediately be the icon of infidelity and violence.

547
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,720
Is it true? That's not important.

548
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,760
People only believe what they see.

549
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,430
  You weren't satisfied with a rich husband so you had a thug for a lover

550
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:46,930
 If this is revealed to the world, a comeback is impossible.

551
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:51,500
What will the kid think of the mother?

552
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,940
I don't want to go that far. Its not being respectful to the dead.

553
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:02,150
That person died because of you.

554
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:07,840
  Woah, woah.  
No matter how much you hate me, that's going a little too far.

555
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:11,270
The photo is just a fact,

556
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:14,230
and this shows just what you did.

557
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:18,470
You're the one who sought the moment.

558
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:24,000
I'll keep Yeong Chan here for few more days and then send him your way.

559
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,480
Father kept on asking to see him recently.

560
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:31,690
- He seems to be getting old. 
- Yeah.

561
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:35,760
You can corner me as much as you want. I won't stay still anyway.

562
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:41,140
But I don't use cheap tactics like you do. You know why?!

563
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:45,170
Those kind of things are worse than death for me.

564
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:50,690
Treat the child well if you want to see his face.

565
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:09,670
A bastard like you who became someone's dog one morning,

566
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:12,990
I used to trust you like my right hand man.

567
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:21,460
Only the person who died is pitiful.

568
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,840
Is finding a way to fill my bowl a sin?

569
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:31,830
Is it the reason why you did not stay true to him

570
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:34,460
and came back to Hyungnim?

571
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:38,750
- Let go!
- What was the relationship between you two or

572
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,580
what happened that night might not be my business.

573
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:42,070
Let go. Why won't you let go?

574
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:48,940
The word betrayer. Isn't it more appropriate for someone who didn't keep his promise to his family

575
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:54,090
and abandoned them for a woman?

576
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,520
That's enough.

577
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:11,780
It hurts... Seong Jae-ya.

578
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:27,260
Yes, what you said is right.

579
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,940
You hurt her, so that's enough.

580
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:33,730
Stop before I beat you to death.

581
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:48,870
She says you lived in the same neighborhood when you were young.You didn't know her?

582
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:50,100
I didn't know.

583
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:54,190
It's probably the first she's heard of this.

584
00:50:56,010 --> 00:51:03,380
My mother died early due to an illness, and when my brother was in his rebellious phase

585
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:07,770
I was just a little child.

586
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:12,940
To give his younger sister a comfortable life,

587
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:17,600
my older brother raised me far away from his organization.

588
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,550
I don't think he had such an intimate personality.

589
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:22,130
 Heol.

590
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:26,840
He had deep thoughts that his underlings didn't know about.

591
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:33,570
Are you feeling better after your hemorrhoid surgery? It's the third time. It was probably difficult.

592
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,980
That look in your eyes.

593
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,820
There's no relation whatsoever.

594
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:46,930
 This little!

595
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:49,890
Okay, so let's say you're his younger sister. What have you been doing and why did you appear now?

596
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:55,830
I uh, that is... There was a small accident.

597
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:59,520
Anyway, I came from America. America.

598
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,960
Studied abroad? What was your major?

599
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:05,960
No, I just lived there and came here.

600
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:09,690
Stop assuming that everybody who goes to America goes there to study.

601
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:12,230
Is everyone who lives in the Shillim neighborhood a Seoul National University student?

602
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:16,110
Why? Am I wrong?

603
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:28,630
He asked me to say just anything in English and that you couldn't understand it.

604
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:30,540
Is he right?

605
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:36,710
Get rid of the assumption that they only speak English in America.

606
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:42,610
Let go! Let go!

607
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:47,660
I don't know what your reason to be here is...

608
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,400
Wait!

609
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:55,640
If you really can't believe me, I have evidence. On my body...

610
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:59,020
I mean on my older brother's body,

611
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:02,860
There's a dragon tattoo.

612
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:04,610
Really.

613
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:13,320
I am your older brother.

614
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:15,800
Go.

615
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,770
That is... It's not the dragon's eye but a mole.

616
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:22,700
I got it, so let me ask one more thing.

617
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:28,090
What happened to the picture that was taken underneath the bridge. Who sent him?

618
00:53:28,090 --> 00:53:32,880
You. Who are you, really?

619
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,850
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Yes.

620
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,290
 Kim Yeong Soo is your husband, right?

621
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,740
What's wrong? Are you feeling sick?

622
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:08,480
No, momentary low blood pressure.

623
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,010
I guess it's time for shift change. Go rest and come back.

624
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:13,690
Yes.

625
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:21,400
Excuse me.

626
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,770
 Aiyoo, why are you so heavy?

627
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:13,420
 What's wrong with you? I already have a woman.

628
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:42,290
 Leader Jeong! Where are you?

629
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:14,320
 Careful!

630
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,450
This... Oh!

631
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:19,140
Oh my God! God? God?!

632
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:24,870
 I will arrive in Seoul soon

633
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:52,300
 Honey... If I knew this was going to happen, I should have hugged you.

634
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:58,660
 I love you. Thank you. I should've said these words.

635
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:03,990
♬  A memory which was lost in space  ♬

636
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:05,160
Are you okay?

637
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:10,750
I'm sorry. It's my fault. Are you at all hurt?
♬  The memories of a time I turned far away from  ♬

638
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:13,150
I'm okay. I'm really okay.
♬  The memories of a time I turned far away from  ♬

639
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:16,070
Ah, this...
♬  Whether it was a matter of something which was forgotten  ♬

640
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:18,400
I keep telling you that I'm fine!
♬  Whether it was a matter of something which was forgotten  ♬

641
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,980
Is this building cursed with a disease that makes you say sorry? Everybody who comes here always says sorry too many times.

642
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:26,730
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
♬ I’m spending a day once again among the days I dreamed of.  ♬

643
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:29,950
The dust...
♬ I’m spending a day once again among the days I dreamed of.  ♬

644
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:35,720
♬  I’m spending a day once again among the days I dreamed of.  ♬

645
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:53,560
What's going on?

646
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:58,880
Nothing. But, you shouldn't come in here.

647
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:03,610
Ah, right. That's what I'm saying. I shouldn't be in here.

648
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:09,390
This! This box is just... so dusty.

649
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:18,350
Hello? It's me! Oh I should've gone there but I came here instead.

650
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:21,830
I know...

651
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:29,110
 Then, one who came from the top? Then, the new department head?

652
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:39,950
 Kim Yeong Soo... There's a small problem.

653
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:41,860
A problem?

654
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:47,000
Let's hear what you have to say. A photo?

655
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:49,030
What do you mean?

656
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:51,220
That night,

657
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:55,340
I talked to Han Gi Tak before he died.

658
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:04,300
 Paparazzi!

659
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:16,390
You were caught in the trap. Han Gi Tak died,

660
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:19,840
and you need someone but there is no one you can trust.

661
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:22,360
That's why I came here.

662
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:34,240
Exactly who do I look similar to that I need to be careful?

663
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:38,390
I can't tell you directly.

664
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:41,330
Aish. Don't joke around.

665
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:45,030
- Is it really the same?
- N-No...

666
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:46,760
It's not the same face at all.

667
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:52,100
The thickness of the eyebrows is different and the size of the mole is a bit...

668
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:54,360
Then it's the same!

669
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:02,500
 Seon Jin Group's chairman's secret son, Lee Hae Joon

670
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:12,120
 The chairman's son?

671
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:26,500
 One sheep, two sheep...

672
01:01:57,130 --> 01:02:05,170

673
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:10,930
♬ Bye, bye, bye. Good Bye, no, no, no ♬

674
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:13,920
♫  I'm afraid.  ♫

675
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,330
 - It's a pervert.
- Well I did follow you, but to say that I followed you is...

676
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:21,980
 If you interfere, I think it's going to get unpleasant.

677
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:25,690
 Don't kick out a guest even if he's a beggar.

678
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:28,100
 Oh right. Why did you do that to me?

679
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:31,560
 The most hideous man is the one who drinks and cries.

680
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:32,690
 No, I...

681
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:35,650
 The new department head is Lee Hae Joon.

682
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:37,390
 Why are you telling me that now?!

683
01:02:37,390 --> 01:02:39,830
 I'm doing my best right now.

684
01:02:39,830 --> 01:02:41,020
 You're the president right?

685
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:43,030
 No, I'm not. You must have the wrong person.

686
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:44,590
 Please help me!

687
01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:46,530
 You should let go.

688
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:52,500
 I'm certainly going to reveal it so that the two women won't cry again.
