1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,990

2
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:38,607
Han Na, where are you? Dad is coming.

3
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:00,907
Oh, Honey.

4
00:01:00,907 --> 00:01:03,047
Han Na is missing.

5
00:01:03,047 --> 00:01:05,307
What?!

6
00:01:05,307 --> 00:01:08,147
Han Na's Mom must be going crazy now. Can you come quickly?

7
00:01:08,147 --> 00:01:11,707
I got it. I'm coming right now.

8
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:21,147
She is not answering her phone. Her friends said they don't know where she is.

9
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:22,787
Have you contacted her school or the police station?

10
00:01:22,787 --> 00:01:24,087
Yes.

11
00:01:24,087 --> 00:01:26,007
You did well.

12
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:32,087
You should calm down first. Don't worry. Nothing will happed to our Han Na.

13
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:34,927
Yes.

14
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:43,707
Da Hae! I have contacted my brother's friends so we can find her soon.

15
00:01:44,407 --> 00:01:50,367
If she wanted to see her dad, might she have gone to the ossuary?

16
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:53,307
I will call the police station there too.

17
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:59,127
Now all you have to do is not worry and smile.

18
00:02:01,847 --> 00:02:03,787
Thank you.

19
00:02:09,447 --> 00:02:10,957
I haven't.

20
00:02:12,607 --> 00:02:13,867
Have you seen this girl?

21
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,487
Are you Han Na's friends?

22
00:02:15,487 --> 00:02:17,307
If you find her, call me.

23
00:02:17,307 --> 00:02:18,187
Yes.

24
00:02:18,187 --> 00:02:21,947
You two go that way, and you three go this way. Get going!

25
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:55,147
 I miss Dad. I am going out to see him.

26
00:02:57,307 --> 00:02:59,927
Han Na, where did you go?

27
00:03:01,407 --> 00:03:03,067
Oh, Father.

28
00:03:03,987 --> 00:03:06,087
What's the fuss?

29
00:03:06,087 --> 00:03:09,167
Don't worry. Han Na is probably with her friends.

30
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:13,167
If she wanted to see her dad, she probably went there.

31
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:15,607
What do you mean "there"?

32
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,707
- I think I know where she is.
 - Let's go together.

33
00:03:35,707 --> 00:03:38,847
I'll bring her. I promise.

34
00:03:57,147 --> 00:04:00,567
  Han Na, be there, please...

35
00:04:03,347 --> 00:04:06,147
 Episode 13

36
00:04:06,147 --> 00:04:11,387
The branch manager instructed that the model on the main billboard be changed to Song Yi Yeon.

37
00:04:11,387 --> 00:04:14,647
He is so excited. Let him do whatever he wants.

38
00:04:14,647 --> 00:04:17,147
It doesn't matter how hard he tries because he is still an illegitimate child.

39
00:04:17,147 --> 00:04:20,447
Where is Chairman? Doesn't he have an important dinner today?

40
00:04:20,447 --> 00:04:23,227
He said that you don't need to come to the business round table dinner today.

41
00:04:23,227 --> 00:04:26,227
I heard that he wants you to tend to department store affairs.

42
00:04:26,227 --> 00:04:29,667
So now he doesn't even want to have me show up?

43
00:04:35,187 --> 00:04:40,287
Did you hear how the branch manager stomped on the president and got Song Yi Yeon's contract?

44
00:04:40,357 --> 00:04:43,957
- Then the head of the pack is Lee Hae Joon, right?
 - Right!

45
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:48,827
Then, can we now be freed from the president's oppression?

46
00:04:48,827 --> 00:04:50,947
All right!

47
00:04:50,947 --> 00:04:53,087
Lee Hae Joon?

48
00:04:54,247 --> 00:05:00,727
He is very smart. He knows how to push people's buttons.

49
00:05:00,727 --> 00:05:04,187
If he implants Song Yi Yeon's face in my department store,

50
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:07,287
he doesn't think I can sell it?

51
00:05:09,287 --> 00:05:12,887
Proceed in selling the department store. Collect as many shares as possible.

52
00:05:12,887 --> 00:05:19,327
It seems Father wants me to show my capability. I should.

53
00:05:20,247 --> 00:05:21,247
Yes.

54
00:05:21,247 --> 00:05:25,507
By the way, Song Yi Yeon's manager, Hong Nan...

55
00:05:25,507 --> 00:05:28,907
Is there anything strange about her?

56
00:05:28,907 --> 00:05:31,407
What do you mean strange?

57
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:35,327
Why do you think she is standing beside Song Yi Yeon?

58
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:37,867
It is very annoying.

59
00:05:37,867 --> 00:05:40,667
Do you have any personal relationship with her?

60
00:05:42,327 --> 00:05:45,747
No. You can leave.

61
00:05:51,427 --> 00:05:53,607
- Secretary Oh. 
 - Yes.

62
00:05:53,607 --> 00:05:55,667
Bring Na Seok Cheol in.

63
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:59,707
I think I have something to hear from him

64
00:05:59,707 --> 00:06:02,227
about Han Gi Tak.

65
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:30,667
 At times like this, I don't even have the right to comfort you.

66
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:39,127
When you are nervous, you can try this to calm down.

67
00:06:39,127 --> 00:06:45,147
Pucker up like a chicken anus, and make a sound prolonged sound like this.

68
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:11,207
Are you mad at me?

69
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:12,987
No.

70
00:08:12,987 --> 00:08:16,527
Did you come here because you miss your dad?

71
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:21,447
Dad told me we would come here together.

72
00:08:25,227 --> 00:08:30,287
It looks cool. Did you want to ride this so much?

73
00:08:30,287 --> 00:08:37,767
Ajhussi, If I go closer to the sky, do you think I can see Dad?

74
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:44,887
The party made me feel so happy and was good.

75
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:51,707
Mom and Grandfather seem like they like you, Ahjusshi.

76
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:55,527
But since Dad is not here,

77
00:08:56,667 --> 00:09:03,307
if I end up liking you, Dad will seem too pitiful.

78
00:09:06,607 --> 00:09:13,547
Because I momentarily forgot about Dad, because I forgot why I miss him,

79
00:09:14,507 --> 00:09:18,047
maybe that's why Dad doesn't come to my dreams anymore.

80
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:24,447
I still have things that I didn't get to say to Dad...

81
00:09:25,187 --> 00:09:29,967
Then, shall we go and meet your Dad?

82
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:46,487
It's really high.

83
00:09:47,507 --> 00:09:49,407
Aren't you scared?

84
00:09:50,927 --> 00:09:52,707
No.

85
00:09:59,927 --> 00:10:02,727
But Ahjusshi is scared.

86
00:10:18,797 --> 00:10:21,837
Your hand is big.

87
00:10:21,837 --> 00:10:24,787
I feel like I can smell Dad's scent.

88
00:10:30,837 --> 00:10:35,497
Really? Is it because I use the same lotion?

89
00:10:37,197 --> 00:10:42,427
Ahjusshi... Dad really sent you, right?

90
00:10:46,207 --> 00:10:48,297
No wonder.

91
00:10:51,927 --> 00:10:53,937
Han Na.

92
00:10:53,937 --> 00:10:59,947
Can't you tell me what you want to tell your dad?

93
00:10:59,947 --> 00:11:03,267
I like you Ahjusshi, but...

94
00:11:03,267 --> 00:11:07,107
You're not my dad.

95
00:12:35,447 --> 00:12:38,547
Dad!

96
00:12:38,547 --> 00:12:41,367
- Dad.
- Han Na...

97
00:12:45,897 --> 00:12:51,307
Dad! Do you know how much I missed you?!

98
00:12:51,307 --> 00:12:56,227
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

99
00:12:56,227 --> 00:13:01,437
Why did you leave me behind? Why did you do it?!

100
00:13:01,437 --> 00:13:06,347
Dad is sorry.

101
00:13:06,347 --> 00:13:09,627
I'm sorry, my baby. Dad is sorry.

102
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,497
Dad...

103
00:13:15,517 --> 00:13:19,397
I'm sorry for not being your real daughter.

104
00:13:20,237 --> 00:13:25,107
No, don't be. Dad...

105
00:13:27,347 --> 00:13:32,037
I was really happy that I was your dad.

106
00:13:33,277 --> 00:13:36,387
Thank you for letting me be your dad.

107
00:13:36,387 --> 00:13:38,357
Dad...

108
00:13:38,357 --> 00:13:44,257
♬   Maybe in a place that I can’t even go back to   ♬

109
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:48,177
Dad... You're Dad...

110
00:13:48,177 --> 00:13:51,957
♬   My whole love is alive and breathing.   ♬

111
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:57,187
♬   That you are my everything   ♬

112
00:13:57,187 --> 00:14:02,417
♬   will stay within us   ♬

113
00:14:02,457 --> 00:14:13,357
♬   While being conscious of that and considering that I will hug you   ♬

114
00:14:31,327 --> 00:14:34,067
 Da Hye! Why all of a sudden?

115
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:38,587
 Yeong Soo, you don't suit me.

116
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:39,817
 Did I do something wrong?

117
00:14:39,817 --> 00:14:44,357
 No. I just don't like you anymore.

118
00:14:44,357 --> 00:14:45,937
 Alright.

119
00:14:47,347 --> 00:14:51,147
 Since that is how you feel, I won't say anything.

120
00:14:51,147 --> 00:14:56,597
 But! Because my feelings are my own, don't tell me to change my feelings.

121
00:14:56,597 --> 00:15:01,157
 If there's another man in your life, I hope that relationship will break apart!

122
00:15:01,157 --> 00:15:04,877
 Like now, I will live well so don't worry about me.

123
00:15:04,877 --> 00:15:09,337
 Da Hye, please only think about your happiness.

124
00:15:09,337 --> 00:15:13,137
  Then... Goodbye.

125
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:45,967
- Kim Han Na!
- Mom...

126
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:49,037
Are you really going to keep doing this, making Mom feel bad?

127
00:15:49,037 --> 00:15:52,137
Yes, Han Na. You need to be scolded for worrying your mom.

128
00:15:52,137 --> 00:15:53,867
Are you going to do it again?

129
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:55,127
Tell her you're sorry.

130
00:15:55,127 --> 00:15:57,337
I'm sorry, Mom.

131
00:15:57,337 --> 00:16:01,077
Are you going to do it again? Really! Do you know how bad I feel—

132
00:16:01,077 --> 00:16:04,297
Stop it, she said she's sorry.

133
00:16:07,457 --> 00:16:10,997
I'm sorry, Mom.

134
00:16:14,777 --> 00:16:18,117
Look at this. What did I say?

135
00:16:27,147 --> 00:16:31,627
Hey, you wench! How many times did I tell you to not eat while you're walking around?

136
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:53,457
That tough wench. How could she not contact me at all after leaving like that?

137
00:16:57,127 --> 00:17:00,887
Oppa, why is your sister so vicious like you?

138
00:17:02,457 --> 00:17:04,977
Is she similar to you?

139
00:17:04,977 --> 00:17:07,437
She's not similar at all.

140
00:17:07,437 --> 00:17:12,087
 Even if I'm not there, Seung Jae will protect you.

141
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:18,577
Tell Hong Nan, that wench, to never think of even coming back to me because I will not accept her.

142
00:17:18,577 --> 00:17:20,627
I understand.

143
00:17:23,087 --> 00:17:27,647
I have no use for Hong Nan's blabbing, so

144
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:31,257
make sure she never comes close to me. Got it?

145
00:17:31,257 --> 00:17:32,797
Yes.

146
00:17:37,187 --> 00:17:41,117
But then, how did you meet with Ahjusshi?

147
00:17:41,117 --> 00:17:45,427
I don't know. Ahjusshi found me.

148
00:17:45,427 --> 00:17:47,647
I see.

149
00:17:51,897 --> 00:17:56,687
Han Na, did you really miss Dad that much?

150
00:18:01,537 --> 00:18:05,077
You don't know how much Dad loves you, right?

151
00:18:05,077 --> 00:18:07,937
When I was pregnant with you in my belly,

152
00:18:07,937 --> 00:18:12,967
he would sing a lullaby every day and

153
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,697
to make Mom smile, he even danced.

154
00:18:15,697 --> 00:18:20,137
Whenever you heard Dad's voice, you kicked a lot because you liked it.

155
00:18:21,677 --> 00:18:27,317
Do you know how similar you are to Dad when you're sleeping? You both raise your arms like hooray.

156
00:18:29,017 --> 00:18:32,927
- Mom, I met Dad.
- What?

157
00:18:32,927 --> 00:18:37,107
When I rode the ferris wheel with Ahjusshi, I saw Dad in my dream.

158
00:18:37,107 --> 00:18:41,937
He thanked me. He said he was happy to be my dad.

159
00:18:43,637 --> 00:18:46,037
Dad said that?

160
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:52,217
So I told him that I was so happy to be his daughter. I did well, right?

161
00:18:54,867 --> 00:19:00,327
You must be glad to see Dad again, Han Na.

162
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:04,277
Good night.

163
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:16,677
Mom... misses him too.

164
00:19:22,727 --> 00:19:29,337

165
00:19:38,797 --> 00:19:42,217
 Because of your low blood pressure, you can't move too much.

166
00:19:43,607 --> 00:19:46,237
  But... Why am I here?

167
00:19:46,237 --> 00:19:51,717
 It seems you fainted on the street. Did your guardian go somewhere?

168
00:19:51,717 --> 00:19:54,107
  - Who? 
 - The child's father.

169
00:19:55,607 --> 00:19:58,637
  I-I'm here!

170
00:20:01,087 --> 00:20:06,037
 The child's father is right here.

171
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:15,067
♬  That I can't see you   ♬

172
00:20:15,067 --> 00:20:21,217
♬  That was all   ♬

173
00:20:21,217 --> 00:20:29,497
♬  the memories I made with you, even all the sadness   ♬

174
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:41,827
♬  I loved everything.  ♬

175
00:20:41,827 --> 00:20:44,227
 I'm in front of the house.

176
00:20:44,227 --> 00:20:48,917
I don't know what to call this feeling,

177
00:20:49,947 --> 00:20:54,757
I feel even more lonely after finding my little sister.

178
00:20:54,757 --> 00:20:59,207
She is my family but I know nothing about her.

179
00:20:59,877 --> 00:21:02,487
There is nothing that I can do.

180
00:21:02,487 --> 00:21:06,547
I can't say that I'm her big brother.

181
00:21:06,547 --> 00:21:10,797
I know that feeling because I felt it too.

182
00:21:10,797 --> 00:21:17,077
But this body suits you. How nice would it be to live like this?

183
00:21:17,077 --> 00:21:22,857
Han Na said to me, "Ahjusshi is good but he's not my dad."

184
00:21:22,857 --> 00:21:29,227
Now I am beginning to understand how it was going to get harder in this world.

185
00:21:36,237 --> 00:21:38,887
Is Han Na okay? Was she hurt anywhere?

186
00:21:38,887 --> 00:21:42,087
Yes. It was chaos so

187
00:21:42,087 --> 00:21:45,247
I couldn't call you. I'm sorry.

188
00:21:45,247 --> 00:21:46,977
- Da Hye... 
 - Also,

189
00:21:46,977 --> 00:21:49,337
I would like it if you don't come to my house ever again.

190
00:21:49,337 --> 00:21:50,837
Han Na...

191
00:21:52,447 --> 00:21:54,497
Is she, by chance, my daughter?

192
00:21:55,427 --> 00:22:01,527
Even in the past, I did think that it couldn't be true. You two were married so that couldn't happen.

193
00:22:01,527 --> 00:22:07,817
I didn't question it further, but now I need to hear the answer from you directly, Da Hye.

194
00:22:09,187 --> 00:22:10,577
Is she really not my daughter?

195
00:22:10,577 --> 00:22:12,227
What do you mean?

196
00:22:12,227 --> 00:22:15,537
Han Na knew before I did

197
00:22:15,537 --> 00:22:17,837
that the two of us are similar.

198
00:22:20,247 --> 00:22:23,057
Again, why is that bastard—

199
00:22:25,297 --> 00:22:30,597
I know I don't have the right to say this, but now you can tell me the truth.

200
00:22:30,597 --> 00:22:33,497
Manager Jeong, you're very rude.

201
00:22:33,497 --> 00:22:35,387
Shouldn't you have at least told me?

202
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:39,397
No. No, I shouldn't have.

203
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:44,427
Han Na's father is Kim Yeong Soo.

204
00:22:44,427 --> 00:22:49,147
The dad that Han Na wants to see is only one person—Kim Yeong Soo.

205
00:22:49,147 --> 00:22:54,527
That has been the case up to now, and it won't change in the future.

206
00:22:54,527 --> 00:22:56,507
Did you get your answer?

207
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,627
Then goodbye.

208
00:23:06,297 --> 00:23:14,457

209
00:23:32,567 --> 00:23:37,387
What is this? What was Jeong Ji Hoon just talking about?

210
00:23:38,077 --> 00:23:40,657
You heard it, Han Na is my daughter.

211
00:23:40,657 --> 00:23:44,777
Tell me properly! What is it that I don't know?

212
00:23:44,777 --> 00:23:47,707
Goodness, why are you being like this?

213
00:23:47,707 --> 00:23:52,667
Hey... Did you know everything from the start?

214
00:23:55,027 --> 00:23:57,427
You knew that she was Jeong Ji Hoon's daughter?

215
00:23:57,427 --> 00:23:58,907
No.

216
00:24:00,067 --> 00:24:02,007
I didn't know that.

217
00:24:02,857 --> 00:24:07,347
I knew that after coming back, after I found out that they used to date each other.

218
00:24:07,347 --> 00:24:11,887
How could you not know when Jeong Ji Hoon is right by your side?

219
00:24:11,887 --> 00:24:16,117
What about Da Hye? Even after leaving him by your side, she never said anything?!

220
00:24:16,117 --> 00:24:18,947
I made a promise with Da Hye when we got married.

221
00:24:20,077 --> 00:24:22,607
Han Na is my daughter.

222
00:24:22,607 --> 00:24:28,227
So I don't ever ask about the past and we don't talk about it.

223
00:24:28,227 --> 00:24:30,187
At the time, that...

224
00:24:31,377 --> 00:24:35,167
is what we thought was the best solution to protect our family.

225
00:24:36,297 --> 00:24:40,527
But, to think that it was Jeong Ji Hoon of all people.

226
00:24:41,937 --> 00:24:44,407
I was so mad.

227
00:24:45,197 --> 00:24:48,277
I couldn't do anything about it.

228
00:24:49,477 --> 00:24:54,017
At that time I had a misunderstanding that the two were secretly meeting without me knowing.

229
00:24:54,017 --> 00:24:58,427
This person... Why are you telling me only now?

230
00:24:58,427 --> 00:25:02,657
Are you trying to hold it in alone until you go to heaven?

231
00:25:02,657 --> 00:25:04,497
Exactly.

232
00:25:05,957 --> 00:25:10,797
It's hard for me but it was probably worse for Da Hye.

233
00:25:12,597 --> 00:25:14,577
She could only talk to me.

234
00:25:14,577 --> 00:25:21,187
It was probably also hard for her to see you hanging out with him, when she couldn't say anything.

235
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:26,407
I only thought about being pissed off. I was selfish and never thought about that.

236
00:25:26,407 --> 00:25:28,527
Like a fool.

237
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:33,487
I really liked Jeong Ji Hoon. I was envious of him too.

238
00:25:34,697 --> 00:25:37,847
Without knowing, I hurt Da Hye.

239
00:25:39,457 --> 00:25:42,107
Even when I came back from the dead, I hurt her.

240
00:25:43,687 --> 00:25:46,337
Why am I so dumb?

241
00:25:52,757 --> 00:25:55,547
  Han Na's father is Kim Yeong Soo.

242
00:25:55,547 --> 00:25:59,417
 That was the case in the past, and it won't change in the future.

243
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:01,687
Hey! Jeong Ji Hoon!

244
00:26:04,287 --> 00:26:06,077
Hong Nan?

245
00:26:10,687 --> 00:26:14,277
You bastard. Are you a human?!

246
00:26:18,627 --> 00:26:21,427
- Why are you being like this?
- You're asking like you don't know?

247
00:26:22,277 --> 00:26:25,227
Because of the gloves? I didn't say anything though!

248
00:26:25,227 --> 00:26:28,747
What do you mean you didn't say anything? You opened your big mouth.

249
00:26:28,747 --> 00:26:33,827
You fool. Looks like you need a beating today.

250
00:26:50,847 --> 00:26:53,177
So pitiful...

251
00:27:31,237 --> 00:27:35,097
 Bok Dong (Lucky charm), how are you doing in there?

252
00:27:35,097 --> 00:27:38,327
 If you want to eat something, tell Mom.

253
00:27:38,327 --> 00:27:41,527
 I can't wait to get to the day when I will meet you.

254
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:45,207
 Also, I am your father.

255
00:28:00,397 --> 00:28:02,457
  Be careful!

256
00:28:04,657 --> 00:28:06,927
 Until when will you keep being like this?

257
00:28:06,927 --> 00:28:09,277
 I'll just give you this before I leave.

258
00:28:09,277 --> 00:28:12,517
 If you catch a cold, it'll be really bad!

259
00:28:12,517 --> 00:28:15,707
 It's cold today, but your body can't be cold.

260
00:28:15,707 --> 00:28:19,557
 Also this.

261
00:28:23,897 --> 00:28:25,667
  Isn't it cute?

262
00:28:30,717 --> 00:28:33,837
 Well you know... It's Christmas.

263
00:28:38,977 --> 00:28:40,847
  I'll get going.

264
00:28:48,537 --> 00:28:50,367
  Yeong Soo!

265
00:28:50,367 --> 00:28:51,627
  Yeah? Yeah.

266
00:28:51,627 --> 00:28:53,827
 I have a request.

267
00:28:57,417 --> 00:28:59,687
 Please buy me a cake.

268
00:29:21,587 --> 00:29:26,987
 And here I thought... Well sure I'll buy you the cake, it's not like it's a diamond ring.

269
00:29:26,987 --> 00:29:31,067
 If I ask you to buy me a diamond ring, will you buy it for me?

270
00:29:31,067 --> 00:29:33,247
  Oh of course!

271
00:29:33,247 --> 00:29:37,957
 If you want a diamond, I'll buy it! It'll be hard but, I can buy it!

272
00:29:37,957 --> 00:29:40,807
 Did you pick one out already? Let's go!

273
00:29:40,807 --> 00:29:44,437
 Ah, I thought about a nickname for our baby.

274
00:29:44,437 --> 00:29:46,757
 How about Bok Dong?

275
00:29:46,757 --> 00:29:48,287
 That's cheesy!

276
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,987
 Right? That's cheesy. Of course it is.

277
00:29:51,767 --> 00:29:55,547
 I didn't think of that...

278
00:29:56,607 --> 00:30:00,707
 Thank you for making me a dad.

279
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:05,757
  Oh, and Merry Christmas.

280
00:30:05,757 --> 00:30:07,997
  Merry Christmas.

281
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:19,297
  Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas.

282
00:31:17,647 --> 00:31:24,287
♬   If I close my eyes, if I close them again  ♬

283
00:31:24,287 --> 00:31:31,157
♬  That short memory of us doesn't disappear   ♬

284
00:31:31,157 --> 00:31:38,107
♬   If I hear your name, I keep calling for you  ♬

285
00:31:38,107 --> 00:31:44,187
♬  I love you, I love you  ♬

286
00:31:44,187 --> 00:31:50,317
♬  Don't leave me, don't leave me behind   ♬

287
00:31:50,317 --> 00:31:55,997
♬  A day without you, I feel like I'll keep on crying   ♬

288
00:31:55,997 --> 00:32:00,977
♬   It hurts so much  ♬

289
00:32:00,977 --> 00:32:05,867
♬  It really feels like you'll come back   ♬

290
00:32:05,867 --> 00:32:16,837
♬  If I close my eyes once again, you appear  ♬

291
00:32:33,867 --> 00:32:38,567
How long did Han Gi Tak live here again?

292
00:32:39,467 --> 00:32:42,997
Probably ten plus years.

293
00:32:45,677 --> 00:32:47,697
I see.

294
00:32:53,527 --> 00:33:01,127
 Happy Life: Happy Life is a promise made with you.

295
00:33:39,657 --> 00:33:44,757
Big Wolf's owner, let's meet with Chef Han Gi Tak.

296
00:33:45,347 --> 00:33:47,877
Owner.

297
00:33:51,037 --> 00:33:53,327
I heard he's still single.

298
00:33:53,327 --> 00:33:57,257
As you cook, at an awesome location,

299
00:33:57,257 --> 00:34:03,357
I'll feel like I want to eat something delicious with the person I love.

300
00:34:03,357 --> 00:34:06,117
 Often, when I see a woman who is happy,

301
00:34:06,117 --> 00:34:08,627
 there are often times when I have thoughts like this.

302
00:34:08,627 --> 00:34:13,877
 Seeing the happy faces of my customers, while they're eating my food,

303
00:34:13,877 --> 00:34:16,687
 is my biggest happiness right now.

304
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:18,557
 How boring.

305
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:21,667
 That's why you still can't date, Oppa.

306
00:34:23,817 --> 00:34:26,657
 Is there a date you'd want to have with your loved one?

307
00:34:26,657 --> 00:34:29,137
 While holding hands, walking across the Mapo bridge.

308
00:34:29,137 --> 00:34:31,557
 So it's not me.

309
00:34:31,557 --> 00:34:34,317
 She's just a run of the mill girl. Just run of the mill.

310
00:34:34,317 --> 00:34:37,407
 Forget that. Next question!

311
00:34:37,407 --> 00:34:40,977
 If you were to pick one food that you thought was the most delicious food you ate, what would it be?

312
00:34:40,977 --> 00:34:44,337
 My deceased mother made for me

313
00:34:45,367 --> 00:34:47,857
 steamy hot rice and soybean paste stew.

314
00:34:47,857 --> 00:34:51,627
 Rice and soybean paste stew...?

315
00:34:53,237 --> 00:34:56,377
 What's so hard about that?

316
00:34:56,377 --> 00:35:01,557
 He said he got the pub's name from Hermann Hesse's story line.

317
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:06,447
 There is a special... significance

318
00:35:06,447 --> 00:35:10,337
 The first gift I received from the one who I loved.
Knulp : The beauty of life's new story by Hermann Hasse

319
00:35:10,337 --> 00:35:15,297
 It's about a lost soul who is dying and trying to to figure out his life, but

320
00:35:15,297 --> 00:35:17,787
 I still haven't read all of it.

321
00:35:17,787 --> 00:35:19,867
 It's too difficult.

322
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,737
 It's difficult!

♬   La la la la la la  ♬

324
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:35,477
♬   La la la la la la  ♬

325
00:35:35,477 --> 00:35:39,697
♬  Love is beginning  ♬

326
00:35:49,137 --> 00:35:56,467
♬   Your fragrance which is carried by the wind  ♬

327
00:35:58,967 --> 00:36:06,137
♬   A warm feeling spreads through my heart  ♬

328
00:36:08,617 --> 00:36:15,817
♬   How long was I looking forward  ♬

329
00:36:15,817 --> 00:36:20,787
♬  My heart keeps racing   ♬

330
00:36:20,787 --> 00:36:28,087
♬   I feel like I'm going to cry  ♬

331
00:36:28,087 --> 00:36:32,367
What's wrong with you, Song Yi Yeon?
♬   Do you look in the eyes  ♬

332
00:36:32,367 --> 00:36:38,357
What is that wench to you?
 ♬   of someone who has fallen in love? They are warm  ♬

333
00:36:38,357 --> 00:36:44,907
♬   The warmth rekindles in my heart.  ♬

334
00:36:44,907 --> 00:36:49,267
♬   Love is beginning.  ♬

335
00:36:52,867 --> 00:36:59,127

336
00:37:09,747 --> 00:37:13,677
It's been a long time since I came to a place like this with you.

337
00:37:15,377 --> 00:37:17,517
It's our first time.

338
00:37:19,277 --> 00:37:24,307
Like a passing wind, you said I can talk about anything, right?

339
00:37:24,307 --> 00:37:25,517
Right.

340
00:37:25,517 --> 00:37:27,917
Then I'll talk with you.

341
00:37:28,937 --> 00:37:33,687
I received so much love from Yeong Soo that

342
00:37:34,367 --> 00:37:37,667
I didn't think I had the right to complain.

343
00:37:37,667 --> 00:37:43,447
And so, even if it was tough, I couldn't tell him that.

344
00:37:43,447 --> 00:37:46,497
In order to match with him,

345
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:50,057
the fact that I couldn't show him my true self,

346
00:37:50,057 --> 00:37:52,387
I regret it.

347
00:37:52,387 --> 00:37:54,927
If I had been more honest,

348
00:37:54,927 --> 00:37:58,167
might that person have been different?

349
00:37:59,157 --> 00:38:05,957
I felt too guilty that I couldn't hold on to that person.

350
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:11,707
At that time you appeared, Branch Manager.

351
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:15,437
To my family, while seeing true feelings,

352
00:38:16,677 --> 00:38:21,267
I was really comforted and had someone to lean on.

353
00:38:22,087 --> 00:38:27,127
It's true... I wavered.

354
00:38:27,967 --> 00:38:31,207
I'm not sure if I was swayed because I'm similar to Yeong Soo

355
00:38:32,027 --> 00:38:35,277
or if I was swayed because of Lee Hae Joon.

356
00:38:36,017 --> 00:38:38,097
I'm really not sure either.

357
00:38:39,257 --> 00:38:43,257
It could be that because of Lee Hae Joon,

358
00:38:43,257 --> 00:38:47,097
I just kept tying to find Yeong Soo.

359
00:38:47,097 --> 00:38:51,507
Later on, when I meet with Yeong Soo,

360
00:38:52,267 --> 00:38:55,427
I will ask him to scold me for wavering.

361
00:38:56,797 --> 00:38:59,197
It can't be like this any longer.

362
00:39:00,117 --> 00:39:05,077
I... love Yeong Soo.

363
00:39:14,387 --> 00:39:18,117
Thank you for saying that.

364
00:39:18,117 --> 00:39:20,027
Are you saying thank you?

365
00:39:20,027 --> 00:39:24,047
Yes. This much is enough for me.

366
00:39:24,047 --> 00:39:26,317
Don't torment yourself.

367
00:39:27,457 --> 00:39:29,777
Your husband will understand.

368
00:39:30,637 --> 00:39:35,787
I'm just a person, like a passing wind, who will not effect Shin Da Hye's life.

369
00:39:35,787 --> 00:39:41,047
If I was able to comfort you for even a moment, I'm satisfied with that.

370
00:39:41,047 --> 00:39:46,187
What should I do? Should I leave right this instant?

371
00:39:46,187 --> 00:39:50,007
If it's hard for you, I can do that.

372
00:39:50,947 --> 00:39:55,497
You said you're leaving soon right?

373
00:39:55,497 --> 00:39:56,377
Yes.

374
00:39:56,377 --> 00:39:58,787
Until then, you can stay.

375
00:40:00,127 --> 00:40:06,507
In exchange, I would like it if we never see each other again after that.

378

Don't worry about that.

382
00:40:39,047 --> 00:40:42,227
 I got a compliment
♬   With you   ♬

383
00:40:47,227 --> 00:40:50,367
Feels good!

384
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:52,287
When did you get here?

385
00:40:52,287 --> 00:40:54,767
Come over here.

386
00:40:54,767 --> 00:40:55,687
Why?

387
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:57,547
Closer.

388
00:41:00,427 --> 00:41:02,727
More closer.

389
00:41:04,687 --> 00:41:07,167
Ah really!

390
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:10,107
Oh, my good looking Brother-In-Law.

391
00:41:10,107 --> 00:41:11,047
What are you doing?!

392
00:41:11,047 --> 00:41:15,087
After thinking about it, it's because you're pretty.

393
00:41:17,787 --> 00:41:22,667
Come here. Why? Should I give you a passionate kiss?

394
00:41:27,787 --> 00:41:30,387
When did I ask for that?!

395
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:42,067
Thank you. For loving my sister so much.

396
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:46,507
No, I should have bowed to  you.

397
00:41:46,507 --> 00:41:50,567
Out of the reasons why we came back, the being who is up above,

398
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:56,967
because He considers us pitiful, must have a reason for us to learn something.

399
00:41:56,967 --> 00:42:02,887
I think that one of those things is you, Kim Yeong Soo.

400
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:06,147
Why are you doing that? So embarassing.

401
00:42:06,147 --> 00:42:11,947
Other than that, I'm not so sure. I feel like there's nothing else.

402
00:42:14,827 --> 00:42:19,387
I guess my Brother-In-Law is lonely.

403
00:42:19,387 --> 00:42:24,267
If, we are born again... No—

404
00:42:24,267 --> 00:42:29,987
If you could turn back time and start over with Yi Yeon, what do you want to do?

405
00:42:31,347 --> 00:42:33,567
What I want to do?

406
00:42:39,607 --> 00:42:44,947
Just like this, holding hands...

407
00:42:44,947 --> 00:42:47,407
And walking together.

408
00:42:58,147 --> 00:43:01,557
Crazy. Now I'm starting to see things.

409
00:43:01,557 --> 00:43:03,507
Hello.

410
00:43:17,967 --> 00:43:21,207
Who told you to appear in front of me?

411
00:43:21,207 --> 00:43:24,467
- What?
- You keep on appearing before my eyes,

412
00:43:24,467 --> 00:43:26,127
I'm saying this because you're getting on my nerves.

413
00:43:26,127 --> 00:43:30,167
Seeing that I got on your nerves, I'm sorry.

414
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:33,007
It's not that you're getting on my nerves...

415
00:43:35,027 --> 00:43:36,507
Hey!

416
00:43:36,507 --> 00:43:40,807
I'll go away. I said I'll disappear from your sight forever!

417
00:43:40,807 --> 00:43:47,367
I will never appear again. Are you satisfied!?

418
00:44:03,327 --> 00:44:05,867
Now and in the past, you haven't changed at all.

419
00:44:05,867 --> 00:44:09,907
Go away? You want me to go away? You can say something like that so easily?

420
00:44:09,907 --> 00:44:13,227
Where do you want me to go away? You want me to go outside of the earth?

421
00:44:13,227 --> 00:44:19,027
Do I have to go away if you tell me to and stay if you want me to stay?!

422
00:44:19,027 --> 00:44:19,807
What?

423
00:44:19,807 --> 00:44:24,607
You're so rude.

424
00:44:24,607 --> 00:44:27,447
I don't want to get out! I won't get out!

425
00:44:27,447 --> 00:44:31,147
Is it all okay if you just think about things and decide by yourself?

426
00:44:31,147 --> 00:44:32,367
Are you really that amazing a person?

427
00:44:32,367 --> 00:44:35,787
- That's...
- Don't say that it's for my sake.

428
00:44:35,787 --> 00:44:39,207
If you do, you'll end up feeling guilty about yourself and

429
00:44:39,207 --> 00:44:43,287
you'll just cry by yourself again. Am I wrong?

430
00:44:43,287 --> 00:44:49,407
It would have been great if Oppa had gotten mad at me like this.

431
00:44:49,407 --> 00:44:56,587
If he'd called me a bad wench. It would have been good if he'd scolded me.

432
00:44:59,807 --> 00:45:02,567
That Han Gi Tak again.

433
00:45:20,847 --> 00:45:26,047
I guess I really did miss Oppa.

434
00:45:26,927 --> 00:45:30,607
I keep feeling vibes of him from you.

435
00:45:30,607 --> 00:45:32,587
Forget about a dead person.

436
00:45:32,587 --> 00:45:36,387
The way you talk about the world, as if you understand...

437
00:45:37,627 --> 00:45:43,647
Ten years ago, that time... Do you think I left without knowing?

438
00:45:43,647 --> 00:45:50,787
I knew that Han Gi Tak called my manager when I left.

439
00:45:52,387 --> 00:45:58,327
I thought that Han Gi Tak would die if he was caught by Cha Jae Gook.

440
00:45:59,947 --> 00:46:06,567
That's why I did what I did. It's just that, to think doing that only benefits me,

441
00:46:06,567 --> 00:46:11,007
I guess it's only an excuse for a pathetic character like me.

442
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:18,747
But then again, it feels refreshing since you cursed me.

443
00:46:22,247 --> 00:46:26,987
 I want to stay by your side, even if it's like this.

444
00:46:26,987 --> 00:46:32,787
I don't want to say this because it tarnishes my pride but

445
00:46:35,107 --> 00:46:38,567
I missed you, Han Hong Nan.

446
00:46:38,567 --> 00:46:44,427

448
00:46:45,787 --> 00:46:47,147
What are you doing? Why aren't you coming?

449
00:46:47,147 --> 00:46:51,107
What are you saying? You told me to go away earlier!

450
00:46:51,107 --> 00:46:55,407
♬  I will hold onto your hand forever   ♬

451

453
00:47:11,747 --> 00:47:13,927
Tada!

454
00:47:16,647 --> 00:47:18,087
How did you...

455
00:47:18,087 --> 00:47:22,207
I always wanted to make this for you brother, but you can receive it in his stead.

456
00:47:22,207 --> 00:47:27,967
It's probably nothing compared to your mother's cooking, but eat a lot.

457
00:47:31,207 --> 00:47:38,087

458
00:47:40,587 --> 00:47:42,307
What? Is it not good?

459
00:47:42,307 --> 00:47:43,907
No...

460
00:47:45,587 --> 00:47:49,207
It's hot. It's because it's hot.

461
00:47:49,207 --> 00:47:53,107
If it's hot, eat the stuff that isn't hot.

462
00:48:05,847 --> 00:48:08,027
Hello? What's the occasion?

463
00:48:08,027 --> 00:48:12,927
 Hong Nan, I was thankful for last time so will you come over to eat?

464
00:48:12,927 --> 00:48:16,127
Sure! Let's eat.

465
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:18,327
I'll come over tomorrow.

466
00:48:18,327 --> 00:48:19,207
Who was it?

467
00:48:19,207 --> 00:48:21,467
Someone I like.

468
00:48:21,467 --> 00:48:22,527
Who?

469
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,647
Aye, I told you.

470
00:48:24,647 --> 00:48:27,767
Go over there tomorrow and eat a lot. Give it back.

471
00:48:30,827 --> 00:48:34,647
 Jeong Ji Hoon! You can't do this! After doing something like this,

472
00:48:34,647 --> 00:48:37,007
 how will you face Da Hye and Han Na?

473
00:48:37,007 --> 00:48:41,147
 How far? How far will you go to become trash?

474
00:48:44,447 --> 00:48:47,247
What did you call me over to the roof for?

475
00:48:47,247 --> 00:48:48,987
What is your reason?

476
00:48:48,987 --> 00:48:55,467
Even after knowing that I made Yeong Soo into a suicide case, why haven't you told Da Hye?

477
00:48:55,467 --> 00:48:57,167
How much do you know?

478
00:48:57,167 --> 00:49:01,387
Could it be that Yeong Soo knew all of this as well?

479
00:49:01,387 --> 00:49:03,967
What's important about that now?

480
00:49:04,887 --> 00:49:07,427
Get your act together and live well.

481
00:49:07,427 --> 00:49:11,147
You can become somebody's hope.

482
00:49:16,127 --> 00:49:18,507
That person, Han Hong Nan...

483
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:23,107
Cha Jae Gook is monitoring her.

484
00:49:23,107 --> 00:49:23,827
Why?

485
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:28,147
In regards to Han Gi Tak's death, Na Seok Cheol and Cha Jae Gook seem to be involved and

486
00:49:28,147 --> 00:49:30,647
there are suspicious points.

487
00:49:30,647 --> 00:49:31,887
Could it be that it's not an accident?

488
00:49:31,887 --> 00:49:35,787
Let's say it's just an assumption. Up to that point is what I know.

489
00:49:42,167 --> 00:49:45,747
 Perhaps, Cha Jae Gook took out Hyung Han?...

490
00:49:50,947 --> 00:49:55,887
It can't be. What exactly happened?

491
00:50:07,107 --> 00:50:10,507
 Are you sure you're the one?

492
00:50:16,287 --> 00:50:20,007
Who put the fortune cookie in my office?

493
00:50:36,857 --> 00:50:38,637
C-Chairman!

494
00:50:47,157 --> 00:50:48,557
Chairman!

495
00:50:48,557 --> 00:50:51,127
Excuse me! Over here—!

496
00:51:05,197 --> 00:51:09,427
Gi Tak's younger sister...

497
00:51:09,427 --> 00:51:10,947
Yes.

498
00:51:12,427 --> 00:51:14,227
But before that, Chairman...

499
00:51:14,227 --> 00:51:19,547
Is Na Seok Cheol really not involved in Gi Tak's accident?

500
00:51:19,547 --> 00:51:23,677
Not long after Gi Tak passed away, you became like this.

501
00:51:23,677 --> 00:51:27,537
Na Seok Cheol found you unconscious at the swimming pool.

502
00:51:27,537 --> 00:51:30,047
He shouldn't have done those things.

503
00:51:30,047 --> 00:51:34,557
If he wanted to take a life, he should have made sure

504
00:51:34,557 --> 00:51:37,407
that the person died.

505
00:51:38,797 --> 00:51:41,567
He didn't do a good job.

506
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:47,217
That's how I survived.

507
00:51:51,967 --> 00:51:55,887
 You're managing the money well, right?

508
00:51:55,887 --> 00:51:57,257
 Pardon?

509
00:51:58,087 --> 00:52:02,307
 Ah yes! Of course, Hyungnim.

510
00:52:02,307 --> 00:52:05,017
 Don't be startled.

511
00:52:05,017 --> 00:52:10,447
 Not even in front of me. I'm not curious about it right now.

512
00:52:10,447 --> 00:52:13,717
 Don't worry. Nobody will be able to find it.

513
00:52:13,717 --> 00:52:15,557
 Is that so?

514
00:52:15,557 --> 00:52:17,187
 Yes.

515
00:52:17,187 --> 00:52:22,747
 Only my younger sibling and I know about this.

516
00:52:24,597 --> 00:52:29,157
Let me meet Gi Tak's younger sibling.

517
00:52:29,157 --> 00:52:32,877
No... Even a phone call...

518
00:52:32,877 --> 00:52:38,527
I have something to tell her

519
00:52:39,367 --> 00:52:41,987
about Gi Tak.

520
00:52:55,577 --> 00:52:57,447
You're here?

521
00:52:57,447 --> 00:53:03,927
I have some items that I entrusted to Gi Tak.

522
00:53:03,927 --> 00:53:06,867
Gi Tak told me they are somewhere that only he knows.

523
00:53:06,867 --> 00:53:12,767
Please find it before Seok Cheol does.

524
00:53:12,767 --> 00:53:17,277
As your Hyungnim,

525
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:20,177
it's my last present that I can give you.

526
00:53:26,637 --> 00:53:28,607
Wait a moment!

527
00:53:29,847 --> 00:53:35,187
He woke up. He needs to get a check-up with his doctor so take him to the examination room please.

528
00:53:35,187 --> 00:53:36,337
We don't need that.

529
00:53:36,337 --> 00:53:41,097
If his heart fails again we won't be able to save him. Will that be okay with you?

530
00:54:03,597 --> 00:54:05,287
Hyungnim.

531
00:54:05,287 --> 00:54:10,047
If you woke up, you should have appeared first before me, your underling

532
00:54:10,047 --> 00:54:12,687
who's been waiting for you in my dreams.

533
00:54:12,687 --> 00:54:17,577
I'm disappointed. Really a lot.

534
00:54:17,577 --> 00:54:21,647
Disappointed? Were you?

535
00:54:21,647 --> 00:54:23,147
Yeah.

536
00:54:42,807 --> 00:54:48,447
Where did you hide it? Just tell me where you hid the secret account.

537
00:54:48,447 --> 00:54:55,117
Where? Where is it? Tell me where it is!

538
00:54:55,587 --> 00:54:57,667
I don't know.

539
00:54:57,667 --> 00:55:03,017
In this world, there's probably no one who knows where the secret account is.

540
00:55:03,017 --> 00:55:08,547
Weren't you the one who made Gi Tak that way?

541
00:55:08,547 --> 00:55:13,157
No! It's not me. It's you, you old fart.

542
00:55:13,157 --> 00:55:18,697
 I'm tired. Hurry up and take it over.

543
00:55:19,237 --> 00:55:24,237
There's one who skimmed off from the organization and there's another who'll end up getting it?

544
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:27,977
The world is so unfair that I can't live. Really!

545
00:55:27,977 --> 00:55:31,977
I'll ask you one last time.

546
00:55:31,977 --> 00:55:34,437
Where did you hide the account?

547
00:55:34,437 --> 00:55:39,727
Jeez, I think I slept just a bit too much.

548
00:55:40,967 --> 00:55:43,927
I don't remember.

549
00:55:45,517 --> 00:55:50,967
Is that so? I guess our Hyungnim slept for too long.

550
00:55:52,107 --> 00:55:53,837
I got it.

551
00:55:57,947 --> 00:56:01,667
You should have told me that you knew, you old fart!

552
00:56:11,707 --> 00:56:13,817
Yes, what about the pretty one?

553
00:56:13,817 --> 00:56:18,167
I heard that Hong Nan and Choi Seung Jae went to the ossuary recently.

554
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:22,227
To the ossuary? I see.

555
00:56:33,767 --> 00:56:35,607
Hyungnim...

556
00:56:43,747 --> 00:56:44,657
 Where are you right now?

557
00:56:44,657 --> 00:56:47,447
What? At the pathetic...

558
00:56:47,447 --> 00:56:49,987
No, I mean Branch Manager Lee's boarding house.

559
00:56:49,987 --> 00:56:52,157
Stay right there.

560
00:56:56,157 --> 00:56:58,147
I'm moved.

561
00:56:58,147 --> 00:57:03,127
Last time you said you wanted to play a role as an in-law.

562
00:57:03,127 --> 00:57:08,077
Like an in-law, I too wanted to cook you a warm meal.

563
00:57:08,687 --> 00:57:12,457
When you first saw me, you called me sister-in-law, and

564
00:57:12,457 --> 00:57:15,667
I was thankful because you treated me so kindly.

565
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:19,587
I am the type that usually walls people off.

566
00:57:19,587 --> 00:57:22,767
Ah so that's what happened.

567
00:57:22,767 --> 00:57:26,557
Oh right! Where is my mind, I put the rice on and forgot about it.

568
00:57:26,557 --> 00:57:28,937
Wait a moment, please wait.

569
00:57:28,937 --> 00:57:31,697
You can take your time!

570
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:55,127
Look at this one.

571
00:57:55,127 --> 00:58:01,017
I guess it's in there. The key to the secret account that the old fart hid.

572
00:58:01,017 --> 00:58:04,177
Hey! Where is my pretty lady right now?

573
00:58:04,177 --> 00:58:07,327
He's at the Branch Manager Lee's boarding house right now.

574
00:58:07,327 --> 00:58:08,977
What do we do, Hyung?

575
00:58:08,977 --> 00:58:15,317
Hide well. It's now time to play hide and seek, pretty one.

576
00:58:15,317 --> 00:58:18,407
Hong Nan, because of the pressure cooker, the time...

577
00:58:29,907 --> 00:58:31,667
Where did she go?

578
00:58:41,667 --> 00:58:44,147
 Are you sure you're the one?

579
00:58:54,117 --> 00:58:56,077
Hong Nan went missing.

580
00:58:56,077 --> 00:58:59,027
- What?
- Because she disappeared so suddenly, I can't get in touch with her.

581
00:58:59,027 --> 00:59:01,137
  No, don't!

582
00:59:03,827 --> 00:59:06,177
What are you doing?

583
00:59:06,177 --> 00:59:07,887
- It's you, isn't it?
- Have you gone mad?

584
00:59:07,887 --> 00:59:09,987
It's you, isn't it Cha Jae Gook!

585
00:59:10,657 --> 00:59:17,917

586
00:59:18,707 --> 00:59:20,497
Hello, pretty one.

587
00:59:20,497 --> 00:59:22,577
Na Seok Cheol...

588
00:59:28,517 --> 00:59:36,617
♬   Have you ever looked into the eyes of someone who has fallen in love  ♬
