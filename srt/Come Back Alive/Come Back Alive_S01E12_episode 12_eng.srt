1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,550

2
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,400
Why aren't you coming in?

3
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,390
Do you remember us talking about my sister?

4
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,750
Because she cried so often when she was young,
I would call her Ugly One.

5
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:52,390
It was because if I called her Ugly One, she looked more adorable when she cried.

6
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,760
Pretty frequently, I made fun of her.
♬   Wherever I am filling me with   ♬

7
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,350
Where my Ugly One could be...
♬   A memory which was lost in space   ♬

8
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,080
♬   The memories of a time...   ♬

9
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,510
I now know.

10
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:13,050
Really? Where is she?
♬   I turned far away from   ♬

11
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:18,630
♬   It might be too late   ♬

12
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:26,650
♬   Maybe in a place that I can’t even go back to   ♬

13
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:34,330
♬   My whole love is alive and breathing.   ♬

14
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,460
Hyung Han...

15
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,990
From now on, call me Hyungnim. 
♬   That you are my everything   ♬

16
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,890
You mean... Da Hye...
♬   will stay within us   ♬

17
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,430
Han Hong Nan.

18
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,010
That's what her real name is.
 ♬   While being conscious of that   ♬

19
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,700
Her real name is Han Hong Nan.
♬   and considering that I will hug you   ♬

20
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,130
♬   On days which will not be   ♬

21
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,490
Although there won't be any reason for us to call her by that name.
♬   special to many people   ♬

22
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,140
This...

23
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,280
What kind of fate is this?

24
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,430
Why we came back here together, 
♬   A breath which always silently covered and hugged me   ♬

25
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,050
I now understand. 
♬   With you   ♬

26
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,910
Why I came back in a woman's body,

27
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,150
now I understand.

28
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,210
Hong Nan! What are you doing outside?

29
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:43,350
♬   It might be too late   ♬

30
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:51,220
♬   Maybe in a place that I can’t even go back to   ♬

31
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,860
Aigoo, Father! We meet again! 
♬   My whole love is alive and breathing.   ♬

32
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,230
Oh... Welcome!

33
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,210
Wow!

34
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,950
♬  With you  ♬

35
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,020
Hong Nan. Try this.

36
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,530
 Hope Orphanage

37
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:30,470
 Your mom passed away so how are you going to raise that young kid by yourself?

38
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:35,950
 If you don't want her to grow up with gangsters, don't be stubborn and let her go.

39
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,370
 Some say if they go an orphanage overseas, they meet good adopted parents with good houses and

40
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,050
 they don't think about coming back to Korea.

41
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,410
Where are we going?

42
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,140
 Why are you starting to cry again?

43
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,160
 If you cry somewhere, I told you you will become the Ugly One, right?

44
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,140
 If someone says that, what do you do?

45
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,700
 One, two!

46
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,240
 That's right.

47
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,830
 You're cool, my kid sister.

48
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,750
 Are we going to see Mom?

49
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,200
 Look there's a car that goes zoom!

50
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,400
 Wow!

51
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,860
 Shall we take a picture with that car?

52
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,160
 Yeah!

53
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,700
 I'm taking it... One, two, three!

54
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,600
 Hong Nan.

55
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,330
Why are you looking at me like that?

56
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,140
Because I missed you.

57
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:53,110
Me too! You should have quickly come in! The meat is almost gone.

58
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,980
That's true...

59
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,800
I came too late.

60
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,240
Mom...

61
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,460
- Should I give you some more? 
 -Yes.

62
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,070
Try this meat. It's just done grilling.

63
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,310
Yes.

64
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,030
I'm really hungry.

65
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,670
Yummy.

66
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,800
Is it delicious? I cooked it.

67
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,230
 Episode 12  
 It's alright. I will do it.

68
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,680
I really wanted to try it once

69
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,030
as an in-law.

70
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,140
Hong Nan, do you have any siblings?

71
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,660
I have an elder brother.

72
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,080
Specifically, an elder brother who liked to call me Ugly One.

73
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:06,030
That's nice. Having an elder brother is reassuring.

74
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:10,730
 Ugly One, your Oppa is right here.

75
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,000
Father, please go in and have some rest.

76
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,160
But... How can we let the guest do the dishes?

77
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,980
It's okay. She wants to be close with Da Hye.

78
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,960
That's good.

79
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,100
Daughter-in-law needs a friend.

80
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:43,930
Da Hye. What were you like when you were young?

81
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,270
Were you happy?

82
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,890
I think I would have been.

83
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:56,410
Actually... I can't remember my childhood.

84
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,530
There was this accident when I was around Han Na's age.

85
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,770
Even though I can't remember much... Dad? Oppa?

86
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:09,470
I think I was looking for and running toward someone. Dad? Oppa?

87
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,550
And I got hit by a soup restaurant car.
♬   I hoped and hoped even more for  ♬

88
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:19,250
That person is like my mom now. 
♬   the time you wouldn't come to me  ♬

89
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,140
On the day I lost my memory, because of insurance coverage,

90
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:26,830
she fooled the hospital staff by telling them that I was her daughter. 
♬  The person who couldn't stay with me.♬

91
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,490
You understand what kind of character she was, right?
♬  The person who couldn't stay with me.♬

92
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,470
Since that day, I grew up delivering soup in the marketplace.

93
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,570
♬  You thought very occasionally of my name too.

94
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,250
That's strange...

95
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:44,730
I never talked about this to Yeong Soo before. 
 ♬  You thought very occasionally of my name too. ♬

96
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,150
It must be because I'm very comfortable around you.

97
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:52,150
♬   Unable to leave  ♬

98
00:07:52,150 --> 00:08:01,120
♬   You also like me are crying.  ♬

99
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:08,670
♬   I, like the star over there  ♬

100
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:16,970
♬   with neither a promise nor a hope ♬

101
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:36,750
Han Na. Can I ask you something?

102
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,010
What is it?

103
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:42,850
When Dad wasn't around, did Mom tell you something?

104
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:46,700
Whether she was very tired, or some sort of secret?

105
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,560
If I tell you, then it wouldn't be a secret anymore.

106
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,640
Oh... That's right.

107
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,930
Everyone in this world has secrets... I have one too.

108
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,430
Oh?

109
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,580
I still have homework to do.

110
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,330
Oh... What kind of homework is it? Do you need my help?

111
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,380
It's alright. I can do it myself.

112
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,100
Okay.

113
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,080
I will be leaving.

114
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,120
Let's have a talk. Can I come over?

115
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,960
I wasn't expecting you to be here so soon.

116
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,910
When you said you could do the thing that Da Hye wanted the most,

117
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,890
was it this?

118
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:59,510
A long time ago I told her I would find her family.

119
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:02,230
I'm still keeping that promise.

120
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,530
Please abandon your intention of using Han Gi Tak.

121
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,310
And leave Da Hye alone.

122
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,490
Kim Yeong Soo...

123
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,700
He called himself her husband.

124
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,950
What have I been doing all this time?

125
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:24,620
How can it be that Kim Yeong Soo didn't know, when even you knew?

126
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,890
It's Da Hye's choice.

127
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:32,200
When we broke up, she threw away the pictures, saying she didn't need them anymore.

128
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,170
Now she only wants to think about Kim Yeong Soo's family.

129
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,050
With such a heavy responsibility,

130
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:48,440
with such a huge open sore... Kim Yeong Soo.

131
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,560
But Hong Nan... Did something happen today?

132
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:10,500
Could you use your fists to hit me?

133
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,240
If you do that, I feel like I would have strength.

134
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,020
Like this?

135
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:24,420
Like this... Ball up your fists tightly and hit my palms.
And count forcefully, one two.

136
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,260
One, two!

137
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,200
That's what my brother taught me.

138
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,760
Wherever you are, never be weak.

139
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:53,780
You made Gi Tak stand in court. Did you already know at the time?

140
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,880
I wanted Da Hye to meet her brother naturally, because

141
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,620
from my position, it was hard for me to tell her.

142
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,280
But Sunbae took Da Hye...

143
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,300
He took her to a funeral and made her work.

144
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,580
The next day, he broke another promise.

145
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:23,880
I was so mad that I went there to tell Da Hye that there was another family member beside Kim Yeong Soo.

146
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,440
At first I couldn't say it, but—

147
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,640
While leaving her alone there,

148
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,180
That day Kim Yeong Soo died.

149
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:35,180
That day, Da Hye was hurt too much.

150
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,020
So...

151
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,640
Are you going to tell her about Han Gi Tak?

152
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:54,660
Her husband and brother are all like this... That's why, I have no intention of telling her.

153
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,240
That's why I think I'm the only one who can protect Da Hye.

154
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,060
Until you showed up.

155
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,940
Jeong Ji Hoon.

156
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,080
Kim Yeong Soo will be very grateful to you

157
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,740
for finding Da Hye's family.

158
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,740
But, please don't tell her.

159
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,640
Let's not make that lady cry again.

160
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,580
It's enough that she's a widower of Kim Yeong Soo.

161
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,800
That's interesting. That woman, Hong Nan, said something different.

162
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,200
I'm really Han Gi Tak's sister.

163
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,360
Please do not tell that person. She's better off not knowing.

164
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,420
No, is it the same?

165
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,980
Anyway, please stop bothering Da Hye

166
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,660
because I'm going to be the one who protects her.

167
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,860
Where did the branch manager go? Did he go somewhere?

168
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,860
It's alright. You will see him again.

169
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:23,640
Um... Can I...

170
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,640
hug you just once?

171
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,960
What's so difficult about that?

172
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:40,350
♬  I waited for you. While I even know everything,  ♬

173
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:46,220
♬   I hope for and desire again ♬

174
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:51,400
♬   the time you won't come to me ♬

175
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:59,980
♬   The person who can't stay with me. ♬

176
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:05,360
♬   who will never be forgotten, a second time ♬

177
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:12,220
♬   You thought very occasionally of my name too ♬

178
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,840
♬   Unable to leave ♬

179
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:26,240
♬   You also like me are cryng. ♬

180
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:35,460
♬  I, like the star over there ♬

181
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:44,650
♬   with neither any promise nor any hope ♬

182
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:54,850
♬   Oh, I... will have loved everything.  ♬

183
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,380
Who told you to die so early?

184
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,380
Look who's talking, you hypocrite!

185
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,560
You dull idiot! Who told you to just work and die?

186
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,700
Is dying at age forty something to be proud of?

187
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,640
If you abandoned a child, you should've at least tried to stay alive.

188
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,180
Who told you to make her an orphan, you gangster-like man!?

189
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,260
What? This jerk!

190
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,060
Really!

191
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,180
What? What? Did I say something wrong?

192
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,460
Whether you were in a gangster's den or in a tiger's den, you should have raised her anyway!

193
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,140
Why did you abandon her? Why? Try explaining yourself. Why did you abandon her?!

194
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,060
This jerk. If you promised to make her happy

195
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,200
you should have kept that promise!

196
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,840
She was a lonely person to begin with, but why did you make her even lonelier?

197
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,880
You are going to die by my hands tonight, understand?

198
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,580
I'm already dead, you cowardly bastard!

199
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,480
Instead try to send me back!

200
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,150
You jerk, you need to...

201
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,380
- This bastard. 
 - It's painful!

202
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,920
You don't think I can't twist you?

203
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,320
- Wait. 
 - Let this go.

204
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,300
Look at this. Look at this bastard.

205
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,720
Let go! Let go of me!

206
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,700
I got it.

207
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,440
Enough.

208
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,380
You thought I'll fall for it twice?

209
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,880
Let me go.

210
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,920
You need a beating. You think I won't hit you?

211
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,900
I'm going to kill you.

212
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,940
Okay, why don't you get hit.

213
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,860
What are you doing right now?

214
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:33,040

215
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:46,780
♬  When I look at your eyes I always feel anxious   ♬

216
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,340
♬  I'm right next to you but I feel lonely   ♬

217
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:53,240
You left all the work to me, and went off on your own. Where did you go?

218
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,720
♬  You are the only one in my heart so   ♬

219
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,560
Did you fight with someone?

220
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:06,760
♬  Please don't turn away anymore 
pretending you don't know me   ♬
Your face...

221
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:13,080
♬  I love you. You also know how I feel.   ♬

222
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,760
You didn't even drink and were totally sober, but fell?

223
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,940
I tripped because my legs are too long.

224
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,140
Yeah right.

225
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:28,020
The person hurting the most right now is you.

226
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,380
I am just troubling you again.

227
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,500
It's done.

228
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,300
Please, put some more on.

229
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,200
It hurts a lot right now.
♬  Every day it's all you, only you   ♬

230
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,660
♬  Please remember that I can't be without you   ♬

231
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,780
♬  Even if a year goes by, even if ten years more pass   ♬

232
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:04,140
Please don't tell Yi Yeon anything.

233
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,240
I just argued a bit.

234
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,140
But... How did you know to go there?

235
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,540
You thought I'd stay out again and followed me, huh?

236
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:23,540
 You are lying about being Han Gi Tak's sister, aren't you, Hong Nan?

237
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,380
I will believe you for now.

238
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:29,440
Believe me, I won't stay out all night.

239
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,480
Song Yi Yeon...

240
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,440
That guy ripped the pictures really neatly.

241
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:08,200
What do we do? This is your brother's last picture.

242
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,400
Cha Jae Gook did this?

243
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:15,530
Yes. It's not like I left home few days ago, so it would be stranger if he didn't know I was here.

244
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:21,410
As long as he doesn't find out you're Git Tak's sister...

245
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:29,660

246
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:37,530
It worried you a lot, right? This is okay.

247
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:44,580
He said he was never going to let me go.

248
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,780
I don't even know where the end is.

249
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,200
 One, two.

250
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,050
 - One, two. 
 - That's it!

251
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,550
Hello.

252
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:42,950
 Dearest, for how long have you been alone having many scary dreams?

253
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,850
 Today, your brother too went through a scary incident.

254
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:52,760
 If you don't remember then there is nothing scarier than that.

255
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:59,030
 In your memories, just leave a small space for me and

256
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:04,190
 fill the rest with happy and pretty memories

257
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,220
 Okay, Da Hye?

258
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:13,760
♬   I love you. I love you. ♬

259
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,880
♬   Don't go, Don't leave  ♬

260
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,990
♬   On a day without you  ♬

261
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,850
What are you doing?
 ♬   It always seems  ♬

262
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,840
I couldn't sleep.
 ♬   always that I just cry. ♬

263
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:32,380
♬  It hurts too much, like you're going to cry  ♬

264
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,540
Are you think about your brother? 
 ♬ Really.  ♬

265
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,950
♬   When I close my eyes again,   ♬

266
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:40,990
I like these photos so much.

267
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:45,020
The things that I didn't personally see...

268
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,640
But I can feel the days that he must have lived.

269
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,040
In that moment he probably thought it was his best.

270
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,570
If you look back at it,

271
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:58,310
it was a crappy life.

272
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,050
Doing something for someone

273
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:08,140
can become the thing that hurts them the most.

274
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:14,720
He didn't know that then.

275
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,330
Did something happen to you today?

276
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,630
No, I just got drunk.

277
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:26,450
♬   I love you. 
 Don't leave.  ♬

278
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:29,890
Sorry for drinking alone. 
 ♬   Don't leave.   ♬

279
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,280
Let it go, just for today,  ♬   On a day without you  ♬

280
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,570
♬   It always seems that I just cry.   ♬

281
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:44,950
♬   It hurts so much I feel I'm going to cry. Really.   ♬

282
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:48,660
♬   If I close my eyes  ♬

283
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:54,310
♬   If I close my eyes again  ♬

284
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:59,250
♬  You appear. ♬

285
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,630
 Knowing a little bit more about you makes me happy.

286
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:59,630
Hey Brother-in-law, are the places where you got beat up okay?

287
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,490
I wonder if weakling Brother-in-law is okay as well.

288
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:04,460
Try calling me hyungnim.

289
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:08,810
- Hyungnim? 
 - That's right

290
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:12,030
How pretty was my younger sister today?

291
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:15,300
The flowers at the store are so shameful they all wilted.

292
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:19,970
Those flowers won't come alive again because my family heritage is glamorous.

293
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:23,840
No, but I didn't know her name was really Hong Nan.

294
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,290
What were you thinking?

295
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,620
If she's alive somewhere,

296
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,590
if we could meet again,

297
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:36,370
when someone says that name,

298
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:40,140
for her to turn around.

299
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,110
Hong Nan. Han Hong Nan.

300
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:55,000
She looked. She looked. She looked.

301
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,710
I call you when I'm done with my appointments.

302
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,850
Let's go. Byong!

303
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,390
You scared me!

304
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:09,170
Oh, Manager Ma, it's been awhile.

305
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,260
It seems you missed me.

306
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:16,660
It was boring, as if I wanted to chew on something but had nothing to chew on.

307
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,160
I'd really like to thank you for giving me time off.

308
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:28,180
Thanks to you, I was able to have a great time with my family in the Philippines.

309
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,770
This was the first time since I started working here.

310
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:35,600
That's good. Submit the receipts for reimbursement.

311
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,850
The company will also cover the family expense.

312
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:40,000
Are you serious?

313
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,340
i'm not someone to speak nonsense.

314
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,350
Wait a minute.

315
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,760
What are you doing right now?

316
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:53,450
I'm looking for some wings, because I think you are an angel.

317
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:57,260
No, but something similar.

318
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,350
A man touching my heart, this is the first time.

319
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:12,780
Even the heavens are congratulating Actor Song's main leading role.

320
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,580
The weather is killer good.

321
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:20,300
I knew this day would come, one way or another.

322
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,500
But, why aren't there any people? Did we come too early?

323
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,320
I will look into it

324
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,830
What? Why did it get canceled? Why?

325
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:50,580
I don't know. Just that it was cancelled by the higher-ups.

326
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:19,010
Wow, our actress Song is so pretty today.

327
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:21,910
But what do we do? It's such a waste.

328
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:27,390
It was him, huh? How could that person still not change?

329
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:30,000
Yesterday, he caused all that mess at the house.

330
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,630
What? That wasn't enough to relieve his anger?

331
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:36,510
Ehh, is that something to get over so quickly?

332
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:40,910
At Han Gi Tak's house, where Han Gi Tak's sister lives.

333
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,050
Leave that child alone.

334
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:44,530
That depends on how Song Yi Yeon does.

335
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,870
Song Yi Yeon, your rudeness

336
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:50,230
pierced the sky and flew above the clouds.

337
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:53,110
You went overboard.

338
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:56,440
Not only here. Three other places broke off their contracts.

339
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,760
I can't pay the contracted money.

340
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,350
So, Actress Song obviously needs to pay, right?

341
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:09,540
Hey, for how long do you think your popularity will rise?

342
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:14,740
For a person who understands that there's someone controlling it.

343
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,090
Why did you have to go overboard?

344
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,350
Go to Cha Jae Gook

345
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:22,510
and wag your tail.

346
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:34,390
I said to watch your mouth. Otherwise you'll really get bit.

347
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:37,860
Aigoo, look who's acting again.

348
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,900
Song Yi Yeon!!

349
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,530
Hey, Pretty Lady.

350
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,530
I shouldn't have joined you.

351
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:56,550
Gosh, this tender-hearted punk.

352
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:00,180
You see, I'm impatient. When the pretty one comes out,

353
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:04,340
tell her to hurry and bring the money. This is my last warning.

354
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,850

355
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:25,070
Song Yi Yeon!

356
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:29,890
♬  We aren't lovers  ♬

357
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:35,760
♬  Now we are strangers   ♬

358
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:41,710
♬   I can't believe it  ♬

359
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:44,770
 Oppa!

360
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:50,100
♬  This is farewell  ♬

361
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:58,210
♬   I really liked you  ♬

362
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:05,170
♬  I really loved you   ♬

363
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:11,360
♬  I was a fool who only had a lot of greed   ♬

364
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,220
♬  Like this   ♬

365
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:17,580
Song Yi Yeon! Get it together!
♬   We say farewell  ♬

366
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,990
Song Yi Yeon!

367
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:26,000
♬  At least once   ♬

368
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:33,060
♬   I haven't regretted loving you  ♬

369
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:39,990
♬  Once again, just once   ♬

370
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:49,260
♬  If I had the chance, I would make sure our relationship never ended  ♬

371
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:54,330
♬  More and more  ♬

372
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:57,140
♬  If I can see you again   ♬

373
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:01,480
♬  If I can protect you   ♬

374
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:08,280
♬  No matter what  ♬

375
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,880
♬  Come back to me   ♬

376
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:18,730
♬   To the spot that's been left vacant for you  ♬

377
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:28,980
♬  I will wait for your heart  ♬

378
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,830
It seems there's no movement from Song Yi Yeon's side.

379
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:37,060
It's only normal, for her crazy manager to run over here.

380
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:41,240
I believe her name was Han Hong Nan? How did your meeting with that woman go?

381
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,360
Besides the fact that she was a close friend to Branch Manager Lee Hae Joon, there was no other information.

382
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,330
So, there's no other information.

383
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:51,230
Is there any information that you found recently?

384
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:54,480
Isn't Shin Da Hye's agreement also a bit late?

385
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,770
I apologize.

386
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:59,740
There aren't too many people in the world that I want to be good to.

387
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,990
Don't disappoint me.

388
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,890
At the scene, Song Yi Yeon fell into the water and

389
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,850
her female manager saved her.

390
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:16,830
Han Gi Tak's

391
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,400
little sister...

392
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:27,430
Song Yi Yeon, your hard shell must have finally come.

393
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:31,390
You're not even crying about this. You're nice.

394
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:41,010
I'll do it.

395
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,190
Earlier in the water, I saw Han Gi Tak.

396
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,360
I guess I almost died.

397
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,280
But then,

398
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,080
even seeing him like that was nice.

399
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:13,900
That bastard Han Gi Tak! Because of him, you go through all of this!

400
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,370
Aren't you even tired of it?

401
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:18,230
What is Han Gi Tak?

402
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:22,080
Do you know why that bastard abandoned me?

403
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,990
Because he couldn't raise me in the gangster world.

404
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:27,180
Even if I died, he wouldn't look for me.

405
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:30,880
Even if I died, he wouldn't look for me. He threw me away.

406
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,570
Like that he is a bad, cowardly bastard.

407
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,290
Hong Nan...

408
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:39,490
You said that you ruined his life right?

409
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:42,160
Don't fool yourself.

410
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:47,520
Ten years ago he's the one that caught you and gave you to Cha Jae Gook.

411
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,660
Han Gi Tak called your manager!

412
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:53,780
So, I say forget that cowardly bastard.

413
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:58,050
What needs to be done for closure? Just what do I have to do

414
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:03,550
for this sick and tiring behavior to end?

415
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:33,090
 Mom... I found the Ugly One.

416
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,600
 But I...

417
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:40,410
 I came back as her and ruined everything.

418
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:45,240
 Mom...

419
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,690
 I'm sorry.

420
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:03,300
 I'll do it.  Let's do it, the modeling contract.

421
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,500
Really?!

422
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:10,290
Hey, Song Yi Yeon said she'll sign the contract. High five!

423
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:22,080
You made the right decision.

424
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,870
Sunjin Mall's model Song Yi Yeon, I sincerely welcome you.

425
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,180
My one condition will be immediately acknowledged right?

426
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:44,240
Yes, we will pay the canceled contract fees as your contract payment.

427
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,570
Is Na Seok Cheol finally getting fired?

428
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:54,330
Until you find a place to stay, we have decided to look into it.

429
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:59,850
Please perform my last condition now.

430
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,140
Han Hong Nan.

431
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,720
You are being fired as her manager.

432
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:20,640
It wouldn't be bad to get Yeong Chan's Mom to reconcile.

433
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,160
Yes.

434
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,260
But it is clear that it's becoming an issue at the company.

435
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,390
Anyway, pathetic idiot.

436
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:31,300
Even if I spoon feed it to him, he can't receive it.

437
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,970
Exactly what has Jae Gook been doing all this time?

438
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:37,640
It's just that the two people's methods were a bit different.

439
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,960
- Have a look.
- Our department store is a place that sells...

440
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:46,400
With the overwhelming popular video of the rich fighting, it seems Lee Hae Joon's care and love for the employees

441
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:52,820
matches well with the brand image that Song Yi Yeon is bringing into the company.

442
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,410
 We don't need it.

443
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:58,590
Was Hae Joon always that kind of person?

444
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:03,010
He is quite different from the way he has acted up to now.

445
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,220
Why? Did you come to see my expression?

446
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:15,450
I certainly gave you a chance.

447
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:19,550
Don't think it's over like this?

448
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,770
You said you wouldn't let me go until the end.

449
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:26,470
If your goal really was to torment me,

450
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,760
okay.

451
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:32,500
You used the best way to do it.

452
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,470
Na Seok Cheol.

453
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:42,440
You tied that bastard to me.

454
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:47,070
Do you know why I can't forget Han Gi Tak?

455
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:54,940
He saved me from that terrible bastard,

456
00:39:54,940 --> 00:40:01,210
although his life was ruined thanks to that.

457
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:24,850
What are you doing?

458
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:28,280
I said let's talk, but what's with the hostile response?

459
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,430
- Yes. 
 - For a little while my friend will be staying with us.

460
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:34,010
You know Han Hong Nan, the family-like friend.

461
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:36,300
She got fired as a manager, so she has no where to go.

462
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,820
Omo. How?

463
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:41,490
So, I ask of this favor, Ajumma.

464
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,550
Yes, okay.

465
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,270
Here.

466
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,070
What's this?

467
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,080
Someone keeps putting them in my office.

468
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:55,130
Dang, this popularity of mine.

469
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:58,210
It's so burdensome, I can't live.

470
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:00,990
But, why are you giving them to me?

471
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:04,450
Ajumma, only you eat it.

472
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:06,780
It's fun to break this into two.

473
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,600
Love messages are inside as well.

474
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:14,000
I don't really care for it.

475
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,300
 Yes, you do care.

476
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:33,970
♬  The things you have  ♬

477
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:35,960
 It's different from what we planned. I'll wait for your call.

478
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,530
Waiting for my call?

479
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:39,150
♬  It melts me,   ♬

480
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:41,130
Oh, you scared me?
♬  and things I'm unsure about  ♬

481
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:43,130
What does it say?
♬  I smile all day because of you  ♬

482
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:50,960
♬  For you and for me   ♬

483
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,320
♬  I will protect you forever.  ♬

484
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,450
Is it not a love letter?
♬  I will protect you forever.   ♬

485
00:41:55,450 --> 00:42:00,950
♬  No matter how much time passes. No matter what happens   ♬

486
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:06,750
♬  I won't lose you   ♬

487
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:15,270
Hello!

488
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:20,150
My name is... My name is Thief.

489
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:22,370
That isn't funny.

490
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:25,110
Then I'm stealing you.

491
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,250
It's not funny.

492
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:38,030
- Han Na. 
 - Yes?

493
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,860
Ahjussi will let you in on a secret.

494
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,350
Secret?

495
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:46,220
In return you must tell me why you're so sad.

496
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:52,500
I want to play with you, but I don't have much time left.

497
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:56,340
Ahjussi, are you going somewhere?

498
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,950
You tell me first.

499
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,980
What's the secret?

500
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:07,100
Umm.. That is... So...

501
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,420
I really, really love our Han Na!

502
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:13,410
What was that?

503
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:30,130
Hello.

504
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:31,160
Hi Han Na.

505
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,360
- Father, you came? 
 - Yes.

506
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,570
Why are you here

507
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,810
at someone else's house, without notice?

508
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:40,820
Because we have that type of relationship.

509
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,110
I do.

510
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:45,560
 That's right. Step on my own feet again.

511
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:00,820
Jeong Ji Hoon, why are you here?

512
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,830
Do I need to tell you?

513
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:04,910
By chance, Da Hye's family.

514
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,470
You didn't come to tell them about it.

515
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:09,300
That's up to Da Hye and me.

516
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,230
What should I do since we don't have adequate things to serve you?

517
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:13,450
Oh, Father. Give it here.

518
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:15,250
Give it to me, Father.

519
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:24,720
He should have brought his own thing to eat when he just showed up out of the blue.

520
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:30,120
Father, we are family, right?

521
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:36,300
Han Na, did something bad happen at school?

522
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,720
No.

523
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,240
Don't act like you know.

524
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,960
- Han Na, is it because you're hungry? Let's go out and eat something good.
 - I'm not hungry.

525
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,340
Don't act like you know.

526
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,510
Han Na, it's because you're bored? Let's go play.

527
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:50,720
No, no it's not.

528
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,440
You want to play at home, right?

529
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,800
No, no.

530
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,830
Ah, was the EXO concert fun?

531
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:58,810
Those tickets were very hard to get.

532
00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:01,550
Do you even know how many EXO members there are?

533
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,590
Did you think I wouldn't?

534
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:08,210
How many members are there?

535
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:23,690
♬  You make my heart tremble, from today, the two of us   ♬

536
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:28,070
♬  While I dream, I pray, from today, the two of us  ♬

537
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:33,150
♬  With the sunset wind
 I'll send my heart to you  ♬

538
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:37,070
♬  So that my heart that longs for you will be closer to you  ♬

539
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:41,850
♬  Me gustas tú, me gustas tú tú tú tú
I like you   ♬

540
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:46,950
♬  su tu tu ru I like you  ♬

541
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:51,480
♬  We are a step behind each other   ♬

542
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,480
♬  How much longer will it remain so   ♬

543
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:00,950
♬  We can't even talk because we're shy   ♬

544
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:05,020
Hey, Song Yi Yeon. Did you think I had nowhere to go without you?

545
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:07,220
I have a family too.

546
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:10,830
I'm never ever lonely.

547
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:27,920
Hey, the cook with no sense of taste, Jae Gil,

548
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,580
let's have a family meeting.

549
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:36,450
♬   I'll send my heart to you  ♬

550
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:40,500
♬  So that my heart that longs for you will be closer to you   ♬

551
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:45,230
♬  Me gustas tú, me gustas tú tú tú tú
I like you   ♬

552
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:50,250
♬  Me gustas tú, I like you   ♬

553
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:51,950
Mom.
♬   One step in front of you, with my two hands  ♬

554
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:54,520
♬  One step in front of you, with my two hands   ♬

555
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,700
♬  I promise not to let you go  ♬

556
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,910
You came?

557
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:00,270
Father, I'm home.

558
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:01,960
Oh, okay

559
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:05,750
♬  From now on, please valorize them  ♬

560
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:06,950
Da Hye.

561
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:11,080
Han Na, I'm going to wash up. Stay with Grandpa.

562
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,640
♬   Sadly, only time is passing  ♬

563
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,170
♬  Now I'll gather the courage to confess   ♬

564
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:27,010

565
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,460
Sunbae.

566
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:39,580
Ahjussi, what are you doing here?

567
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,520
Oh, Han Na.

568
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:56,500
Yeah, thank you.

569
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:07,660
But, what was that you left earlier?

570
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:09,920
Something your mom lost a while ago.

571
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,440
But, why do you have it?

572
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:16,640
Because I thought your mom could find it.

573
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,910
 Why is Lee Hae Joon okay, but not me?

574
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:23,010
 I don't want to hear this

575
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:28,550
 Da Hye, Is it because we were together the day Sunbae died?

576
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:31,050
Ahjussi, do you like my mom?

577
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:32,500
Yeah.

578
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,690
I do like her.

579
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:40,100
I like your mom and dad,

580
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,830
and I like you too.

581
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:06,060
Do you get itchy when you have bananas too?

582
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,400
Huh?

583
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,760
It's not, right?

584
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,520
I don't resemble my dad.

585
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,790
I don't like resembling you.

586
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:17,850
What are you talking about?

587
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:21,510
My dad being smart like you, I hate

588
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:25,140
I hate that like I'm very competitive like you.

589
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:29,600
I hate that my dad liked you too.

590
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:45,500
By the way, is your studying going well?

591
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,830
Nowadays, because we're busy...

592
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,800
But our sister, how do you know that?

593
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:55,760
Did you give up on studying because Han Gi Tak is gone?

594
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,150
No, it's not like that.

595
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:03,820
Okay, I'm sorry.

596
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:09,120
What he said about studying for the GED and going to college, he wasn't just saying it.

597
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:12,020
He did say not to worry about tuition but

598
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:14,130
he died.

599
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:15,140
Is that Hyungnim's fault?

600
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:16,960
It's not like that.

601
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,050
Na Seok Cheol, that bastard.

602
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:22,340
That's right. He's the bastard who should be chewed on.

603
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:24,310
What do we do?

604
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:26,700
Should we ambush them and get the pub back?

605
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:30,080
Hey, you punks. First, cleanse yourselves in hot water and

606
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:33,260
start getting rid of that gangster mentality. Got it?

607
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:34,950
How many times do I have to say this?

608
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:38,800
Legally and fairly.

609
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:44,350
We will surely get the pub back fairly. Got it?

610
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,880
Yes, Hyungnim...

611
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:48,630
Noonim.

612
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:51,070
Also...

613
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:55,080
Let's go visit our big hyungnim too.

614
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,590
You're here?

615
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,680
Yes.

616
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:16,700
Go away.

617
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:18,880
Your old personality is starting to come out.

618
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,660
What?

619
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:23,370
The cold personality before Hong Nan came.

620
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:32,260
What about you? You changed the most.

621
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:35,430
Uhh, no I'm not.

622
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:40,790
Are you really not going to see her anymore?

623
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,910
Hong Nan

624
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:47,460
becoming like Gi Tak.

625
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:52,350
I really don't like it.

626
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,590
 If your true purpose was to torment me then,

627
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:12,140
 okay.

628
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,930
 You used the most effective way,

629
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,080
 Na Seok Cheol.

630
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:27,460
Aigoo.

631
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:32,380
I was wondering if I would get the chance to see your office before I died.

632
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:36,280
I'm so honored.

633
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:43,910
But, why at this time of night...

634
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,770
Sit.

635
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:06,160
When I first met you, you were so capable.

636
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,130
You are too kind.

637
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:13,330
Who Song Yi Yeon visited ten years ago, and

638
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:18,550
who she'd run to when the scandal got out...

639
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:21,240
Like a fortune teller, you were getting it so correctly.

640
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:26,790
Ah... It's because my senses in that area evolved.

641
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:30,040
That's why I'm able to make a living.

642
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:33,050
But

643
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,980
who gave you this scar?

644
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,720
This?

645
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,800
Well, why do you want to hear this crazy story?

646
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,160
Crazy story? Even so, I'm curious.

647
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:53,650
Why? Is it hard to say, because you twisted Song Yi Yeon and Han Gi Tak together?

648
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,210
President, that's...

649
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:58,490
How dare you?

650
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:06,250
A person like you dares to fool me?

651
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:10,000
It's a misunderstanding. Please spare me.

652
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:15,550
You toyed with my girl?

653
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:18,320
You toyed with Cha Jae Gook's woman?

654
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,800
No! You can't do this.

655
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:30,770
I'm sure if I killed a dog like you and put you on the street, no one would notice.

656
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:32,550
Please.

657
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:37,570
Should I give it a try?

658
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:43,060
No!!

659
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:05,350
I told you, you shouldn't eat bananas.

660
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:08,260
You should've been more careful.

661
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:09,680
Mom.

662
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,280
Yeah?

663
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,270
Grandfather, Dad and you,

664
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:19,040
none of you have this allergy, but why do I?

665
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:27,810
When Dad ate carrots, he used to shake.

666
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:30,980
What was that?

667
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:45,000
Tomorrow, I'll call your teacher. Let's rest for a day.

668
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,010
I will come home early from work too.

669
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,050
Sleep well.

670
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:44,450
I miss you, Dad.

671
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:47,200
I will go to see Dad.

672
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:08,410
 My love Han Na

673
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:17,030
 Because the customer is not answering...

674
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:28,800
Father, where are you?

675
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:32,000
What about Han Na? Are you with Han Na?

676
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,940
 No, I'm at the retirement home.

677
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:37,680
Why? What's wrong?

678
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:41,010
No, I will call you later.

679
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:51,420
 This call cannot be connected.

680
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:57,720
Han Na, please pick up the phone.

681
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:01,870
Hello.

682
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:04,830
Ahjumma, how's Han Na?

683
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:07,440
 I heard Jaecheureum porridge is good for that kind of allergy.

684
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,870
 So tonight...

685
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:13,760
Hello? Are you listening?

686
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,870
 Are you listening to what I'm saying?

687
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,740
What's wrong?

688
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:22,360
Han Na.

689
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:26,900
She's gone and is not answering her phone.

690
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:30,490
What? Where are you?

691
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:32,130
Home.

692
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:37,130
Home, but she left a note and disappeared.

693
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:41,230
Don't move and stay there. I'll be there soon.

694
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:48,170
Han Na.

695
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,110
Why is this here?

696
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:13,020
 Mom.

697
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:15,900
 Yeah?

698
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:19,770
 Grandfather, dad and you,

699
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:23,670
 none of you have this allergy, but why do I?

700
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:33,610
What did you talk about with Han Na yesterday?

701
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:34,970
Da Hye, What is...

702
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:37,470
What exactly did you say to her!?

703
00:59:37,470 --> 00:59:39,630
Did something happen to Han Na?

704
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:50,870
Han Na, Where are you? Dad's coming.

705
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:56,670
  Epilogue
I'm so happy!

706
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:02,500
  Wait. 
 - What's the matter?

707
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,900
 I don't think I should do this.

708
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:07,510
 Damn, you're trying to eat it all by your self.

709
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:09,100
 Give it to me.

710
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:11,090
 I still have one container left.

711
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:14,970
 I waited ten years to see Man Book so tell him to wait a bit longer.

712
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:16,600
 Dad's gonna fly right over there.

713
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:20,230
 I love you. It's English for "I love you."

714
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:23,860
 My Man Bok. I have to go to her.

715
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:24,840
 No!

716
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:25,740
  Man Bok!

717
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:27,190
  No!

718
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:40,100
