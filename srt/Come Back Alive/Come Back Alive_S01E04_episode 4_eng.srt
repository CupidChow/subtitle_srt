1
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:35,637
 Help me, President. My dad didn't commit suicide.

2
00:00:35,637 --> 00:00:40,987
 Something's wrong. My dad would never do such a thing! Help me!

3
00:00:40,987 --> 00:00:42,907
 - Let go of this.
- Please help me.

4
00:00:42,907 --> 00:00:46,027
 Han Na, you can't do this.

5
00:00:47,227 --> 00:00:48,747
 I'm sorry, President.

6
00:00:48,747 --> 00:00:50,167
 What the heck is this?

7
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:53,047
 She's the daughter of the late Kim Yeong Soo.

8
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:58,627
 This is proof. This is a gift he was going give to my mom.

9
00:00:58,627 --> 00:01:04,627
 So, he wouldn't have committed suicide.

10
00:01:04,627 --> 00:01:09,597
 Huh? Help me, President. Help me!

11
00:01:58,107 --> 00:02:08,027

12
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:17,127
Yes?

13
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:24,367
It's you, huh? 3 7 4 7.

14
00:02:32,407 --> 00:02:38,527
He is the President of Sunjin Department Store as you already know.

15
00:03:02,817 --> 00:03:05,147
Are you okay?

16
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:12,307
If you're okay, get up. Your dad said when you fall, you should get up on your own.

17
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:19,687
You said your dad told you so.

18
00:03:25,027 --> 00:03:27,157
Are you okay?

19
00:03:55,637 --> 00:04:01,437
On that morning, to lessen Mom's anger, he even learned three sets of how to act cutesy.

20
00:04:01,437 --> 00:04:05,737
A few days earlier, he even prepared an event to give her the necklace.

21
00:04:06,477 --> 00:04:10,277
So that's why it doesn't make sense that my dad committed suicide.

22
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:14,887
  I see you are the only one who understands how I feel.

23
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:19,577
Dad couldn't die because spending that money would have been wasteful.

24
00:04:25,627 --> 00:04:30,327
But with the adults, there might be a circumstance that you might not know about.

25
00:04:30,327 --> 00:04:36,887
That would never happen. Even if Dad was a cheapskate, he could never do bad things

26
00:04:36,887 --> 00:04:39,187
because he was chicken-hearted.

27
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:47,447
Even if the things were very difficult, he wouldn't have died and leave me like this.

28
00:04:47,447 --> 00:04:52,307
 That's right, my baby. How could I leave you like that?

29
00:04:53,567 --> 00:04:56,827
You were told that it was a heart attack. When did you find out?

30
00:04:56,827 --> 00:05:02,507
Am I a dummy? It's just because I pretended I don't know.

31
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:11,907
This... When Dad— I mean can Ahjussi keep it and give this to your mom?

32
00:05:11,907 --> 00:05:14,947
If I were to give it to her now, she might be too sad.

33
00:05:18,307 --> 00:05:22,867
Why? Is it because you want to knock off some of the debt?

34
00:05:23,707 --> 00:05:27,347
I don't know who she takes after but...really.

35
00:05:29,407 --> 00:05:32,547
Are you really a high-up person?

36
00:05:32,547 --> 00:05:35,947
Yeah, that's right. I am the highest ranking person in this place.

37
00:05:38,107 --> 00:05:39,727
That's why you are in the business of loan sharking.

38
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:43,807
No, I said I'm not a loan shark.

39
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:47,407
Did you ever see such a handsome loan shark before?

40
00:05:47,407 --> 00:05:51,907
My Dad said people look what they are worth.

41
00:05:58,747 --> 00:06:02,367
I'm sorry. Why are you here? What about school?

42
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:06,507
Mom, this is not the problem right now.

43
00:06:06,507 --> 00:06:10,247
What's the problem, then? Why are you here? What are you doing here?

44
00:06:10,247 --> 00:06:12,887
Why are you hitting a child?

45
00:06:12,887 --> 00:06:16,467
Mom, I'm sorry.

46
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:24,367
What are you sorry for?

47
00:06:26,807 --> 00:06:29,127
Mom...

48
00:06:36,107 --> 00:06:39,067
No, I'm the one who is sorry.

49
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:48,287
♬   Wherever I am filling me with a memory which was lost in space   ♬

50
00:06:48,287 --> 00:06:59,227
♬   The memories of a time I turned far away from   ♬

51
00:06:59,227 --> 00:07:04,557
♬   Whether it was a matter of something which was forgotten.  ♬

52
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:09,437
♬   or whether it was matter of going toward somewhere   ♬

00:07:09,437 --> 00:07:20,097
♬   I’m spending a day once again among the days I dreamed of.   ♬

57
00:07:34,227 --> 00:07:38,227
Oppa, you're awesome! I knew my assumption was correct.
♬   My whole love is alive and breathing.   ♬

58
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:45,957
I'm sure that Son Yi Yeon's scandal was made up by Cha Jae Gook. 
♬   That you are my everything   ♬

59
00:07:45,987 --> 00:07:49,597
Anyway, you became a branch manager overnight.

60
00:07:49,657 --> 00:07:54,657
I made a good choice picking you to have my back.
♬   will stay within us   ♬

61
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:55,707
It was here,

62
00:07:55,707 --> 00:08:00,967
where I breathed my last breath.
♬   While being conscious of that and considering that I will hug you   ♬

63
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:15,167
It must have hurt.

64
00:08:23,427 --> 00:08:25,127
♬   With you.   ♬

65
00:08:25,127 --> 00:08:30,507
Truthfully, I don't remember if it hurt or not,

66
00:08:30,507 --> 00:08:35,207
if I was sad or not, or if I was scared or not.

67
00:08:36,027 --> 00:08:42,687
You're hurt, you're sad and you're also scared. Just like me.

68
00:08:43,507 --> 00:08:48,987
I feel that way right now. My daughter...

69
00:08:52,247 --> 00:08:54,507
That I might make her cry again,

70
00:08:56,087 --> 00:09:00,567
it hurts and I'm sad.

71
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,147
I'm scared.

72
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:10,287
She's pretty because she resembles her mom.

73
00:09:11,387 --> 00:09:16,347
I am definitely going to find out, so

74
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:23,027
I won't make these two girls cry ever again. I have to.

75
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:27,207
Both you and I have a long way to go.

76
00:09:28,607 --> 00:09:36,327
Anyway, was the world that we lived in this lovely?
♬   At the end of the world which is dying   ♬

77
00:09:36,357 --> 00:09:48,357
♬   “We” is the name which was always kept next to me.   ♬

78
00:09:48,457 --> 00:09:53,887

00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:14,747

82
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,967
♬   With you.   ♬

83
00:11:06,387 --> 00:11:09,207
Who are you?

84
00:11:12,267 --> 00:11:16,527
Father-in-law, he's the one who came by yesterday.

85
00:11:16,527 --> 00:11:19,067
Someone came by yesterday?

86
00:11:20,627 --> 00:11:23,287
That's right.

87
00:11:24,107 --> 00:11:29,387
Yesterday seems like today and vice versa.

88
00:11:31,947 --> 00:11:35,767
Before you go... Eat two bowls of rice before you go, debt collector.

89
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:55,367
Han Na's Mom, do you also think that way?

90
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:57,367
That he committed suicide?

91
00:11:59,207 --> 00:12:02,527
Do you really believe it?

92
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:03,847
They said the situation was like that...

93
00:12:03,847 --> 00:12:07,247
Do you want to believe it was a suicide or are you believing that it was suicide?

94
00:12:12,047 --> 00:12:14,847
What's the use of believing it or not?

95
00:12:15,607 --> 00:12:18,347
A dead person can't talk.

96
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,407
A dead person doesn't talk.

97
00:12:37,227 --> 00:12:40,227
Those are the funniest words I've heard.

98
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,187
You grew up a lot.

99
00:12:57,187 --> 00:13:00,627
blocking your hyung's way.

100
00:13:03,287 --> 00:13:07,207
I have nowhere to sleep. I'll stay in your room, not in Song Yi Yeon's.

101
00:13:07,207 --> 00:13:09,547
Won't you let me in?

102
00:13:13,247 --> 00:13:17,947
Cut the crap. Go back while I'm still nice, before it becomes nasty.

103
00:13:17,947 --> 00:13:21,127
"Go back," in the old days, was equivalent to saying, "You should die." As to nasty,

104
00:13:21,127 --> 00:13:24,427
the nasty thing was you getting circumcised when we were in middle school.

105
00:13:27,387 --> 00:13:29,407
Hyungnim...

106
00:13:38,647 --> 00:13:40,727
Han Gi Tak said that...

107
00:13:40,727 --> 00:13:42,827
More? What now?

108
00:13:42,827 --> 00:13:46,327
You are the only person in this world

109
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:51,007
who wouldn't betray him even if everybody else did.

110
00:13:56,027 --> 00:14:03,047

111
00:14:05,247 --> 00:14:08,887
"I saw Song Yi Yeon at the Sun Jin department store today.

112
00:14:08,887 --> 00:14:14,907
"She was, in front of her ex-husband, flirting with her ex-boyfriend. She seems crazy.

113
00:14:14,907 --> 00:14:18,287
"She's coming back with a new movie. An erotic movie would be perfect for her.

114
00:14:18,287 --> 00:14:23,307
"She's an idiot who can't live without men around her. What a pitiful son she has."

115
00:14:23,307 --> 00:14:27,347
- That's enough. 
- Why? There are still 600 more.

116
00:14:27,347 --> 00:14:32,727
Thus, please, you need to face the reality, Yeong Chan's mother.

117
00:14:32,727 --> 00:14:35,527
Song Yi Yeon, why did you behave that way in that place?

118
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:40,467
He probably was imperiled. I can imagine all his lackeys coming all the way here.

119
00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:42,127
Woof woof!

120
00:14:43,487 --> 00:14:45,467
They all bark.

121
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:51,187
Why? Should I call you a slave, then?

122
00:14:51,187 --> 00:14:53,247
I know that you work for him.

123
00:14:53,247 --> 00:14:55,707
You guessed it.

124
00:14:55,707 --> 00:15:00,007
We both get paid by the same person. Let's take care of each other.

125
00:15:00,007 --> 00:15:03,927
Don't make me wander everywhere. It's tiring.

126
00:15:03,927 --> 00:15:08,087
In this big house... Living and eating.

127
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:14,487
Who would spend so much money on a has-been actress?

128
00:15:15,787 --> 00:15:16,647
Then...

129
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:21,467
For many reasons, the investor is uncomfortable with the situation.

130
00:15:26,507 --> 00:15:31,687
That person can't eat nor sleep because of a dead guy.

131
00:15:34,387 --> 00:15:37,647
I'm so upset, really.

132
00:15:37,647 --> 00:15:41,127
Let your son go to his dad. Live in ease just acting...

133
00:15:41,127 --> 00:15:44,427
Let go! You want to die? Let go or you're dead.

134
00:15:44,427 --> 00:15:46,107
What is it?

135
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:59,307
 Na Seok Cheol. You bastard...

136
00:15:59,307 --> 00:16:04,607
I'm sorry, sir.This is the sister I was talking about.

137
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:09,707
I told her to run some errands, but she won't listen. Let's leave.

138
00:16:09,707 --> 00:16:11,607
Let go of me!

139
00:16:16,087 --> 00:16:20,387
Are you the President Na Seok Cheol?

140
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,487
What do you want?

141
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:28,307
Would you like some coffee?

142
00:16:28,307 --> 00:16:30,427
Of course.

143
00:16:36,447 --> 00:16:40,607
These are the offers that we received so far. Take a look.

144
00:16:40,607 --> 00:16:45,967
A nude scene, a mature movie. You have two choices. What do you want to do?

145
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:51,147
Be thankful and do what I tell you to do.

146
00:16:51,147 --> 00:16:52,807
You got it?

147
00:16:57,047 --> 00:17:03,167
Don't act so tough like a thug and stay still. I can take care of myself.

148
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:06,607
What can I do with your attitude? Jeez.

149
00:17:11,927 --> 00:17:12,847
 It's delicious.

150
00:17:12,847 --> 00:17:18,287
I'll work like a dog to pay you back and then I will leave this dumpster.

151
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:22,287
Do it that way, please.

152
00:17:52,027 --> 00:17:56,027
You've had too much alcohol.

153
00:18:00,527 --> 00:18:03,407
What's the use if your mental state is so weak?

154
00:18:04,807 --> 00:18:10,567
I have a meeting with producers tomorrow. They're preparing something with Director Bong Soo Wook.

155
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:15,587
I'm not ready yet. Looks like they really want me on this.

156
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:20,847
How do I look?

157
00:18:22,327 --> 00:18:24,607
Am I a mess?

158
00:18:25,287 --> 00:18:30,567
Well... not to the extend that I can't recognize you.

159
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:35,647
After I had the kid, I gained 5 kg.

160
00:18:36,787 --> 00:18:40,447
I'll look fat on camera.

161
00:18:40,447 --> 00:18:43,987
But, what is your name?

162
00:18:50,807 --> 00:18:56,667
Hong... Hong Nan.
( Hong= red; Nan = orchid  )

163
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:58,827
Hong Nan?

164
00:18:58,827 --> 00:19:01,947
Han Hong Nan.

165
00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:07,487
It's a pretty name.

166
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:16,467
It suits you well. You're very pretty.

167
00:19:18,967 --> 00:19:25,787
Hong Nan, let's not see each other again.

168
00:19:28,887 --> 00:19:37,687
I... want to forget the name Han Gi Tak.

169
00:19:39,407 --> 00:19:44,427
as if he were a person never in my life in the first place.

170
00:19:52,887 --> 00:19:57,487
I'll give back all that I owe Gi Tak later.

171
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,007
You can resent me.

172
00:20:00,007 --> 00:20:01,507
But for right now,

173
00:20:05,297 --> 00:20:08,087
I want to live quietly.

174
00:20:09,287 --> 00:20:12,247
What did Na Seok Cheol say?

175
00:20:17,847 --> 00:20:20,067
I'm begging you.

176
00:20:22,547 --> 00:20:25,427
Please just get lost!

177
00:20:30,047 --> 00:20:37,107

178
00:20:56,567 --> 00:21:00,397
♬  I get anxious when I look at your eyes. ♬

179
00:21:00,397 --> 00:21:03,017
The debt...

180
00:21:03,017 --> 00:21:05,947
It's too late to pay it back.

181
00:21:05,947 --> 00:21:08,227
♫  I was alone  ♫

182
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:14,357
♫  There's still only you deep in my heart.  ♫

183
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:22,817
♬  Stop acting like you don't know me. Don't turn away from me. ♬

184
00:21:22,817 --> 00:21:29,097
♬  I love you. You also know how I feel. ♬

185
00:21:29,097 --> 00:21:34,327
♬  Don't see me and hide. ♬

186
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:42,067
♫  Alone, I'm still thinking of you and waiting for you.  ♫

187
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:47,937
♫  It hurts like this.  ♫

188
00:21:50,797 --> 00:21:55,807
I shouldn't have come back.

189
00:22:15,897 --> 00:22:21,127
Did you see it? That punk just shaking and turning around to ignore me?

190
00:22:21,827 --> 00:22:24,237
That was his greeting.

191
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:30,007
You saw that? That woman sneered at me, and what's the deal with that kid?

192
00:22:30,007 --> 00:22:33,477
The three of them planned to disrespect me, Cha Jae Gook.

193
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:37,027
Moreover, it was in my own department store.

194
00:22:37,027 --> 00:22:41,657
Even you two! If someone talks to you, answer!

195
00:22:41,657 --> 00:22:44,137
Damn it!

196
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:56,187
 Don't tremble in front of the Chairman.
 This person is my Dad right now.

197
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:04,967
Chairman! What an honor to meet you!

198
00:23:06,827 --> 00:23:11,307
President! I wasn't in my right mind earlier, I'm sorry!

199
00:23:25,017 --> 00:23:29,267
"Increase the sales of Sun Jin's department story by 130 percent in two months!

200
00:23:29,267 --> 00:23:34,097
"Starting tomorrow you'll be busy, get some rest!" He said this.

201
00:23:44,267 --> 00:23:48,287
Don't do whatever you were going to do.

202
00:23:48,287 --> 00:23:51,967
- Pardon?
- Even if you try, you won't have it.

203
00:23:51,967 --> 00:23:54,047
What are you trying to say?

204
00:23:54,047 --> 00:23:56,087
Stop acting.

205
00:23:56,087 --> 00:24:01,167
What? Because you were summoned to the department store, do you think you will be acknowledged as Father's son?

206
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:03,877
Absolutely not. Never.

207
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:08,517
- So don't even dream of it.
- Is that so?

208
00:24:08,517 --> 00:24:13,567
If you go back to The States now, I'll give you enough so that you won't be disappointed.

209
00:24:13,567 --> 00:24:19,627
Anyway, it's a mall that we are planning to close. Losses are getting bigger as we speak.

210
00:24:19,627 --> 00:24:21,967
 Close the mall?

211
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:25,087
 Every day he scolded me and said to increase the sales...

212
00:24:25,087 --> 00:24:28,177
 I died for nothing!

213
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:34,147
Listen to what I'm saying, because you're smart.

214
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:36,397
I understand.

215
00:24:36,397 --> 00:24:40,207
As I expected, you're well-educated so you understand me well!

216
00:24:40,207 --> 00:24:44,477
I'll do my best but if it doesn't work, let's have another talk.

217
00:24:44,477 --> 00:24:46,497
Then.

218
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:05,387
It's going to be fun.

219
00:25:15,337 --> 00:25:19,767
She wants to forget me. She wants to erase my existence.

220
00:25:20,247 --> 00:25:22,317
Is that what she wants?

221
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:41,397
I go. I don't go.

222
00:25:41,397 --> 00:25:46,077
I go. I don't go.

223
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,937
I go. Aish.

224
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:53,817
Human Han Gi Tak, what the heck are you doing here?

225
00:25:53,817 --> 00:25:58,847
I have nowhere to go. There is also no one waiting to greet me.

226
00:25:59,547 --> 00:26:02,407
Why exactly did you come?

227
00:26:09,047 --> 00:26:11,597
I'm hungry.

228
00:26:13,537 --> 00:26:15,287
Ah, really.

229
00:26:17,247 --> 00:26:21,797
 If you are in a difficult situation or have questions please hold the star key.

230
00:26:21,797 --> 00:26:24,927
 It will connect directly to me.

231
00:26:24,927 --> 00:26:27,247
Oh, gosh.

232
00:26:27,247 --> 00:26:29,447
 What is it? Do you want to go back?

233
00:26:29,447 --> 00:26:33,147
I didn't press it! I did not press it!

234
00:26:33,827 --> 00:26:37,267
What the heck? You were watching me? Are you a stalker?

235
00:26:37,267 --> 00:26:39,707
It what we call "monitoring".

236
00:26:39,707 --> 00:26:44,177
You aren't a prosecutor! This is illegal.

237
00:26:44,177 --> 00:26:48,047
Omo! Why are you getting angry at me for being a professional? That's my job.

238
00:26:48,047 --> 00:26:52,997
Don't do it. Don't do your work so religiously!

239
00:27:12,677 --> 00:27:16,327
♬  The path I casually walked on ♬

240
00:27:16,327 --> 00:27:22,637
♬  It feels familiar. Stop as is, in this place.  ♬

241
00:27:22,637 --> 00:27:26,347

 Up to here! I'm so cute!

243
00:27:30,377 --> 00:27:35,837
 The rabbit is falling down the sky!

244
00:27:35,837 --> 00:27:40,517
♬  Will you give a smile as bright as moonlight?   ♬

245

♫  You've always been pretty. You're the only one.  ♫

246
00:27:48,307 --> 00:27:54,287
 Hong Nan, let's not see each other again.

247
00:27:54,287 --> 00:27:58,887
 I... The name Han Gi Tak...

248
00:27:58,887 --> 00:28:01,167
 I want to forget it,

249
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:05,387
 as if he were never a person in my life in the first place.

250
00:28:05,387 --> 00:28:09,637
♫  Every day.  ♫

255
00:28:40,537 --> 00:28:43,467
 I'm back.

256
00:28:49,933 --> 00:28:52,343
As expected,

257
00:28:52,343 --> 00:28:55,123
I could watch it again.

258
00:29:06,373 --> 00:29:12,023
♫  The red wine.

259
00:29:15,203 --> 00:29:18,123
Let's see.

260
00:29:24,103 --> 00:29:27,883
I signed a big contract today.

261
00:29:27,883 --> 00:29:31,113
Han Gi Tak, are you watching?

262
00:29:31,113 --> 00:29:33,483
 I'm watching, you bastard.

263
00:29:33,483 --> 00:29:38,923
♫  You cannot beat me even if you try your best.

264
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:43,273
You're dead, aren't you? You jerk.

265
00:29:47,813 --> 00:29:52,143
I'm a crazy man, really.

266
00:29:52,143 --> 00:29:56,203
When did I turn on the lights?

267
00:30:16,813 --> 00:30:19,733
Ah, why isn't it working?

268
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:27,353
 It's not working again... My fists...

269
00:31:31,063 --> 00:31:33,623
It hurts! I said it hurts!

270
00:31:33,623 --> 00:31:36,823
You wench, stay still, huh?!

271
00:31:39,863 --> 00:31:43,223
Wench?! Who are you calling a wench!?

272
00:31:44,923 --> 00:31:49,483
 I bit him like a girl. What a macho man, Han Gi Tak!

273
00:31:51,003 --> 00:31:53,373
You, seriously.

274
00:31:53,373 --> 00:31:56,453
Huh? Why are you here?

275
00:31:56,453 --> 00:32:00,333
Do you have a death wish? Do you know what that place is? Why would you go in there?

276
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:03,423
Are you following my footsteps?

277
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:07,213
 I don't go.

278
00:32:07,213 --> 00:32:11,183
 I go... I go.

279
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,070
 When did I turn on the lights?

280
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:34,770
I guess you were worried about me, huh?

281
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:37,590
I don't care whether you are his sister or a con-artist.

282
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:41,060
If you wanted to dig into something, you should leave before you get hurt.

283
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:46,950
You talk tough, but I know you.

284
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:51,070
What a cute brat. How can I leave you here?

285
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,070
What a macho man.

286
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:12,820
You... Didn't they teach you the formal way of speaking in America?

287
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,800
Why? Want me to call you Oppa?

288
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,610
Rascal!

289
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:21,570
I-I warned you. Hurry up and leave.

290
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:27,290
Don't look at me like a woman. Look at me as your boss.

291
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,950
What the heck is the reason you went to see Song Yi Yeon?

292
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,420
That's what I want to ask.

293
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:38,090
- I saw a ghost! 
- Him...

294
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:42,980
Why did he suddenly appear in front of Song Yi Yeon?

295
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,240
This won't do. Follow me.

296
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,920
Wait!

297
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,260
- A ghost... ! 
 - You!

298
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:54,610
This can't be!

299
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,670
Greet him.

300
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:08,780
 Han Gi Tak
1976. 9. 19 - 2016. 1. 25

301
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,560
He didn't have the family to hold a funeral.

302
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:21,910
I wanted to spread his ashes in the ocean, but I thought he would have been lonely.

303
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,930
 Han Gi Tak
1976. 9. 19 - 2016. 1. 25

304
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:32,750
Now that I see it with my own eyes, it feels real now.

305
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,500
Don't cause trouble.

306
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:46,330
If you get into danger, I won't have the strength to talk to him anymore.

307
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:53,880
Don't blame yourself. That day...

308
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,920
It was an accident.

309
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:01,330
If we were together, both of us would've gotten hurt.

310
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,900
At least you are safe, so it's a relief.

311
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,000
That's right.

312
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:17,510
That's why I'm waiting for a moment.

313
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,360
I'll wait until no one is paying attention.

314
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:27,090
I'll hold my breath, quietly.

315
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:28,620
You, perhaps...

316
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:34,480
I will unveil the truth.

317
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:49,610
♬  Oh I see it oh   ♬ 
♬  Oh I see it now   ♬

318
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:52,180
♬   Ready, one   ♬

319
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,720
♬  Two, three  ♬

320
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:02,660
♬  Get set, go. Bye, bye, bye, goodbye. No, no, no.  ♬

321
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:07,720
♬  Hey, you. Tell me more. Tell me everything. ♬

322
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:13,000
Awesome. 
♫  Because I believe you.  ♫

323
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,650
♫  Hey, you, yes you. Won't you get your head straight?  ♫

324
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:20,650
This isn't too bad. Do I need this?

325
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:25,070
Have a nice break. Bye.

326
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:29,490
♬   I'm so dizzy  ♬

327
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:33,150
♬   Two faces...  ♬

328
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:37,160
♫  I'm scared  ♫

329
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,830
♬   I'm scared  ♬

330
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:43,820
♬  You choose me   ♬

331
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:49,550
♫  Don't let it go. Thank you, don't make some noise  ♫

332
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:53,030
♬   Tell me you love all of me  ♬

00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:57,450

00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:03,430
♬  I'll bet my everything ♬

335
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:09,330
Oh, Hyung Han. What's wrong with your voice?

336
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:12,240
What? You don't have a place to stay?

337
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,760
Ugh, smells like alcohol. How much alcohol did you drink?

338
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,130
Did you run away again without paying for your drinks?

339
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:25,640
She wants to forget me! She wants to erase me!

340
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:29,140
This Han Gi Tak!

341
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:32,590
Yi Yeon said that?

342
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:41,200
But... Seung Jae, that rascal...

343
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:50,230
 How could I forget Hyungnim... when he's my family?

344
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:05,940
What should I do? Should I go?

345
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,220
Or not?

346
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:12,960
My body doesn't move the way I want it to.

347
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,230
These are fists.

348
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:23,120
Why are my cheeks so wet? Is it raining?

349
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:27,360
A macho man is crying. Why are you crying?

350
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:32,970
It's always raining.

351
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:37,720
Ah, don't be like this, seriously!

352
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:42,070
Aigoo, Hyung Han! Hyung Han! Hyung Han! Hyung Han!

353
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,320
Hyung Han!

354
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,610
Hyung Han! Hyung Han! Hyung Han!

355
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,630
No matter when I look at myself, I'm so handsome.

356
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:16,490
Even if I have eye boogers, I'm still handsome.

357
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,020
Good morning!

358
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,290
Look away!

359
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,380
 Sunjin Department Store

360
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,590
Good morning.

361
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,770
Hello, Branch Manager.

362
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:04,630
Hello.

363
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,710
I love you!

364
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,750
Ah, it's chaos in the secretary's office!

365
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:13,390
Why?

366
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:17,800
To be the secretary to the branch manager, someone canceled her maternity leave and is coming back right after giving birth!

367
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:23,590
What to do? There's a new person now. It's awful.

368
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:27,900
♬  Moon Light. Thinking about...  ♬

369
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,010
Is it still right to do this at my age, when I'm about to get a grandchild?

370
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:33,320
♬   Even like this  ♬

371
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:39,680
♬   It'll get better eventually right? I miss you  ♬

372
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,170
♬  'Cause I'm still waiting  ♬

373
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:43,880
Why am I shaking?
♬  For you   ♬

374
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,490
He's so cool.

375
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:47,880
Move, move, move!

376
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,670
Come in.

377
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,210
Yes.

378
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,760
Branch Manager, I have brought the morning coffee.

379
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,310
Did you have a good rest for the last few days?

380
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:04,130
Yes, thanks to you.

381
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:06,630
Ah, well...

382
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:10,320
I'm not making you feel bad by making you do errands like this right?

383
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,980
No, of course not.

384
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:15,270
It's an honor for me to serve you, Branch Manager.

385
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:17,560
Until I figure out my role, please help me.

386
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:21,400
Yes, I will do my best.

387
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:24,690
Could you move out of the way?

388
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:28,500
Stop blocking the line of sight. The employees can't see me.

389
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,760
Then, the reason why you wanted to change it to transparent glass was...

390
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,120
You said it was for welfare of our company, right?

391
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,880
Oh my!

392
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,060
It's to cheer up the employees.

393
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:41,510
Ah, I see.

394
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:44,870
I feel like my spirit is going up, up and up.

395
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,810
In the future if you receive men's apparel, send it to my office right away.

396
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,920
What? Why that...?

397
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,000
I'll wear them and walk around like a model.

398
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,940
The sales will probably go up and up, too.

399
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,670
Ah, I see.

400
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,790
Since you said it, it sure seems like it.

401
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:07,870
The face completes the fashion.

402
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:10,020
It. Completes. It.

403
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:13,120
Oh. You look complete.

404
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:24,170
You work in fashion, so why don't you complete yours?

405
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:25,540
Pardon?

406
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,140
I think your eyes are sagging. Did you ever think about tightening them up?

407
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,770
Huh?

408
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:37,140
If they stay like this,

409
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,450
they can sag like this and you might not be able to see.

410
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:42,160
Not at all. I can still see well.

411
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,990
Right. Tell me if you can't see.

412
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:46,500
Yes.

413
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,570
Ah, this.

414
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:56,190
What's the matter?

415
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:58,260
I suddenly want to drink iced coffee.

416
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,900
During this weather?

417
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:02,650
Should I brew it again?

418
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:03,490
Yes.

419
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:07,080
Then of course I should redo it. I will bring it for you.

420
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,870
Iced coffee.

421
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,030
Hey, look here.

422
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:14,000
Han Goo Yeong!

423
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,260
 The Little Sister by Raymond Chandler

424
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:23,410
He brought in a woman?

425
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:24,630
Yes.

426
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:27,240
On top of that, that woman is...

427
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,200
Ah, that...

428
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,360
That kind of whisper which sounds like an undertaker wanting an installment payment,

429
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,630
stop with it.

430
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:39,820
Undertaker's whisper?

431
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:44,740
Just say it out loud. Loudly!

432
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:48,470
- Who would be listening in?
- Oh, yes.

433
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:53,790
He used jet lag as an excuse, but she might be the reason he didn't come in immediately.

434
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:58,990
He summoned her and he spent all night drinking with her at hostess bars.

435
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:02,130
He then brought her to the store, and then...

436
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:04,270
Incredibly.

437
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:06,000
Incredibly.

438
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,750
Incredibly, they were shopping.

439
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,460
♬  Trumpet, whoo!  ♬

440
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,220

450
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:54,520
Hello, Branch Manager.

451
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,110
My friend wants to buy some new clothes.

452
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,950
Then I can—

453
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:04,420
Can you help us, Shin Da Hye?

454
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:07,600
M-Me?

455
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,680
Yes.

456
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,090
My fr—

457
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,780
She's really my friend!

458
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:15,550
But she has no sense of fashion.

459
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:17,630
Can you give some recommendations?

460
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,550
Please take good care of me.

461
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,210
Wow, your wife is the best.

462
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:34,810
There was a reason why you fought so hard to return.

463
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:37,100
The absolute best.

464
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:42,390
Would you like to try this?

465
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:58,350
- You're so, so beautiful!
- You're very beautiful!

466
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:02,560
Can I stop wearing stockings?

467
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,290
They keep getting stuck in my anus.

468
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,910
It's elegant and nice.

469
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:16,650
I'll take it. With that and that one.

470
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,590
With those shoes and that bag. Please pack them up for me.

471
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:20,100
All of them?

472
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:23,900
Yes. I'll pay for it with my card.

473
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:27,580
The black card that the top one percent VIP uses.

474
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:30,600
Single payment, please.

475
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:36,500
- How much is t?
- It's $9,260, Branch Manager.

476
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,460
Hey, are you crazy? No, don't.

477
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,860
How can I not buy it?

478
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:44,080
- Payment.
- Okay.

479
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:56,330
It's okay since I'm the branch Manager. It's okay since I'm the branch manager.

480
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:01,980
I can pay several months of the loan payments...

481
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,710
Father...

482
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,980
He has that much money...

483
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:16,510
I think I know now why women shop when they feel depressed.

484
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:18,010
Hey!

485
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:20,930
What is with your posture?

486
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,770
To a woman, it's all about attitude.

487
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:25,900
Straighten your back and your chest...

488
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,900
Push out your chest like this.

489
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,190
Stick out your butt like this. Like this!

490
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:33,230
This is the most beautiful posture.

491
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:34,770
Like this?

492
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,700
Can't you make that line like this?

493
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,080
- Is it hard?
- Yeah.

494
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,270
Put your hands together and...

495
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:48,460
While you are pushing it...

496
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:51,310
- Ah!
- Ah!

497
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,000
Ooh!

498
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,760
Such a waste of brand name goods.

499
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:07,020
But that wife of your looks familiar.

500
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:09,540
Where have I seen her before?

501
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,260
Where would you have seen her, Hyung?

502
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:14,070
I saw her somewhere before for sure.

503
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,970
Doesn't she look like Madame Bong?

504
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:19,290
You want to die?

505
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:21,670
I'm already dead, you punk.

506
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:36,150
Please, buy them for me.

507
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:41,180
Hey! Hey!

508
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:43,660
Do you have an appointment?

509
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:49,420
There was once another person who stood there and asked me the same question.

510
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,000
I think that person was fired the next day.

511
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,440
That was a long time ago though.

512
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,800
Well, the CEO is in a meeting right now.

513
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,630
I'm always told that, whenever I call.

514
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:04,990
It's great that he's busy.

515
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:08,890
As long as he doesn't forget why this movie company became a major one.

516
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:10,500
I can't wait long.

517
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,440
You can't go in now!

518
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,140
I guess you came out in the end.

519
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:17,310
Actress Song!

520
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:22,210
What brings you here without calling?

521
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:25,400
You seemed busy so I came directly.

522
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,790
Have you spoken with the director?

523
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:32,820
That's... I did say that you were the best choice,

524
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:36,000
but the director seems to have a different thought and image in mind.

525
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,570
I don't think one can fill that acting role so easily.

526
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:41,550
Of course, I think so as well.

527
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:44,000
But as you know, Director Bong is stubborn.

528
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,670
It's hard for this old author to force anything on him since he's not a newbie.

529
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:51,500
CEO, I'm leaving. I'll see you at the shoot.

530
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,400
Yeah, sure.

531
00:49:56,300 --> 00:50:02,380

532
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:13,120
Ow! What's wrong?

533
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,750
Actress Song.

534
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,470
Even a mother role is ok.

535
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:22,660
Acting as an aunt or even a grandmother is fine.

536
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:25,890
I'll even take a minor role, so just get me anything.

537
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:28,300
Yi Yeon.

538
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,510
Consider our past fondness, please...

539
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:38,480
I'm sorry, I can't do anything. It's a condition from the investors.

540
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,170
Because Sunjin Group used their influence everywhere,

541
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:45,770
unless it's an independent film, in the future it will be hard for you to make a movie.

542
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:56,560
Goodness, I feel bad but I can't do anything.

543
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,260
You son of a bitch!

544
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:12,210
It's a call from Director Bong.

545
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,480
Yes, hello Director.

546
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:27,620
What? It's today? Of course I have time.

547
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:34,530
Wait let me check. How's my schedule? Oh, for a moment. For a moment, it's okay.

548
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:38,030
I wasn't going to go there, but since you called I'll come.

549
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:41,450
Yes. I'll see you later then.

550
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:46,770
He asks for hot water, cold water, then honey water...

551
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:51,740
On top of that, he even has some weird habits.

552
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:00,020
 Let's work well together in the future.

553
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:10,930
 You're spilling on the sides, should I help you?

554
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:21,130
I guess I don't need to worry about it.

555
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:24,590
Guys like that are easier to handle.

556
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:28,240
Unlike the rumors, I don't think he's that great.

557
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,860
Recently, having too much to drink, l think you guys should curtail drinking.

558
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:52,120
When you die and get to heaven, you'll be scolded a lot.

559
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,100
What are you doing here, Manager Jung?

560
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:06,850
He was promoted to general manager not that long ago.

561
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:10,600
Is that so? General Manager, wow!

562
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:14,160
So you're on the same team as Department Head Ma. You're a guy with some capabilities.

563
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,570
Manager Jung— I mean Department Head Jung.

564
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:19,940
On the morning of the day that Manager Kim died, you met him on your way to work, right?

565
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:20,770
Yes.

566
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:24,890
According to Manager Kim's daughter, on that day he was going to have a date with his wife

567
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:28,500
and asked you to take over for him. Is that right?

568
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:31,670
Yes.

569
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:37,480
It means a person who asked you to cover for him for a date with his wife committed suicide.

570
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,620
Ah, that...

571
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:44,770
There was no suicide note left behind, so why was it deemed a suicide? Was it captured on CCTV?

572
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:47,530
It captured him getting in the elevator without shoes.

573
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:51,270
There were no signs of murder and under those circumstances, even the police said it was suicide.

574
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,820
Oh, circumstantial evidence.

575
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:58,660
I'm sorry, but I don't really understand why you keep on asking about Manager Kim...

576
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:00,210
Why did I come here?

577
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:03,980
Because the Chairman told you to increase sales.

578
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:07,590
Sales. That's right, we should increase the sales.

579
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:09,660
Like you guys, would anyone want to buy merchandise

580
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:13,680
from a crappy mall that had an employee who took bribes and committed suicide?

581
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:18,240
So! This crappy mall, in order to be cleared of being framed...

582
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,260
Huh?

583
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:24,690
I am going to reveal why Manager Kim Yeong Soo, who worked for 15 years at this store, had to die.

584
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:27,590
That reason is certainly here as well.

585
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:34,020
Whether it was suicide or murder, are you saying that the reason lies within the company?

586
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,050
Correct answer.

587
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:41,890
If there is something rotten, don't you think we should remove it for the sake of increasing sales?

588
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:45,700
Don't you think so, President?

589
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:58,020
He is someone who is quite ambitious.

590
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,460
I'd like to hear you out.

591
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:06,670
This is the testimony of the people who met with Manager Kim on the night that he died.

592
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:16,810
 That night, Manager Kim looked desperate and hotheaded.

593
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:19,410
 He didn't seem to be feeling well but...

594
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,530
 On the day of his wedding anniversary, after he hurt his family,

595
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:26,950
 he begged numerous times to have another chance.

596
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:33,680
 Truthfully speaking, thanks to Manager Kim we won the Lucia deal.

597
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:40,840
 But, he committed suicide right after that? I don't believe it.

598
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:49,040
 I was very shocked seeing the news.

599
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:53,340
 I felt like I did something wrong.

600
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:57,610
 That night, I didn't smell alcohol on him at all.

601
00:55:57,610 --> 00:56:03,660
 He suddenly rushed out of the car to vomit.

602
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,550
 Did you see him jump off?

603
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:11,330
 I said that I didn't see him. I heard a bang so I went to go check, but he was already—

604
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:14,890
 Wait a second, is this a camera? This is driving me crazy.

605
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:16,810
 I have nothing to say. Please leave.

606
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:21,150
 Rumor has it that you quit your job the day after his death. Was it because you were reprimanded?

607
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:25,460
 I said I have nothing to say. Please leave me alone!

608
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:33,000
We weren't able to hear the reason from anybody.

609
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,140
So what could have happened?

610
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,680
What I'm trying to say is,

611
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:48,030
we have to look into what he said.

612
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:06,370
 I said that I didn't see him. I heard a bang so I went to go check, but he was already—

613
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:17,710
 Oppa! The camera is so nice!

614
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:53,700
  In every which way, this is very fishy.

615
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:13,730
"I did not see it."

616
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:16,710
It takes him around a minute to two minutes to search around the roof.

617
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:21,100
We don't know if he was hanging off something before he fell.

618
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:24,360
If there was a person who was about to commit suicide, there wouldn have been plenty of time to witness the person.

619
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:26,630
Then let's consider some hypotheticals.

620
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:30,400
Everybody said that Manager Kim didn't look well that day.

621
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,890
What if he didn't jump on purpose?

622
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:43,410
What exactly is the reason then?

623
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:48,020
It's not like he was cleaning the windows. If he wasn't thinking of committing suicide why was he up there?

624
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:52,830
Goodness... And it's not like we could ask a dead person.

625
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:08,870
Branch Manager Lee, are you saying that it was suicide or not?

626
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:11,770
That's what I want to ask you all.

627
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:17,400
There's this man.

628
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:21,670
In order to increase the sales by 130 percent, he works like a madman during the sales season.

629
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:24,700
He hardly sleeps two hours a day and sometimes eats twice a day.

630
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:29,490
He ate things like hamburger, ramen, and triangle kimbap, substituting junk food for meals.

631
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:32,750
He doesn't have time to exercise and goes to a health club once or twice every six months,

632
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:36,070
and he has to take diet pills because his manager tells him to lose weight.

633
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:38,440
Also, he drinks every day with clients.

634
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:41,920
If you count all of the alcohol he drank all his life, it is 1/30,000 of the Pacific.

635
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,830
Is it suicide or not suicide?

636
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:53,490
A stroke, myocardial infarction, high blood pressure, hyperglycemia and diabetes!

637
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:56,720
He had fifteen illnesses!

638
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,050
 Physical Examination

639
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:04,020
He overworked himself and drank every day. As a result, he was probably in pain all the time,

640
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:08,360
but he ignored it and kept on going. Is it suicide or not?!

641
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:11,730
 It was a deliberate suicide.

642
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:19,820
The average working hours for you guys is 40 hours a week, isn't it?

643
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:23,700
For Manager Kim, he worked 72 hours a week,

644
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:27,210
but he was paid for working for only 45 hours.

645
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:30,360
He devoted his life to work here.

646
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:34,010
This is how the system at the department store works.

647
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:36,750
And everybody who worked with him are the witnesses.

648
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:39,660
You ask for immoral percentages as a threat, and

649
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:43,130
you dare to say that the company is not at fault for his death?!

650
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:49,320
If the company has one percent responsibility, we have to acknowledge it and give just compensation.

651
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:57,680
To the family who has lost the only husband and to the father who lost his only son.

652
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:10,520
This is very moving. I see what you're trying to say. But,

653
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:16,210
you said that this company bears responsibility for the death of Manager Kim. Then,

654
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:22,400
does that mean that Shin Da Hye over there is working at the company that killed her husband?

655
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,760
If she had any doubts about her husband's death,

656
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:35,960
then how could she work at this company like nothing happened? Isn't that right, Shin Da Hye?

657
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:46,310

658
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:49,220
 Epilogue

659
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,060
♬  Trumpet, whoo!  ♬

660
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:01,510
Look here.

661
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:05,860
Look here. Look here!

662
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:08,950
Is he in hypothermia?

663
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:11,550
No! No! Don't die!

664
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:14,520
No! No! You can't die!

665
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:24,490
Who are you?
 ♫   From the moment of waking up feel alive  ♫

666
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:28,000
♫  Feel like a rain cloud about to burst Yeah   ♫

667
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,820
♫  A new beginning Feel so right alive,  ♫

668
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:35,490
♫  I'm flying high. ♫

669
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:41,750
♫  Say I'm going to the sky, oh oh oh.  ♫

670
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:45,100
 Shin Da Hye, it's truly hard for me to look at you.

671
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:48,560
 Did you think you could hide it forever?

672
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:51,270
 Why did he have to die?

673
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:55,880
 I'll give you the answer. Just wait.
