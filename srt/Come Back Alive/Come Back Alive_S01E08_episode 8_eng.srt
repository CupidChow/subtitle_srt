1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,920

2
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,800
Wait.

3
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,560
The thing that you prepared for me was this?

4
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,540
- Han Na's mother!
 - Don't call my daughter's name!

5
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,100
What are you doing right now?

6
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,760
Are you using my husband for your power struggle, like people have been saying?

7
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,040
You know that can't be.

8
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,420
If not, why are you doing this to me?

9
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,550
Aren't you happy? It wasn't a suicide!

10
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,100
Do you think I should be happy?

11
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:05,030
Instead of suicide, is this any better?! Huh?

12
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:24,510
♬   It might be too late   ♬

13
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:29,800
♬   Maybe in a place that I can’t even go back to   ♬

14
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:40,190
♬   My whole love is alive and breathing   ♬

15
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:45,370
♬   With you   ♬

16
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:51,740
♬   With you   ♬

17
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,450
Would you like to try it on?

18
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,140
Da Hye. Can you please check the warehouse inventory?

19
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,030
Yes, I'll be back soon.

20
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,190
- Success?
- Yes.

21
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,170
Well. For now.

22
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,710
Congratulations, Honey!

23
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:25,780
- What about you?
- All night I posted Yoo Hyeok's voice on blogs everywhere.

24
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,470
It's about time that they start to nibble on the bait.

25
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,630
 Yoo Hyeok's Shocking Confession: Who was the mastermind behind his fake scandal with Song Yi Yeon?

26
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,870
 Listen to the audio

27
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,890
 That's right!

28
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,060
 I even pretended to be Song Yi Yeon's lover, with my face that is worth more than my life,

29
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,530
 so you can't do this to me!

30
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,840
 You repay my grace this way?

31
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,480
Lee Hae Joon, Song Yi Yeon.

32
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,510
So this was the event you prepared.

33
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:03,400
 The mastermind behind Song Yi Yeon's scandal was her ex-husband Mr. C, S group's eldest heir.

34
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,230
 S group still has not released an official statement.

35
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:14,050
After so long, how does it feel to be searched on the Internet?

36
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,190
So, you guys filmed an action movie all night?

37
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,050
Of course, this is the top class, ultra,

38
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:26,100
super, mega, spectacular action and suspense movie!

39
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,330
Your words that are misunderstanding, threatening,

40
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:33,160
even after I took in all the curses, I persevered and

41
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,810
like this, I went through hardship.

42
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,390
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. Good!

43
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,880
I seduced Yoo Hyeok, and

44
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:49,300
by spreading everywhere how wronged you were, got it in the newspaper.

45
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,910
We got it done.

46
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,720
We got it done.

47
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,040
A day like this has finally arrived.

48
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,280
You guys are really just doing useless things.

49
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,270
What?

50
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,170
Did anyone ask for this?

51
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:06,510
I knew you would be like that. A woman like you...

52
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,090
You're arrogant, aren't you?

53
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,180
But what is this smell?

54
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,050
- What is this?
- Omo.

55
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,730
- What are you doing?
- Why is this drinking snack here?

56
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,860
Oh yeah, why is this here?

57
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,720
The drink I made... I haven't even tried it yet.

58
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,540
Did you have some kind of party all night?!

59
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:43,830
So... Yoo Hyeok? What happened to him?

60
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,640
Oh yeah.

61
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,460
What did he eat that he's so heavy, this jerk?

62
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,640
Now...

63
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,840
Ah I don't know. Does this situation even make sense?

64
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,510
Eat, eat. Stop staring at us and eat.

65
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:37,370
You... In front of me! You, eating ramen... Does this situation even make any sense?

66
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,030
For my past lover to do so...

67
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:46,540
But this jerk! You're like this because of us,. We can't just leave you here to die.

68
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,980
This jerk. Eat!

69
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,040
Stop staring at us. Eat! Ah, this guy...

70
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,460
Who's calling?

71
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,800
 Na Seok Cheol

72
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,910
Na Seok Cheol?!

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,780
Choi Seung Jae.

74
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,720
Don't you think that you should do the nose now?

75
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,430
Yes, I understand.

76
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,230
Is it Seok Cheol?

77
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,890
Do you think you'll be okay?

78
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,270
Worry about yourself.

79
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,870
Seung Jae, you were worried about our action movie so that you tailed us?

80
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,180
It's painful isn't it, brat?

81
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:52,090
Are you hurt a lot? Where? Where?

82
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,870
Move.

83
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,750
Let me see. I'll put on some medicine for you.

84
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,750
I told you not to use your fist so readily, didn't I?

85
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,860
This jerk.

86
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:38,880
I know Seok Cheol too well. If you are in danger, say you are Han Gi Tak's younger brother.

87
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,150
No matter what happens, you must come out alive.

88
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,860
Understood?

89
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,730
This time, these injuries seem like they are going to last a long time.

90
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,790
After doing something huge, a drink is really killer.

91
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:15,560
How was it? Sister-in-law really liked it, right?

92
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,450
No.

93
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,860
Although I can't figure out exactly what emotion that is,

94
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,910
for now, I think she got mad.

95
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,770
Huh? What are you saying?

96
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:30,860
Ah, I don't know. What about Yi Yeon? Did she feel very touched and cry?

97
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,290
No way she cried. She just rebuked me.

98
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,180
Even though I became a woman, I still don't understand a woman's heart.

99
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,530
I want to know that heart too.

100
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,550
Daughter-in-law! The Branch Manager has come visit! Come on in.

101
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:02,000
You must be having a feast. I can smell the delicious food from the alley...

102
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,180
I wonder if Dad has safely arrived in heaven?

103
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:25,860
What?

104
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:32,090
That's what grandfather said. Forty-nine days after one dies, you will forever...

105
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,570
go to heaven.

106
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:44,690
 Dad's here. Dad's right by your side.

107
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,140
I... have something to tell you.

108
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,370
I came here to apologize.

109
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:11,220
 After you planned with Lee Hae Joon and Song Yi Yeon, my younger underling Choi Seung Jae made a move...

110
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,500
 Something like that.

111
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,820
What are you trying to say?

112
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:21,690
Until when should I wait for our Seung Jae?

113
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,760
You jerk.

114
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:31,500
Yoo Hyeok and that pretty sister were holding hands and ran off in front of me.

115
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,570
However, Yoo Hyeok has disappeared.

116
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:39,450
But our pretty one is walking around freely.

117
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,450
How should I accept this situation?

118
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:53,220
Oh he's not flinching. He has to flinch. That stings!

119
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:02,010
Seung Jae. About that pretty girl,

120
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,680
is she really your younger sister?

121
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:15,680
You said you believe in your dad, right Han Na?

122
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,880
Your words were right.

123
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:27,990
Dad... He loved our family so much,

124
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,050
that he worked hard every day.

125
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:35,940
That's why he was so sick.

126
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:41,880
He worked so hard that he didn't know how much he was hurting.

127
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:51,490
That's why... I guess he wanted rest a bit earlier than he originally thought.

128
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,950
So that's what happened.

129
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,170
All this time, you've been suffering a lot, haven't you?

130
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,850
I suppose so.

131
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,580
The company will formally apologize and give compensation.

132
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:27,290
Now, you can kick out your legs and sleep comfortably and even laugh comfortably!

133
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,880
Right... Thanks.

134
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,400
Daughter-in-law. Let's have dinner.

135
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,520
♬  I love you, don't leave me   ♬

136
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,270
♬  Don't leave me.  ♬

137
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,830
♬  A day without you  ♬

138
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,340
♬   I feel like I'm going to cry  ♬

139
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,700
♬   It hurts a lot  ♬

140
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,650
Right.
♬  It feels like you'll come   ♬

141
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:07,170
Would my son have ended his life in vain like that?

142
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,890
It can't be.

143
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,860
Yeong Soo...

144
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,500
How must have you...

145
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:32,760
How much...

146
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,280
♬  All day today, another day, unable to forget ♬

147
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:44,280
Bring back my dad. Bring him back.

148
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,920
Bring him back! Bring him back!

149
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,890
Bring my dad back to life!

150
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:56,390
My child.
♬   Don't leave  ♬

151
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,300
How hard it must've been?

152
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:06,000
♬  A day without you. I feel like I'm going to cry  ♬

153
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,520
♬  It hurts so much   ♬

154
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:14,480
♬  I feel like crying honestly  ♬

155
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,980
♬   If I close my eyes again  ♬

156
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:23,790
♬   If I close my eyes again  ♬

157
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:28,340
♬   I see you  ♬

158
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,020
I was wondering where we were going.

159
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,110
It's the 49th day after his death.

160
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,150
What to do? We came empty-handed.

161
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:01,000
Then again, he probably wouldn't want a drink from me.

162
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,760
If you give it to him, he'll take it. Why wouldn't he?

163
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:25,140
 Han Gi Tak

164
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,400
For sending your younger sister,

165
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,890
thank you. I'm very thankful.

166
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,210
 What's she saying. Those words are for me so why can't I hear them?

167
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,590
My Noonims are here.

168
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:53,580
Indeed the sisters are the best when it comes to loyalty.

169
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,180
For our Hyungnim,

170
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,370
I brought some meat soup.

171
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,300
Rascal. Thanks.

172
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,380
Why are you hitting the chest of a bachelor?

173
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,480
It makes my heart flutter.

174
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,810
- What's this?
- What happened to Yoo Hyeok that you're here?

175
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,050
He went to live his own life.

176
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,270
When was it that he whined about having no place to go?

177
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,110
What a funny guy.

178
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:39,430
Chairman! No, Hyungnim.

179
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:46,240
We came. He used to always say things about meat soup.

180
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,010
You'll be eating it until you get sick of it.

181
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,510
But this, Is this really Korean Beef?

182
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:22,030
Ah. Seriously.

183
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,790
Real? I personally went to the Majang District and

184
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:30,010
I made sure it was made it Korea and sliced it up.

185
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:01,800
I wonder why. I revealed everything about my unfair death.

186
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,320
Why don't I feel relieved?

187
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,270
It's because you can't turn back your death.

188
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,980
- I'm so hungry. 
 - What should we eat?

189
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,940
Do you really think the company will really give compensation?

190
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,840
How much do you think they'll give?

191
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,900
Manager Kim's ghost is probably calculating the amount tonight.

192
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,300
Wait how much is the compensation?

193
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:33,670
- Ah! Let's go run! 
- Come here, I'll find you!

194
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,890
That's why I said it will be tough.

195
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:51,150
It can possibly be even more burdensome and hard

196
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:54,490
because, as a different person, you're looking back at yourself.

197
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:00,590
Now. Now that you got rid of your resentment...

198
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,640
No! I didn't get rid of my resentment.

199
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,190
You know you can't do anything about it.

200
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,850
Honey.

201
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,190
Why at this time of night?

202
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,300
Could it be...? Jeong Ji Hoon?

203
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,990
No! Don't do this at the company!

204
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,660
This isn't right, Da Hye!

205
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,510
It's better to do it in front of me.

206
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:11,060
 It's probably not here. Da Hye isn't that kind of person.

207
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:21,630

208
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,580
 These little...!

209
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,100
 Han Na's Dad.

210
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,050
Yeong Soo.

211
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,970
It's me.

212
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:55,450
I thought that I'd be able to meet you if I came here.

213
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:06,680

214
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:14,810
After you left like that,

215
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:20,790
I was so scared and sorry.

216
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:23,510
I thought that it was only hard for me.

217
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:31,410
But for you too, it was hard enough to die for.

218
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,470
I didn't even know that

219
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:42,510
and said those things to you, resenting you.

220
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:47,330
 No... I'm sorry, I am.

221
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:54,870
I guess that's why I wanted to believe that person's words that you didn't commit suicide.

222
00:21:55,810 --> 00:22:00,870
Because then I'd be able to live.

223
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:06,840
How scary it must have been for you to lie there alone on the cold cement.

224
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:15,290
Whenever I thought about that, I thought I was going crazy.

225
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:20,430
You stupid... You're so stupid.

226
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:25,040
Why did you do it?

227
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,370
Why did you go up there?

228
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:33,930
Did you not think of me at all?

229
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:37,970
Didn't you think about us? You moron.

230
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,270
♬   Like that star over there  ♬

231
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:47,050
It really is like you.

232
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:51,030
Even until the very end.

233
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:57,520
 I did wrong. I deserved to die.

234
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,030
Yeong Soo.

235
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:09,010
I... I thought that only I had to do well.

236
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:18,990
I... I thought I was doing well, but as I lived together with you...

237
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:26,230
I was really lonely.

238
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:29,550
We lived so foolishly.

239
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:33,770
You neglected me and

240
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:40,250
I wasn't honest with you. If I had been more honest,

241
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:47,330
would something have been different? I can't stop thinking about that.

242
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:53,830
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Han Na's dad.

243
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:59,850
With these feelings, I can't continue to hold onto you.

244
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:04,710
I came to tell you this, Yeong Soo.

245
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,890
Now...

246
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,890
I'll send you off.

247
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:21,030
♬  For all of that  ♬

248
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:24,750
What is that supposed to mean?

249
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:30,070
♬  I loved you  ♬

250
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:35,450
You were lonely? You weren't happy?

251
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,410
Branch Manager.

252
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:40,970
You were living with those kinds of feelings?

253
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:43,490
What do you know?!

254
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:46,570
 Kim Yeong Soo was just a stain in Shin Da Hye's life.

255
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:50,430
Was I just a stain in your life?

256
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,470
Honey.

257
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,270
 Han Na.

258
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:36,790
 Dad!

259
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:40,110
 Dad!!

260
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:51,470
 My daughter! You're so heavy. Who fed you this well?

261
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:56,890
 - My little pretty.
- Honey! Han Na!

262
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,850
 Father!

263
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:33,570
 No! No no! It can't be like this!

264
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,710
 I warned you.

265
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,970
 If you break the rules, something scary will happen.

266
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,990
 Something scary?

267
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:49,050
 That fact that you existed in this world disappears.

268
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,790
 You become someone who was not born in this world.

269
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,870
 No...

270
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:56,450
 Nobody will remember you.

271
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:02,340
 N-No! No no! This isn't right!

272
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:19,950
If you're a loan shark then focus on the loans. Don't pry into other people's matters.

273
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:48,690
 There are no more warnings.

274
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:55,070
If you're not confident, return.

275
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,410
Go in.

276
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,450
Go.

277
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:20,670
Close your door securely and close your windows too.

278
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:29,210
Do you want to sleep over?

279
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:47,650
Where have you been living lately since you're not living at your brother's house?

280
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:50,890
What? My friend's house.

281
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:55,280
It must be a close friend then. Are you allowed to burden them for this long?

282
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,610
No, I can't! We're not even that close.

283
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,830
I'll wash up first then.

284
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:06,790
D-D-Do what you want.

285
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:28,730
No. I can't have these scenarios in my head.

286
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,730
- Your timing is so... Gosh!   - What?

287
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,390
Forget it. I'm busy so hurry and tell me what you want.

288
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,070
 Open the door.

289
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:07,350
If you're joking around, I'll kill you.

290
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:15,960
What do you want today? Did the war start today or something??

291
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,240
I saw the scary scenario.

292
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:32,390
When I saw the guy who took my place, I got the chills.

293
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:36,350
I was wondering what a dead person could be scared about.

294
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:44,230
Does she know what I did to come back here?

295
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:49,630
But all her smiles in front of me were fake and everything during that time was a lie!

296
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,540
Sister-in-law went a bit overboard.

297
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,820
But, why is she saying that now?

298
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:00,560
That's what I'm saying! Why didn't she tell me before, at least once!?

299
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,760
- You sure it wasn't that she said it but you just didn't understand?
- Madam.

300
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,940
That's better than hearing sister-in-law.

301
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,820
What's this? From where did you hear?

302
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:13,720
Isn't it just talk about not being able to forget a woman and whining about it?

303
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:19,780
She probably said it for sure. Multiple times.

304
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:27,520
But if you say it multiple times and they don't acknowledge you, you eventually stop.

305
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,300
That's what a woman does.

306
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:34,550
Excuse me, you need to say it so I understand.

307
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:38,720
Since you're from the Cha Household, you're exactly the same.

308
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:45,620
Now she wants to send me off? No way, I will never let her go.

309
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:49,420
That's not love. It's obsession.

310
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:52,360
If you love her, you need to know how to let go of her.

311
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,700
Do you think people's feelings can be cleanly cut off as if you are slicing off something?

312
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:00,400
He's not distinguishing love and obsession. So pathetic.

313
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,050
Pathetic?

314
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:15,000
I want to forget but I can't, so what can I do?

315
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:21,250
I want to cut it out of my heart, but I can't.

316
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:25,830
She's hovering in front of my eyes so much that I want to gouge my eyes out.

317
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:28,210
Is this being pathetic?

318
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:41,630
Just why did I become so pathetic?

319
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:47,670
Don't start to like him. He's is really pathetic.

320
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,360
We're not in that kind of relationship—

321
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,760
If Da Hye doesn't love me, what becomes of my life?

322
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,720
I guess you worked endlessly and died.

323
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,200
Why is it so hard?

324
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,760
Should I just seduce her instead?

325
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,510
Isn't that revenge?

326
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:11,540
I'd be seducing my own wife, so how is that revenge?

327
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:15,460
Should we ask Maya?

328
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,380
Scared me!

329
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,950
Seducing her...

330
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:29,590
then saying, "I'll destroy you!" is revenge.

331
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:32,010
It's not! It's not like that!

332
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:36,040
Your seducing her isn't really affirming revenge, per se, but...

333
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:40,780
I want to know Da Hye's honest feelings. What is it that she couldn't tell me?

334
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:44,090
Did she even love me? That's what I want to know!

335
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,100
It's not revenge then!

336
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,870
You have to get rid of the resentment so you can go to heaven!

337
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,870
Don't look at me like that. What to do?

338
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:58,960
I think I'm going to die from overwork. I am. I'm so tired...

339
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,410
Don't lean on me!

340
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,760
Don't lean on me either.

341
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:10,770
-Look here.
-I don't know.

342
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,550
Where is Father?

343
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:18,950
The chairman's blood pressure is not good today. It would be best not to see him right now.

344
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:24,600
He doesn't even want to see me? Does he know what Lee Hae Joon, that bastard, did today?

345
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,990
President.

346
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:28,870
He wants the whole world to know.

347
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:32,020
This, all from that mighty son of that mighty father,

348
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:36,370
scheming a trap to smash our Cha family.

349
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:39,410
So, all this time you were just sitting idle while you were being had?

350
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:43,370
Are you going to say Song Yi Yeon's scandal was manufactured by Lee Hae Joon too?

351
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:47,600
Father wanted it! He wanted me to bring Yeong Chan here!

352
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,220
You moron!

353
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,250
Go croak instead!

354
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,790
Father...

355
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:01,660
It's been so many years since I've heard your voice and you're cursing me.

356
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:06,040
Yes, I know! You closed your mouth because you don't want to speak with me!

357
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:12,510
I did it so that I could live. To live!

358
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:16,710
Everytime I see you my temper flairs and my blood pressure goes up!

359
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:28,310
Since my salary isn't at all enough to handle the loan.

360
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:32,720
I heard that the company was going to give compensation.

361
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,070
It probably won't help much.

362
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:41,380
Now that Han Na's dad is not around anymore, we'll need to figure out how to manage by ourselves.

363
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,350
Alright. Let's sell the house.

364
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,030
You must be sad.

365
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:49,490
The house is too big and it's been a burden, actually.

366
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:54,860
My legs shake when I want to clean the whole house. I was actually going to suggest we sell it first.

367
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,590
If Father is like that then this won't do.

368
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:02,590
"You wench! My son bought this house for my sake. What are you to sell this house?"

369
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:06,730
You need to be angry like that so I'll feel less sorry.

370
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:10,380
What face do I have to be angry at you?

371
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:14,090
I'm sorry, daughter-in-law. I'm no help at all.

372
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:18,220
Just having you by my side is like having a hundred people help me.

373
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:25,440
If I had been alone, it would have been hard to deal with.

374
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,040
Stay healthy, by my side, for a long time, alright?

375
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:34,700
You take responsibility, Father!

376
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:40,120
I thought if he's your son he'd be a family guy. I got tricked!

377
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:45,010
I shouldn't have packed him kimbap that day.

378
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,870
All because of that kimbap.

379
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:52,430
I know, right?

380
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:56,030
He really liked my kimbap.
♬  felt familiar ♬

381
00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:04,190
♬  And I stopped there In the place where I was   ♬

382
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:08,060
♬  together with beautiful you that stupid night   ♬

383
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,110
This is flipping me out.

00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,670
♬  How much will it change   ♬

385
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:20,870

386
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:26,010
♬  You were always beautiful   ♬

387
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,820

388
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:33,300
♬  Moonlight. Thinking about you tonight   ♬

389
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,120
This chick sure sleeps loud.

00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:47,480
♬ you appear in my sweet dream and I welcome you in my arms  ♬

00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:21,880
♬  Moonlight. Even though the sleepless times   ♬

395
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,940
Oh, Gang.
♬  are too long   ♬

396
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,300
You slept here?

397
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:35,050
♬  cuz I’m still waiting for you   ♬

398
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:38,940
Did you sleep well, Gang Ja? Your face is swollen.

399
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,630
Han Na.

400
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:50,380
Grandpa and I talked about this...

401
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:53,060
Today, this house—

402
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,610
Today what?

403
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:01,390
Aigoo it's cold.

404
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:09,750
Thank goodness the weather's letting up or else I'd freeze to death.

405
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:18,580
The broth came out really good. More broth.

406
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,030
What's up with everybody?

407
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:27,410

408
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:32,660
Before we report you for breaking and entering, you will answer at once.

409
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,520
How did you know the passcode to our house?

410
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,070
Damn liquor.

411
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:39,600
- Branch Manager!
- It's Han Na's birthday!

412
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,380
Er no. Yeong Soo told me.

413
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,980
He told me to come over whenever I want homemade food.

414
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:53,810
To be honest, I can't even call my father "Father".

415
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:57,150
I also can't call my older brother "Hyung".

416
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:01,830
I grew up without eating homemade food so my face is like this.

417
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:04,990
Daughter-in-law, I think we'll need to call the police.

418
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:08,750
Let go for a second.

419
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:13,230
- Hello? 
- Hello?

420
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,370
To the President's office?

421
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,090
Acquitted?

422
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:25,140
Your husband put the money received from Department Head Baek in a golf locker and sent the key.

423
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:29,670
Although Department Head Baek denied receiving the money, in the end he acknowledged it.

424
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:32,910
What do you mean a key? You said it was a gift card.

425
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:35,440
- You said it was a gift card?
-  Why would Department Head Baek lie?

426
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,980
- That is because...
- That is because Department Head was trying to keep the money that was returned.

427
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:43,880
And Department Head Jeong found the money as evidence.

428
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,740
So he's acquitted.

429
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,880
I guess it was revealed really fast.

430
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,020
You really revealed it fast, didn't you?

431
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:56,780
It's a relief that the deceased has been exonerated, but there's one thing I want to make clear.

432
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,080
We can't acknowledge that it's death from overwork.

433
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,740
It's a death by a slip of his own foot.

434
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:04,040
It's was from a cerebral hemorrhage from overwork!

435
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,330
That's just a supposition.

436
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,230
It's not like we can do an autopsy on him now.

437
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:10,830
He died because of work. Acknowledge it as him dying while he was working.

438
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:13,980
Was it Manager Kim's duty to go up there with bare feet?

439
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,320
- That's because...
- To acknowledge that company is responsible when he did things that he wasn't even told to do.

440
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,290
Isn't that a bit irrational?

441
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:23,090
"Do a job that he wasn't told to do?"

442
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:29,530
Shin Da Hye, if you feel wronged, you can sue but our position will not change.

443
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:32,940
If we drag the issue out more,

444
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,900
aren't we making it hard for the deceased?

445
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,080
However since it happened at our company location, we decided to give compensation.

446
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,430
How much compensation will you give?

447
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:56,020
Even if he was considered to have died performing his duty, with only 60% of his pay,

448
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:59,140
how much can it help with your living expenses?

449
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:02,940
By taking this money,

450
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,600
are you saying she should shut her mouth for the rest of her life?

451
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,540
All you have to do is sign here.

452
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:13,630
You can't sign. You know why your husband died.

453
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,420
Stop it already, Branch Manager Lee.

454
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,870
Stop manipulating other's pain.

455
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,400
What did you say?

456
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,310
Mom!

457
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:34,940
Yeong Chan.

458
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:44,860
The chairman wants to see you for a bit.

459
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,890
I heard the custody rights were handed over

460
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:55,960
for fear of a death in the house.

461
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:00,630
If I had known sooner, I would't have given up custody easily.

462
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:07,340
I wouldn't have given them my child. Send Yeong Chan to us.

463
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:12,240
Sunjin's future owner can't be raised so haphazardly.

464
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:18,670
Also, open this.

465
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:22,070
Your livelihood must be tough.

466
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,080
It's not enough.

467
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,370
I said this is not enough.

468
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:38,720
Shin Da Hye.

469
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,470
Wait.

470
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,680
Unlike yourself, why are you getting all nervous?

471
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,540
Bring it back with her signature,

472
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:57,030
so she won't bring up death by overwork ever again.

473
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:05,460
Shin Da Hye. Shin Da Hye!

474
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:12,010
What? Do you still have something left to say?

475
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:16,280
What do you mean it's not enough? Are you thinking about settling for that money?

476
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,720
I don't need the money.

477
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,340
Why don't you need money?

478
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:25,480
"You're working yourself to death so you should be able to get paid for your life's worth."

479
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,160
 You neglect the family and put your life on the line for the company.

480
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,910
 Aren't you suppose to get paid your life's worth?

481
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:41,390
That's right. I do need money.

482
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:44,490
I have to repay a loan and have to increase my savings, but

483
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:48,050
I'm running out of money for living expenses and I have a child to raise.

484
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:52,090
I don't have a skill that is profitable, or a rich family.

485
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:56,880
Since we know that it wasn't a suicide, then I'm going to take the insurance money, compensation money,

486
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,580
and bereavement funds also. I want to take everything entitled to me, but

487
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:10,070
How can I? How can I trade that person's life for money?

488
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:19,250
Why? You don't think you are entitled to that money?

489
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:26,090
Is that what you believe? Other's are heartbroken but still accept the money.

490
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:28,980
That's the definition of family.

491
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:35,080
If you really loved your husband you wouldn't have this emotional reservation, right?

492
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:40,940
Don't worry. I'll pay back your debt even if I have to sell my house.

493
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:50,680

494
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:56,000
Exactly, how much were you going to give her to create such a mess?

495
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,410
How much is it? That damn compensation money?

496
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:05,640
An amount that Kim Yeong Soo would never earn during his whole life was what I was told.

497
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,520
So, in order to make Shin Dae Hye settle

498
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,270
how far is it? How trashy do you have to become?

499
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:13,610
If I was Kim Yeong Soo, I would have told her to take it.

500
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:16,750
- What?
- To take that money and live comfortably

501
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:19,340
instead of saying such crappy things.

502
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,280
 Transfer of Shares Contract

503
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:36,540
I could play my whole life with this amount of money.

504
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:41,990
Choose an agency. You gave me a precious grandchild.

505
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:43,770
As if I couldn't do such a thing for you.

506
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:46,080
However,

507
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:51,830
I don't want my son watching me eat and play the rest of my life.

508
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:58,300
I don't want to raise my son like his father was raised.

509
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:04,650
Obtaining something through effort is so precious.

510
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:11,080
How freedom is so divine.

511
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:19,990
How plain and ordinary things are vast.

512
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:24,040
I want him to know all these things.

513
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:28,970
Above all else, I'm going to raise him with complete love,

514
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:32,810
outside this palace.

515
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,990
What's going on?

516
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:50,070
I think I just did something totally stupid. I could have changed my life.

517
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:57,510
Can we talk for a moment?

518
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:01,560
Let's have some tea together.

519
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:10,330
The three of you, including Lee Hae Joon, have worked hard.

520
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:14,070
By now, Yoo Hyeok will deny that it was his voice.

521
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:18,380
It's hence up to us to state our position.

522
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:23,650
Hence, I've made preparations. Headlines.

523
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:27,620
 - "Groundless rumors. We are doing fine together." 
- Why, you...

524
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,440
You should have told me. I would have worn better makeup.

525
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,420
Furthermore, I'm much prettier from my right.

526
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:41,480
Consider the angle next time. I'm an actress, after all.

527
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:48,230
If you don't like these, what about this?

528
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,950
"Song Yi Yeon's gangster lover, Han Gi Tak."

529
00:48:55,950 --> 00:49:01,250
"He gave his life to first love Song Yi Yeon, but she betrayed him and married a chaebol."

530
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:06,330
"In order to take revenge, he orchestrated a fake scandal with Yoo Hyeok."

531
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:10,160
How is this? It sounds plausible.

532
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:16,180
It's plausible indeed. Let's do this.

533
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:18,530
- Stay out of this.
- Do this, Song Yi Yeon!

534
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:21,350
Your manager's smart.

535
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:27,910
Let's not take advantage of a dead man... If you call yourself human.

536
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:29,810
That's right...

537
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:38,750
He died because of Song Yi Yeon who ran to him when she was cornered.

538
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,680
Just like when you ran away from me ten years ago.

539
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:51,360
So, you had Yeung Chan's paternity tested?

540
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:55,660
How could you not recognize even your own child?

541
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:04,300
You're the one making a person go insane.

542
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:08,510
You made me a fool because of your guilt, and you take his side?

543
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:13,140
No. It's not that.

544
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:18,820
It's not because of that person. It's because of you.

545
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,810
It's because I don't like you.

546
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:30,930
Would you say it again?

547
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:35,510
You... I didn't like you.

548
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:41,220
I'm warning you.

549
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:45,860
Don't provoke me. You'll get hurt.

550
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:54,820
Those who are not loved, aren't they supposed to reflect on themselves first instead of getting mad?

551
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:59,620
The worse they are, the more they always blame others.

552
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:04,760
If it were me I'd be so embarrassed, I'd want to croak.

553
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,890
- What? 
- Hold your penis and repent.

554
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:11,720
Or put up a fight.

555
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:19,410
You. If you mess with Song Yi Yeon one more time...

556
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:22,030
You will die at my hands.

557
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:29,180
This photo?

558
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:35,420
Spread it,

559
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:40,030
if you want to announce to the whole world you're a loser.

560
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,510
You picked your manager well.

561
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:46,290
Come on. Let's go.

562
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:00,330
Don't be jealous of Han Gi Tak.

563
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:03,760
Someone who won't even let go of a bean that's within his grasp

564
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:08,850
could not comprehend someone who laid down his all.

565
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,360
Don't you think?

566
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:27,290
Song Yi Yeon... Song Yi Yeon!

567
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:36,270
You don't think that bastard will really spread them, do you?

568
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:41,400
He won't be able to. Don't worry. Just leave everything to me, even if does.

569
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:48,180
Whether you choose litigation or this consolation money, you should do as you wish.

570
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:52,440
I will support you no matter what you decide.

571
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:55,730
But if I were to be greedy,

572
00:52:55,730 --> 00:53:01,520
I hope you wouldn't live in the shadow of the deceased as you take the money coming in monthly.

573
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,220
Without having to worry about money, comfortably... and above all...

574
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:08,220
I wish you would live happily.

575
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:12,410
Ji Hoon...

576
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:18,480
It's been nine years since you called my name.

577
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:22,720
You said we didn't have a proper farewell.

578
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,280
You chose your ambitions

579
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:30,690
and you didn't respect me, so we broke up.

580
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:34,810
But at that time, Yeong Soo was there to comfort me.

581
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:41,600
So, throw away the mistaken idea that I'm living like this because of you, Ji Hoon.

582
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:46,400
This was my choice, because this is my life.

583
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:51,280
Goodbye.

584
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,360
At least once

585
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:16,100
you could have given me the chance—the chance to ask for forgiveness.

586
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,940
Can't you give me one more chance?

587
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:21,460
The chance to go back to you?

588
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:38,280
Wow, it's high!

589
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,590
We are going to live here from now on.

590
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:43,490
Where is this place?

591
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:45,900
Mom's friend's house?

592
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,840
But you don't have any friends.

593
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:50,510
I do!

594
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:53,920
In the past.

595
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:11,100
Why aren't you asking... what happened ten years ago?

596
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:15,190
You should have at least lived well.

597
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:18,110
I'm just getting punished, I guess.

598
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:24,330
Your brother... I killed him twice.

599
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:34,360
The wedding scandal burst and like a coward, I ran away.

600
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:40,220
What if I...

601
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:45,710
If I had chosen differently, what would have happened?

602
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:48,000
Abandon that thought!

603
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,550
We are still gangster-like gangsters!

604
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:55,150
Because he wanted to live by himself, he even abandoned his younger sibling.

605
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:00,090
Yeah...

606
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:03,070
It must have been harder for you.

607
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,900
Listen carefully, Song Yi Yeon.

608
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,280
If you want to raise Yeong Chan well by yourself,

609
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:14,340
shove those weak words and put on your sharp wits.

610
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:18,670
Those kinds of rascals! Show them that you can live a nice life!

611
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:19,900
Understand?

612
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:23,210
I'm prepared to do anything.

613
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,400
I'm a mother.

614
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:31,600
Manager. You are going to help this unni even if you hate me, right?

615
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,370
Don't ask me to call you Unni, or I will die in front of you!

616
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:39,750
Why are you like this? Help me.

617
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:45,440
♬  Even if ten years more pass   ♬

618
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:50,310
♬  I will love you. ♬

619
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,380
What am I doing here?

620
00:56:56,380 --> 00:57:02,090
  This field is normally like that. I did something useless, right?

621
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:06,940
Why must you work in this abnormal industry?

622
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:27,110
♬  Boys. Were going to wait outside.   ♬

623
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:31,670
If I wasn't an actress, what could I do?

624
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:35,390
You definitely should continue acting.

625
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:38,390
You should do it.

626
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:42,040
Alright! Oh, I'm startled!

627
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,950
Omo, why is she here?

628
00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:48,300
What is wrong with her?

629
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:50,600
You surprised me!

630
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,480
Why are you like this?

631
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:03,180
You have a debt you have to pay, right? What are you going to pay with?

632
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,770
I even have evidence of you screwing me.

633
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:08,970
Shall I teach you a lesson?

634
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:12,830
I learned only one thing from living with Cha Jae Gook.

635
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:17,740
You saw me associate with Yoo Hyeok and hit rock bottom, right?

636
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,130
Unni, are you gangsters?

637
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:24,860
Aigoo, why are you making the kid cry?

638
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:28,300
Smile, smile. There are many people watching.

639
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,700
What? Did I say something?

640
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:34,740
No, I just wanted you to put me in your schedule.

641
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:37,590
Even better, you hand it over to me completely.

642
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:41,770
But... Your clothes today are really pretty. You'll supply me with your clothes, right?

643
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:43,330
Why do I have to do that?

644
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:47,100
We are in the same agency.

645
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:48,930
You don't want to?

646
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:51,460
Should I just make it so you're in the state I am in?

647
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:54,000
Unni, you can't do it because no one is interested in you.

648
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:59,670
Hey! Would I do this if they were interested?

649
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:01,540
Hong Nan.

650
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,880
Smile! Smile.

651
00:59:08,790 --> 00:59:12,800
 Sunjin group proves employee's wrongful death. It wasn't suicide after receiving a bribe.

652
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:18,060
At these times, they are fast.

653
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:27,540
Are you in there? We came to look at the house!

654
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:28,910
 Rush sale.

655
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:31,910
This woman... Did she really put her house up for sale?

656
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:36,910
I'm sorry, but please come back another time.

657
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:39,360
We'll just take a look for a moment!

658
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:49,940
These people! This house isn't for sale! I'm the owner of this home!

659
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:51,190
Hurry and go!

660
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:55,840
I hate you, Mom! Don't sell the house!

661
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,690
Who says you can sell the house?

662
00:59:57,690 --> 01:00:02,660
What kind of house is this that she's selling this house?! Is this woman in her right mind, or not?!

663
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:04,590
But, this house is not going to be sold!

664
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:09,770
Father, Han Na, don't worry! I'll protect this house!

665
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:23,200
 Sunjin Mall, reveals wrongful death of an employee. It wasn't a suicide after accepting a bribe.

666
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,870
Mom!

667
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,730
You're home?

668
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:33,710
No, Father, that person... Why?

669
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:35,040
Why are you home so late?!

670
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,030
Excuse me! In a stranger's home, what are you—

671
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:40,180
With whose permission are you selling this house?!

672
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:43,320
Yeah! With whose permission are you selling this house?!

673
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,300
Han Na!

674
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,570
I don't like it. I'm not moving.

675
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:48,090
That's good, Han Na.

676
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:52,630
That's right, you don't have to sell the house.

677
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,830
No!

678
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:01,970
This ahjumma... Why are you so strong? I won't leave, I can't leave!

679
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:06,210
You said I'm a creditor. No matter what, I still own half the house, so I have a right!

680
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:08,240
Show me that promissory note!

681
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,900
No... Well my things did not come yet. I did send it by boat from America...

682
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:14,140
Get out this instant!

683
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:17,790
Why? You said you were lonely!

684
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:21,200
I'll make sure you are not lonely.

685
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,970
Live with me, huh?

686
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:27,720
Let's live together.

687
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:35,810

688
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:39,040
♬  You appear in my sweet dreams

689
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,100
♬   And I welcome you in my arms   ♬
Play, play!

690
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:41,940
  You can't say those kinds of things here.

691
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:44,390
  You're going to go around the department store in this condition?

692
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:48,650
 Actress Song! You are beautiful! Fighting!

693
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:52,160
 - Are all rich people rude punks?
- I'm sorry.
- Watch it.

694
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:56,300
 Are you going to cry after losing her to another man? Be a man!

695
01:01:56,300 --> 01:02:01,180
 I won't just wait for you to look at me anymore. I wouldn't have come then.
