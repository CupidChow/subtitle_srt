00:01:00,567 --> 00:01:01,707
Why are you here?

3
00:01:01,707 --> 00:01:06,127
What are you doing here, Branch Manager? I'm here for an errand.

4
00:01:06,127 --> 00:01:09,007
Do you know what kind of errand you're doing right now?

5
00:01:09,007 --> 00:01:12,697
What are you... Why are you here?!

6
00:01:15,287 --> 00:01:17,787
Looks like you don't know it.

7
00:01:23,207 --> 00:01:27,097
 Out of all the CCTVs on the roof, only one captured Sunbae Yeong Soo.

8
00:01:27,097 --> 00:01:29,617
 But when we checked it after the incident, it was already broken.

9
00:01:29,617 --> 00:01:34,917
 I personally checked it myself but there was nothing recorded. I couldn't recover any footage.

10
00:01:34,917 --> 00:01:37,327
 Please do it quickly.

11
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:42,467
 Come Back Data 
1654-2850

12
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:45,387
 While I was on the phone...

13
00:01:45,387 --> 00:01:46,447
 Sunjin Department Store

14
00:01:46,447 --> 00:01:52,127
 They completely destroyed it. Does someone have a grudge against you?

15
00:01:52,127 --> 00:01:56,747
 He's not the kind of person who accepts bribes. He would never do that!

16
00:01:56,747 --> 00:01:57,647
 Director Jeong Ji Hoon

17
00:01:57,647 --> 00:02:01,507
 Tell them the truth, please?

18
00:02:01,507 --> 00:02:04,457
 Just now, Kim Yeong Soo's wife came by.

19
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,747
 No, she doesn't know. I didn't say anything.

20
00:02:10,727 --> 00:02:17,427
 Thanks to Kim Yeong Soo, you can be with your mother right now.

21
00:02:17,427 --> 00:02:21,747
 If you understood me, just look for the envelope.

 To: Jung Kkot Nim

23
00:02:28,737 --> 00:02:32,167
I just thought there was someone who was always one step ahead of me.

24
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:37,457
Staying by my side and erasing all the evidence, it was you?

25
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,847
Even if it wasn't me, it would have been someone else.

26
00:02:39,847 --> 00:02:41,167
It's not like it's someone else. How could you—

27
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:45,237
Why does it matter to you whether or not Manager Kim committed suicide?

28
00:02:45,237 --> 00:02:49,717
How could you... I didn't know you could be such trash!

29
00:02:49,717 --> 00:02:56,277
Trash? Aren't you and President Cha the same in using a dead person?

30
00:03:01,127 --> 00:03:05,957
You said that Kim Yeong Soo didn't commit suicide. You said that you'd believe in him!

31
00:03:05,957 --> 00:03:07,527
Was it all a lie?

32
00:03:07,527 --> 00:03:11,837
When did I say I would believe in him? I only told the truth.

33
00:03:11,837 --> 00:03:14,167
You jerk!

34
00:03:16,107 --> 00:03:22,527
Jeong Ji Hoon! You can't be like this. After doing this, how are you going to face Da Hye and Han Na?

35
00:03:22,527 --> 00:03:26,927
After doing this, how can you smile in front of that family? Are you even human?

36
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:31,537
Anyway, Kim Yeong Soo! He was a stain in Shin Da Hye's life.

37
00:03:32,767 --> 00:03:35,807
Do you know what he did wrong?

38
00:03:36,587 --> 00:03:41,967
He left Da Hye and died. Whether it was suicide or not.

46
00:04:27,637 --> 00:04:34,297
I told them that there wasn't a kid like that but the reporters would hound the children and ask.

47
00:04:34,297 --> 00:04:36,667
I'm sorry, Teacher.

48
00:04:37,787 --> 00:04:42,057
If the other parents find out who Yeong Chan's Mom is,

49
00:04:42,057 --> 00:04:44,647
I think it will be difficult for Yeong Chan.
 ~Episode 7~

50
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:48,217
Don't take pictures, please. Don't take them !

51
00:05:01,947 --> 00:05:05,117
Hurry and take the picture. Hurry!

52
00:05:05,117 --> 00:05:08,847
What? Do you want a certain pose? What should I give you?

53
00:05:08,847 --> 00:05:10,787
You're treating us like trash.

54
00:05:10,787 --> 00:05:15,297
The reason we're taking pictures is for the people that loved you all this time.

55
00:05:15,297 --> 00:05:17,607
They want to hear some type of explanation.

56
00:05:17,607 --> 00:05:22,387
Year and year again, if I explained myself, would they believe me?

57
00:05:22,387 --> 00:05:25,767
You can write whatever you want about me.

58
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:29,967
But please don't mess with my son.

59
00:05:30,787 --> 00:05:35,987
I'm asking this of you.

60
00:05:42,247 --> 00:05:44,187
Where do you want to go?

61
00:05:52,707 --> 00:05:55,347
I'll bring Yeong Chan.

62
00:06:11,107 --> 00:06:14,527
My son, I have to go to work.

63
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,347
Dad!

64
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:34,737
I have to tell your mom something, so go in with this Ahjumma.

65
00:06:39,077 --> 00:06:41,947
Lightning power!

66
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:56,547
I heard Yeong Chan's kindergarten was hounded by photographers.

67
00:06:58,647 --> 00:07:00,847
That's why I told you to send him to a private school.

68
00:07:00,847 --> 00:07:04,427
Creating problems for other people is another issue of yours.

69
00:07:04,427 --> 00:07:10,307
If you hadn't done something like that, I wouldn't have had to trouble others, don't you think?

70
00:07:10,307 --> 00:07:14,437
Do you think I planned that during the production announcement, in such a petty way?

71
00:07:14,437 --> 00:07:20,607
So you know it. People like... Wang Joo Yeon?

72
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,187
She matches you well anyway.

73
00:07:27,727 --> 00:07:29,607
Let go!

74
00:07:35,587 --> 00:07:39,577
In that case, what kind of childish plans do you have with Lee Hae Joon?

75
00:07:39,577 --> 00:07:40,567
Lee Hae Joon?

76
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:43,627
Miss Song Yi Yeon, get your head straight. Are you avoiding people's eyes because you're embarrassed?

77
00:07:43,627 --> 00:07:46,927
Can you not see straight anymore because you were so humiliated?!

78
00:07:46,927 --> 00:07:48,847
Move.

79
00:07:49,547 --> 00:07:57,067
Think about it. Why do you think I'm letting you insult me?

80
00:07:57,067 --> 00:08:00,727
Why? For what reason?

81
00:08:03,607 --> 00:08:08,887
You'll see soon.

82
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:11,747
I won't let go of you until the very end.

83
00:08:30,827 --> 00:08:32,067

84
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:34,107

00:16:10,497 --> 00:16:15,587
 I'm sorry, Right now, I'm searching everywhere she could have gone.

158
00:16:15,587 --> 00:16:19,007
Alright. Report back to me about everything.

159
00:16:36,017 --> 00:16:39,387
Gosh, it's not working again. Aish.

160
00:16:55,627 --> 00:16:59,407
Wow, now there's the smell of perfume?

161
00:16:59,407 --> 00:17:04,267
Are you now going to live here and make it into a hideout?

162
00:17:04,267 --> 00:17:06,917
Okay, come out.

163
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:10,387
L-Let me see your face!

164
00:17:10,387 --> 00:17:16,787
Come out. You didn't know that I was in the Special Forces that catches ghosts, right?

165
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:19,717
Come out. Come out!

166
00:17:37,847 --> 00:17:41,487
Who is this?!

167
00:17:41,487 --> 00:17:43,267
It's me.

168
00:17:57,317 --> 00:18:01,147
We're going to have to call someone. I think it's broken.

169
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:12,477
When did you get here?

170
00:18:21,197 --> 00:18:25,997
The place you escaped to was here? You must have had nowhere else to go, huh?

171
00:18:28,497 --> 00:18:37,177
I'm sorry. I'll try hard to reduce the number of rumors.

172
00:18:39,987 --> 00:18:43,307
Because of my conscience...

173
00:18:43,307 --> 00:18:45,497
Watch your mouth.

174
00:18:48,787 --> 00:18:53,397
Where's that manager of yours who follows you around?

175
00:18:53,397 --> 00:18:55,537
Hong Nan? Why?

176
00:18:55,537 --> 00:18:59,427
She's got a huge ambition.

177
00:18:59,427 --> 00:19:04,117
I don't think she's the type to go around doing your errands.

192
00:20:08,377 --> 00:20:13,967
It could be that I went into the body of a spectacular woman to seduce Yoo Hyeok.

193
00:20:13,967 --> 00:20:15,437
Don't you think so?

194
00:20:15,437 --> 00:20:20,047
Seeing as how my ear is wet, it seems like it was caught on something important.

195
00:20:20,047 --> 00:20:22,217
Sorry.

196
00:20:32,617 --> 00:20:40,137
I get the feeling that those two are going to cause a big problem.

197
00:20:40,137 --> 00:20:42,767
This is why I don't like the one's with many grudges.

198
00:20:47,337 --> 00:20:49,117
What to do?

199
00:20:51,757 --> 00:20:53,227
What is this?

200
00:20:58,647 --> 00:21:05,707

201
00:21:15,597 --> 00:21:18,907
Here. Angle. The flower and the chairs... Angle.

202
00:21:18,907 --> 00:21:22,007
Even the water bottles. They are all showing different perspective.

203
00:21:22,007 --> 00:21:26,137
Focus. Get the angles right! Angles! Angles!

204
00:21:27,457 --> 00:21:31,887
Director Jung. How dare you catch up to me?

205
00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:38,717
Until when will you bathe in your victory? I will wait until the day he falls from his seat.

206
00:21:38,717 --> 00:21:41,927
Omo, omo, what to do? Are you okay?

207
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:43,847
- What's with her?
- I'm fine.

208
00:21:43,847 --> 00:21:47,637
I am very very okay.

209
00:21:47,637 --> 00:21:50,987
That ahjumma is just blatantly being close. What the heck?

210
00:21:50,987 --> 00:21:55,257
I didn't see Shin Da Hye like that but she is openly choosing her side.

211
00:21:55,257 --> 00:21:59,107
Staff. Help me.

212
00:21:59,107 --> 00:22:03,057
Department Head, what happened?

213
00:22:03,057 --> 00:22:05,517
Da Hye, I'll explain everything...

214
00:22:05,517 --> 00:22:09,047
Department Head Baek didn't do this to you, did he?

215
00:22:09,047 --> 00:22:10,327
What?

216
00:22:10,327 --> 00:22:12,547
Your face...

217
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:18,597
What a punk! Should I use my fists on him?

218
00:22:18,597 --> 00:22:22,467
No. What's important right now is that we get the fashion show underway.

219
00:22:26,737 --> 00:22:30,207
No, I got hurt exercising.

220
00:22:30,207 --> 00:22:31,987
Did you meet with Department Head Baek?

221
00:22:31,987 --> 00:22:35,477
What was in that envelope turned out to be a gift card

222
00:22:35,477 --> 00:22:38,677
- for Department Head Baek Mother's 80th birthday...
- That can't be.

223
00:22:38,677 --> 00:22:41,467
They could have exchanged the cash for a check and sent...
- Da Hye—

224
00:22:41,467 --> 00:22:44,677
If he received the same package, he could have exchanged it.

225
00:22:44,677 --> 00:22:48,797
Please! What do I have to do for you to believe me?

226
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:55,147
I had a feeling this would happen, which is why I told you that we should stop.

227
00:23:05,147 --> 00:23:08,257
 2016 Spring/Summer Luxury Collaboration Fashion Show

228
00:23:08,257 --> 00:23:09,457
  Collaboration Fashion Show

229
00:23:09,457 --> 00:23:14,357
Come out, great. Good, from the back.

230
00:23:14,357 --> 00:23:17,617
Stick together. Get closer. Good.

231
00:23:17,617 --> 00:23:21,417
Yoo Hyeok, always excellent.

232
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:26,157
Yoo Hyeok, OK! Nice.

233
00:23:26,157 --> 00:23:28,017
Omo.

234
00:23:28,017 --> 00:23:30,917
That's right. That looks good.

235
00:23:59,977 --> 00:24:01,967
Miss?

236
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:07,027
My body is moving on its own.

237
00:24:07,027 --> 00:24:10,207
- Oh!
- What the heck?

238
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:16,447
Oh my. You fell onto me...

239
00:24:16,447 --> 00:24:19,377
Oh my! Attention, attention!

240
00:24:19,377 --> 00:24:22,377
What's wrong with you guys? You're pros! What's wrong with you?

241
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:26,337
- Put some strength into your legs! Why are you falling?
- So noisy.

242
00:24:26,337 --> 00:24:29,057
Omo, omo. What is this?

243
00:24:29,057 --> 00:24:33,127
Omo. Why am I so itchy?

244
00:24:33,827 --> 00:24:36,927
 What is going on?

245
00:24:36,927 --> 00:24:39,307
Get your act together!

246
00:25:23,727 --> 00:25:27,617
Good, good!

247
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:47,287
Go.

248
00:25:47,287 --> 00:25:51,217
Alright, store manager. Go.

249
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:53,857
Go.

250
00:25:55,547 --> 00:25:59,087
He came out well, what's with him? Is he nervous?

251
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,987
Honey.

252
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:04,067
Honey, are you alright? What's wrong?

253
00:27:04,067 --> 00:27:06,347
It wasn't a bird.

254
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:09,397
It was a camera.

255
00:27:12,057 --> 00:27:14,777
It was a helicam that was filming the fireworks.

256
00:27:14,777 --> 00:27:16,207
Then...

257
00:27:16,207 --> 00:27:18,857
It could have caught me on film.

258
00:27:24,027 --> 00:27:27,087
Sir, are you alright?

259
00:27:37,997 --> 00:27:41,427
Something as dangerous as this.

260
00:27:42,877 --> 00:27:45,217
What is this feather?

261
00:28:01,397 --> 00:28:04,177
What are you going to do?

262
00:28:08,817 --> 00:28:12,047
  January 25th. Fireworks.

263
00:28:13,477 --> 00:28:15,757
 Seoul International Fireworks Festival.

264
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:23,767
 January 25th, 2016. Flowers bloomed in the night sky!

265
00:28:23,767 --> 00:28:26,097
 Celebrate the 2016 Seoul International Fireworks Festival with SBC.

266
00:28:26,097 --> 00:28:29,697
My last moments could be on there.

267
00:28:29,697 --> 00:28:34,217
Right. I do have some power with broadcasting.

268
00:28:34,217 --> 00:28:37,527
Why are you standing there so stupidly? Run to the broadcasting station.

269
00:28:37,527 --> 00:28:39,477
Will you be alright on your own?

270
00:28:39,477 --> 00:28:41,757
Are you worrying about me now?

271
00:28:57,817 --> 00:29:02,367
That girl at the fashion show today with Lee Hae Joon store manager...

272
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:04,917
She's Song Yi Yeon's manager.

273
00:29:06,267 --> 00:29:08,497
That's old news.

274
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:10,927
I have not reported to the Chairman just yet.

275
00:29:10,927 --> 00:29:14,917
- Why is that? 
 - It can be called schedule filtering.

276
00:29:14,917 --> 00:29:18,047
Especially in your case.

277
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:21,177
He put out a toy without getting permission from his father.

278
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:26,747
It's only a matter of time the Chairman finds out that Sunjin Department Store is on the market, isn't it?

279
00:29:26,747 --> 00:29:32,197
That statement sounds like you, Assistant Wang, knowing that the company owner will change.

280
00:29:32,197 --> 00:29:35,987
Yes. The owner will probably change.

281
00:29:35,987 --> 00:29:39,487
- Whoever it is.
- Whoever it is?

282
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:43,287
A wild dog and a domestic dog.

283
00:29:43,287 --> 00:29:46,077
I want to see those two dogs fight with all their might.

284
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:51,567
You're bragging too much. Do you think I'm listening to you because I want to?

285
00:29:51,567 --> 00:29:55,187
That side is doing an event to save this department store.

286
00:29:55,187 --> 00:29:59,237
I'm curious to know what your event will be.

287
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:15,557
Oh my, look at this.

288
00:30:15,557 --> 00:30:19,707
 It doesn't seem like she's the type of person to follow you around and do things for you.

289
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:26,517
 How do I capture a man's heart?

290
00:30:36,297 --> 00:30:38,917
I've brought the items you've asked for.

291
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:41,297
Where is Hong Nan right now?

292
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,460
Yes, I listen to it a lot.

293
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,100
You already know.

294
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,730
Is that what looks cool?

295
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,440
What are you all doing tomorrow?

296
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,080
- Never mind that. Let's go for a beer or two.
- Sounds good.

297
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:11,510
Oops, sorry. Because it was so firm,

298
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,420
I thought it was this.

299
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,800
Impact smile?

300
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,470
It's my first time seeing you.

301
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:26,810
 I knew it. Guys are so weak when it come to touching.

302
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:32,100
Look at me under the bright lights, thoroughly.

303
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,350
Please get out. Get out. Hurry, hurry.

304
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,550
Hurry! Hurry, hurry!

305
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,970
We've met, haven't we?

306
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:57,290
Huh? Uh, I'm not sure.

307
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,930
 Excuse me! I think our phones got switched.

308
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,850
 Oops, sorry.

309
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:11,510
I heard the second time means it's fate.

310
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:14,500
Well, it could be our third time.

311
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,420
 Please spare me.

312
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,440
Did we meet in our past lives?

313
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,250
It's similar.

314
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:26,540
Then, is it a fate for us?

315
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:33,810
Shall we find out after the show whether it is or isn't fate?

316
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,700
Should we?

317
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:46,300
Yoo Hyeok, we'll start your makeup.

318
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,310
- See you later.
- Okay.

319
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,900
You're dead, bastard.

320
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:08,130

321
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:13,890
What brings you here?

322
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:17,830
Why? Have I come to a place where I shouldn't be?

323
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:23,810
Because it's the Sunjin Group's fashion show? Because it's the Sunjin Group's son who is also modeling?

324
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:27,850
Or what? Because Yoo Hyeok is the main model?

325
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:31,450
You know a lot.

326
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,450
What are you doing here?

327
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:36,750
You kiss my ex-husband's younger brother.

328
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,780
You seduce a man I supposedly had an affair with.

329
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:43,710
What's next? My ex-husband Cha Jae Gook?

330
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:49,710
Yeah, the target from the beginning was Cha Jae Gook.

331
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,900
Are you for real?

332
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:57,680
If I don't do at least this much, Han Gi Tak can't rest in peace.

333
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,820
Right now, are you...

334
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,800
getting revenge on me for Han Gi Tak?

335
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:14,070
Because of me, your brother died. I killed Han Gi Tak. Is that it?

336
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,200
What did I do so wrong to Han Gi Tak?

337
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,720
Why did that person die because of me? Did I tell him to die?

338
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,180
I've been looking for you.

339
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:38,790
Hong Nan, I'll be doing your make-up.

340
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:47,370
If you're going to interfere, can you leave? This is an important show to me.

341
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:10,140
So you are Sunjin Department Store's branch manager, Lee Hae Joon?

342
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,910
Yes. Did I do something wrong?

343
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,320
 Personal Information: Lee Jae Hoon

344
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,690
No, it's because it's rare that a big business executive comes here in person.

345
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,080
You heard from Song Yi Yeon's manager, right?

346
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:27,200
Yes, but I didn't say that I'd do an interview.

347
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,540
For now, I'd like to see the items that that person requested.

348
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:39,970
Find the scene that shows Sunjin department store's rooftop.

349
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:51,510
Whether it's you or Song Yi Yeon, you must do an interview on  Forsaken by the Conglomerate,  okay?

350
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:54,370
I'll follow you to the end.

351
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,810
Is this all that was filmed with the helicam?

352
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,460
I see that you got lot more popular, Yoo Hyeok.

353
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:20,500
Secretary Go is not the type to be ignored anywhere.

354
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,570
You say you must do the fashion show.

355
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,400
What do you mean ignore?

356
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,120
I was just asking for a bonus but he treated me like a beggar.

357
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:36,560
I also have to make a living, and there is nothing wrong with being diligent in trying to make a living.

358
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:51,470
For now, end the show nicely.

359
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,890
I'll give you my reply after the show ends.

360
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,460
Yes.

361
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,620
Lee Hae Joon ran off in the middle of the fashion show rehearsal.

362
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,190
Ran off?

363
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,530
What should I do about Yoo Hyeok?

364
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:21,750
Catch him after the show ends. He wants a bonus so I'll think of something.

365
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,820
Oh, Sister. Big news.

366
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:47,260
Yoo Hyeok looks like he's going to get cut off.

367
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:54,740
Come on. Would you take this thing off? It's hurting my pride.

368
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:58,160
Pink? Pink?

369
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,820
Coral Pink.

370
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,360
How many times do I have to tell you that it's coral pink!

371
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,600
Pink? Pink? Ugh.

372
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,150
You're so crude. Crude.

373
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:11,490
Hey! Is that Branch Manager still not back?

374
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,650
No, not yet.

375
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:16,370
I take the time to teach him but he runs off?

376
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:19,000
Oh, my pores are getting clogged.

377
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,910
If your pores are getting clogged, just unclog them.

378
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:24,100
So, what I'm saying is...

379
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,340
Oh, oh.

380
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:31,530
Oh my, the President?

381
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:34,170
President Cha!

382
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,220
President!

383
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:43,320
He is the fashion show designer Julian Hong.

384
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:47,560
I am the world famous Julian Hong.

385
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:51,460
Oh my! You're so tall!

386
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:56,090
Oh this fashion sense! This body line!

387
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:59,230
Aren't you a bit selfish?

388
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:03,960
Well, I didn't become like this because I wanted to.

389
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:12,150
Oh, you're even funny.

390
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,650
Coral pink!

391
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:16,890
Oh my! The concept this time is coral pink!

392
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:19,990
Would you like to go on the runway?

393
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,790
Model.

394
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,740
 Sunjin Fashion Show

395
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,590
She said she came to take revenge.

396
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,620
No matter how many times I prod her, she won't open her mouth.

397
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:12,100
Watch her closely. She might cause a problem.

398
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:16,660
Make sure that she doesn't get hurt.

399
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:20,650
No matter what.

400
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,050
Oh.

401
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:52,210
Why did that bastard come?

402
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:59,470

403
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,700
Oh, hey!

404
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,800
Ah! Oh my!

405
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:09,330
What should I do? I don't know.

406
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:17,500
You're so cute. Isn't there anything else?

407
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:22,630
 That's right. Laugh a lot while you can, baby.

408
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:30,170
Why is that bastard here again?

409
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:32,240
Ding Dong!

410
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:39,420
Chairman Cha sent an answer and the answer is,

411
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,790
"It's me, you bastard."

412
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,480
This little...!

413
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,950
Capture him.

414
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:00,030
- Hurry!
- Hey!

415
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:03,120
You little!

416
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,840
Aish, their blinkers.

417
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:44,980
Drive faster! I'm dead if I'm caught by that guy.

418
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:47,110
I guess you must have gotten a beating from him in the past.

419
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:52,200
Don't you know about that famous Yoo Hyeok violence case? That damn gangster.

420
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,960
 As I thought. It was your doing, Na Seok Cheol.

421
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:07,500
Stop. Stop! Right there. There!

422
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,910
There's a person! A person.

423
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:11,820
Right?

424
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:17,370
That's it! This is it!

425
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:19,150
This is it!

426
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,130
Cha Jae Gook.

427
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:28,470
You're a dead man now.

428
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:41,110
What are you doing? Why did you stop?

429
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:44,610
Wait! Wait!

430
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:46,710
 I don't want to.

431
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:50,930
- Get out.
- Let go of me!

432
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:55,420
Let go! Ow!

433
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:09,620
I have an important meeting today, so I'll be leaving first.

434
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,460
I'll do it, Department Head.

435
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,220
I'm sorry.

436
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:33,200
Not at all. I'm sorry for not thinking from your perspective and only thinking about myself.

437
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,010
I'm sorry.

438
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:43,340
I've wanted to say these words for nine years now.

439
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:47,430
But I didn't have an opportunity to say it because if you think about it,

440
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:51,590
we didn't get to break up properly.

441
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:56,130
Let's start over.

442
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,330
I've always wanted to say those words, too.

443
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,610
- I'll be leaving first.
- If Sunbaenim hadn't passed away,

444
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:13,460
I never would have said these words.

445
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,370
Then, I'll just pretend I didn't hear them.

446
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:24,630
No. You have to listen because I won't say it again.

447
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:30,290
Let go of that hand.

448
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:42,820
This rude wrist of yours, I guess I'll have to take care of it for good.

449
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:51,780
Shin Da Hye. I promised you something, didn't I?

450
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,940
About why your husband died that way.

451
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,760
That I would reveal the truth.

452
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:03,760
Stop now. Why are you always riling her up when she is having a difficult time to begin with?

453
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:06,190
Why?

454
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:08,990
Are you afraid of what I brought?

455
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,010
How could I be?

456
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:16,240
If you discovered everything, you would have been very happy.

457
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:23,310
Come with me or continue your conversation with Jeong Ji Hoon.

458
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,100
I'll go with you.

459
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:36,050
You stay here with joy.

460
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:09,220
I just want to talk so why are you trying to run away?

461
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:14,300
Do you think you'll be safe after doing this to me? I am Yoo Hyeok!

462
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:19,950
I know you very well. You sold out Song Yi Yeon and became a star.

463
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:27,280
Na Seok Cheul! Why don't you be like a man and untie this so we can fight?

464
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,060
Y-Yeah!

465
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:33,010
I even pretended to be Song Yi Yeon's lover, with my face that is worth more than my life, so

466
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:34,990
you can't do this to me!

467
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:38,360
You repay my grace this way?

468
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:44,720
I listened your words so well that they moved me,

469
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,590
so die now.

470
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:48,340
Take care of them.

471
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:53,300
Take care of what?

472
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,300
Let go!

473
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:59,080
Save me! Save me!

474
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,150
Seung Jae.

475
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,700
You there! Save us!

476
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:07,520
Hyungnim, my younger sibling is immature.

477
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,620
Please forgive her.

478
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:16,780
Seung Jae!

479
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:45,130
You didn't say one word on the way here.

480
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:48,670
What exactly happened?

481
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:53,710
I want to tell you right away but I'm holding back.

482
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:55,400
Pardon?

483
00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:00,580
There's more that I need to prepare for you. Please wait a little longer.

484
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:06,840
Until then, don't believe what anyone says except me.

485
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,060
Do you understand?

486
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,540
But why this far?

487
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:17,720
Just.. I wanted to walk with you...

488
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,360
 Department Head Jeong Ji Hoon

489
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:43,140
Then, go on in.

490
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:39,480
Hey, bastard!

491
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:43,970
Wait! Please call Chairman Cha.

492
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:48,430
I did wrong. Please call Chairman Cha.

493
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:59,010
I won't do it again. I'll live quietly like I promised.

494
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:07,560
Hey, you! Why are you beating anyone up? You don't even know anything.

495
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:12,720
Hey, don't give that bastard his pay. That bastard.

496
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,970
Yes.

497
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:20,390
Ah, these peons, coming here to make an action scene?

498
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:24,670
♬   Trumpet, woo  ♬

499
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:32,090
♬  Work mate  ♬

500
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:38,120
♬   Alright alright aye aye aye  ♬

501
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:45,180
♬   Oh ohohohoh   ♬

502
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,660
Go, go, go.

503
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:51,680
Send me your bank account numbers. I'll pay you. None for you though!

504
00:52:56,670 --> 00:53:03,360
The next is the survey results for the fashion show, based on the people who were featured in the show.

505
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:06,140
Is Branch Manager Lee Hae Joon not here yet?

506
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:09,480
No. Since he ran off yesterday, he is nowhere to be seen.

507
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,610
Still. Goodness.

508
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:49,150
For people who don't do work, what are you guys doing here?

509
00:53:55,690 --> 00:54:00,220
Are you thinking about who you'll frame again?

510
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:05,050
Branch Manager Lee Hae Joon. What do you think you're doing?

511
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:09,990
What's this smell? From where,

512
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:13,770
is this rotten smell coming?

513
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:16,850
What will change by spitting out the crap you've been eating?

514
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:19,190
You probably threatened him that way, right?

515
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:24,850
So that you could make your employee into a criminal by giving him a small portion of the bribe that you received.

516
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:28,980
Who was the one that got Lucia into the department store?

517
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:31,980
What are you trying to say?

518
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:38,310
Also, isn't the golf course locker room a bit boring now?

519
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:41,730
I'm sure you're using #43 well?

520
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:47,610
Now then, you and you.

521
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:52,350
All of you racoons!

522
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:57,480
I see that this is all a bribery field!

523
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,950
You people...

524
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:08,150
You people who murdered this man made it seem like suicide!

525
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:15,870
What is that man doing over there?

526
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:20,570
That man who couldn't even keep his promise to be with his wife on their wedding anniversary

527
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:24,090
was fixing the sales banner there.

528
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:27,340
Placing himself in a dangerous spot

529
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:31,900
and flinging his life away at the order of his company!

530
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:42,970
Thank you, Ma'am. Please come again.

531
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:44,620
Yes.

532
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:50,150
Da Hye. Branch Manager Lee Hae Joon has summoned you to the conference room.

533
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:51,900
Me?

534
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,960
Welcome, Shin Da Hye.

535
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,840
As you can see here, your husband did not commit suicide.

536
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:27,510
That night, while trying to get hold of the banner, he lost consciousness and fell.

537
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,230
The real reason for his death

538
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:35,690
is being worked to death. This is the truth.

539
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:47,880
We must restore his honor, apologize and compensate his family!

540
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:51,010
Apologize to that person immediately!

541
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,660
Stop right there!

542
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:07,960
What was the worth of the benefits from manipulating the truth?

543
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:13,970
To the child who lost her father, and the tears of the family, how much was it worth?

544
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:18,330
Is it valuable enough to ignore one's conscience?

545
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:24,360
What would be the best course of action for this crappy department store?

546
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,820
If I were Kim Yeong Soo,

547
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:32,390
my anger wouldn't subside even if I chewed you up. What should I do?

548
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:37,810
Should I let the whole world know so you guys can be censured?

549
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:46,300
What are you going to do?

550
00:57:56,350 --> 00:58:00,680
Branch Manager Lee, let's not make this a big deal.

551
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:06,980
I will look at compensation for the family very carefully.

552
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,520
Wait a minute.

553
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:37,420
What you prepared for me was this?

554
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:41,770
- Han Na's Mom!
- Don't say my daughter's name.

555
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:44,420
What are you doing right now?

556
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:48,050
Are the rumors true that you're using Han Na's dad in your struggle for power?

557
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:49,310
It can't be that!

558
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:52,550
If it's not, then how could you do this to me again?

559
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:58,980
Aren't you happy? It wasn't suicide.

560
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:04,310
Do I have to be happy?

561
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:10,870
Is this any better than suicide?

562
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:21,180

563
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:29,380
 Epilogue

564
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:34,080
It's not that I meant to do that.

565
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:39,110
I only gave a small tip

566
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:44,280
because I wanted to help them come back soon. What do you mean, excess?

567
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,460
I'll take it back.

568
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:58,230
How am I that I have to raise my arms like this?

569
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:07,230
You really don't remember?

570
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:11,060
Are you telling me I really flew that airplane?

571
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,650
Let's each find our own food separately.

572
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:25,140
Okay. This is seaweed and conch.

573
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,150
Put it down. Put it down!

574
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:35,730
- It tastes good.
- Put it down!

575
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:46,120
♬  I love you. You also know how I feel. ♬

576
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,320
 I'll protect this house!

577
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:49,230
 - I'm not moving.
- Good job, my Han Na.

578
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,870
 - Should I seduce him?
- Isn't that revenge?

579
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:53,290
 I'm going to destroy you. That's revenge—

580
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:54,390
 It's not!

581
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:57,080
 Han Gi Tak. He died because of Song Yi Yeon.

582
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,050
 It was because of you.

583
01:00:58,050 --> 01:01:00,070
 Don't irritate me, you'll get hurt.

584
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:02,980
 If you mess with Song Yi Yeon, you'll die by my hands.

585
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:04,750
 - All you have to do is sign there.
- Don't sign it.

586
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:06,560
 It's not enough. This much isn't enough.

587
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:10,420
 If I were you, I would have told her to accept it. Accept that money and please live in ease.

588
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:13,890
 You said you were lonely! I'll make it crowded here and keep you from being lonely!

589
01:01:13,890 --> 01:01:15,850
 Let's live together.
