1
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:18,570

2
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,720
Hi there, pretty!

3
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,400
Na Seok Cheol !

4
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,000
What did you do to Han Hong Nan?!

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,140
What are you saying?

6
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,780
Talk with your hands off.

7
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,220
Where is Hong Nan!?

8
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,440
Why are you asking me about that woman?!

9
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,360
So you really didn't do it?

10
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,760
What do I have to do with this crazy woman?

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,200
What the heck is wrong with him?

12
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,590
- Try to find out what's going on.
 - Yes.

13
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,700
Choi Seong Jae, it's Lee Hae Joon.

14
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,180
What happened?

15
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,620
Hong Nan suddenly disappeared,  Do you have any idea where she might be?

16
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,340
Na Seok Cheol... I know where she is.

17
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,080
Where is the place?

18
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:51,180
Hey, pretty one. Revenge against Song Yi Yeon? What a joke.

19
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,860
You dove into the Han River while screaming Song Yi Yeon.

20
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:03,060
If someone were to see they'd think you were Han Gi Tak. How is it that your actions are so stupidly similar to him.

21
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,400
What do you want?

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,080
What I want? It's simple.

23
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:23,080
Ta-dah! How is it? You hid the key to the account here, right?

24
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,680
Hide what? What are you saying?

25
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,980
What do you mean? Your secret account.

26
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,720
Your brother's secret Swiss bank account key.

27
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,920
Where is she?

28
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,480
There sure are a lot of angry customers today.

29
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,340
Where is Hong Nan?

30
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,780
Are they all crazy?

31
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,740
What did you do to Hong Nan?

32
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,960
There's no one but you who would torment her!

33
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:57,260
Are you being like this because she's Han Gi Tak's little sister?

34
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:02,210
Try touching even a hair on Hong Nan.

35
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:07,290
I won't leave you alone if you do.

36
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:14,400
And if you don't let that pass?

37
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,480
What do you think I'll do? Huh?

38
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,520
Should I just... cancel the contract?

39
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:30,870
What do I have to do for you to leave her alone?

40
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,150
Should I get on my knees?

41
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,170
Would you stop that!

42
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,180
Na Seok Cheol kidnapped Han Hong Nan.

43
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,220
Na Seok Cheol...

44
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,250
Catch that bastard.

45
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:06,530
The way I see it, it looks like you fooled me and used me.

46
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:12,650
What you're talking about? I don't understand. Taking a picture of my sibling is somehow wrong?

47
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:18,850
I still haven't found the money. I'll have to ask eldest Hyungnim.

48
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:24,190
What can we do? Our elder Hyugnim fell asleep again.

49
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,130
Forever. Straight up.

50
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,570
There's no way...

51
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,670
Big Hyungnim...

52
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:41,210
 Find it before Seok Cheol does.

53
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:47,050
 The only thing I can do for your older brother...

54
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,370
 This is my last present.

55
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,610
Na Seok Cheol! Just what the hell did you do?

56
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:59,490
Hey, pretty one. If you keep doing this, you'll end up tangled with me for the rest of your life.

57
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,050
I won't kill you and I won't spare you.

58
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,750
I said so, right? Once I bite, I'll never let go.

59
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,670
What the hell?

60
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,370
Oh, Choi Seong Jae!

61
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,230
Na Seok Cheol!

62
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,610
Choi Seong Jae, did you come on a white horse?

63
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,870
Let her go.

64
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:51,690
What to do? I can't let the princess go.

65
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:55,830
This crazy bastard. What are you doing, you bastards!

66
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,270
Seong Jae!

67
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,650
Stay still.

68
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,470
Catch her!

69
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,590
Catch her!

70
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,890
Damn, the bone is broken!

71
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:59,670
Yi Yeon, it's me.

72
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,910
Is there still no news?

73
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:09,330
I wouldn't worry. For sure,

74
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:15,110
she'll return making a lot of ruckus.

75
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,950
Stay out of this.

76
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:39,670
Why? I'm just warming up.

77
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,490
Let's go!

78
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,250
You're pretty good!

79
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,030
Go.

80
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,550
Who is that guy?

81
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,490
Are you okay?

82
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,670
What happened?

83
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:41,170
I'm Lee Hae Joon. I called on Han Gi Tak's guys.

84
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:45,030
What? Is it so hard to call up the guys when our sister is missing?

85
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:50,350
Isn't that bastard the branch manager of Sunjin Department Store?

86
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:53,630
Is that him? The Na Seok Cheol you told me about?

87
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,470
I'll catch that bastard.

88
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,150
You can't even fight, what can you do?

89
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,370
Aren't you going to tell me what happened?

90
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:35,390
Na Seok Cheol... My old friend.

91
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:41,350
To say that it's not correct because he thinks of me as his enemy.

92
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:47,590
The day Big Hyungnim quit the organization, he took care of me more than him.

93
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,570
Because of that, to Na Seok Cheol, it became a poison to him.

94
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:54,630
Because he couldn't trust Na Seok Cheol, Big Hyungnim entrusted his money to me.

95
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:59,040
You did all this to find the money? Where is the money?

96
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,850
A safe place.

97
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,130
 It's the secret Swiss bank account code under Han Gi Tak's name.

98
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:21,430
You need the passcode to withdraw the money.

99
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:27,730
Since Han Gi Tak died, only the surviving family member can find it.

100
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,650
If you're talking about the surviving family member...

101
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,800
Da Hye!?

102
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,810
Then you have to tell her about the existence of her brother.

103
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:40,090
If Na Seok Cheol were to learn that Dae Hye is my real sister...

104
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,650
He can't!

105
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:45,730
I'd better not see her for a while

106
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,700
because I can not let her get hurt.

107
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,510
Hyung,

108
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:13,130
I speak on behalf of Han Gi Tak.

109
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:17,630
Don't get revenge on anyone.

110
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,470
I thought you were going to die.

111
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,210
Die? No.

112
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,840
How can I die and leave you behind?

113
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,820
Why are you so late?

114
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,510
Were you waiting for me, with the lights off?

115
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,070
Are you okay? You should've called me.

116
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:32,010
Something actually happened, but everything is fine now. And Hong Nan went to Yi Yeon's place.

117
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,380
That's a relief.

118
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,590
There was actually a serious gang fight...

119
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:41,890
I went there with a bunch of guys and knocked all thugs out.

120
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,150
Ahjumma, you should've seen me fight.

121
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,100
By any chance, didn't you alone fight off seventeen people?

122
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,880
Yes, it was like that.

123
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,800
Did you eat?

124
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,320
No, I didn't.

125
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,040
Are you staying by my side?

126
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,880
You don't want to eat alone.

127
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,810
Think of it as Boarding House Ahjumma's special service.

128
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,120
How kind you are.

129
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,850
It looks delicious.

130
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:47,870
Actress Song, I am not suffering from a serious illness.

131
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,860
Aigoo.

132
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,710
I know, I know!

133
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,250
I know, so just relax.

134
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,170
I'll take good care of you today.

135
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,940
Take care of what?

136
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:06,970
Whenever you say things like that, it makes me feel very uneasy.

137
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:11,050
You've always protected me.

138
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,710
 Come on, Song Yi Yeon. Get off the stage.

139
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,190
That's a relief, Song Yi Yeon.

140
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:50,160
Because you look better than last time.

141
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,530
Open up!

142
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,110
You eat it so well.

143
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,870
  Are you okay?

144
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,000
  Yes.

145
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,800
  That's a relief.

146
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,790
  I was worried.

147
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,790
  You're not hurt anywhere?

148
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,310
  Have you slept?

149
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,520
  You haven't?

150
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,320
  You were not replying, that's why.

151
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,170
  Because I like

152
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:48,290
  that you worry about me.

153
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,460
  Don't do that next time.

154
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,510
  You should tell me when you go somewhere.

155
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:57,020
  I was waiting and was worried too.

156
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,290
 You were waiting for me. I'm sorry.

157
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,160
  I'm sorry, my Ugly One.

158
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,790
Have a seat, Father-in-law.

159
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,690
When did you put all of those grape stickers on?

160
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:27,530
I did because I was so impressed by Han Na and your mom.

161
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,490
Because you want to move out of our place fast?

162
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,950
No way!

163
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:37,330
I promised you that I'd leave when I put all the stickers on the board.

164
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,800
Ahjusshi, isn't the amount of food today made for a grand meal?

165
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,770
At this rate, she can't receive any more grape stickers, right?

166
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:49,690
Right. I can not give stickers.

167
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,950
Oh my, I made a mistake again.

168
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,870
Han Na, we rode the Ferris wheel. Is there anything else you wanted to do with Dad?

169
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,700
I will do it for you instead of Dad.

170
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,850
You're ticked off because I said you weren't my Dad.

171
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:08,260
However, I don't dislike you.

172
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,800
Is that right?

173
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,580
Should we make our garden bigger, Yeong Soo?

174
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,570
Yes, we should, Father.

175
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,180
Fa-Father...

176
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:24,900
I thought of talking to you but I misspoke.

177
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,910
Why do you keep doing that?

178
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,100
You surprised me again.

179
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,300
It's not like it's the first time that I got confused with mixing up names.

180
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,820
I sometimes call Kang Ja, Han Na.

181
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,110
Right, Kang Ja?

182
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:44,660
Hey you. Why do you always respond?

183
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,490
Oh, this guy...

184
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,840
Let's eat.

185
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,670
  April 7th, 2016

186
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,180
  I called him Yeong Soo again.

187
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:08,550
  April 6th, 2016 
 I couldn't remember what day it was today.

188
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,750
  I got lost on my way home.

189
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,410
  It is important to diagnose Alzheimer's Disease early.

190
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,000
 For one to mitigate Alzheimer's Disease, it's important to detect it at early stage.

191
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,540
Give it to me.

192
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,550
Father. Do you have Alzheimer's?

193
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,150
- Be quiet! 
 - Who knows about this?

194
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,310
Alzheimer's?! Father!

195
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:43,060
Your mouth. Be careful!

196
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,880
You come out here.

197
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,610
Get up.

198
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,900
I said I don't have Alzheimer's. Will you keep saying nonsense?

199
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,990
Since when you were like this? Han Na's mom isn't aware of this either?

200
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,310
It's not Alzheimer's.

201
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:59,230
It's normal for one to lose memory when one gets old.

202
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:03,090
I'm in the midst of trying not to get sick so I exercise and go to the hospital regularly.

203
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,540
But still, you should have told your son and your daughter-in-law.

204
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,040
Your son didn't even know anything.

205
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,710
I told you I'm not sick.

206
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:13,320
I'm a person who can't get sick. If I get sick and fall, then who is going to take care of my children?

207
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,660
Father...

208
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:21,900
And you. How did you find Han Na when she left home wanting to find her dad?

209
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,110
That is because Yeong Soo Hyungnim told me before.

210
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:31,470
I don't know how much you know about our household, but don't pretend too much that you know.

211
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:38,870
- What?
- I'm thankful about you being in our house in place of Yeong Soo, but if you're going to show off like this,

212
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,820
get out immediately.

213
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,770
What are you trying to say?

214
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:47,260
I'm telling you not to show off in front of Da Hye and Han Na!

215
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,870
Father. Were you aware?

216
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,510
Don't even say such a thing.

217
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,690
When did you find out?

218
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:06,960
Before the wedding, Da Hye said that she could not marry Yeong Soo.

219
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,870
She said she had no right, as she came and cried.

220
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,570
Because I felt so bad about how she grew up,

221
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:20,520
since she's the one that my son loved, I wanted to protected her.

222
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:25,380
It's not like there wasn't any hardship, but

223
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,830
she's my daughter and my child.

224
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,460
Do you know how good my daughter-in-law was to us?

225
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,650
Father--

226
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,490
You tried hard.

227
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,480
It's not something that comes if you try hard.

228
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,680
It just came naturally. That's how family is.

229
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:49,150
♬   Unable to leave  ♬

230
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:58,450
♬   You also like me are crying.  ♬

231
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,460
♬   I, like the star over there  ♬

232
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,280
Why are you crying?

233
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,800
It's nothing.

234
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,150
Anyway, see what happens if you blabber about Alzheimers and things like that.

235
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,200
I'm going to kick you out!

236
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,700
Yes.

237
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,170
  Ho!

238
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,090
  Let's go!

239
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,910
It seemed as though you were like Hyungnim Gi Tak.

240
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:02,080
This is for certain.

241
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,680
It was about loyalty.

242
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:12,530
Do you have fever, too. Did you over exert yourself yesterday?

243
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,580
Where did Song Yi Yeon go? Why are you here by yourself?

244
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,800
She told me to take care of you.

245
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,180
Am I a child or something? I'll be back.

246
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:27,810
No, you can't. Na Seok Cheul didn't give up on you.

247
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:31,220
Big Hyungnim and Hyungnim Gi Tak's  accidents

248
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,750
were definitely all Na Seok Cheol's doing.

249
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:41,250
If even you get hurt, I...can't face Hyungnim Gi Tak.

250
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:46,050
I won't get hurt. I promise.

251
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:50,110
If something happens, I'll contact you the very first.

252
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,820
That's enough, right?

253
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:59,160
This is about loyalty.

254
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:06,560
- How did you find me last night?
- What?

255
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,930
It's not like you placed a tracker on me so how did you find me?

256
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:19,320
As I thought, I raised my little brothers well! You're so smart!

257
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,890
Is this place okay now?

258
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:47,170
I've practiced several times to become okay with it.

259
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,510
I will become more okay with it.

260
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:53,340
Just when will I become okay?

261
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,390
I won't ask anything anymore.

262
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:01,530
Now that you know for sure,

263
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:04,880
I am not going to expect anything. However,

264
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:11,820
If you need my help, let me know any time

265
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:16,280
if you ever feel like finding your family again.

266
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,960
Even if it's not that,

267
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,360
I'll help you then.

268
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,580
Thank you.

269
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:29,600
If something like that happens, I'll ask for your help.

270
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:01,370
The ball may have dropped to your side, but

271
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:05,150
can you protect Da Hye to the end?

272
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,950
If you can't take responsibility to the end, end it now.

273
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,830
Don't give her wounds like I did.

274
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:18,000
Have you already gotten over her?

275
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,810
Now, it's mine to take care of.

276
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,670
The thing that I have to repay for the rest of my life.

277

283
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,060
Even if I'm not here...

I wish you would be happy in this place.

289
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:13,320
 It would have been good if I had met her earlier.

290
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,870
 Can I go back with you in my memory?

291
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:22,390
♬   When I close my eyes again,   ♬

293
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,360
Manager Ma, what are you doing there?

294
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,620
Branch Manager.

295
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,880
What? It was you?

296
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,550
I'm sorry, Branch Manager.

297
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,810
You were the one who did everything until now, right?

298
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:47,450
No. This is the first time.

299
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:50,020
I just wanted to eat one.

300
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,360
Liar.

301
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,280
It's the truth. Since it's been a while, to...

302
00:26:54,280 --> 00:27:00,550
I came to bring a cup of coffee and I...

303
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,690
 Why are you avoiding me?

304
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,270
Who in the world are you?

305
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:27,210
How's the employees' response to bettering their welfare?

306
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:30,590
I'm sorry to tell you but

307
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,330
it's just crazy.

308
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,650
 Stress Relieving Room

309
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,590
 Massage: Foot massagers

Music/DVD Room

311
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,490
 Cafe

312
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:56,850
This is too much.

313
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,000
Is it honey or water?

314
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:13,450

315
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,950
Is this a children's house or a department store?

316
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,560
Oh, I'm running into my enemy and we're even on a log bridge.

317
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,720
Branch Manager Lee, because of Song Yi Yeon and bettering the employees welfare,

318
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,610
have the sales gone up?

319
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,650
Yes, for the first time in six years.

320
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,400
It turned out really well.

321
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:42,170
Thanks to you, Branch Manager, I think I can get a really good price for the store.

322
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:46,970
Next week, at the Directors Meeting, we're going to finalize the sale of the store.

323
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:49,960
Didn't I tell you you can't sell the store?

324
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,600
It seems like you think you are the only one who has concern for this store.

325
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,320
I do have a plan, too.

326
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,000
Do you think the chairman will just stand idly by?

327
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,010
Even if the chairman opposes it, there are other ways.

328
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:02,290
Must you go to this extent when we have just stabilized?

329
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:05,730
You just keep increasing the worth.

330
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,880
Work hard then!

331
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,280
Anyway, why is it taking so long to catch Na Seok Cheol?

332
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,560
I think Na Seok Cheol caused some trouble.

333
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,600
He's being chased by the police.

334
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,190
For murder?

335
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:40,200
 C020-16ME-0224-B404-14CK-M

336
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:46,080
If we give this account number to Na Seok Cheol,

337
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,120
It'll become dangerous for Da Hye.

338
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:52,040
Right. I thought it was a given to not tell her.

339
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,320
However, are we doing the right thing

340
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,070
hiding her brother forever?

341
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:02,200
I'm already dead and the only thing I can give her are wounds.

342
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,450
The money as well would only bring danger to the family.

343
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,510
Na Seok Cheol will be caught soon.

344
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,580
I'm not talking about the money. I'm talking about Han Gi Tak.

345
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,960
You can't tell her.

346
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,580
Accepting that her brother died would be hard at first.

347
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:21,300
I'm talking about Han Gi Tak.

348
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,410
Honey, my old father and even Han Na are still energetic.

349
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:29,310
The people who are alive will be able to withstand whatever situation they're in.

350
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,010
I want to tell Da Hye

351
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,970
the truth that there is a brother who loves her more than anyone else.

352
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:44,370
Honestly, I want to do that too.

353
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:54,150
I want to tell that kid that I didn't do it because I didn't love her.

354
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,920
Those words

355
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,480
Let's make sure to tell her.

356
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,690
We don't have time to be afraid anymore.

357
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,830
Take a look at this.

358
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,600
  I cannot wait any longer. Sale in progress. 
 Prove your plan will work.

359
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,170
These are not love letters.

360
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:16,590
What is this?

361
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:21,200
Is it someone who knows the real Lee Hae Joon?

362
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:26,580
Hyung Han thinks that too, right? Should we ask Maya?

363
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:37,330
Hey. It's a spy the real Lee Hae Joon planted.

364
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:40,080
Then that person knows I'm fake?

365
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,610
Who knows? That's something you should find out yourself.

366
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:48,610
The time is almost over. Be more generous!

367
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:57,730
You know you don't have much time left, right?

368
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:09,790
We have to be the real thing if we're going to continue protecting the things that we created.

369
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:13,800
You are more real than something that's already real.

370
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:18,460
This will help someone who is preparing to say good-bye.

371
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:23,970
I am starting to realize that I have done nothing for my family.

372
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:28,260
Man, why would you say that you have done nothing?

373
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,990
This is the kind of place that you're bringing me to eat, huh?

374
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:38,240
The food that Jae Gil makes isn't something a human can eat.

375
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,090
Let's eat at home. At home. Huh?

376
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,220
My sign.

377
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,850
How did this...

378
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,560
No way.

379
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,660
Apparently, the shop had to close down because of loss and debt.

380
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:08,110
So I took it over. Your little brothers are running it.

381
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,050
Who asked you to do this?

382
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:13,840
Of course I was going to get this place back to them legally.

383
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,290
It wasn't because of you, Hyung Han. It was for Da Hye's sake.

384
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:19,730
What?

385
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,730
If it weren't for the department store, the woman would have nothing to remember me by.

386
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:28,630
Even this sign is a painful memory to Da Hye too.

387
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:34,020
This is the place we three met when we were all alive.

388
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,710
I want to change it into a good memory.

389
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,470
You are so stupid.

390
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:45,840
If it's not Chef Han Gi Tak, then who will help me? Hm, Hyungnim?

414
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,990
Oh, look at this lady who is so moved that she is about to cry now.

415
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:28,660
I got it, I got it.

416
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,500
- Hey kid, cut it out. 
 - I got it.

417
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,250
What are you doing President Han? You should blow out the candle already.

418
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:35,280
President Han?

419
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,630
Right! Let's blow it out!

420
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,370
No, not yet! Wait!

421
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:43,690
We should take a picture here since this is such a historic day and all.

422
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,900
Now.

423
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,700
Ah, wait, wait a minute.

424
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,150
Why does it look so foggy?

425
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,910
Here.

426
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,250
Oh, it came out well.

427
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:03,100
♬   Thinking about you tonight   ♬

00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,170

436
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:49,820
How nice.

437
00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:01,520
Hey you punks! Is this how you're going to reopen this place?

438
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,940
See how you've lost your minds just because you haven't held a pan for a few months?

439
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:11,400
You are to arm your minds first and foremost.

440
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,710
Start!

441
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,930
Yes, Chef.

442
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:19,660
Don't be startled. Let's not be startled.

443
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:23,760
Our sister here has an aura that causes people to recoil.

444
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,020
Indeed it's the blood of Master Han Gi Tak!

445
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,830
You do well yourself.

446
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:33,720
You're the biggest problem here.

447
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,920
Can you distinguish sugar from salt and MSG or not?

448
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,650
Can't.

449
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:43,270
Stop punishing the kids and go work hard for yourself, you bastard!

450
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:52,530

451
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,620
You're watching, right?

452
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:02,960
It's like you came back alive.

453
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:13,020
The new store buyer is Lee Hae Joon, a Sunjin Department store manager.

454
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,530
Sunjin Department Store?

455
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:19,230
The punk that brought Han Gi Tak's underlings to save that chick that time.

456
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:23,050
So Lee Hae Joon knew Han Gi Tak.

457
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:41,020
I'm back.

458
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,370
You're late.

459
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,690
Were you waiting for me?

460
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:50,710
Yes. It's a given to wait if a family member hasn't come home.

461
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,080
Family?

462
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,940
Then go rest.

463
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,860
Tomorrow night,

464
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,360
would you like to have dinner with me?

465
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:08,960
Before I leave, let's have dinner for the last time.

466
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:11,940
I would like it if you came.

467
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,560
Okay.

468
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:29,920
Now our Han Na can go to school alone without someone having to take her.

469
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,470
If you can help it you should try to use big streets along with your friends.

470
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:37,180
Always remember to ask for help when someone you don't know approaches you.

471
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:42,180
You should also call and let your mom and grandpa know where are, okay?

472
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,710
I understand.

473
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:49,490
Ahjussi nags a lot too, like Dad.

474
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:56,100
Okay kiddo. You can go by yourself starting from this point on, right?

475
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,290
Are you telling me to walk by myself?

476
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,990
I have to go to work too.

477
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:03,500
Understood.

478
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:10,380
Miss, you should pay me for bringing you here.

479
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,470
You look like an octopus.

480
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,920
Bye, go now.

481
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,950
Father, try doing this.

482
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:49,310
This. People say that clapping like this is good for Alzheimer's.

483
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:53,150
Good! You're doing well!

484
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:56,590
People say walking and exercising like this is good for Alzheimer's.

485
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,970
Even if I'm not here, come outside often and meet new friends.

486
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:02,090
And exercise.

487
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:06,510
Don't worry. I have great muscle strength for my age.

488
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,850
My brain is also healthy.

489
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:12,370
My back is still good too.

490
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:25,790
 Father, when did you get this short?

491
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:28,550
 Long ago, you looked so much taller.

492
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:31,130
I am still good.

493
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:40,510
Grandmothers, hello!

494
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:43,470
My father started exercising lately. Please look after him.

495
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:44,470
Hello.

496
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:47,570
My father is very attractive. He is a brain-sexy man.

497
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:52,210
His butt! And his waist!

498
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,730
Father!

499
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:11,910
What are you doing here?

500
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:20,290
One fell in the water and another got kidnapped. Look at you guys.

501
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:24,770
What is the reason you're staying here? Anybody can come here if they want.

502
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:27,710
Here is the 'anybody' who comes anytime he wants.

503
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,790
What now? What, what?

504
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:29,830
The child is asking for you!

505
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:31,250
I'll go get him soon!

506
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:34,550
He said he wants us to eat together.

507
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:38,470
The three of us.

508
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:42,470
I don't want to either, but what can I do? The child wants it!

509
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:48,910
I don't know why I came all the way here and am giving this message to you right now.

510
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:52,950
I came here for nothing.

511
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:59,490
Either because he looks like somebody or is growing taller, he is eating so well these days.

512
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:10,070

513
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:17,070
Goodness, that guy being like that makes me so uneasy.

514
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:20,550
You don't need to be afraid of Cha Jae Gook. He cannot lay a hand on you now.

515
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:23,130
Who said I was afraid of him?

516
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:26,710
I'm just saying that I won't sit still any longer.

517
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:34,530
Song Yi Yeon, this is a favor.

518
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:39,110
Forget about Han Gi Tak and Cha Jae Gook. Live your life while enjoying yourself.

519
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:43,790
Don't worry. My life is just beginning.

520
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:48,650
Next time, please meet a good guy.

521
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:54,890
Not someone who loves you but has no courage, like Han Gi Tak. And not someone who loves you but bothers you, like Cha Jae Guk.

522
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:58,230
A man who can love you just the way you are.

523
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:00,770
Meet a good man.

524
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:04,770
No... Even if it's not a man,

525
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:08,750
just... meet a good person.

526
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:14,390
A person who is like a friend and a family member by your side.

527
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:16,870
A person who can stay by your side.

528
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:22,670
Now that I hear it, it sounds like that person is you.

529
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:29,970
Don't go anywhere, let's just live like this, Hong Nan.

530
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:37,210
While eating the food that you cook, I want to live like this forever.

531
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:52,890
You meeting a good person, loving them, getting married, and having a child.

532
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:56,110
Your happy, aging face.

533
00:44:56,110 --> 00:45:01,510
In your brother's stead, I'll watch over you.

534
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:04,470
 I...

535
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,210
 That's the future I dreamed of for you.

536
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:20,930
Aigoo.

537
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:23,890
Deul Sam, go get some mannequins with Da Hye.

538
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:27,970
Oh. That place is very dismal.

539
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:32,730
I'll bring it by myself, I'm strong.

540
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,570
No. It is very heavy.

541
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,530
I'll be back shortly.

542
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:41,510
Go with her,. It's heavy!

543
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:44,470
That unni is too fast.

544
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,630
 What do you mean you were lonely?

545
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:03,590
 Weren't you happy?

546
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:04,810
 Branch Manager...

547
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:09,330
 You... lived with those kinds of feelings all this time?

548
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:17,170
He's a really weird person.

549
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:41,370
  Hi! My precious love... I want to go home. 
 Compensate employees for their industrial accidents..

550
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:42,410
  Stop talking about sales!

551
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:46,010
  No scribbling

552
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:57,670
♬  When I look at your eyes I always feel anxious,   ♬

553
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:03,170
 Da Hye.
♬  I'm right next to you but I feel lonely   ♬

554
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:07,070
♬  You are the only one in my heart so   ♬

555
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:12,370
 Da Hye, everything about you is pretty but your smiling face is what is most pretty.

556
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:17,830
 But don't smile in front of other men or else I'll get jealous.

557
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:19,110
♬  I love you.   ♬

558
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:22,110
  There are too many obnoxious and bossy customers here.

559
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:25,470
 When it's too hard and tiring, get on the elevator.

560
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:30,150
  I thought of the moment when you smiled at me for the first time.

561
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:32,550
 You're my vitamin. 
♬  All alone I will dream and wait for you   ♬

562
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:35,630
♬  All alone I will dream and wait for you   ♬

563
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:41,170
 My happiness, Han Na. She is the greatest present you've given to me.

564
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:45,870
♬  My heart is moving toward you   ♬

565
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:50,170
 Thank you. This word that I say hundreds of times in a day.

566
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:53,970
 To you, I've never said those words properly.

567
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:57,210
 Thank you for being my wife.

568
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:03,210
 I love you, Da Hye.

569
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:06,990
 I'm sorry for not saying I love you often.

570
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:11,010
 And be happy.

571
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:18,610
 Ahjumma. 
♬  Even if a year goes by, even if ten years more pass   ♬

572
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:23,310
♬  I will love you.   ♬

573
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:30,270
 Be happy, Ahjumma.

574
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:38,290
 Ahjumma

575
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:23,710
 - Will you come see me? —X

576
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:19,290
 Because your call can not be connected...

577
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:24,410
Why is the cute President Cha not answering the call?

578
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:39,470
 President.

579
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:44,920
 I'm sorry to call you like this. It's just that I'm in a tough situation.

580
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:48,270
Anyhow, I know you're in a tough situation.

581
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:50,880
You were mentioned prominently in the conversation.

582
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,710
Ah, is that so?

583
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:57,850
Detective, why did you say you came?

584
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:02,460
I'm in the midst of investigating Na Seok Cheol's involvement of Chairman Jang Jin Goo's death.

585
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:06,290
 Oh I see.  I'm in the middle of a call...

586
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:13,920
 President Cha, I won't crumble this easily.

587
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,590
Please help me this once.

588
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:20,970
I know pretty well of your difficulty but is there anything of worth for me to invest in?

589
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:25,710
As you know, I don't invest in things that do not benefit me.

590
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:27,130
Then.

591
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:28,870
  W-Wait a moment.

592
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:31,370
It's just that I have an important engagement.

593
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:33,160
 Filthy bastards.

594
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,010
 Then, according to the plan, Han Gi Tak...

595
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:38,340
 Kill trash like him!

596
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:43,620
 President Cha Jae Gook who ordered the murder of Han Gi Tak.

597
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:50,890
So, should I go see your wife at her house as a service?

598
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:55,570
Or should I spread this nationwide?

599
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:12,440
Yeong Chan, you're not hungry?

600
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,910
Yeah.

601
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:21,730
Mom is really hungry though. Should we just eat first?

602
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:25,390
You want to eat together when Dad comes?

603
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:26,930
Yeah.

604
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:32,750
You like it when Mom and Dad eat together?

605
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,170
Yeah.

606
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:35,100
Why?

607
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:37,140
Because it's nice.

608
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:45,910
Dad!

609
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:51,260
Cha Yeong Chan, you were waiting for me, huh?

610
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:54,690
As expected, there's no one like my son.

611
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:35,030
Welcome, customer.

612
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:39,550
I'll serve you: This way.

613
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:22,390
 Be happy, Ahjumma.

614
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:29,070
 Nobody pays any attention to wounds like this.

615
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:33,940
 Miss Shin Da Hye, you probably wouldn't understand what I am talking about.

616
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:36,870
 Never mind about the word damn, okay?

617
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:53,150
 That's right. You are doing great.

618
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,590
  Branch Manager Lee Hae Joon

619
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:44,490
Ahjumma?

620
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:46,240
Yes...

621
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,640
You're still there?

622
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,040
Of course. Where are you?

623
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:54,190
I'm almost there. I'll go right away. You'll wait for me, right?

624
00:55:56,950 --> 00:56:00,910
Yes, I'll wait for you.

625
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:04,270
I'll keep my promise this time.

626
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:17,940
 Epilogue 
I've been confined on this desert island for fifty one days.

627
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:24,460
The thing that's even scarier than hunger is despair. It's when nobody is looking for you.

628
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:41,780
 Father, I am finally able to call out to you.

629
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:46,500
 I resented you a lot, Father, even when you looked away from me in the past.

630
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:50,320
 I still hate you because you're not looking out for me.

631
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:54,020
 However, I am trying my best to forgive you once and for all.

632
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:59,940
 It's an unfortunate thing to leave the world while hating someone.

633
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:04,840
 So, now I forgive you.

634
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:08,950
 And, I love y...

635
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:28,080
