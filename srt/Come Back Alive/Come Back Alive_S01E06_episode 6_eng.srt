1
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,970
You think you didn't do anything wrong?

2
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,280
What the heck did you do?

3
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,900
You believe your husband committed suicide. You aren't suspecting anything.

4
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,900
You didn't think about how it contradicts his personality.

5
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,940
It means that you don't know your husband very well.

6
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,900
So, I...

7
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,680
I don't like you, Ajumma.

8
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,260
Yes.

9
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,340
I don't know him.

10
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,280
No... I don't know him at all.

11
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,440
That's why it's driving me crazy,

12
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,150
and it's making me angry.

13
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:34,280

14
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,640
♬   It might be too late   ♬

15
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,110
♬   Maybe in a place that I can’t even go back too   ♬

16
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,690
It's driving me crazy. This woman. It is me!

17
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,570
♬   My whole love is alive and breathing.   ♬

18
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,680
What are you looking at?

19
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,750
♬   My whole love is alive and breathing.   ♬

20
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,430
I'm going to be seeing things now.

21
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,650
Hey. Hey. S-Stop!

22
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,770
Stop!!!

23
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,740
- Thank you. 
 - Please throw this away.

24
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,560
Let's go. Manager Jeong Kyung Ho.

25
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,000
 It's you.

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,990
 Song Yi Yeon's everything.

27
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,380
 Yi Yeon's universe.

28
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,980
Hello, kiddo.

29
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,060
 2016 SBC Drama Special: The stories you didn't know
 Director Goo Gwang Hoe's New Work

30
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,710
 The Story That You Don't Know.

31
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,310
And now we introduce the female lead.

32
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,650
Please come up to the stage.

33
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,880
Excuse me. It's my turn soon.

34
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,030
Song Yi Yeon?

35
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,170
Wait a moment, please move.

36
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,350
Are we really going to see my mom?

37
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,350
Listen here, kiddo. Where else would I take you to use you?

38
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,840
A space monster?

39
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,580
That lady you talked to earlier wasn't your mom.

40
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,700
I am kidnapping you to get a ransom from your Dad.

41
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,380
I am a space monster!

42
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,890
Oh, it's my mom.

43
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,710
Song Yi Yeon! Song Yi Yeon!

44
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:08,750
Gwang JooYeon! Gwang Joo Yeon! Gwang Joo Yeon!

45
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh my, Unni!

46
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,310
What are you doing here?

47
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,620
Who's the female lead?

48
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,790
Originally, the female lead was supposed to be Song Yi Yeon but it was taken away from her.

49
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:39,300
Song Yi Yeon, why did you show up here? To get revenge on her?

50
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,120
Song Yi Yeon, did you not know that the female lead changed?

51
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,380
Please tell us the reason why you showed up here!

52
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,990
 Gwang Joo Yeon, come here and tell us give us a comment.

53
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,010
You said that Joo Yeon would personally tell her.

54
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,870
She's telling her right now.

55
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,410
Very politely.

56
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,990
U... Unni.

57
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,130
We're in front of the camera, smile.

58
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,640
Let go of me.

59
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,660
Let go of me, please.

60
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,140
Are you crazy?!

61
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,380
Noona!

62
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,470
Those little...!

63
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:12,020
Noona, why are the people doing that to Mom?

64
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,400
Look here, kiddo. A man should not cry.

65
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,000
Look over there; there are lots of cameras, right?

66
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,870
Right now, your Mom is the leading actor.

67
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,430
I see.

68
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,240
It's a scene where bad people are bothering your Mom.

69
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:39,490
From now on I'll fight those villains and save Mom.

70
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,120
Wow like The Lightning Man? (Superhero)

71
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,350
Lightning Man?

72
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,480
- Not that.
- Then since you're a woman, you're Lightening Girl.

73
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,970
Y-Yeah.

74
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:54,380
I am the Lightning Girl and I'll fly like shoom!

75
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,080
Fighting!

76
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,730
♬   Trumpet, woo  ♬

77
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,100
♫  Work mate  ♫

78
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,740
Wow it's The Lightning Girl!

79
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,450
Wow!

80
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:01,040
♬  Amazing, 10 points  ♬

81
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,830
From here on out, it's an action scene.

82
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:13,180
♬   From the moment of waking up feel alive   ♬

83
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:20,310
♬   A new beginning Feel so right alive   ♬

84
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,050
♬   I say I'm going to the sky   ♬

85
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,730
 Song Yi Yeon, apologize. Apologize!

86
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,310
Mom, you were really great today.

87
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:39,110
You were being attacked but The Lightning Noona saved you right?

88
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:43,080
I'm amazing right?

89
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,110
Wow there's cream on your mom's face.

90
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,470
Mmm delicious!

91
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,680
Mmm, it's delicious!

92
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,900
Get this kiddo!

93
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,980
Get Mom!

94
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,520
Then Mom will attack Yeong Chan.

95
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,310
I'm attacking Mom too.

96
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:06,190
How could you attack Mom? Then I will attack you.

97
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,860
Mustache attack!

98
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,650
A mustache attack?!

99
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,480
 Attacking the eye brows.

100
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,480
Then mom will once again—

101
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,150
Why is this woman so late?

102
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:27,070
Could she be with Jeong Ji Hoon?

103
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,540
Yes.

104
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,980
It has been restored?

105
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,000
Yes, I'll go right away.

106
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,840
What are you doing here?

107
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,140
Please go. What's with you, seriously?

108
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,100
I have nothing to say to you, so just go.

109
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,550
The rice cake! That you gave me.

110
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,940
 Excuse me. You are Manager Kim Yeong Soo's wife, right?

111
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,840
 Yes. Why?

112
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,760
 Take this home. It's nothing special, but rice cake.

113
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,150
 It's okay.

114
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,820
 Don't be burdened, and take it.

115
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:35,210
The rice cakes went somewhere. The were returned to you, Department Head Baek.

116
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,610
I can't believe it. What are you even saying?

117
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:43,130
The afternoon my husband died, he had a package delivered somewhere.

118
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:47,870
The recipient's name was Jeong Flower Lady.

119
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,510
That's your mother's name, right?

120
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:55,430
I can check for myself what he sent.

121
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,810
Please tell me the truth.

122
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,930
He was not someone who would receive a bribe.

123
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,630
He wouldn't commit suicide either.

124
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,300
Tell me honestly, please. Yes?

125
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,500
Anyway, I don't know anything. Don't look for me again.

126
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,660
  You deserted your home and committed your whole body to your work.

127
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,620
  Shouldn't your salary be as high as what your life is worth?

128
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,430
That happened while I was away on the phone.

129
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:09,810
It was completely destroyed. Is there anyone who holds a grudge against you?

130
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,910
  Whatever you do, don't do it.

131
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,850
 Even if you try, it's not something that you can overcome.

132
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,720
 You're going to purposefully cover my death, huh?

133
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,430
Cha Jae Gook. Cha Jae Gook!

134
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,460
I'm going to break your legs into pieces. Director Goo.

135
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:09,120
My number one has always been Wang Joo Yeon.

136
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,150
I see you're flapping that mouth.

137
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,890
Wang Joo Yeon was my choice but I cast Song Yi Yeon.

138
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:18,090
But actually I was confident I would get Wang Joo Yeon

139
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:21,080
 Na Seok Cheol, you bastard.

140
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,560
It is too much of a risk to use a product with a defect for a masterpiece like this.

141
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,760
  A defect? That bastard!

142
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,510
What to about Song Yi Yeon? I feel so sorry for her.

143
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,860
I think there was a problem in communication,

144
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,940
but I'll take care of our side, so you just need

145
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,520
to wrap it up well.

146
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,660
Song Yi Yeon must give you a hard time.

147
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,770
Not only Sunjin but also its subsidiaries and partners.

148
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:49,180
They're threatening to take away her advertisements if Song Yi Yeon gets cast.

149
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:53,670
 I knew it. It's all Sunjin's doing.

150
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,640
 These bastards.

151
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,580
Oh, you.

152
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,000
Then, I'll get going to meet my staff members.

153
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,980
Sure, Director Goo.

154
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,440
Please take care.

155
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,960
What a chicken-hearted dummy!

156
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,120
When did you come, President?

157
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,760
You seem very busy, working without even reporting.

158
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,020
Ah, that...

159
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,080
I apologize.

160
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,630
This tea's taste

161
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:00,860
is as gritty as a meteoroid coming from outer space.

162
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:11,620

163
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,500
Song Yi Yeon is mine.

164
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,750
Who said you could touch my toy?

165
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,320
Looks like I have to throw it away.

166
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:24,230
How kind he is.

167
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:33,520
Song Yi Yeon is still useful.

168
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:48,670
You did a good job. Very Good. Good! Good! Good!

169
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:32,480
How crazy I am. Is this the only place I can go?

170
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:41,290
It's so fun. Hey!

171
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,650
They say it's here, where Manager Kim fell.

172
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,880
Oh, hey! Hurry, hurry!

173
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,170
I'm so hungry.

174
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,390
 Would you please give me an answer?

175
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,650
 3/10/2016: Da Hye's Obstetrician's Exam

176
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,770
 Kim Yeong Soo

177
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,210
♫  I waited  ♫

178
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:52,020
♫  Even though I knew everything  ♫

179
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:57,380
♫  The time you won't come to me  ♫

180
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:03,030
♫  No matter how much I wanted it  ♫

181
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:07,110
♫  So that you'd be near me  ♫

182
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:11,660
♬   A person who no longer exists  ♬

183
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:17,060
♬  At least a little  ♬

184
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:23,590
♬  Did you think of my name?   ♬

185
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:30,650
 One person is crying.

186
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:35,570
 Another person has a story.

187
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:45,170
 Few times I came to cry by myself but for the one who was crying, I left.

188
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:50,450
♬   The memories that I made with you  ♬

189
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:55,210
♬   Even that sadness  ♬

190
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:59,710
♫  Oh, I  ♫

191
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:06,170
♬  All of it   ♬

192
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:13,390
♬   I loved it  ♬

193
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:17,670
 We all need comfort.

194
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:21,110
 I need it and you do too.

195
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:31,070
 Sunjin Department Store

196
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,990
Isn't the guy we want to catch, the same guy?

197
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:38,140
The tiger that ate up Kim Yeong Soo and Song Yi Yeon.

198
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,810
Let's capture that tiger and beat him up.

199
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,660
I'm living in a tiger's den and I'm about to be eaten up.

200
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:50,660
This guy. If you want to catch the tiger, you have to start a smoking fire in front of the den.

201
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,270
We'll bring Yoo Hyeok and settle him down.

202
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,850
Is Yoo Hyeok a fire extinguisher or something?

203
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,870
Right.

204
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:59,680
How are you going to model when you can't even walk properly?

205
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,340
I'm very good at walking.

206
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,550
Do you think a fashion show is a joke?

207
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:15,090
How dare... Forget everything and

208
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:20,540
get on your knees and apologize to my wife sincerely. Hurry up!

209
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:24,140
Huh? Isn't that your wife?

210
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,080
What kind of rude bastard, to your wife...

211
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:32,330
What's the name of this place? Lucia—? Get on your knees and apologize!

212
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,850
I'm sorry.

213
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,920
What's with your expression? You feel wronged?

214
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,450
Even after making a perfectly normal person a thief?

215
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,790
Sir...

216
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,090
For now, please calm down and...

217
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,960
You stay out of it. What are you?

218
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,930
You won't stay out of it? Ajumma, you feel wronged? Huh?

219
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:49,820
If you feel wronged, call your husband.

220
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,260
Call your husband quickly. Where's your husband?

221
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:57,300
I said to call your husband! Where is he?

222
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,780
What kind of a department store is this?

223
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,760
Treats a customer like crap.

224
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,040
Call your husband!

225
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,760
What kind of place is this?

226
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,690
I'm sorry.

227
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,720
Seriously.

228
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,780
What are you doing right now?!

229
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:31,940
What are you? Oh, are you her husband?

230
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,940
That's right. I'm this woman's hus—

231
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:42,170
- Oh, my goodness!
- What to do?

232
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:44,170
What's wrong with this department store?

233
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,840
Stay still. It's all for your sake.

234
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:02,460
No. You're trying to create a problem, aren't you?

235
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,750
Awesome.

236
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,670
Branch Manager, I'll take care of things here.

237
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,570
Huh?

238
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:33,050
Then, I'll leave it to you.

239
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,090
No, that's not it... Hey.

240
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:38,160
Move aside.

241
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,460
- Huh? 
 - I'm the Strategic Planning Department Head, Jeong Ji Hoon.

242
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:48,170
I apologize for one of our employees making you feel bad.

243
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,130
Yeah, yeah.

244
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:52,600
As a higher up, you do show some hope.

245
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,670
Our department store is based on being considerate and does not suspect you.

246
00:25:56,670 --> 00:26:01,330
However, to get rid of the unpleasant misunderstanding,

247
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:05,350
we'll let the police to do an impartial fact finding.

248
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:08,190
You don't have to have any impartial fact finding.

249
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,040
Ah, they are here!

250
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,640
What is this? Why is that in there?

251
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,970
- I'm sorry, I won't do it again!
-That's not it.

252
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:24,140
I think there might be some misunderstanding.

253
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,430
 Look here, Mister...

254
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,770
That damn...

255
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,300
Ah, seriously!

256
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:49,300
Hey! What do you think you're doing in front of my wife!?

257
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,910
It's your Noona's plan for your sake.

258
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:55,070
Plan?! Plan my butt!

259
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:58,280
You're going reveal your identity for such a petty incident and go straight up there?

260
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:02,740
This Hyung is your life saver!

261
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:07,320
Well that's true but...! Really!

262
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,380
I only ended up doing good things for Jeong Ji Hoon.

263
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,980
We are of one heart and mind.

264
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:18,010
If you cause trouble and go to heaven, I won't have a house nor will I have any backing.

265
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:21,440
How can I live with such a frail body?

266
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,160
So that was your motive.

267
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,470
Come home early.

268
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:29,160
I'll rinse out your mouth with soju.

269
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:40,780
That person is neither a young lady nor an old man.

270
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,030
Father.

271
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:00,050
You know that. There are all kinds of customers in the department store.

272
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,810
Don't let it bother you.

273
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:06,320
Yes. Thank you.

274
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,940
Are you really okay?

275
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,320
Yes, of course.

276
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,740
What's bothering you?

277
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,640
Yesterday I went to meet Department Head Baek's Mother.

278
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,450
Department Head Baek?

279
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:24,130
The day when I returned the rice cake that I received from Department Head Baek to Han Na's Father...

280
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:27,490
My husband had a package delivered to Department Head Baek's Mother.

281
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:31,350
Do you by chance know anything about that delivery?

282
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,100
Yes.

283
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,490
Though he denied any knowledge about it,

284
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:38,970
it's surely that rice cake.

285
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:42,710
What made you come here?

286
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,860
It seems that Shin Da Hye went out to eat.

287
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:55,960
Yeah, it seemed like it.

288
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,790
I didn't eat yet...

289
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:10,470

290
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,340
It's Han Na's dad.

291
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,960
It's kimbap.

292
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,590
I'm the best maker of kimbap in my family.

293
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:16,860
When Yeong Soo went on his first date, I made kimbap for him.

294
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:22,200
After one bite, Han Na's mom fell so in love with the taste that she married him.

295
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:29,480
How does it taste?

296
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,650
It's delicious.

297
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:35,320
What's the matter?

298
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,300
Did you chew a rock?

299
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,970
No. Let's eat together.

300
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:42,150
No, I ate a lot at home.

301
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,060
Have more.

302
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,880
Mister Branch Manager,

303
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,550
thank you.

304
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,330
Pardon? For what?

305
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,380
Just because.

306
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:09,780
Please don't tell my daughter-in-law I came here today.

307
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:16,060
Yes, I understand.

308
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,680
Here, have some more.

309
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,880
One can eat three meals a day with anybody, right?

310
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,780
Yes, Mana...No, I mean Department Head.

311
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,550
You can call me whatever you want.

312
00:31:56,550 --> 00:32:00,300
Anyway, let's release all of your discomfort here and go back.

313
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,500
- Excuse me!
- Yes?

314
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,380
Can we get two yukgaejang? Oh and one with rice.

315
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,100
- Right?
- Yukgaejang?

316
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,160
- I can't.
- Huh?

317
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,670
I have an allergy.

318
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:13,770
- Excuse me...
- I want to eat yukgaejang,

319
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:16,900
but Da Hye is not there to eat taro porridge for me.

320
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,400
So, I'm a regular here.

321
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,030
Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that it's fine.

322
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:26,400
Because they don't put taro in the soup.

323
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,240
Introduce yourself.

324
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,520
This is my F-F-Father...

325
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,620
Ah, is that so?

326
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:49,020
Nice to meet you. I'm Han Gi—

327
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,380
Hong Nan.

328
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:08,100
Name, Han Hong Nan.

329
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,860
Age... Unknown.

330
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,560
Education... Unknown.

331
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,880
Born in...

332
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:20,580
Somewhere around the States.

333
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,870
Ah, seriously!

334
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,110
What is your relationship, he says.

335
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,850
Just someone who comes and goes--

336
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,460
She's a friend.

337
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,900
I met her in America. I am me,

338
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,930
She... You...

339
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,880
Fashion school.

340
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,890
He used to play basketball.

341
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,450
Please shut up.

342
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:09,920
What?

343
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,490
Da Hye.

344
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:25,300
I'll meet with Department Head Baek.

345
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,760
Rather than you, who had a family member who died, wouldn't he be more comfortable with me,

346
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,600
- since your husband died because of the money he gav—
- No, it's not true.

347
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,960
I received it.

348
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,450
He said it was rice cake so I really thought it was rice cake.

349
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:40,600
I received it and returned it back to Han Na's dad.

350
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,250
I know.

351
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:46,350
You're not at fault, Da Hye. Your husband isn't the kind of person who'd do that either.

352
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:49,100
I want to believe it too, but...

353
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,260
For now, being emotional won't be of any help.

354
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:56,970
Will you trust me and wait a bit?

355
00:34:57,810 --> 00:35:00,540
When I bring you the answer,

356
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,560
it would be best to acknowledge it without any lingering attachments.

357
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,790
This is what I saw in a drama.

358
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:20,530
In any case, we have a business relationship.

359
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,880
Ah, we're friends!

360
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,180
That kind of an expression can cause many misunderstandings.

361
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,940
So, um... Ma...

362
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,880
That's it. This is a business relationship.

363
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,460
You were fooled right?

364
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:44,160
Why do you think we kissed in the sacred department store in broad daylight?

365
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,700
Ah the event! The event!

366
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,820
It was like a teaser to promote the fashion show.

367
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,320
That's right! I'm slim and sexy,

368
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,060
he's a chocolate bar, who has a tight butt.

369
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,600
Wow!

370
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,390
The two of us will do the fashion show.

371
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,570
The main model is Yoo Hyeok! Fresh, isn't it?

372
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,870
He said he'd do it for us.

373
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:14,800
The sponsor is you, Father! 
Father, you're the best.

374
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,660
Please just shut your mouth.

375
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,280
He said to carry on the plan without disruptions.

376
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:29,580
Is that the truth?

377
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:34,630
He said all tasks related to the fashion show

378
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:37,480
will now be going to you, Branch Manager.

379
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,770
Are you crazy? Do you think I have the time to be doing the fashion show?

380
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:53,560
And even at this time, that guy Jeong Ji Hoon is probably doing everything to show himself off to Da Hye!

381
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:57,170
Are we strangers? We need to catch Yoo Hyeok to lure the tiger outside.

382
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:59,500
Stop talking about the tiger! You've done it enough.

383
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,930
In order for Song Yi Yeon to live,

384
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,680
this is the only way.

385
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:09,200
The only thing I can do for my woman is this.

386
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,350
You made it all awkward because you got serious...

387
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:15,410
Oh my gosh, I'm going to go crazy!

388
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:31,020
Hey.

389
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,920
Who could this be?

390
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,890
The number one searched star on the Internet.

391
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,170
You came?

392
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:40,950
I'm still surprised because the reception of the news was so positive.

393
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:43,080
Yoo Hyeok is the main model?

394
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:49,680
I'm also starting to be surprised by your actions.

395
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,980
 What are you trying to do with Yoo Hyeok, Lee Hae Joo?

396
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:58,450
Oh no, it's nothing compared to what you do.

397
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,410
 It's you, isn't it?

398
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:06,180
 By covering my death, what is it that you want?

399
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:15,040

400
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,060
Aish!

401
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:22,530
This is the model, Hong Nan, who will be doing the fashion show with me.

402
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:29,990
Anyway, for this fashion show,

403
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:32,130
I'm looking forward to—

404
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,650
Shin Da Hye!

405
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,350
Ajumma!

406
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,540
What did you do with that Jeong Ji Hoon?

407
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:02,030
We had a meal. Why?

408
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:05,840
Why? Why?!

409
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,840
You left your position during your work time.

410
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,910
- What did you eat?
- We ate yukgaejang.

411
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,950
You don't even like that!

412
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:16,070
That's not true. I just don't eat it because we don't have it.

413
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,390
It must have been delicious.

414
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,750
W-W-What? That yukgaejang shop in front?

415
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,990
What do you need to say to me?

416
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:26,430
What? Do you think I'm worried about you?

417
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,820
Okay fine! I'm saying this because I'm worried.

418
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:34,750
Don't hang around him too much.

419
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,940
It's because others who are watching might get different ideas.

420
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:40,540
I know it's difficult but you can't just rely on others all the time.

421
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:44,890
In this world in which you live alone, you have to be strong and live independently!

422
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:48,540
I know. I know. If anybody takes one look at you, they'd think you're a young lady.

423
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,610
But what can you do? You're an Ahjumma.

424
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:52,700
That courage that you have...

425
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:56,000
Like, try to take it out.

426
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,320
- Are you interested in me?
- Heol.

427
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,230
Me? Interested in you?

428
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,600
Did you get shot with a gun?

429
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,720
What kind of nonsense are you saying?

430
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,870
Exactly. It's just that you keep saying nonsense.

431
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:12,330
If you don't have anything to tell me, then I'll be going.

432
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:14,260
Ah, wait...

433
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:19,180
That woman...

434
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,110
Come here.

435
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,970
What's with you, really?

436
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,850
Let me ask you something. I'll get to the point.

437
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:49,030
How can I gain a man's heart?

438
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,640
Are you seeing someone?

439
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:55,700
None of your business. Tell me your secret.

440
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,870
Did I steal their hearts? They just gave them to me.

441
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,130
So, what is your secret? How can you be loved like that for such a long time?

442
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:10,290
What's the special secret you have that made many men kneel down in front of you?

443
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:13,000
There is no special secret.

444
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,780
Yes, that's the one.

445
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,910
What's wrong with you?

446
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:23,170
Yes, that's it. I should do it like this?

447
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:25,080
How on earth did you do that?

448
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:29,420
Not like that.

449
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:33,080
Ah! You are making me do such things?

450
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:45,180
Good. That's it.

451
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,930
Ah, wait. What's wrong with you?

452
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,760
Aigoo, my muscles must've been surprised at the sudden exercise.

453
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,850
M-Me t-to. Me... me too.

454
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:48,720
Did you work that hard?

455
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,850
Huh?

456
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:55,290
Your heart is beating so crazy fast.

457
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:58,220
Listen to this it's going ba-dump ba-dump.

458
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,760
Omo!

459
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:07,480
Yes, I am Song Yi Yeon's manager.

460
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:11,570
Yes, which TV program?

461
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:18,560
I won't show you again. Watch carefully and follow. Pose. Pose. Pose.

462
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:23,730
Should we try the walk next?

463
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,150
Good. Very good.

464
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:31,530
Straighten your back and shoulders! You stone-head!

465
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:33,940
Straighten your shoulders!

466
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:35,310
What's with you?

467
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:38,510
Go. Good, good. With confidence.

468
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:40,450
That's right.

469
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:46,570
Shin Da Hye.

470
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:51,270
- Starting today, stay by my side.
- What?

471
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:53,930
I have responsibilities to give to you, Ahjumma.

472
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:04,200
Oh-ho. Hurry.

473
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:45,740

474
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:52,270
Why are these clothes so small?

475
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:58,070
Oh my goodness, how could you come out like this?

476
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:01,340
This is a dress.

477
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:02,830
Eh?!

478
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:05,180
Why is it taking so long?

479
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:07,860
- This is... You need to put your arm inside!
- Wait!

480
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:10,120
What's wrong? What's going on?

481
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,570
Aigoo, aigoo.

482
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:13,660
- Come here!
- Omo!

483
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:17,530
- Do you still have more errands for Shin Da Hye?
- And if I do?

484
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:22,370
She's our partner's employee. Things will become difficult if you just boss her around.

485
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:25,560
Is the fashion show not work?

486
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,910
Also, did you think that I don't know at least that much?

487
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:32,950
You don't look like a person who knows.

488
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:38,050
Jeong Ji Hoon! Since when have you been unable to tell poop and soy bean paste apart?

489
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,750
Ta-da!

490
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:03,790
How can I wear all of these clothes by myself?

491
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:11,220
Not anybody can wear that. The skirt is too short!

492
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:15,540
I'm sorry. I'll change right away.

493
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:30,790
Hey! Reporters!

494
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:37,880
Eat and live. Let's do this while eating.

495
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,940
Here is some fried wonton, complimentary for you while working.

496
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:43,080
Eat it and leave early.

497
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:49,200
Ahhh, no matter how long you wait,

498
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,260
you won't get to see Song Yi Yeon's breathtaking behind.

499
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:58,110
Did you order black bean noodles?

500
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:04,650
I am Park Jeong Won, PD of the show,  I'll Go the Whole Nine Yards .

501
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:16,890
We're preparing a theme of people thrown away by the rich.

502
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:20,910
I've asked you for an interview because I felt that you would have the most to say about the matter.

503
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:21,700
Me?

504
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:26,830
Wbout Sunjin Group influencing your romance scandal and your acting career,

505
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:28,560
what do you think?

506
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,380
What exactly does that mean?

507
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:36,640
Our program is not shaken by any threats. Please be brave.

508
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:40,080
That's right! Song Yi Yeon's guardian angel!

509
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,320
I'm sorry, Producer.

510
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,960
I think that you misunderstood something.

511
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,460
Wait, that's not it.

512
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:51,000
I... Wait a minute, wait.

513
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,140
- Song Yi Yeon!
- Hey!

514
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,920
Wait. Just let me talk!

515
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:58,520
Song Yi Yeon! Song Yi Yeon!

516
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:06,890
Why? What's there to be timid about?

517
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:08,370
I just want to live quietly.

518
00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:13,030
You're going to live quietly like an idiot? Until when are you going to keep on getting hurt?

519
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:15,110
You need to let them know how unfair it is.

520
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:18,250
It's unfair and I did nothing wrong. It was that bastard, Yoo Hyeok who lied—

521
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:22,440
So, what? Shed tears and receive pity?

522
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,600
Why are you being like this? I'm an actress.

523
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:30,120
I'm not pitied. I'm aspired to.

524
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:33,310
Lowering my face, and having to wear a hat...

525
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:37,470
I don't want to hear people whispering about me anymore.

526
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:39,850
If you want to do that kind of thing, then go ahead.

527
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:44,830
You're still far away aren't you, Song Yi Yeon.

528
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:50,480
Let's say you're doing this because of your pride. Then what did your kid do wrong?

529
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,160
What do you know?

530
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,990
Just what do you know?

531
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:59,020
Do you think I live this way because I'm stupid?

532
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,880
It's not as simple as you think it is!

533
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,370
What exactly is so complicated?!

534
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:06,780
It's my life. Don't talk so lightly about it.

535
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,780
Does it seem like I'm talking about it so lightly?

536
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:30,870
Could I call you Yooneunim (nickname for Yoo Jae Seok, famous MC)?

537
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:33,690
Yooneunim?

538
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:39,310
Then what do others call you?

539
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:45,370
Well, they usually call another person by that name.

540
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:48,080
I want to call you that..

541
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,970
 Yoo Hyeok

542
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:56,510
There's handsome smudged on you.

543
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:11,810
I worked so hard. My soul's been sucked out of me.

544
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:15,810
You should've called me!

545
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:22,390
You can't seduce him in that state.

546
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:26,670
Let me show you my surprising improvement.

547
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:46,250
♬  The name on everybodies' lips is gonna be Roxie.  ♬

548
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:59,320
I told you not do stuff like this.

549
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:03,960
Take care of those pants first.

550
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,830
Oh these?

551
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,810
It won't close.

552
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:14,870
- Hold on!
- Just turn around.

553
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:17,270
Put your arms up.

554
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:19,940
Hold on a second. One, two, three!

555
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:23,560
No, don't move around.

556
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,250
Lift that up.

557
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,680
I'll do it for you. I'll pull them up.

558
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,890
- Stay still. Stay still. One, two, three.
- Oww!

559
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:35,190
That hurts!

560
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:38,270
No, let go! One!

561
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:41,520
Damn this!

562
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:45,780
There. It's done. Turn around. One, two, three.

563
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:52,430
Hold your breath. Hold your breath! It's done!

564
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,960
What's wrong?

565
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,900
Can you...take this off for me...? Can't breathe.

566
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,860
Put your hands up!

567
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:08,590
Just stay still!

568
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:14,930
No, no, no, no...

569
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:17,980
I said it's not like that! It's not!

570
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:22,820
Branch Manager! You can't do this at the company. I will book you a hotel room.

571
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:25,670
I said it's not like that!

572
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:36,920
Honey, can you take this off?

573
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,380
Can I do that for you?

574
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,080
You there. Hold on!

575
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:46,270
Wait. Listen to my side of the story.

576
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:51,120
Listen to what I have to say! No. Listen!

577
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,370
What are you doing? I'm going to scream!

578
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:01,650
Quiet. Be quiet.

579
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:09,230
Sorry. I'm so sorry. You kept screaming so I had to...

580
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:18,000
Please excuse me.

581
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:29,230
I mean, no one pays attention to the cut here.

582
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:45,160
Sit down here. I have something to tell you.

583
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:49,650
Gosh, just sit down. I don't bite!

584
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:54,750
When are you going to rest if not now? Take off your shoes, too. They don't smell!

585
00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:58,310
You shouldn't be like that.

586
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:02,880
I wanted to tell you before, the way you look at me isn't right.

587
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,360
If you keep looking at me like that, I feel like I've done something wrong.

588
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:10,990
That kiss was professionally done for the store, for the business. Wait a second. It's weird if I say it like this...

589
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:14,700
Oh yeah. Just now. It was just like that.

590
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:19,480
Anyway, you shouldn't look at someone that way.

591
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:28,300
Shin Da Hye, I'm sure you don't understand what I'm saying right now, but yes, I understand.

592
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:33,680
Damn it. I don't even know what I'm saying. Wait. I take back saying damn it.

593
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:45,630
 Please come again when we release new products. Thank you very much.

594
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:56,270
 - You said you're going to the VIP lounge, right?
- Yes.

595
00:54:56,270 --> 00:55:00,100
♬  The scent of the street at dawn ♬

596
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:05,150
♬  felt familiar and I stopped there ♬

600
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:21,240

♬   Will you give a smile as bright as moonlight?  ♬

604
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:37,600
 I did wish that time would stop right now, 
 ♬  Moonlight.

605
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:41,590
 but I really didn't do anything. I just thought it.

 ♬  (everyday) I wanna stay up all night  ♬

610
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:59,290
 I don't think you know me yet.

611
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:04,020
 But I know you, Shin Da Hye, very well.
 ♬  Even though the sleepless times are too long  ♬

612
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:06,940

♬   I want to experience the day  ♬

613
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:10,590
 I've just watched you from afar.
 ♬   that will get better.  ♬

614
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:16,510
 Uh... Is this weird, too? You probably don't understand what I'm saying.
 ♬  cuz I’m still waiting for you 
 ♬

615
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:20,030
 Yes, I understand.

616
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:26,090
 Damn it. I don't even know what I'm saying. 
♬   Because I'm longing for the awkward romance  ♬

617
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:28,490
 Wait. I take back saying damn it.
 ♬  to last a little longer.  ♬

00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:55,280

622
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:01,630
♬  cuz I’m still waiting for you  ♬

623
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:09,240
 I...I apologize.

624
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,620
 What do you think you're doing right now?

625
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:24,600
You're such a weird person.

626
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:29,170
Angry one second, strangely kind the next.

627
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:32,100
I don't know who the real you is.

628
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:35,770
I'm sure it's weird. I think it's weird too.

629
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:39,150
But who do you think made me this way?

630
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:48,440
What kind of person is Yeong Soo?

631
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:54,590
The Kim Yeong Soo this department store talks about

632
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:57,890
isn't the Yeong Soo I knew.

633
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:04,880
But you're the only one who believes in Yeong Soo.

634
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:10,710
Who was the Kim Yeong Soo you knew?

635
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:15,060
Then, who was the Kim Yeong Soo you knew?

636
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:21,960
He was stupidly kind to the point of being hardheaded.

637
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:26,850
 That's right. I did live like an idiot.

638
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,290
My opinion is the same as yours.

639
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:35,370
I'm trying my best, too, but I keep losing confidence.

640
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:40,420
I met Department Head Baek to try and clear his name.

641
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:41,850
Why Department Head Baek?

642
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:45,380
He had a delivery text on his phone.

643
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:47,250
So?

644
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:50,780
Department Head Baek seemed like he had never heard of it before.

645
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:54,450
 Does that mean the rice cake (meaning money) is still there?

646
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,970
What's wrong?

647
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,350
You did well! You did so well!

648
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:04,500
You did well!

649
00:59:08,730 --> 00:59:12,490
 Someone will come to eat up that rice cake (meaning money).

650
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:18,400
Nice shot!

651
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,580
I'm hitting well today.

652
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:22,180
Managing Director, you're sweating a lot.

653
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:24,550
Give him a tissue.

654
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:31,300
This guy. Do you know what kind of world we live in these days?

655
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:34,590
For you to use one at a time.

656
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:46,910
One, two, three.

657
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:50,100
 Which bastard is it?

658
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:20,110
 You really look excited while your employees are working to the death.

659
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:23,720
Is it too late today?

660
01:00:57,850 --> 01:01:05,940

661
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:09,860
 I will be paid the price for my life!

662
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:11,680
 It might contain my final moment.

663
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,210
 Is this better than suicide?

664
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:14,380
 What are you doing here?

665
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:16,480
 My target has been Cha Jae Gook from the start.

666
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,090
 Stop! Revenge is prohibited.

667
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:19,150
 It's not revenge!

668
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:21,220
 Like this. La la la.

669
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:22,260
 Did I ask you to?

670
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:23,710
 What did you say? A woman like you...

671
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:24,700
 Conceited.

672
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:26,050
 Let's start over.

673
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:28,160
 Let go of that hand.
