1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,370

2
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,240
 No!

3
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:33,960
 I have to get off.

4
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,820
 I saw all kinds of mayhem with dead people who didn't want to die.

5
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,260
 You're the first to jump out of the train going to heaven.

6
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,480
  The chance that will be given for you to put things back in order in the current world,

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,420
 is called Return Experience.

8
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,120
 There are three rules that you'll need to keep in mind that must be strictly observed.

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,420
 You must keep this a secret.

10
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,200
 Honey!

11
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,980
 - Oh my. 
 - Dad!

12
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,380
 Hello (converted "Yabo --honey to "Yaboseyo" --Hello")

13
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,760
 You can't get revenge.

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,320
 Gi Tak died because of you.

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,420
 Stop it, I won't hold it in.

16
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,180
 You can't get involved in a human's life.

17
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,620
 This person died because of you.

18
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,320
 What happened to the photo that was taken under the bridge?

19
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,060
 Who the hell beat up that bastard?

20
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,320
 You... What kind of person are you?

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,460
 It's destiny.

22
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:20,480
 Hey you, do I look like someone you can fool around with?

23
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,340
 Is this the only service I can get?

24
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,620
 There are some problems...

25
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,060
 Problems?

26
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,680
Your physical appearance for the Return Experience is designed by our supercomputer.

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,320
To prevent any unfortunate accident,

28
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,040
through a thorough process, whether it's a person who does not exist in the world or

29
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,820
a person who is scheduled to die, we pick the physical design.

30
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,140
 The probability of meeting someone who looks exactly the same as you is near 0%.

31
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,300
 However, there is a 0.001% that includes...

32
00:01:52,300 --> 00:02:00,380
 Something that shouldn't have happened, just happened.

33
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,560
How can that even be possible?

34
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,980
The super computer never makes a mistake.

35
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,840
The problem is...

36
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,820
 Remodeling Body - Success

37
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:19,140
 It was God's timing that the supercomputer couldn't do anything about.

38
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,920
When I get up there, I am going to file a complaint.

39
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,260
It's unfair, Customer. It wasn't me. It's the computer. The computer.

40
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,760
Then what should I do?!

41
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,000
Do you want to return?

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,260
Do you know what it took for me to get here?

43
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,700
You really won't, right?

44
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:49,160
It can't be helped since it already happened. It'll be fine as long as no one discovers it.

45
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,960
I'm sure of it.

46
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:02,360
The fact that he's hiding his identity and poking around, just like the rumors, he's being rather careful.

47
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,720
 The Chairman hugged the winner.

48
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,260
Ah this little dog.

49
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,330
Does he want to take me on?

50
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:21,880
Why? Have you come across a mutt who doesn't listen?

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,540
I know. It's really getting on my nerves.

52
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,220
Why are you pondering about it like this? All you have to do is send him my way.

53
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,760
I do have some experience in dog training.

54
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,500
No.

55
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,720
This time, I have to personally train it.

56
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,600
I personally...

57
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,830
 Sunjin Group President Cha Man Seok's Second Son (born out of wedlock)

58
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,340
  Lee Hae Joon

59
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,200
The Chairman's son...

60
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,660
Let me hear about what you know.

61
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,640
A photo? What are you talking about?

62
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,960
That night... I spoke with Han Gi Tak before he died.

63
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:19,680
Han Gi Tak, that man told me to come see you if something were to happen to him.

64
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:26,980
Han Gi Tak. It's truly a shame about what happened to him.

65
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,960
These are my honest feelings.

66
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,240
But if you came here hoping to get something, you came for the wrong reason.

67
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,540
Because of him, my situation has become difficult.

68
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:56,220
Do you really think Han Gi Tak did it? A person who only goes around beating up people.

69
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,880
- Whatever you think...
- Did you ever consider that it was a trap?

70
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,460
To catch you.

71
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,420
You were caught and the bait immediately died.

72
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,060
"I don't resent you."

73
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,080
 I don't resent you.

74
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,540
"I never did."

75
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,300
That's what he said, without knowing that he was going to die.

76
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,860
Okay fine. You are Han Gi Tak's younger sister and everything you say is right.

77
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,620
Then isn't it normal to resent someone like me?

78
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,880
Why? Did you come here to get ransom money for your brother's life?

79
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,740
The reason why I came here?

80
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,620
You were caught in a trap. Han Gi Tak is dead. And...

81
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,600
You need somebody but there is nobody to believe you.

82
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,860
That's why I came here.

83
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:35,230
That was that idiot's final request.

84
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:46,080
♬   Have you ever looked in the eyes of someone who has fallen in love♬

85
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,540
♬  In my heart which has been warmed  ♬

86
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:57,180
♬   Please hold my hand ♬

87
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,520
♬   Love is starting  ♬

88
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,560
The guest is leaving. I won't go out too far. Then.

89
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,680
It seems that you two are misunderstanding something but Han Gi Tak is not that kind of person.

90
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,140
She never touched that model bastard.

91
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:36,820
Because of that event, we were hassled by the police, were scattered and we ended up being disbanded.

92
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,400
-A misunderstanding?
-That's right!

93
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,180
He never forgot the promise he made to you guys to live lawfully.

94
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,960
A promise is something to be broken. That is what a promise is, especially for a woman.

95
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,440
-I said, that's not the case, you punk.
-From now on, it doesn't concern me.

96
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,860
Go. Don't hang around here again.

97
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,860
You rascal. The business was taken away but you didn't even do anything?

98
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,380
And Eldest Hyungnim just stood there while Na Seok Cheol took the store?

99
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,640
Eldest Hyungnim wasn't in a state to interfere.

100
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,640
What does that mean?

101
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,520
The Eldest Hyungnim had a heart attack.

102
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,620
It means that the Na Seok Cheol era has come.

103
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,400
Oh...

104
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,680
Hello?

105
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,420
Oh!

106
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,040
Ah, of course.

107
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,280
Of course. 
♬   Wherever I am filling me with   ♬

108
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,720
Mom!

109
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,420
Oh, Han Na!

110
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:43,260
♬   A memory which was lost in space   ♬

111
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,420
♬   The memories of a time I turned far away from   ♬

112
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:54,180
 Han Na, my daughter.  
♬   The memories of a time I turned far away from   ♬

113
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,620
♬   Whether it was a matter of something which was forgotten   ♬

114
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:04,380
♬   or whether it was matter of going toward somewhere   ♬

115
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:11,440
♬   I’m spending a day once again among the days I dreamed of   ♬

116
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,940
You're here?

117
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:20,080
♬   With you   ♬

118
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,560
♬   With you   ♬

119
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,240
Mom, we have big trouble. That pervert came all the way to our house.

120
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,480
Now all sorts of people look down on me.

121
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,320
Don't worry, Mom!

122
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,660
Han Na, what are you going to do?

123
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,960
I'll make it so that he won't ever come back!

124
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,440
Will it be okay?

125
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,340
What's going on?

126
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,740
Kang Jae! Hi!

127
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,340
Kang Jae, shh!

128
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,160
 Father...

129
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,880
Who are you? Why are you in front of someone's house?

130
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,260
A stranger's house...?

131
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,580
 I'm the kid's father.

132
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,920
Grandpa, it's that person. He's a real pervert!

133
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,080
No, it's not that. It's just...

134
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,780
A guest is here, why are you barking?

135
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,460
Stay still...
 Go bite him!

136
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,900
Kang Jae, bite him!

137
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,890
Let's check it out.

138
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:18,220
You rascal. You recognize me, don't you?

139
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,160
I'm sorry for dropping by so late in the evening.

140
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,870
Don't you know who I am?

141
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,530
Oh... From earlier...

142
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,770
Do you know him?

143
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,770
No, it's just that earlier at the department store, I met him briefly.

144
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,220
From the department store to here... Did you follow my Mom here?

145
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,900
No, that's not it.

146
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,100
Well I did come from behind her so I did follow but—

147
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,610
-This man must be a stalker!
-Good.

148
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:54,620
It's good that you're wary of strangers. Good work, Han Na.

149
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,970
He even knows my name!

150
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,630
Dad just—

151
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,780
I mean Ahjusshi...

152
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,220
I came to my own house and I need a reason to stay, gosh.

153
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,080
Why is this  your  house?

154
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,690
My Dad worked hard to buy this house!

155
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:10,940
Should I say that when working hard to the bone, that bone was my bone?

156
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,630
Stop it, Kang Jae.

157
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,140
It's not your first time coming to our house right?

158
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,640
Have you ever seen Kang Jae doing that to just anybody?

159
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,700
Excuse me, this is the police station right?

160
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,780
A suspicious person is here, I think he's a stalker.

161
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,330
- What are you doing now?!
- Oh my gosh!

162
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,400
No, listen I just—

163
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,480
Sit down, Kang Jae. Stop it.

164
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,130
Sit down, Kang Jae.

165
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,060
He even seduced Kang Jae.

166
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,070
Listen Da- I mean Ahjusshi isn't the type of person to do that.

167
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,390
I am going to go really nuts.

168
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,400
-Did you come from a bank?
-Pardon?

169
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,080
A bank.  Bank!

170
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:03,510
Father, why would he come from a bank? We haven't been overdue on the loan not even once.

171
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,190
This man says that this is his house.

172
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,030
Daughter-in-law, there may be something that we don't know about.

173
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:12,430
I'm not from the bank, Father. I'm from a similar...

174
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,760
Well I didn't think it'd become like this.

175
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,450
I didn't want to say this but Kim Yeong Soo has a debt to pay me.

176
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,170
That is his debt...

177
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,690
A debt?!

178
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,210
Did he take out a loan from the loan sharks?

179
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:31,980
This man must be a loan shark gangster. Just look at his attire, he's wearing a black suit.
-That's right. Tha's right.

180
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:38,030
If you'd used that perceptiveness on studying, your class president Byeong Seuk might have liked you.

181
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:42,250
Now! When you bought this house, you got a $100,000 loan and paid $200,000 with all your assets, right?

182
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:46,570
Where did that $200,000 come from? Father's retirement fund of $80,000. Your savings of $20,000.

183
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,000
-And?
-The previous house.

184
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,490
That's right the newlywed house that Kim Yeong Soo bought ten years ago.

185
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,390
 That's right. I saved and took out loans until I pooped bloody poop.

186
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,140
That's wrong with that?

187
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,860
I gave him that $100,000.

188
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,980
 Watch that mouth of yours.

189
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,900
That makes no sense.

190
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,550
On top of that, it was in cash.

191
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,270
 Stop it. What are you saying?

192
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,630
You are going to have to give me that $100,000 right now.

193
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,930
What did you say?

194
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:14,080
You can't repay me? Then this house is mine.

195
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:18,980
- Excuse me!
- Look here!

196
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:29,170

197
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:36,780
 Dad! Daaaaaaad!

198
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,770
 - You didn't go to sleep yet?
- Daaaad!

199
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:43,230
 Aigoo look how heavy you are now. Who fed you so well?

200
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,430
 Good work today.

201
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,820
 I worked hard today too, right?

202
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:51,710
 Of course!
♬   Wherever I am filling me with   ♬

203
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:56,330
 Aigoo, my daughter.
♬   A memory which was lost in space   ♬

204
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:02,470

 - Ah stop it.
♬   The memories of a time I turned far away from   ♬

205
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:06,830
 Stop, it tickles. Stop it.

206
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,150
 It tickles?

207
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:12,220
♬   Whether it was a matter of something which was forgotten   ♬

208
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,520
 Ah if you keep doing that...!

209
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,280
♬   Or whether it was matter of going toward somewhere   ♬

210

211

212
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:42,330

♬   That you are my everything   ♬

215
00:15:54,900 --> 00:16:00,370

♬   will stay within us   ♬

216
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:04,690
 - What's wrong? 
 - Oh my!

217
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,490
 This is all your fault, Dad!
♬   Forever in my every dream   ♬

218
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,500
 - It's all your fault!

219
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,930
I got dunked!

220
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,610
 She's really stuck. We need to call a plumber.
♬   With you   ♬

221
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,910
♬   With you   ♬

222
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,160
 I don't need your help!

223
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,830
Excuse me, it seems that you think that we are stupid but...

224
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:46,170
That newlywed house, with his savings, instead of company's...

225
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,470
He lied to you.

226
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,840
He paid it off diligently every month from his paycheck for seven years.

227
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:56,570
Okay. Okay. You might want to believe that but I never saw a cent.

228
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:01,820
I'm sorry, Daughter-in-law. I must've raised my son wrong.

229
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,810
You probably didn't know either, Father.

230
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,070
Because he completely fooled everybody until now.

231
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:12,400
 I'm sorry, Father and Han Na's Mom... But this is for the best.

232
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,960
- Hey Daughter-in-law...
- Mom!

233
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,520
I'm alright, Father. I'm okay.

234
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,160
Han Na, I'm fine. I'm fine. Fine.

235
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,230
I said I'm fine!! Truly.

236
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm okay.

237
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:35,190
If you are really okay, I would like to pay my respects to the deceased.

238
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,390
Pay respects to the deceased?

239
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,120
 I really did die, huh.

240
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,010
 Everything is the same here.

241
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:27,750
 The only thing missing is me.

242
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:23,990
 It's so pitiful...

243
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:36,210
He's worried that he won't get his money so he's really crying aloud.

244
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,950
It's such a great loss that I could die. Just die.

245
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,840
 Calm down. Think of something peaceful and calm. This is too much for you.

246
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,640
 It's peaceful and calm. Calm and...

247
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,490

248
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,800
Madam has sent these.

249
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,320
- We weren't notified of this.
- Then I have no choice.

250
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,410
Replace these wild chrysanthemums every day before they wither. The president likes them.

251
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,340
For more than one hour per day, take him outside in the sun to get enough vitamin D.

252
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:53,180
Maintain humidity at 45% and temperature at 23 to 25 degrees.

253
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:57,670
Play the interlude of Cavalleria Rusticana by Mascagni in the morning and evening.

254
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,230
Make sure to feed Geum-soon and Geum-dol, the names of the goldfish that he cherishes. Wait! wait!

255
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,910
Go in.

256
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,400
Hyungnim.

257
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,480
 Madam is well right?

258
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,740
 She only goes to the hospital even if she is fine.

259
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:44,770
 After I quickly retire, I want to farm with my wife.

260
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,570
 You seem very tired.

261
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:51,050
 I am tired. So, quickly take the organization from me.

262
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,970
 I still like getting physical.

263
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:56,600
 In this field, I have no family

264
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,460
 that I can trust.

265
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,510
 You came?

266
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,940
 You were here.

267
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,270
 President Han, your business is going well right?

268
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:23,450
 President Na, long time no see.

269
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:33,050
 You bastards, just try to fight again.

270
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:36,780
 Let's go for a meal, guys.

271
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,800
After getting a good rest, shake off everything and get up.

272
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,770
With your wife, you have to go plant the potatoes.

273
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,250
I'm sorry!

274
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,450
I'm really sorry.

275
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,140
After you do your business, make sure you do a good job cleaning around it.

276
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,790
- Don't forget to put down the toilet seat.
- Excuse me?

277
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:25,350
You should be considerate of the women.

278
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:30,090
After I tried peeing sitting down, it is not bad.

279
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:53,080
He really acts like this is his house. Do you think this is a restaurant?

280
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:59,720
Han Na, even if our guest were a homeless person, you shouldn't treat him that way.

281
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:10,530
Daughter-in-law, give him another bowl of rice.

282
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:12,750
We don't have any more rice.

283
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:16,790
Oh, no. He still looks hungry.

284
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,280
Oh, wait a second.

285
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,990
If it's okay with you, eat this.

286
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,510
Father-in-law!

287
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:41,510
It is said that if you eat the rice served for those who passed away, all your misfortunes will be eliminated.

288
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,150
The way you eat looks so blissful.

289
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:57,830
Just like my Yeong Soo.

290
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,360
It's been so long since I last ate home-cooked food.

291
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,780
- So, it suits your taste?
- Whether it's her cooking skills or her looks,

292
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,900
she looks exactly like his mother who passed away, so

293
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,460
he said he fell in love at first sight.

294
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,840
Were you close with my son?

295
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,820
Ah, it's not that...

296
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:22,470
Well I just heard it from him once.

297
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:31,180
 Sunjin Department Store promises you 
the best service.

298
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,930
 Wow.

299
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,560
 Isn't she pretty, Father?

300
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,700
 How is it that she looks just like Mother?

301
00:25:55,060 --> 00:26:00,170
By the way, did you receive the life insurance money?

302
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:06,440
Han Na, if you're done eating can you go back to your room?

303
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,010
Okay.

304
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,190
Let's talk one on one regarding the rest of the matters.

305
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:21,990
You should go in and rest. You must be tired from working all day.

306
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:25,720
No, I'm fine. I'll talk about that matter.

307
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,790
- I'm sorry, Daughter-in-law.
- Don't say that again.

308
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,910
Up to what point did you talk about?

309
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,170
Have you received insurance?

310
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:52,870
Even though you found out so much about our family, I guess you didn't look into the insurance.

311
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,000
I still haven't received it.

312
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,250
Is it because he committed suicide—?

313
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:01,360
Excuse me, please watch your words.

314
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,140
My daughter doesn't know that.

315
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,690
What?!

316
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,810
- Pardon me?
- That her dad committed sui—

317
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:12,700
She thinks he died of heart attack.

318
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,170
But how...

319
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:19,670
Though others freely talk about her father,

320
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,550
but to that child, he was her one and only dad.

321
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,210
How could I tell her the truth?

322
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:31,400
We quietly had the funeral among the family members, not taking in any other guests.

323
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,520
That child...

324
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,550
I thought that she should say her final goodbye to him at least.

325
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,080
 You know what?

326
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,520
 The guy who committed suicide at Sunjin Department Store is her dad, isn't it?

327
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,290
 She said he died from a heart attack.

328
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,440
 Did she lie?

329
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:12,600
♫  In love. You've never been in love. ♫

330
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:20,400
♫  Or even touch me, never.  ♫

331
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:29,070
♫  I always wonder why you never said goodbye.  ♫

332
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,650
Father-in-law, what are you doing?

333
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,550
Huh? Oh.

334
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,990
I put this out to throw it away. Why did you bring it back in?

335
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,090
It's perfectly fine so why would you throw it out?

336
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:47,710
Only your son used it. You give things away frequently.

337
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:51,490
Let's just let someone who needs it take it away.

338
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:54,860
No, I'm going to use this.

339
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,950
Ah...

340
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:59,240
Father-in-law!

341
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:05,680
These days, because I lam lacking strength...

342
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:14,040
You're not going to throw this out either?

343
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,240
This...

344
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,530
I'm going to wear these.

345
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:22,980
We can throw these books out at the very least.
♫  Without you.   ♫

346
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,990
- What?
- I'm going to read them!

347
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:28,790
You too? What's wrong with you? How could you read these kinds of books?

348
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:31,640
You always tell me to read more!

349
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:43,430
♫  I love you more.  ♫

350
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,090
Mom...

351
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:47,420
What are you doing?

352
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:52,560
Father-in-law, you can hurt yourself wearing dress shoes that don't fit. I'll buy you new ones.

353
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,770
I'll buy you new books, Han Na.

354
00:29:55,770 --> 00:30:01,250
No, don't do this. This is for Dad...! Don't.

355
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,370
- Han Na.
- I hate you, Mom!

356
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:07,310
- Mom, no!!
- What's wrong with you. Let go, Han Na.

357
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:10,300
- Why are you doing this, Mom?
- Go back inside, Father-in-law.

358
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,830
- No! No!
- Stop it!

359
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:25,590
Excuse me, Miss. It seems like you're alone since earlier.

360
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,150
Should I buy you a drink?

361
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,940
Don't be like that.

362
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:40,230
I have things on my mind that I need to quietly think over.

363
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:44,950
I will get irritated if you bother me. I have said this for the fifth time.

364
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,080
Why you little...

365
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,990
Jeez.

366
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,380
Let's go.

367
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,040
Dang.

368
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,040
 Do you know what I worry about lately?

369
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,890
 I have an offer to pose in the nude.

370
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:17,210
 Should I do this?

371
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:22,330
 To be honest, I don't have the confidence. Divorced because I had an affair.

372
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:26,530
  There is even a rumor that I am a secret mistress of a gangster.

373
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,890
 In this world,

374
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:33,500
 what do I have to do to be able to raise my own child?

375
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,060
 At this rate,

376
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:41,110
 my child is going to be taken away from me.

377
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,910
 There is no way to fall further.

378
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,650
 I don't even have anybody I can trust.

379
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,250
Now, I don't have anybody.

380
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:07,790
  Since I am in this condition, if you are talking to me about the person who is dead

381
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:13,850
  and trying to fool me, then I might end up killing you.

382
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:21,730
 That's quite...a scary talk.

383
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:26,100
 You better not talk about this to the person outside.

384
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:39,570
 So, how are you going to help me now?

385
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:50,820
To think that he urinates while sitting down...

386
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:57,460
I told him not to time and time again but he's doing it.

387
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:03,530
Aish.

388
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:08,460
Ahjumma, please give me another bottle of soju.

389
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,570
Does your father urinate while sitting down?

390
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:14,160
- How did you know?
- You've been crying about that for a whole hour now.

391
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,760
Oh have I?

392
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:22,130
Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry!

393
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:25,750
There are three kinds of unsightly men in the world.

394
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:33,030
A guy who cries while drunk, a guy who makes a scene and a guy who does both simultaneously.

395
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:37,150
Lady, I'm not usually this type of person.

396
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,260
But!

397
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:44,980
Today was so difficult!

398
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:48,030
It was very hard today.

399
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:59,150
Accept a glass of soju from me and shut up, or accept the fact about your father.

400
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:03,150
He is a great guy and that is very hard to see these days.

401
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:07,880
Just love him. That is the best you can do.

402
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,740
Father!! Father.

403
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:21,080
Life is but a fleeting moment.

404
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:26,190
As time passes by, that kind of worry is nothing.

405
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,930
You know... I've felt this since earlier but...

406
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:36,920
- Miss, you have a—
- If you're going to tell me I'm pretty, then don't.

407
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,630
You look like a pollack.

408
00:34:45,467 --> 00:34:50,527
But that's my father's name.

409
00:34:50,617 --> 00:34:54,517
Father!! Father.

410
00:34:54,517 --> 00:34:58,407
You seem to be very drunk. You should go.

411
00:34:58,407 --> 00:35:01,277
Ahjumma, how much for this table?

412
00:35:01,277 --> 00:35:02,907
You don't need to do that.

413
00:35:02,907 --> 00:35:07,207
I'll pay. You listened to my sorrows so I should pay.

414
00:35:08,007 --> 00:35:10,007
Here.

415
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:13,007
Hmm? That's weird. It should be here.

416
00:35:13,007 --> 00:35:14,917
How much is it?

417
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:17,287
It will be 48 dollars.

418
00:35:17,287 --> 00:35:19,637
Forty-eight dollars?

419
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:25,577
I'm a bit short.

420
00:35:25,577 --> 00:35:30,467
I said I'd pay! Stop this. Really.

421
00:35:35,527 --> 00:35:38,797
Didn't you hear me? I said I'm short on cash!

422
00:35:38,797 --> 00:35:43,527
That's weird. It should be here but it's not.

423
00:35:43,527 --> 00:35:47,177
Hey! Are you sleeping!?

424
00:35:48,487 --> 00:35:51,147
Are you not going to pay?

425
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:55,047
Do you have absolutely nothing?

426
00:35:55,807 --> 00:35:58,757
He looks like he's doing well for himself.

427
00:35:59,727 --> 00:36:01,847
Hey you.

428
00:36:01,847 --> 00:36:05,397
You said you'd buy alcohol for me earlier, right?

429
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:06,967
Buy it now.

430
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:11,977
You are really getting on my nerves. What did you say?

431
00:36:11,977 --> 00:36:14,517
Hah, really.

432
00:36:16,777 --> 00:36:18,107
Hey.

433
00:36:18,107 --> 00:36:22,957
Look here. Why are you standing like a moron? RUN!

434
00:36:23,387 --> 00:36:25,477
HEY!!

435
00:36:32,267 --> 00:36:37,017
One Hundred Fifty Dollars. They should've paid me without making such a fuss.

436
00:36:37,017 --> 00:36:40,287
They were making such a scene.

437
00:36:46,497 --> 00:36:49,797
Wait! Wait!

438
00:36:49,797 --> 00:36:51,547
How could you just run like that?

439
00:36:51,547 --> 00:36:55,047
I'll accept your thanks another time.

440
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:58,217
Farewell.

441
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:01,417
Hey.

442
00:37:04,047 --> 00:37:08,317
Wait a minute. The way she walks looks kind of familiar.

443
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:25,637
That's not it. I'm staying at this hotel too.

444
00:37:29,797 --> 00:37:33,267
You look familiar.

445
00:37:33,267 --> 00:37:37,607
Oh! This morning!

446
00:37:49,527 --> 00:37:53,377
Excuse me, have we really not met somewhere before?

447
00:37:53,377 --> 00:37:56,927
This is why men get cursed. You said earlier that you felt bad for your wife.

448
00:37:56,927 --> 00:37:59,747
That's not it! Aha!

449
00:38:00,817 --> 00:38:02,407
Perhaps are you a celebrity?

450
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:06,407
Even though I look like this

451
00:38:09,517 --> 00:38:12,947
Anyway, go away.

452
00:38:23,147 --> 00:38:26,007
- What are you doing?
- Hold still for a second.

453
00:38:26,007 --> 00:38:28,427
You bast—
♬  Sherry, Sherry baby   ♬

454
00:38:40,947 --> 00:38:44,567
 Just because I'm in a woman's body, have my feelings become womanly too?

455
00:38:44,567 --> 00:38:50,607
 Why is my heart beating so fast? No no. I just had too much to drink.

456
00:38:50,607 --> 00:38:54,287
For some reason, at first she looked familiar.

457
00:39:00,877 --> 00:39:04,287

♬   is all that you give me  ♬ He's tougher than he looks.

458
00:39:04,287 --> 00:39:08,457
 Wow. The smell of the rough male.

459
00:39:08,457 --> 00:39:13,967
 What the heck am I thinking? Let's fight

460
00:39:18,547 --> 00:39:22,867
 I can't be like this. Get it together, Han Gi Tak!

461
00:39:24,537 --> 00:39:26,127
Are you perhaps?

462
00:39:26,127 --> 00:39:29,927
 No... No... I'm a man!

463
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,300
Hey, really!

464
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,350
Hyung-ssi! Oh my friend!

465
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:55,620
Oh, my late friend!

466
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,790
To think that we'd meet again after being reborn. It's a pleasure to see you again.

467
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:02,980
I knew we'd meet again!

468
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,280
Aigoo.

469
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,440
To meet again!

470
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,430
This guy...

471
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,740
Aigoo...

472
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:17,670
Oh my God. Did you rescue the country in a previous life? Did you bribe some one?

473
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:21,820
What did you do?

474
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:24,610
How's it? It's nice right?

475
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:27,040
Even when I think about it, I think it's amazing.

476
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:32,600
Wow! Look at these muscles! They're similar to mine.

477
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,360
This is bad. I can't go to the sauna.

478
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,480
Why?

479
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,710
My sculpted chocolate might melt.

480
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,070
You are crazy.

481
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:46,460
Then again, you can go into the cold sauna.

482
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,700
Wait a second, Han Hyung!

483
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,050
Then I'll be a cold frosted chocolate.

484
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:56,110
Hmmm. It tastes so sweet.

485
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,620
You don't even need a wash board.

486
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,930
By the way,

487
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,920
Your has your manhood been re-engineered too?

488
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,880
No. Stop! That is a bit too much.

489
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,920
Let me see it.

490
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,000
Ah come on! Hyung, it's a bit awkward.

491
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,350
Hey, You.

492
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:23,400
Do you see me as a woman? Yes.

493
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,680
Oh my!

494
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,760
Am I pretty? Do I make your heart flutter? Huh? Huh?

495
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,370
I don't know.

496
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:35,460
Don't refuse me.

497
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,380
Alright. Alright.

498
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,080
Alright.

499
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,450
Because we are comrades from heaven, I'll describe it to you.

500
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,810
Did I commit so much sin? Huh?

501
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,370
Shh.

502
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:55,430
Don't let it get to you.

503
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,650
But you have something I don't have.

504
00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:00,490
Even two of them.

505
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,370
So what?

506
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:07,460
What did I do wrong?

507
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,960
While you were creating them,

508
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,350
you could've added this much. Just this much more.

509
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:16,380
How stingy can you be? Really!

510
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,420
Hey you.

511
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,390
Let's talk about it later.

512
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:25,600
Even though you keep it secret from the child, how long will you be able to go on like this?

513
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,670
If she thinks her dad received bribes and committed suicide...

514
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:33,030
I can't give the child that kind of hurt.

515
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:35,950
I will clear my name with my own two hands.

516
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:38,090
You will? The guy heavily in debt?

517
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,550
Anyway, Hyung Han. Do you not have this kind of symptom?

518
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:46,410
The symptom of my mouth blabbering against my will.

519
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:49,010
I think it's a side effect.

520
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:59,500
It's a serious side effect.

521
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:10,350

522
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:13,920
 My Happiness Han Na.  Jung Ji Hoo Director.My woman Da Hye.

523
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,690
 Oh my daughter!

524
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:23,550
 Stop drinking and come home quick!

525
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:27,090
 Dad is on his way!

526
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:29,490
 I'll be home soon.

527
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:32,630
♬   There is only you in...  ♬

528
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:35,980
You said that you'd be home soon.

529
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,900
But whenever you open your mouth, you lie.

530
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:44,100
♬  Pretending not knowing how I feel  ♬

531
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:50,290
♬   I love you, you're aware of that  ♬

532
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:52,610
♬   Don't hide from...  ♬

533
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:55,140
 You deserted your home and committed your whole body to your work.

534
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:59,110
 Shouldn't your salary be as high as what your life is worth?

535
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:03,290
♫  I'm waiting  ♫

536
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:08,890
♫  I'm hurting like this.  ♫

537
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,680
It's me.

538
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,970
My itinerary has changed a bit.

539
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:32,370
Because of the bad weather, the plane made an emergency landing in Japan.

540
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:35,570
For some reason, I have been on stand-by for hours because no seats are available.

541
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:38,820
He said that due to the circumstances, he can come to Korea tomorrow.

542
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:42,550
Even though he has already been secretly inspecting the department store,

543
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:44,110
pretend you don't know that.

544
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:47,490
He might need some time to quietly check things out for himself.

545
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,900
Yes.

546
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:55,240
He says to stop joking around and come here immediately.

547
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:01,710
 He means to test my ability from the start.

548
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:03,160
 Alright.

549
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,820
 If there is no path, I will make one, Father.

550
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,930
 No, CEO.

551
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:09,780
 Watch and see.

552
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:14,300
 Even if you never accept me as your son, through my own ability,

553
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:17,040
 I will take your place.

554
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,480
Aish!

555
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,780
You came again.

556
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,020
Where are you trying to go?

557
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:32,630
Hey, kiddo. Isn't it time for you to quit, now?

558
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:34,500
This is the right place.

559
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,440
You think anyone would be fooled by just changing the sign?

560
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,150
Give me my dad's necklace!

561
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:41,990
I don't have anything like that!

562
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:44,900
This tiny kid is so stubborn.

563
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,220
Leave!

564
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:49,450
Just try coming one more time.

565
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:50,870
Leave!

566
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,940
Ahjusshi.

567
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:01,890
Do you not know my dad's necklace, either?

568
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:03,760
No, I don't know.

569
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:07,830
Necklace?

570
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:09,930
The Beauty and the Beast?

571
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:11,820
You do know.

572
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,610
Where is my dad's necklace?

573
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:17,070
I feel like I know but don't know.

574
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:19,640
Find it for me, please.

575
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:24,090
That's an article my dad left behind.

576
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:32,900
Child, I'll find the necklace no matter what,

577
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:36,000
so don't worry about it. Promise.

578
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,190
That's right.

579
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:54,200
There are many people who can prove I didn't commit suicide.

580
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,760
If I look, there will be a lot of evidence.

581
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:00,060
I need to tell Han Na's mom.

582
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,320
Welcome!

583
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:10,000
Welcome, Branch Manager.

584
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,990
Welcome, Branch Manager.

585
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,010
That humble attitude towards customers.

586
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:22,080
As expected!

587
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:31,740
That humble attitude towards customers, as expected!

588
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,280
Why are they calling me Branch Manager?

589
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:46,360
Did you not know?

590
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,240
The new Branch Manager

591
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:51,240
is Lee Hae Joon.

592
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,190
Why would you

593
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:57,600
- tell me that just now?!
- Well aren't I telling you now?

594
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,110
I am also trying my hardest.

595
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:04,910
I've been up all night taking care of Lee Hae Joon.

596
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,170
So, where is that person right now?

597
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,220
Hey, there won't be any problems, right?

598
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,620
Don't worry.

599
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:25,280
Though it looks worn out, it works great because it is well taken care of.

600
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,960
Okay, okay?

601
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,430
No, I meant that person. Will he be okay?

602
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,940
He's traveled between Korea and Japan so often

603
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:38,980
that he could do it with his eyes closed.

604
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:50,570
Bye!

605
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:52,800
Have a safe trip!

606
00:48:53,700 --> 00:49:00,760
♬   Let's go, let's go at home , let's go ♬

608
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:08,570
How many hours will this take?

609
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,110
I have important business to attend to.

610
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:13,490
Yes? What time will we arrive?

611
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:16,130
What is the fastest bird in the world?

612
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:17,960
In the blink of an eye!
 (Pun on "sae" meaning bird. Phrase is "noon kkam jjack hal sae")

613
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:21,010
We'll arrive in the blink of an eye, you free rider!

614
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:23,340
And there isn't a person more busy than me, here.

615
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:25,200
You're Korean?

616
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,400
Also, how am I a free rider? I paid $250.

617
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,160
You must've gotten scammed, too.

618
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,880
It doesn't matter because we're going to Seoul anyway. Just take a nap on the way!

619
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,210
Goddamnit.

620
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:41,820
Good Morning! JO224 to Seoul!

621
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:46,030
Good morning, JJ224. Radio contact. Radio contact.

622
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:48,460
VFR maintains your navigation.

629
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:26,920
Aigoo!

630
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,340
Aigoo, Department Head Ma.

631
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:32,930
How do you know me? What in the world!

632
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:37,390
Did you already memorize all of our names and positions? I respect you, Branch Manager.

633
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:39,030
I am... the Branch Manager?

634
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:43,860
I thought you would be a little overwhelmed with a lot of employees, so I came here alone.

635
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:47,070
Ah to escort me... (Spoken at the highest level of respect to another)

636
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:48,950
Then escort me quickly. 
  (Ending with no politeness in his speech)

637
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:52,240
Yes, of course. Let us go.

638
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:07,870
  Nobody can look at me properly without a risk to their job, like I couldn't look when I was in their shoes.

639
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:10,190
 I'm sorry, President!

640
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:18,590
I am really sorry for not recognizing you yesterday.

641
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:20,350
But you recognize me today?

642
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:21,950
Ah yes.

643
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:25,630
Yesterday, you didn't know my name. Today, you do. Perhaps you won't recognize me tomorrow. Are you usually confused?

644
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:28,000
Ah ha ha... I'm sorry.

645
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,710
Your brain is old. That's why this is happening. Do some exercise instead of sitting at your office desk all day.

646
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:36,320
Your words are gold to me.

647
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:38,650
Department Head Ma?

648
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:41,950
To think you'd call crazy ol' me by name... Yes Branch Manager.

649
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:44,670
- Department Head Ma?
- Yes, Branch Manager.?

650
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:46,110
Department Head Ma.

651
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:48,760
Yes, Branch Manager!?

652
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,510
Thank you. Have a nice day.

653
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:54,670
Ma Sang Sik.

654
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:57,710
Thank you for calling me so casually, Branch Manager.

655
00:51:57,710 --> 00:51:58,700
Who am I?

656
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,050
You are the Branch Manager.

657
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:01,880
Who?

658
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:05,000
Branch Manager Lee Hae Joon.

659
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,120
I can't hear you.

660
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:13,800
You, manager, are Branch Manager Lee Hae Joon. Everyone! This is Department Store Branch Manager Lee Hae Joon!

661
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:29,170
Han Na. What are you doing here?

662
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:32,140
She's asking if Manager Kim bought this here.

663
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:37,250
He probably bought it with an employee's discount right?

664
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,330
Thank you! You're so handsome!

665
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:45,350
- Thank you.
- My name is Lee Jung Hee.

666
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:58,990
Why is  she  here?

667
00:52:58,990 --> 00:53:02,970
Who's this? Long time no see.

668
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:10,390
Oh! I didn't even recognize you! How have you been? You've become more beautiful.

669
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:14,210
My appetite has come back again after not seeing you.

670
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:17,170
Your humor is the same as well.

671
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,800
It was nice seeing you again.

672
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,270
Yep.

673
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:26,670
Oh right. I forgot to ask you, why did you do it?

674
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:29,540
- What?
- Why did you do that to me?

675
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:37,260
I've been really curious about it. Why exactly did you do that to me?

676
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,830
Long time no see, Executive Director Oh.

677
00:53:57,830 --> 00:54:01,560
Ah yes. But why are you here?

678
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,940
Why else would I come to a department store? To buy clothes, of course.

679
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:08,590
I'm sorry but what do you think of going to another location?

680
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:17,060
I'm sorry. The other customers can be uncomfortable about this.

681
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:56,290
You seem to have forgotten but I am also a customer.

682
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:58,180
Excuse me!

683
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:18,820
-Excuse me... 
 - Yes. I am the Branch Manager. You're surprised, right? In addition to looks, I have ability.

684
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:21,880
How were you acquainted with my husband?

685
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:27,680
Uhhh... You could say he's like an alter ego. Close enough to lend that much money.

686
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,580
I've never heard about you before.

687
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:33,990
Of course not! Because Kim Yeong Soo keeps his secrets well.

688
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:38,340
That's why I like that friend. As you can see, I am an important person.

689
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:42,790
Show me the promissory note then. He was the type who was unable to live with debt.

690
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:48,700
Do you think that I carry that around here and here to show you?

691
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:51,400
I'll show you later on.

692
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,910
Don't be suspicious for no reason and work hard.

693
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:58,460
Your manager is watching so you could get fired. And if you want to pay back...

694
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:01,440
Isn't that woman crazy?

695
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:08,250
She asked me why I did it. What am I supposed to say?

696
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,370
I'm sorry.

697
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,980
Excuse me!

698
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:32,990
I think we switched phones.

699
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:34,930
Oh you're right!

700
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:38,360
Oops! Sorry!

701
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:55,360
374-75187, 374-75187, 374-75187.

702
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:00,080
 Excuse me!

703
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:09,160
374-75187, what a difficult number.

704
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:13,530
Okay, there we go.

705
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,700
What are you planning?

706
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:31,850
Do you think I give you all a monthly salary for you to just greet me with something anyone can do? Fire them all.

707
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:33,390
Yes.

708
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:41,440
See. Everybody is waiting in anticipation. Quickly get rid of that woman.

709
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,950
Yes.

710
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:47,490
You're the president right?

711
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:50,020
Nope, you got the wrong person.

712
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:52,810
You're the president Cha Jae Gook.

713
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:58,690
The chairman said to fire Manager Noh today.

714
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,520
This isn't some small shop. Why? Just tell him to destroy this shop.

715
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:09,070
If you leave within five minutes, a situation like that won't occur.

716
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:12,050
I've been his family member for 20 years.

717
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:14,300
How could he do that?

718
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:17,100
Fine! I'll go then.

719
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:20,120
When you're done with the alteration, please send this to me by mail.

720
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:22,640
Yes, I understand.

721
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,260
One minute has passed.

722
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:28,330
Have you always run this department like this?

723
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:32,260
You can't identify people and you're treating customers this way.

724
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:42,870
If you were uncomfortable today, I am truly sorry. From next time, I will be sure to not let this kind of situation happen again.

725
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:44,920
We're sorry.

726
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:57,110
Your noonim is coming out. Shouldn't you go?

727
00:58:57,110 --> 00:58:58,550
What are you planning?

728
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:00,790
I need to know who hired this guy.

729
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:03,770
Then on purpose you... Did you two plan this?

730
00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:08,090
I'm simply checking if my theories are true or not.

731
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:11,870
First, he's going to start being afraid when he sees Song Yi Yeon.

732
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:15,800
The theory that Na Seok Cheol's gang eliminated Yoo Hyeok.

733
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:21,480
Then, there's Na Seok Cheul, the mastermind of this, who defeated Song Yi Yeon.

734
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:26,120
Please help me, President! My dad didn't commit suicide!

735
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:31,670
There must be something wrong! He's not the kind of person to do that! Please help me!

736
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:33,560
- You should let go of this.
- Please help!

737
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:36,540
Han Na, you can't be like this.

738
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,330
I'm sorry, President.

739
00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:40,850
Who is this kid?

740
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:43,990
She's the deceased Manager Kim's daughter.

741
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:50,550
I have evidence here. He bought a present to give to my mom so he wouldn't have done something like committing suicide!

742
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:54,090
Please help! Please!

743
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:58,360
Please help me, President! Please help!

744
01:00:43,870 --> 01:00:52,460

745
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:56,520
 Epilogue

746
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:11,930
Look here! Excuse me, get it together!

747
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:26,790
Nooooooooo!!!

748
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:30,430
♫  It's such a warm feeling, yeah.  ♫

749
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:36,820
♫  Let's start anew. Fell so good, alright. I'm flying high.  ♫

750
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:39,610
 Good morning!

751
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:41,670
 He's not that great after all.

752
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:43,120
 Those types of guys are easy to control.

753
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,420
 A girl is all about attitude.

754
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:46,990
 What did that bastard Na Seok Cheul do that you're being like this?

755
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:48,280
 GO AWAY!

756
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:51,250
  People like you don't care about people dying because of money

757
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:55,040
 She wants to forget Han Gi Tak.

758
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,750
 I will find it. I will definitely find it.

759
01:01:56,750 --> 01:02:00,420
 Both you and I have a long way to go.
