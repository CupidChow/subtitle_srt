1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:10,040

2
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,770
Is my older brother

3
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:52,170
Han Gi Tak? I know it doesn't make sense, but

4
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:58,150
lately I keep having the same dream.

5
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,280
With his big hands,

6
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,090
there was someone teaching me how to jab.

7
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,520
Bit by bit, it's becoming more clear.

8
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:18,330
When I heard the name Han Gi Tak, strangely I started to tear up.

9
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:25,570
When I saw this, it was as if the pieces of the puzzle were coming together.

10
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:30,940
But if you are that person's younger sibling,

11
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:37,390
then could it be just my fantasy after hearing about your older brother?

12
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:46,130
I lived using your name.

13
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,510
Because he wanted to see you,

14
00:01:55,090 --> 00:02:01,110
your brother gave me that name.

15
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,500
Hong Nan...

16
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,260
That's my name?

17
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,740
Han Hong Nan.

18
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,060
While calling me Hong Nan,

19
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:25,690
he raised me like a real sibling.

20
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,490
He never forgot about you for a moment.

21
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,440
You...

22
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:43,450
But, after this moment, don't say that name out loud.

23
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:47,690
Han Hong Nan and Han Gi Tak.

24
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,930
Could it be...

25
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,630
that my older brother, like everybody's been saying,

26
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,030
he died that way?

27
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,010
Da Hye.

28
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,640
Your brother, remember him as you see him in this picture.

29
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,780
He would want you to remember up to that point.

30
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,280
Rather than you living as Han Hong Nan,

31
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,010
he would want you to live as Da Hye.

32
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,610
This is all that I can tell you.

33
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:31,230
♬   That you are my everything   ♬

34
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,730
♬   will stay within us   ♬

35
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:44,240
♬   While being conscious of that and considering that I will hug you ♬

36
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,100
 Final Episode
 You were really surprised right?

37
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:52,010
This feeling of mine that everyone that I love falls into misfortune. Do you know?

38
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,320
This is why I couldn't tell you.

39
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,970
The one who found your older brother

40
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,810
is Jeong Ji Hoon.

41
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,300
- What?
- It seems like he's been looking for your family for a while.

42
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:14,790
On the day Kim Yeong Soo died, that's why he met you at Big Wolf. Han Gi Tak was the chef there.

43
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,810
Jeong Ji Hoon did?

44
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,980
To you, who lost your husband, he couldn't tell you about your older brother.

45
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,880
You are someone who went through times which were worse than any other person.

46
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,960
That isn't your fault. Everyone is worried.

47
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,070
I don't think I have the right to say this to you, because you rejected me.

48
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,110
It's laughable, but the words I want to say...

49
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,100
is that you are a woman who received a lot of love.

50
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,990
So don't think stupid thoughts.

51
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,570
I lost both my husband and older brother.

52
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,460
Strangely, the loss hasn't driven me insane.

53
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,580
Nevertheless, I think I can bear it because of the love I received.

54
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,070
Could you please not look at me like that.

55
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:18,230
With the look that you know everything. Exactly what are you, Lee Hae Joon?

56
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,030
A friendly person staying at your house.

57
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:26,100
I am leaving the day after tomorrow, Ahjumma.

58
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,700
 Sunjin Department Store President
Cha Jae Wook

59
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,730
Why? Did you come to congratulate me?

60
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,080
You should have at least brought cake and some flowers.

61
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,920
You too...

62
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:59,690
If you met another person instead of me, would you have been more happy?

63
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,100
We're both killing each other.

64
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,560
No matter how much we hurt, it won't be as much as someone who's already dead.

65
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,430
It's just so hard now.

66
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,690
Let's just end it here.

67
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,370
What are you talking about?

68
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,830
Let's cut ties and live well.

69
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,760
After I settle matters here, I'm going to take Yeong Chan and go far away.

70
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,760
I came here to tell you that.

71
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:47,920
Branch Manager.

72
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,590
Branch Manager. No, CEO.

73
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:01,590
You look really, really, really, really handsome today.

74
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,440
Department Head Ma.

75
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,450
You calling my name like that makes me excited. Yes, Branch Manager.

76
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,890
If I do weird things from now on, please understand.

77
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,010
Differently than the other Branch Managers, you constantly

78
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,490
did do some extremely weird things though.

79
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:18,950
Let's embrace each other.

80
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,720
- What?
- Come now.

81
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,050
It's my first time so it may be awkward.

82
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:35,310
Oh my. Does this mean, I'm in Lee Hae Joon's line?

83
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,340
Is it confirmed, President?

84
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,430
Why are we drinking in the middle of the day?

85
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:01,300
When will I experience the taste of soju with you guys again?

86
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:06,760
When I go back to America, I won't be able to taste it for a long time.

87
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:10,990
I'm sad. You're starting to say those things again.

88
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,420
Is there no soju in America?

89
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,340
You're leaving?

90
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:21,260
I only came here on vacation briefly. Since I played around a lot, I need to go back.

91
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,740
You can just play with us.

92
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:28,080
Protect the restaurant well between the two of you.

93
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,290
Don't ruin the Big Wolf that we finally got back.

94
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:36,750
Especially you.

95
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:41,090
The cook with no taste buds, stop scolding the kids and you practice your cooking, okay?

96
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,040
Okay!

97
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:49,650
Seung Jae, take care of Yi Yeon.

98
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:58,810
I'll be the one to protect Song Yi Yeon and Big Wolf, so don't worry.

99
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,900
And the meat soup for our Hyungnim,

100
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:08,320
I am in charge of it, so don't worry about that either.

101
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,100
Alright, I feel reassured.

102
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,500
Wait a little longer.

103
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,650
Before you leave, I will catch Na Seok Cheol and get him locked up.

104
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,440
Seung Jae.

105
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,680
I know how he moves, I'm close.

106
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,800
- So...
- That's not what Han Gi Tak would want.

107
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,160
The revenge you want, he would never want you to do that.

108
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:58,430
 Noonim! Sister is going back to America and I just wanted you to know.

109
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:03,380
 She nagged at us a lot today and left.

110
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,280
Should we try it again?

111
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,740
Yes, let's go.

112
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:12,190
That's great, Yi Yeon. A little bit more.

113
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:16,180
Okay! Good!

114
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,990
That's right.

115
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,710
You'll do well on your own.

116
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,460
Everyone's around, right? I'm going to count to three and take it.

117
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,040
One, two, three! I took it.

118
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,130
One more time. One, two, three!

119
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:49,890
I took it! One more time!

120
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,740
Should we take a look?

121
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,620
Hey, Seung Jae—

122
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,400
Na Seok Cheol!

123
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,620
Are you the one who killed Gi Tak?

124
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,340
That question is so freaking annoying.

125
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,940
Hey you. Am I not allowed to kill Han Gi Tak or something?

126
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,520
I killed him because there was a reason to kill him! Bastard!

127
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,770
Get rid of this bastard.

128
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,450
So annoying.

129
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,740
Should we get rid of Han Gi Tak's sister today too?

130
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:03,360
Yeah, we should let her go on the rooftop and send her to her brother.

131
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,740
You try to stay alive. By tomorrow, it'll all be over.

132
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,030
Yeah!

133
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,720
Hello?

134
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,420
  Yeah, this is the real estate office. Do you know who Han Gi Tak is?

135
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,750
Excuse me?

136
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:38,700
Oh, I couldn't get in contact with the relatives. Do you not know Han Gi Tak?

137
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,390
Yes, I know him.

138
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,800
I have Han Gi Tak's items.

139
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,450
It's been a while and I'm not sure if I'm supposed to throw them away or what.

140
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:54,110
Come by quickly and retrieve them. That way we can put the room up for sale.

141
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,550
Uh, okay.

142
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,130
I'll come.

143
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,430
This is fun.

144
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,690
Hello? Come quick!

145
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,720
 Hong Nan

146
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:26,400
I"m sorry. There isn't that much that I can say to you.

147
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:37,070
You brat! Where are you? You left Yi Yeon alone.

148
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,040
Hello?

149
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,250
You...

150
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,430
Don't come...

151
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:50,030
Choi Seyng Jae! What's wrong with your voice?

152
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:55,440
Don't you come! Na Seok Cheol...

153
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,800
is looking for you.

154
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:11,970
Are you there? Excuse me.

155
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:22,150

156
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,410
Hello, ma'am.

157
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,830
 Blocked number

158
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,860
Hello?

159
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,720
Hello?

160
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,950
 Have you met... this person?

161
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:58,460
  The person who used to live here, Han Gi Tak.

162
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:07,670
Of course. He lived in this house for over ten years so I know him very well.

163
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,980
 Hey, Mister Mighty Branch Manager.

164
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:21,970
If I hit you that hard, the least you could've done is break a bone somewhere as a curtesy. Don't you think so?

165
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,540
Making the guy who hit you so embarrassed.

166
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,910
Na Seok Cheol!

167
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:30,510
Hurry and bring the secret bank code.

168
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:33,750
If you want to see her live,

169
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,270
the sister of Han Gi Tak whom you care so much about.

170
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,870
Hello?!

171
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:10,280
Da Hye is with Na Seok Cheol!

172
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,340
- What ?
- This bastard was eyeing the secret bank account.

173
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,550
No! If you hand over that account, Da Hye will be in more danger.

174
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,580
Then what do you want me to do? Leave them be?!

175
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,990
No! It's my fault, I'll take care of it.

176
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:15,980
 I lived under your name. Because he missed you,

177
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,640
 your brother gave me that name.

178
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,900
Oppa...

179
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:41,840
Clean out slowly. We have lots of time.

180
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,740
Seung Jae...

181
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:15,880
Seung Jae! Keep it together! Did Na Seok Cheol do this to you?

182
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,480
How long have you been like this?!

183
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:29,110
I told you... yesterday.

184
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:32,150
You brat!

185
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,770
I told you not to do this kind of thing!

186
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:39,250
Go.

187
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,870
Seung Jae!

188
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:45,400
Help!

189
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,580
Excuse me! Call 911 please!

190
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:56,750
Seung Jae! Wake up! Choi Seung Jae!!

191
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,210
You packed everything up, I see.

192
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,920
Do you want to have something to drink? I have something to tell you.

193
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:14,600
It's fine. It's late, I'll leave.

194
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,480
I really don't like repeating myself.

195
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,860
What are you doing now?

196
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:26,520
What do you mean? All I want to do is talk about something.

197
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,630
Han Na's father... Yeong Soo...

198
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,240
Don't do that!

199
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,910
Branch Manager...

200
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:03,130
- You're finally here! 
 - Are you all right?

201
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,640
But you, Branch Manager. Did you come empty handed?

202
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,870
Na Seok Cheol, stop it or you'll end up going to hell.

203
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:14,230
Yes, I want to go to hell so I'm living like this.

204
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,290
Come here.

205
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:24,870
I won't die. I won't die. I won't die because I've already died once.

206
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,480
Come here!

207
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,620
Come here!

208
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,320
Come here, I said!

209
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,120
This punk.

210
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:23,840
Where is the secret bank code?! I don't have time to play with you like this!

211
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,830
I'm the one who has the least amount of time.

212
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:33,900
I'm the one who worked for fifteen years for a crappy company!

213
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,960
You really don't get what I'm saying.

214
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:56,040
I don't know about anything else, but I will protect Da Hye.

215
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,720
Try and protect her.

216
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,960
No! No! Please don't!

217
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,610
Da Hye doesn't know anything! Don't touch Da Hye!

218
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:08,690
This bastard, really...

219
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,790
It came out well.

220
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,250
Hong Nan...

221
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:29,130
 Show me your face since I have to leave soon.

222
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:33,180
 Noonim, sister said she was going to go back to America.

223
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:44,220
 How could I die, leaving you alone, Song Yi Yeon?

224
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:55,790
 He doesn't resent you. He never has.

225
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:01,950
 Meet a good person. Beside you

226
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:07,270
 like a friend, like family, someone who can be there for you like that.

227
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,210
Where is the secret bank code?!

228
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:43,230
You cute pair. I should eat both of you.

229
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,370
 Na Seok Cheol!!

230
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:50,750
Isn't that what you want?

231
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:55,800
Yes! That's it!

232
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,300
Give it to Oppa.

233
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,400
Are you okay?

234
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:03,990
I'm okay. Don't cry.

235
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,980
Give it. Hurry and give it to me.

236
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,220
You, is living like this worth it to you?

237
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,410
Yeah. It's worth living.

238
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:16,650
Thus, pretty, give it me when I'm nicely asking you.

239
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:20,190
You try and come get it, you bastard.

240
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:33,970

241
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:52,130
How many people are you going to kill? Wasn't Han Gi Tak enough?

242
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:57,120
Big Hyungnim, Seung Jae, and now even them. Are you going to kill all of them just for that money?

243
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,290
What's wrong with money?

244
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:03,010
Do I have to lose to Han Gi Tak my whole life?

245
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:06,100
He should be thankful to Song Yi Yeon's father,

246
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:12,450
because he made the person who made my face like this linger around all this time.

247
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:13,610
What are you saying?

248
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:16,840
He's been following me around my whole life,

249
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,920
just blocking my way. That's Han Gi Tak!

250
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,280
- Don't!
- Let's stop now.

251
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,790
No!

252
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,720
Don't do it!

253
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,290
It's mine!

254
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:55,990
Hong Nan! No!

255
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,500
Save me! Save me!

256
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,350
This crazy...

257
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,920
No! Let go of his hand!

258
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:11,320
Don't! I was wrong! I did bad things!

259
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,080
Yeah, let's stop now... Seok Cheol.

260
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,350
No! Let go of his hand!

261
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:23,460
I wish for you to be happy.

262
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,380
The people I love.

263
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,230
Don't! You can't leave me!

264
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:34,530
My sister, until the last moment,

265
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:38,380
I leave her to you, Brother-in-law.

266
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,310
Don't be like this! No!

267
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,010
 Bye, you Ugly One.

268
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,040
Oppa...

269
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:01,010
No!

270
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:04,320
No! Please...

271
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,680
Don't go! Please!

272
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,590
No!

273
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:43,100
 Thank you for loving my sister so much.

274
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:51,600
 Among the reasons we came back, there must be a reason The One up there felt pity for us, so

275
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,640
 He wanted us to know one thing before we left.

276
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:04,160
 To me, I think one of those things is you, Kim Yeong Soo.

277
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,210
No!

278
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:20,330

279

Yes officer, so Na Seok Cheol...

318
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:08,230
 We don't know the details for sure yet, but we think it was because of a fall.

319
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,950
 Nonetheless, thank you for your cooperation.

320
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:12,290
Yes, you worked hard.

321
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:49,950
 I told you if you cry everywhere, you're the Ugly One, right? If someone makes fun of you, what do you do?

322
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:52,800
 One two, one two!

323
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,580
 That's right.

324
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,700
  That's right, you look cool, my dongsaeng.

325
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:10,390
Memories of Han Gi Tak will be erased from people's minds.

326
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:16,500
I will... I will remember those moments.

327
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,070
Ahjumma, are you okay?

328
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,590
-Branch Manager. 
 - Huh?

329
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,770
Huh?

330
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:43,630
- Hae Joon... 
 - Yes.

331
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,120
Yes.

332
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,350
Why are you looking at me like that?

333
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,230
I was glad to meet you.

334
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,390
How is it? It's warm, right?

335
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:13,280
Ahjussi, this is quite...

336
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,720
Winter isn't for a long time.

337
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,180
Hey! What are you saying.

338
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:23,250
Here, this is Han Na's first bra!

339
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:32,340
And this is perfume, rose and a kiss for Valentine's Day...

340
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:37,170
Kiss? If you get a boyfriend,

341
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:39,510
tell Mom and Grandpa and get permission, okay?

342
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:44,260
And you have to make sure it's someone as good as your dad, okay?

343
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:48,950
Yes, yes. But, what is this one?

344
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,820
Is it a crown?

345
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:59,890

346
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:09,010
This is a tiara. This is what brides wear for their wedding.

347
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:15,270
Your dad would have liked it if he saw you wearing a wedding dress.

348
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,950
I'm going to marry you.

349
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:27,580
- Huh?
- Let's practice.

350
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:05,810
 It's nothing you force. It's something that comes naturally, that's what family is.

351
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,870
 He is looking handsome lately.

352
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:02,900
 I'm not going to miss you Father, so you stay here

353
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:07,930
 and watch Han Na get married and have kids.

354
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:11,860
 After all of that, let's meet again.

355
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:19,490
 Father, I was happy to be your son.

356
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:50,680
♫  I close my eyes again and again.  ♫

357
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:57,650
♫  I can't erase our brief memories.  ♫

358
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:04,740
♫  I keep staring blankly at your name  ♫

359
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:10,780
♫  I love you, I love you.  ♫

360
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:16,780
♫  Don't leave. Don't go without me  ♫

361
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:23,820
♫  On a day without you, I think I am going to keep on crying  ♫

362
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:32,350
♫  It hurts so much. It seems like you're really going to come  ♫

363
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:37,760
♫  I close my eyes again.  ♫

364
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:46,750
 The sister I abandoned but didn't take off the family registry.

365
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:53,090
 Now I will be the real Hong Nan. This is the only way to protect that child.

366
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,140
 Hold onto this photo for me,

367
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,880
 no matter what happens to me, so that she can move the money with this code.

368
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:08,990
 This time, no matter what, I will protect her.

369
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:16,250
♬  It feels like you'll really appear, if I close my eyes again   ♬

370
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:20,280
Good work, Hyung Han.
♬   If I close my eyes again  ♬

371
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:28,090
♬  you will appear.   ♬

372
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,830
Eat before you leave.

373
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,710
It's curry.

374
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:48,920
When I first got married and didn't know how to cook,

375
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,210
I only made curry every day.

376
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:59,010
Even after eating curry for 365 days, he never complained once.

377
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:06,010
Since that person left, it's my first time making it again.

378
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:11,200
 Yes, I wish for you to become a little bit more comfortable.

379
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:27,170
Like you said before, it would be good if we never saw each other again.

380
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:32,160
If we see each other by chance, let's pretend that we don't know each other.

381
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,550
Don't act like you know me because I'm going to act like I don't know you.

382
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,280
I won't.

383
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,970
Even if I'm rude and say mean things, don't cry about it to yourself.

384
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:52,400
Insult me like a cool person and just turn around.

385
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,770
I understand.

386
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:08,990
  Thank you to Channel managers:
pilar_velasquez &amp; tompark

387

389
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:39,080
 Thank you to The Possessed seggers cont.:
cgwm808, bjohnsonwong, laura_garrido, tompark

390
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,110
I thought I would have some soju with Hyungnim on the train ride to heaven.

391
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:50,940
It's a relief though that there will be someone who will remember Han Gi Tak.

392
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,780
He left coolly right?

393
00:43:55,710 --> 00:44:00,210
Refusing the train to heaven, was it worth it returning here?

394
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:03,790
Of course! If I hadn't come back, things would have been really bad!

395
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:23,110
What is it? Do you still have lingering attachments?

396
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:29,450
While I hoped for her not to realize it was me,

397
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:32,680
I still hoped for her to realize it was me.

398
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:37,710
Oh, I thought you had something you didn't say.

399
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:42,700
I didn't say my farewells to her.

400
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:47,880
To say goodbye.

401
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:59,690
 Today my favorite curry has appeared once again!

402
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:08,080
 Thank you to The Possessed subbers:
dolcehime, changhuh, itsjoo, yiji1997, sera19_27

403

404
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:23,440
 To Han Na's mom that I love, my Da Hye.

405
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,530
 For meeting such an incompetent husband, you're going through a lot aren't you?

406
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:31,390
 I told you I'd make you happy yet all I've done was to make you go through hard times. I'm sorry.

407
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:36,620
 But one day, with Han Na and you,

408
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:39,860
 I will become a Kim Yeong Soo for whom you won't be embarrassed.

409
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:45,670
 I'm always thankful and I love you.

410
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:56,030

411
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:05,680
You've worked hard, today as well.

412
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:11,540
 You've worked hard today as well.

413
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:14,180
 I worked hard today as well.

414
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:25,080
 Thank you so much to Translation Editors: 
Changhuh and Yiji1997

You also like me are crying. ♬

429
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,240
Even after the marriage, you constantly had projects.

430
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:13,870
You are playing the role of a woman who has fallen deeply in love.

431
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:17,740
Do you perhaps have a special love that you have experienced?

432
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:22,870
I wonder. I don't know when it started, but

433
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:25,610
from somebody

434
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:29,870
I get the feeling that I've received an overwhelming love.

435
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:34,830
Even during hard times, I endured with that strength.

436
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:39,920
I have really become peaceful.

437
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:49,390
A new road?

438
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:51,300
Yes, that is the case.

439
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,520
What did you do before coming here?

440
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:55,130
I held a knife.

441
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:57,460
I like men who cook.

442
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:04,040
Noonim. Rather than a cook, what do you think about a barista?

443
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:14,150
My son. Mommy really really misses you.

444
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:17,640
Mommy is almost there so wait just a little longer.

445
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,900
What do you want to eat? Chicken?

446
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:28,010
Okay let's go eat that. If my son wants to eat it then of course Mommy has to buy that.

447
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:32,010
Of course! Mommy is going to make lots of money and buy delicious food for Yeong Chan.

448
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:42,070
 Thanks a lot to our Chief Editor:

 Thanks to Cover Wall and Thank You Cards: 
tompark

450
00:49:53,100 --> 00:50:00,060
 Thank you to our English moderators:
lupita311 &amp; yiji1997

451
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:09,130
 Thank you for watching with us!

452
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:12,980
Oh my!

453
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:16,020
Branch Manager! You're so handsome today!

454
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:20,170
I heard you got into an accident, but it seems after that you have gotten even more handsome.

455
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:23,190
Thanks to the employee resting room, my back disc problems are all gone!

456
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:26,380
It's all better now, Branch Manager.

457
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,380
Excuse me.

458
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,390
But... Isn't that seaweed?

459
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:41,890
Huh?

460
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,210
Are you talking behind the back of your superior, Sister Po?

461
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,170
- No!
- Never!

462
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,600
Didn't I plead with you?

463
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,680
Because the Branch Manager hurt his head in a hit and run accident,

464
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:58,680
even if he does strange things, let's be his warm co-workers.

465
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,690
- Understand?
- Yes!

466
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:06,250
 Please distribute my shares equally to the employees.

467
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:07,940
 Are you sincere?

468
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:11,200
 I told you. We should be considerate of our company's employees.

469
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,350
What about the management rights...

470
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:18,350
The managing just needs someone who can manage well, and regardless of who, they are still a company employee.

471
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:22,230
See that they don't make decisions without the consent of the employees.

472
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:29,740
 To: Lee Hae Joon

473
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:49,180
 If you are reading this letter then that means that I have left this world.

474
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:52,640
 For the past two months, just like you have experienced those ordeals like a dream,

475
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:58,830
 I too, experienced a dream-like time here borrowing your name.

476
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:04,660
 In order to protect this department store, I ruined your plan.

477
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:07,610
 But I don't want to apologize.

478
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:11,320
 In exchange for bringing this department store up from the bottom,

479
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:16,880
would it be selfish of me to say that I gifted your employees that love and care for you?

480
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:22,740
 Rather than living for revenge, I hope that you live for happiness.

481
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:26,480
 From: A friend who looks like your twin.

482
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:32,070
"You're fired from the company. What are you doing here?" is what he says.

483
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:34,690
How our Manager Lee is handling the proxy president role...

484
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:38,130
I was curious as to whether or not he is protecting the chairman spot well.

485
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:41,500
Also, my aging father,

486
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:45,840
I pity seeing him tidying up the president's messes.

487
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:48,380
I wanted to be of some help.

488
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:51,390
What do you want to do, proxy President and Branch Manager, Lee Hae Joon?

489
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:56,640
Although I did resent you to death, and I still do, however...

490
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,220
Hyung.

491
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:05,710
Hyung?!

492
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,680
Also, Father.

493
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,920
What the hell?

494
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,110
I want to call you that at least once.

495
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:21,890
Before I die, at least once, I want to call you that.

496
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:26,470
Father, and Hyung too.

497
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,530
I don't know!

498
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:41,990
I don't know what he is trying to say!

499
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:44,690
Until when do I have to keep doing this crap?!

500
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:47,770
Please, have a conversation!

501
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:50,010
Talk, please!

502
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:16,240
Stop it. Living once with you is enough.

503
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:21,510
Let's go eat. I have a lot of free time lately since I'm unemployed.

504
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:30,240
You said you wanted me to act more like a dad. If I don't do it now when I have a lot of free time, when will I ever do it?

505
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:34,640
Since when were you that considerate?

506
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:41,960
Cha Yeong Chan! Don't go too far away!

507
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,820
Thank you.

508
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:55,060
Do you know how much I like your dad?

509
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:59,340
We have some similarities so it makes me happy.

510
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:05,740
Your dad was a very great person. You can be proud of him.

511
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:08,010
I wanted to tell you that so I came here.

512
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:10,240
- Ahjussi...
- Yes?

513
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:14,570
Later on, will you teach me how to dance?

514
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:17,500
Of course!

515
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:26,090
♫  Oh I see it all  ♫

516
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:30,280
♫  Oh I see it now.  ♫

517
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,260

518
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:32,880

00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:43,540

523
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:48,040
♬   Oh you tell me more, just lay it all on me  ♬

524
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,210
♫ Because,  ♫

525
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:53,570
Excuse me...

526
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:56,100
I'm on my way to apply for workers' compensation insurance.

527
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:59,110
♫  Can't you get a hold of yourself?!  ♫

528
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:02,780
What?

529
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:05,650
Never mind.

530
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:08,640
♫  I'm so dizzy.  ♫

531
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,030
♫  Maybe I have two faces  ♫

532
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:13,710
♫  I'm falling again  ♫

533
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:15,570
♫  Wait for me  ♫

534

♫  I'm frightened!  ♫

535
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:20,290
♫  I'm scared!  ♫

536
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:24,440
♫  Forget the night I chose  ♫

537
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:27,050
♫  Don't let it go. ♫

538
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:30,680
♫  Thank you to make some noise.  ♫

539
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,530
Are you okay?

540
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:35,540
I'm okay.

541
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:38,530
♫  I promise you.  ♫

542
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:43,460
♫  I'm wagering my all  ♫

543
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:49,150
But... Have we ever met somewhere?

544
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:52,300
I'm not sure. I haven't been here for that long.

545
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:55,070
It's the same for me.

546
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:56,900
Why are you laughing?

547
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,650
It's nothing.

548
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:05,120
There seems to be a misunderstanding. I'm not that kind of woman.

549
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:07,550
Did I say something?

550
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:09,670
Why are you still laughing?

551
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:12,040
I'm sorry.

552
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,530
  Epilogue
I'm taking it.

553
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:46,470
 Kimchi! One, two, three!
♬  The road I accidentally was walking   ♬

554
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:50,050
♬  felt familiar and I stopped there   ♬

555
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:52,850
 Ahjussi, can you take a picture of us, please?
♬  felt familiar and I stopped there   ♬

556
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:56,430

♬  Will you give a smile   ♬

560
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:14,970
 Father!
 Kim Yeong Soo

561
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:18,540
 What are you doing in my car, you brat!

562
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:21,000
 Father, can't I drive this just once?

563
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,030
 I have to drive around cars like this so that I can boost my reputation.

564
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:27,840
 Stop the nonsense and go home to do your homework.

565
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,780
 Go go!

566
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:32,890
 So, I'll be able to bring home a pretty wife someday!

567
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:36,470
 You should study well before thinking about bring a pretty bride!

568
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:38,230
 As a person who can't do homework well...

569
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:40,080
 Just wait!

570
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:44,150
