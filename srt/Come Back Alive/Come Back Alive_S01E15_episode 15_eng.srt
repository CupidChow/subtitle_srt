1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:06,800

2
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,833
  Will you have dinner with me tomorrow?

3
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:40,233
  I'd like to dine with you for the last time before I go.

4
00:00:40,233 --> 00:00:43,833
 It's the last time for the three of us to meet before I disappear.

5
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:46,833
 I wan't to change it into a nice memory.

6
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:50,733
 I don't want this time to become a scar to Da Hye.

7
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:55,733
 Lee Hae Joon and Han Gi Tak know each other.

8
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:58,933
The one person who knows about Han Gi Tak's death.

9
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:01,933
 I won't get ruined so easily.

10
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:20,933
 7027

11
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:11,033
  Are you alright?

12
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,833
 Excuse me, are you sure you're alright?

13
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,633
 Are you okay?

14
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:24,033
Wait just a bit long... I'll be there soon.

15
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:28,033
I'm going.

16
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:53,833
 Be happy, Ahjumma.

17
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,933
 Ajhumma.

18
00:03:55,933 --> 00:03:58,833
 Ahjumma, you're still there, right?

19
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:02,933
 I'm almost there. You're going to wait for me, right?

20
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,833
I'm a little late, right?

21
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:08,033
They got soaked in the rain. Will you still take them?

22
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:19,033
 Episode 15

23
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:24,433
Did something happen?

24
00:05:24,433 --> 00:05:26,833
I ran because I was running late.

25
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,633
You could have taken your time.

26
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:32,733
This time I didn't want to be late.

27
00:05:38,433 --> 00:05:39,633
Over here.

28
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:41,533
Yes, customer.

29
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:45,633
I placed an order in advance. Is that alright?

30
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:51,233
The chef's special is available for old times sake.

31
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:53,333
Of course.

32
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:10,633
See, the color will be distinct.

33
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:13,133
Such a nag.

34
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,633
Hey treat them well.

35
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:30,833
Yes, chef.

36
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,733
Please enjoy.

37
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:43,533
Thank you.

38
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:48,133
Let's start.

39
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:59,633
I heard the food was good here but I've never experienced it properly.

40
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:21,533
Here.

41
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:24,333
♫   Wherever I am filling me with  ♫

42
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:27,333
You can leave it. I can do it myself.

43
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:31,733
I wanted to do this for you. Enjoy. 
♬   A memory which was lost in space   ♬

44
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:38,833
♫  Within the memories the time I turned far away from the memoryI ♫

45
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,533
How is it? Is it good?

46
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:48,133
Yes.
♬   Whether it was a matter of something which was forgotten   ♬

47
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:53,133
♬   or whether it was matter of going toward somewhere   ♬

48
00:07:53,133 --> 00:08:03,633
♬   I’m spending a day once again among the days I dreamed of.   ♬

49
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:09,033
♬   It might be too late   ♬

50
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:14,433
♬   Maybe in a place that I can’t even go back to   ♬

51
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:22,633
♬   My whole love is alive and breathing.   ♬

52
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:25,033
Aren't you eating?

53
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:29,033
Eat. 
♬   That you are my everything   ♬

54
00:08:29,033 --> 00:08:32,633
But...
♬   will stay within us   ♬

55
00:08:32,633 --> 00:08:35,233
Why did you want to meet here?

56
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:38,233
♫  While being conscious of that  ♫

57
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:42,733
The food you made for me
♬   and considering that I will hug you   ♬

58
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:45,633
was so warm and I'm so thankful.

59
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:50,533
I wanted to invite you in a delicious meal just once.

60
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:56,833
This is nothing in comparison to what you've done for me during this time.

61
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:04,733
Also, for becoming a family to me,

62
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:08,033
I'm very thankful.

63
00:09:12,633 --> 00:09:15,533
I wanted to say those words to you.

64
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,833
That feels good.

65
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:37,033
This time I kept my promise.

66
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:48,133
Excuse me.

67
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:56,533
You are very beautiful today.

68
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:10,433
Hae Joon! Hae Joon!

69
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:16,333
Hey Honey, pull yourself together.

70
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,833
Hong Nan, what should we do?

71
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,133
Call 911 immediately!

72
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:20,633
Yes!

73
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:23,633
The blood is...

74
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:25,833
What?

75
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,333
It was good to have...

76
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:38,733
Will he be alright?

77
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:40,033
Patient are you alright?

78
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:41,833
Doctor!

79
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:47,233
What's the matter with this patient?

80
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:49,033
He was in a hit and run.

81
00:10:49,033 --> 00:10:50,733
Let's examine him first.

82
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,933
Please stay here.

83
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:56,433
He never said a word.

84
00:10:56,433 --> 00:10:57,633
He'll be alright.

85
00:10:57,633 --> 00:11:01,933
Why is he like that? Why did have to do it to this extent?

86
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:12,633
Send the kids to look for the car's license plate. It's urgent, so hurry.

87
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:16,833
Contact me as soon as you find it. Alright.

88
00:11:42,063 --> 00:11:44,243
Are you going to kill him like this?

89
00:11:50,873 --> 00:11:55,213
Unfortunately, I guess the precious time of Kim Yeong Soo's will be shortened.

90
00:11:55,213 --> 00:11:58,503
- What the heck nonsense is that? 
- It will be difficult for him to overcome today.

91
00:11:58,503 --> 00:12:01,643
Perhaps, is he's dying again?

92
00:12:01,643 --> 00:12:06,123
There's nothing we can do since it's a self-inflicted injury after he came back here.

93
00:12:06,123 --> 00:12:08,973
So he's dying again like this?

94
00:12:08,973 --> 00:12:11,153
You're the one who made him Lee Hae Joon!

95
00:12:11,153 --> 00:12:14,043
Save him right now! Hurry!

96
00:12:18,203 --> 00:12:23,023
It is not my authority to save someone.

97
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:31,113
You need to let them say good bye to each other.

98
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,773
Save him.

99
00:12:34,773 --> 00:12:37,483
What do I have to do?

100
00:12:37,483 --> 00:12:41,953
I can't let him go like that!

101
00:12:51,463 --> 00:12:54,303
There is a way.

102
00:12:54,303 --> 00:12:58,503
What is it? I'll do anything.

103
00:12:58,503 --> 00:13:05,263
Han Gi Tak, could you share your remaining time with Kim Yeong Soo?

104
00:13:33,663 --> 00:13:39,163
Please. Please wake up.

105
00:13:40,813 --> 00:13:44,433
If you don't wake up I'm going to be angry.

106
00:13:45,673 --> 00:13:49,213
You said you were going to be like the wind that passes by.

107
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:54,973
You can't do this.

108
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:03,263
Wake up immediately and leave from my house with a smile.

109
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:53,063
Let go home.

110
00:16:00,813 --> 00:16:02,773
Are you alright?

111
00:16:05,013 --> 00:16:07,313
I want to go home.

112
00:16:08,523 --> 00:16:13,913
I want to lay on my bed and listen to Han Na babbling in the background.

113
00:16:13,913 --> 00:16:16,723
I want to eat the food you make me.

114
00:16:25,873 --> 00:16:27,413
Let's go.

115
00:16:34,263 --> 00:16:36,463
Where did this patient go?

116
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:38,833
He was discharged.

117
00:16:41,463 --> 00:16:44,083
He has a brain hemorrhage!

118
00:16:46,813 --> 00:16:53,813

119
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:03,583
What kind of accident is this person responsible for this time?

120
00:17:11,523 --> 00:17:14,353
- You're here?
-Yes.

121
00:17:14,353 --> 00:17:17,583
He's starting to get me all worried!

122
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,583
- What now?
-Cha Jae Gook is who I'm taking about.

123
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:25,683
He asks to eat together. He doesn't laugh or talk in front of the kid.

124
00:17:25,683 --> 00:17:27,993
Something seems off.

125
00:17:27,993 --> 00:17:29,593
Is that so?

126
00:17:32,423 --> 00:17:33,793
Oh my!

127
00:17:35,323 --> 00:17:37,513
Isn't this me?

128
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:41,913
Hey how long has it been?

129
00:17:41,913 --> 00:17:45,753
It's an interview from ten years ago.

130
00:17:45,753 --> 00:17:50,153
Hey, your brother saved the weirdest things.

131
00:17:51,883 --> 00:17:57,723
I don't know who it is but she's pretty. Now and 16 years ago.

132
00:17:57,723 --> 00:17:59,453
Am I not pretty?

133
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,403
You are.

134
00:18:02,403 --> 00:18:07,013
Seriously, it's really been a long time.

135
00:18:07,013 --> 00:18:09,153
I was so young.

136
00:18:25,233 --> 00:18:27,803
Aigoo, Director Cha.

137
00:18:27,803 --> 00:18:31,603
Meeting you like this is refreshing. What a welcome.

138
00:18:31,603 --> 00:18:34,943
Your face really suits the scene under this bridge.

139
00:18:34,943 --> 00:18:37,503
It must be difficult being wanted?

140
00:18:38,443 --> 00:18:42,443
It's time for you to save me now.

141
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:45,093
Give me what you've got.

142
00:18:46,103 --> 00:18:47,743
This thing?

143
00:18:47,743 --> 00:18:49,943
 Kill those bastards.

144
00:18:49,943 --> 00:18:52,433
Oh my so frightening.

145
00:18:52,433 --> 00:18:55,073
It's time for you to verify the money.

146
00:19:01,753 --> 00:19:05,303
The amount should be right.

147
00:19:06,363 --> 00:19:08,983
Yes, this is the right amount.

148
00:19:15,203 --> 00:19:17,603
Oh my.

149
00:19:17,603 --> 00:19:20,823
You've made some new friends already.

150
00:19:20,823 --> 00:19:23,153
I can't leave a rabid dog that bites his owner alone.

151
00:19:23,153 --> 00:19:25,253
A rabid dog.

152
00:19:29,163 --> 00:19:33,283
Oh yea, I wonder if you've already heard.

153
00:19:33,283 --> 00:19:37,513
Lurking around where a rabid dog lives, so

154
00:19:37,513 --> 00:19:40,343
I completely ran him over with the car,

155
00:19:40,343 --> 00:19:45,583
your rival Lee Hae Joon.

156
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:48,673
What? Lee Hae Joon?

157
00:19:48,673 --> 00:19:50,883
Why did I run over Lee Hae Joon over?

158
00:19:50,883 --> 00:19:55,043
That was because you told me to.

159
00:19:55,043 --> 00:19:57,803
Just like you ordered me to do to Han Gi Tak.

160
00:19:57,803 --> 00:20:00,643
You killed him and want to put the blame on me?

161
00:20:00,643 --> 00:20:04,753
I need at least this amount of insurance while cleaning up behind you.

162
00:20:04,753 --> 00:20:10,023
You ordered me to kill Han Gi Tak. You also ordered me to Lee Hae Joon.

163
00:20:10,023 --> 00:20:14,783
This was all ordered by you. Because you and I are one body.

164
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:20,063
This son of a b*tch.

165
00:20:20,063 --> 00:20:24,593
How dare you frame me!

166
00:20:30,093 --> 00:20:31,613
You're laughing?

167
00:20:34,183 --> 00:20:35,823
Oh that hurts.

168
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:44,873
You think I would have come, bringing that, with no backup plan in mind?

169
00:20:45,633 --> 00:20:48,373
Surprise.

170
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:50,423
Wait for it.

171
00:20:58,783 --> 00:21:01,673
Find him!

172
00:21:01,673 --> 00:21:04,573
Go inside. Find him quickly!

173
00:21:04,573 --> 00:21:09,283
This bottom feeder individual! Find him quickly.

174
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,113
Find him!

175
00:21:48,803 --> 00:21:54,893
♫   When I see your eyes, I feel uneasy  ♫

176
00:21:54,893 --> 00:22:00,533
♫   I start feeling lonely next to you  ♫

177
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:06,643
♫   In my heart, it's just you  ♫

178
00:22:06,643 --> 00:22:15,103
♫   Don't turn around like you don't know me anymore  ♫

179
00:22:15,103 --> 00:22:21,373
♫   I love you, you're in my heart  ♫

180
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:26,723
♫   Don't hide in front of me  ♫

181
00:22:26,723 --> 00:22:34,413
♫   Alone, I dream about you and wait for you  ♫

182
00:22:34,413 --> 00:22:39,563
♫   It seems like I love you  ♫

183
00:23:07,523 --> 00:23:10,183
It'll be bad if it leaves a scar.

184
00:23:18,203 --> 00:23:20,183
Good morning, Ahjumma.

185
00:23:20,873 --> 00:23:23,013
Are you feeling better now?

186
00:23:23,013 --> 00:23:27,223
Yes, I'm feeling like a completely healthy person now.

187
00:23:27,223 --> 00:23:30,573
That's good, let's go down and eat.

188
00:23:32,343 --> 00:23:36,993
In my dream, it seemed like somebody was caring for me.

189
00:23:38,903 --> 00:23:40,463
Here.

190
00:23:41,673 --> 00:23:43,433
Thank you.

191
00:23:47,053 --> 00:23:50,343
Did I ask for the grape sticker?

192
00:24:09,963 --> 00:24:15,823
Oh, Maya. I think the clock is broken. The remaining time has decreased drastically.

193
00:24:15,823 --> 00:24:18,373
It's not that it's broken.

194
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:21,323
What? What are you saying?

195
00:24:21,323 --> 00:24:25,703
I'll just tell you that your time did not decrease but has increased.

196
00:24:25,703 --> 00:24:28,623
You should be clearer so I can understand!

197
00:24:28,623 --> 00:24:31,723
When you return, you'll find out.

198
00:24:31,723 --> 00:24:34,543
Please, take good care of the family matter.

199
00:24:34,543 --> 00:24:38,103
This amount of time is impossible for me!

200
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:40,473
Just like everyone else.

201
00:24:52,433 --> 00:24:56,763
Why until now you pretended not to know, I am curious as to your plan.

202
00:24:56,763 --> 00:25:01,203
It was good enough to make me doubt if you were the Lee Hae Joon I knew.

203
00:25:01,203 --> 00:25:03,393
That's because I couldn't completely trust you.

204
00:25:03,393 --> 00:25:06,733
I think you've said the same thing before.

205
00:25:06,733 --> 00:25:08,263
It's not that simple for me to trust people.

206
00:25:08,263 --> 00:25:12,883
Sunjin Group's first member of international support department, Lee Hae Joon.

207
00:25:12,883 --> 00:25:18,983
Although Chairman was an official sponsor, helping out a person who had lost his mother,

208
00:25:18,983 --> 00:25:25,883
that person is the ex-secretary of the Chairman, my father.

209
00:25:25,883 --> 00:25:27,893
 That is something I did not expect.

210
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:34,223
I wanted to confirm the work you were going to put into Sunjin Group's future.

211
00:25:35,943 --> 00:25:39,493
Currently, there is a fight going on that is disadvantageous to Lee Hae Joon.

212
00:25:39,493 --> 00:25:44,433
Now, can I help you?

213
00:25:52,423 --> 00:25:58,433
Okay, the only way to block the sale of the store is to become the real Lee Hae Joon.

214
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:01,793
- Hello. 
- Hello.

215
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:03,073
Hello!

216
00:26:03,073 --> 00:26:05,853
Hi friend!

217
00:26:05,853 --> 00:26:08,483
I came to raise the sales!

218
00:26:09,663 --> 00:26:11,413
Hello.

219
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:21,723
Hong Nan was at the pub. Is she not your manager anymore?

220
00:26:22,543 --> 00:26:26,573
That restaurant was originally her brother's.

221
00:26:26,573 --> 00:26:28,213
I've heard that before.

222
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:33,653
She taught me how to box, saying her brother taught her when she was younger. Jab Jab.

223
00:26:36,623 --> 00:26:39,753
Her brother was originally the chef there.

224
00:26:39,753 --> 00:26:43,773
He also boxed on the side.

225
00:26:44,573 --> 00:26:49,053
It seems like you're close to Hong Nan, too.

226
00:26:49,053 --> 00:26:51,373
Han Gi Tak...

227
00:26:52,283 --> 00:26:54,963
This person's name...

228
00:26:54,963 --> 00:26:57,723
is Han Gi Tak.

229
00:26:57,723 --> 00:27:00,443
Han Gi Tak?

230
00:27:02,683 --> 00:27:05,723
I liked him a lot.

231
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:09,843
This person died...

232
00:27:10,783 --> 00:27:15,103
Now, his younger brothers are protecting me.

233
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:26,153
This person appeared like it was meant to be.

234
00:27:35,393 --> 00:27:37,203
Miss Da Hye, are you okay?

235
00:27:37,203 --> 00:27:40,613
Yes, I'm okay.

236
00:27:40,613 --> 00:27:43,753
That's strange. What's happening?

237
00:27:50,593 --> 00:27:52,443
Branch Manager!

238
00:27:52,443 --> 00:27:56,073
Have you seen this?

239
00:27:56,073 --> 00:27:59,653
Oh my world!

240
00:27:59,653 --> 00:28:09,853

241
00:28:12,053 --> 00:28:14,513
The preparation for the special shareholder's meeting is going well, right?

242
00:28:14,513 --> 00:28:19,023
So that we can secure the decision to sell, make sure you manage the directors.

243
00:28:19,023 --> 00:28:22,453
The audio file that was posted on the Internet,

244
00:28:23,593 --> 00:28:26,153
- was it your voice that was recorded? 
- What are you saying?

245
00:28:26,153 --> 00:28:29,703
The one person who said he killed Han Gi Tak,

246
00:28:29,703 --> 00:28:32,223
It's spreading fast that it's your voice.

247
00:28:32,223 --> 00:28:35,193
Tell them to stop saying nonsense.

248
00:28:35,193 --> 00:28:38,923
As I am sensitive, facing the sale of the store, who is trying to mess it up?

249
00:28:38,923 --> 00:28:42,123
There is also movement from the prosecutor's side.

250
00:28:43,093 --> 00:28:45,683
CEO, there's a big problem!

251
00:28:48,683 --> 00:28:53,473
If it's the truth, I can't consider you as the CEO anymore.

252
00:29:14,843 --> 00:29:17,843
What's wrong? Is there a problem?

253
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:21,293
Well... Are you okay?

254
00:29:26,273 --> 00:29:30,053
 I think this is talk about our hyung, Gi Tak.

255
00:29:30,053 --> 00:29:32,233
 What should I do CEO?

256
00:29:32,233 --> 00:29:34,093
 You dirty bastards.

257
00:29:34,093 --> 00:29:35,523
 Then according to the plan, Han Gi Tak--

258
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:38,453
 Kill them! Those filthy rats!

259
00:29:38,453 --> 00:29:40,783
 Then I will follow along with the plan

260
00:29:40,783 --> 00:29:45,093
 I saw that too, but is that this mall's chairman?

261
00:29:45,093 --> 00:29:47,123
 No way...

262
00:29:47,123 --> 00:29:49,813
 Die, you filthy rats!

263
00:29:49,813 --> 00:29:51,713
 So, as planned, Han Gi Tak...

264
00:29:51,713 --> 00:29:53,303
Han Gi Tak...

265
00:29:53,303 --> 00:29:56,273
 Die, you filthy rats!

266
00:29:57,053 --> 00:29:59,033
Cha Jae Gook.

267
00:30:03,663 --> 00:30:09,903
Da Hye... I'm sorry. It looks like I have to leave.

268
00:30:09,903 --> 00:30:12,923
Miss Yi Yeon, are you okay?

269
00:30:12,923 --> 00:30:18,893
Of course! I'll see you next time.

270
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:28,933
 Die! You filthy rats!

271
00:30:28,933 --> 00:30:31,873
You killed Han Gi Tak.

272
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:33,893
Who in the world told you this nonsense?!

273
00:30:33,893 --> 00:30:35,583
Did you order the killing of Han Gi Tak?

274
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:40,133
I'm Cha Jae Gook. How would killing a thug like him benefit me?

275
00:30:40,133 --> 00:30:43,213
I will kill everyone that's been saying that.

276
00:30:43,213 --> 00:30:46,993
Yes. It can't be you.

277
00:30:46,993 --> 00:30:51,143
If it is you, I will demolish you.

278
00:30:51,143 --> 00:30:55,653
Right, you're finally showing your actual self, Lee Hae Joon.

279
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:59,343
The people in misery, that you've stepped on,

280
00:30:59,343 --> 00:31:03,523
I will help you feel that misery soon, too.

281
00:31:19,943 --> 00:31:22,563
No...

282
00:31:22,563 --> 00:31:23,843
Song Yi Yeon...

283
00:31:23,843 --> 00:31:27,123
No matter how mean that person is...

284
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:30,903
He would never go this far.

285
00:31:32,383 --> 00:31:38,603
Hong Nan, I'm sorry. I have things to do so I'll be leaving first.

286
00:31:46,713 --> 00:31:48,323
Did you hear that?

287
00:31:49,063 --> 00:31:52,293
Cha Jae Gook, Na Seuk Cheol... They killed Hyungnim.

288
00:31:52,293 --> 00:31:53,193
Follow Song Yi Yeon.

289
00:31:53,193 --> 00:31:57,323
Is she the problem right now? Your brother was killed!

290
00:31:57,323 --> 00:31:59,063
- I'm asking you.
- Han Hong Nan!

291
00:31:59,063 --> 00:32:04,013
Think about what Han Gi Tak wants.

292
00:32:10,273 --> 00:32:14,223
Miss Hong Nan, are you okay?

293
00:32:15,823 --> 00:32:18,563
This is what I wanted to say.

294
00:32:28,803 --> 00:32:30,383
Here.

295
00:32:32,773 --> 00:32:33,733
Are you okay?

296
00:32:33,733 --> 00:32:35,863
I'm not.

297
00:32:35,863 --> 00:32:38,333
I'm not okay whatsoever.

298
00:32:39,553 --> 00:32:42,903
I didn't live that nicely,

299
00:32:42,903 --> 00:32:46,273
but it makes me wonder if I lived mean enough to make someone want to kill me.

300
00:32:46,273 --> 00:32:48,193
What are you saying?

301
00:32:48,193 --> 00:32:53,423
Throwing away my family, hurting the person I love.

302
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:56,763
I wonder if this is the punishment I'm receiving for those things.

303
00:32:56,763 --> 00:32:58,593
Stop saying this!

304
00:32:58,593 --> 00:33:02,323
I will definitely, 100% find out who made you like this!

305
00:33:02,323 --> 00:33:08,763
In that time, just stay next to Hong Nan's side.

306
00:33:08,763 --> 00:33:13,223
She asked me if I was okay,

307
00:33:15,713 --> 00:33:20,213
even though I am feeling so guilty because I died that way.

308
00:33:20,213 --> 00:33:25,423
Since I can't stay by her side,

309
00:33:26,533 --> 00:33:28,433
in my place,

310
00:33:30,123 --> 00:33:33,153
stay by her side and protect her.

311
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:36,823
Even if it's just for the remainder of your time.

312
00:33:38,233 --> 00:33:44,343
I promise. I will dedicate all of the time I have left.

313
00:33:44,343 --> 00:33:46,583
And I'll stay by her side.

314
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:58,513
 Han Gi Tak. That person's name is Han Gi Tak.

315
00:33:58,513 --> 00:34:03,573
 I told you if you cry everywhere, you're the Ugly One. You're so cool, my sister.

316
00:34:03,573 --> 00:34:05,993
 Where are you going?

317
00:34:05,993 --> 00:34:09,233
Da Hye... Da Hye?

318
00:34:14,973 --> 00:34:18,533
Did you have a bad dream?

319
00:34:20,163 --> 00:34:24,723
May be it's because I feel worried but something feels strange.

320
00:34:25,573 --> 00:34:30,823
I'm uneasy, I feel like something bad will happen.

321
00:34:32,313 --> 00:34:34,963
Can I ask for a favor?

322
00:34:34,963 --> 00:34:36,843
You can ask me anything.

323
00:34:36,843 --> 00:34:38,873
Even if you leave,

324
00:34:40,143 --> 00:34:42,423
don't leave without telling me.

325
00:34:42,423 --> 00:34:47,443
At least let us do our farewells before you leave.

326
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:52,893
I understand. I promise.

327
00:35:20,193 --> 00:35:24,563
You finally showed up.

328
00:35:24,563 --> 00:35:29,563
Did you really do it?

329
00:35:29,563 --> 00:35:37,253
You... You ordered that Han Gi Tak be killed?

330
00:35:37,253 --> 00:35:42,253
The first thing you say after years of not coming in here, is that?

331
00:35:42,253 --> 00:35:47,763
It's not true right? It's not, right?

332
00:35:48,723 --> 00:35:53,223
Say something! It's not right? Tell me that it wasn't you!!

333
00:35:53,223 --> 00:35:56,333
You have to have not done it! You didn't do it!

334
00:35:56,333 --> 00:36:01,243
No!! No no no!!

335
00:36:01,943 --> 00:36:07,413
Yeah, I killed him. I tried to kill that punk.

336
00:36:07,413 --> 00:36:12,263
I told them to rip him to pieces and leave no trace of him and kill him. Is that enough?!

337
00:36:16,653 --> 00:36:20,653
Please tell me it wasn't you.

338
00:36:20,653 --> 00:36:23,963
No! Nope!

339
00:36:25,713 --> 00:36:31,853
I killed him! Why? It's because of you, Song Yi Yeon.

340
00:36:35,413 --> 00:36:37,603
It was because of you.

341
00:37:03,183 --> 00:37:09,283

342
00:37:23,363 --> 00:37:28,703
Where are you? I don't have much time left.

343
00:37:46,913 --> 00:37:51,703
- Are you going in to the prosecutor's office?
- Yes.

344
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:54,413
CEO, don't you think humble-looking clothing would be better?

345
00:37:55,823 --> 00:37:58,573
Why should I? Did I commit a crime?

346
00:38:04,253 --> 00:38:06,723
Welcome.

347
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:10,493
What is all of this?

348
00:38:10,493 --> 00:38:15,213
Cha Jae Gook is currently denying the charge that he ordered the killing, at the Prosecutor's office.

349
00:38:15,213 --> 00:38:19,263
But Jeong Ji Hoon and Choi Seung Jae said

350
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:23,253
that there were lots of questionable aspects to your case,

351
00:38:23,253 --> 00:38:24,763
so I looked into it again.

352
00:38:24,763 --> 00:38:27,743
The truth behind Han Gi Tak's death.

353
00:38:32,063 --> 00:38:34,093
Spill what you have.

354
00:38:34,093 --> 00:38:39,363
Here. First, the whereabouts of the black box that should've been at the site.

355
00:38:39,363 --> 00:38:43,313
Second, the paparazzi and the driver, both of their whereabouts are unknown.

356
00:38:43,313 --> 00:38:47,483
Third, is the site where there are no CCTVs to be found.

357
00:38:47,483 --> 00:38:50,213
They made the accident happen in a place where there are no CCTVs.

358
00:38:50,213 --> 00:38:54,393
- So what?
- So! What do you think we need?

359
00:38:56,573 --> 00:39:02,563
Brain. We will find out what happened through your memories.

360
00:39:10,363 --> 00:39:12,093
 Oh, Seung Jae. Let's talk later.

361
00:39:12,093 --> 00:39:14,803
 What happened, Boss? The police came to the restaurant too.

362
00:39:14,803 --> 00:39:17,923
 - What?
- They're looking for you. What did they mean by an assault case?

363
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:19,923
 Exactly what happened—

364
00:39:19,923 --> 00:39:24,753
 So you wanna go, huh? Alright then, let's go to the end.

365
00:39:30,803 --> 00:39:35,553
 Han Gi Tak was in the midst of following the paparazzi to show that Song Yi Yeon was innocent.

366
00:39:35,553 --> 00:39:37,693
 He found about Yoo Hyuk's assault

367
00:39:37,693 --> 00:39:42,123
 and assumed that he'd fallen into a trap that was set up by somebody.

368
00:39:59,093 --> 00:40:03,783
 From following the paparazzi, you got in the first accident.

369
00:40:21,563 --> 00:40:27,233
 The second accident was when the truck came at Han Gi Tak's car.

370
00:40:27,233 --> 00:40:29,323
That's when he officially died.

371
00:40:29,323 --> 00:40:33,383
Do you remember anything regarding the accident? Anything strange?

372
00:40:33,383 --> 00:40:34,893
I'm not sure.

373
00:40:37,153 --> 00:40:42,913
Now that I think about it...
 What's this? Transformation?

374
00:40:44,423 --> 00:40:46,873
 There was a cigarette in my pocket.

375
00:40:46,873 --> 00:40:48,593
 What's with this?

376
00:40:48,593 --> 00:40:53,543
 It's been quite a long time since I quit smoking.

377
00:41:02,633 --> 00:41:07,393
 Are you alright, Ahjusshi?

378
00:41:08,973 --> 00:41:10,833
 Are you dead or alive?

379
00:41:12,713 --> 00:41:14,533
 Ahjusshi!

380
00:41:16,643 --> 00:41:18,263
 Seems like he's dead.

381
00:41:33,713 --> 00:41:35,763
 I took care of the driver.

382
00:41:35,763 --> 00:41:37,473
 Go then.

383
00:41:51,783 --> 00:41:53,663
 What should I do, Chairman?

384
00:41:59,503 --> 00:42:01,393
 These dirty scumbags.

385
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:05,143
 - Then as contract, Han Gi Tak—
- Kill that trash!

386
00:42:05,143 --> 00:42:07,973
 Just do it as planned and make sure there's no trace.

387
00:42:07,973 --> 00:42:11,973
 At the Prosecutor, he said that the statement he made about killing him was just a metaphor.

388
00:42:11,973 --> 00:42:15,513
 The original plan was to make Song Yi Yeon housebound with the scandal.

389
00:42:15,513 --> 00:42:21,103
 Yes, I will clean up Han Gi Tak without a mess.

390
00:42:41,413 --> 00:42:46,923
 You worked hard. Now just rest.

391
00:42:48,073 --> 00:42:50,273
 Na Seok Cheol, you punk...

392
00:42:51,543 --> 00:42:55,553
 He used Cha Jae Gook to kill Han Gi Tak.

393
00:42:57,923 --> 00:43:03,953
 How sad. He should fall into hell's pit.

394
00:43:06,043 --> 00:43:10,483
The person who committed your hit and run was also Na Seok Cheul.

395
00:43:10,483 --> 00:43:13,133
Na Seok Cheol, that guy... What is his motive?

396
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:15,393
The person that was like his parent, Big Hyungnim.

397
00:43:15,393 --> 00:43:19,123
Killing his friends and only following the line of the money.

398
00:43:20,103 --> 00:43:23,263
Now, he has nothing to lose.

399
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:28,263
Now that Cha Jae Gook is like that. The remaining hope for Na Seok Cheol is...

400
00:43:29,623 --> 00:43:30,423
The secret account number?

401
00:43:30,423 --> 00:43:33,923
Until Na Seok Chul dies,

402
00:43:33,923 --> 00:43:39,003
I have to be Han Gi Tak's sister. It has to be.

403
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:44,863
Will it be alright? After we pass on,

404
00:43:44,863 --> 00:43:49,173
Da Hye and Yi Yeon... Will they be alright?

405
00:43:49,173 --> 00:43:53,933
I have to hurry and catch Na Seok Cheol while I'm still around.

406
00:44:02,853 --> 00:44:05,733
What's this? Why is yours so different from mine? How come you have so little time left?

407
00:44:05,733 --> 00:44:06,923
What's different!?

408
00:44:06,923 --> 00:44:08,453
What did you do?

409
00:44:08,453 --> 00:44:13,993
 It's not that Kim Yeong Soo's time got shorter. I'll just tell you that it got longer.

410
00:44:17,153 --> 00:44:21,163
Could it be... You gave some of your time to me?

411
00:44:21,163 --> 00:44:23,793
They said you wouldn't make it two days.

412
00:44:26,033 --> 00:44:28,333
It was for the sake of my younger sibling.

413
00:44:38,053 --> 00:44:44,493
This person, in this time, I told you to do well with your wife.

414
00:45:25,733 --> 00:45:26,803
  Really pathetic.

415
00:45:26,803 --> 00:45:28,343
 - Pathetic?
- Pathetic?

416
00:45:28,343 --> 00:45:31,893
 What am I supposed to do when I want to forget but I can't?

417
00:45:31,893 --> 00:45:35,433
 I want to take it out of this heart, but it doesn't work.

418
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:39,373
 They're in front of my eyes and it makes me want to pull my eyes out.

419
00:45:39,373 --> 00:45:41,013
 Is that being pathetic?

420
00:45:41,013 --> 00:45:44,693
I'm the most pathetic person on this planet.

421
00:45:50,933 --> 00:45:56,713
How nice would it be if he was there?

422
00:45:59,383 --> 00:46:05,963
To see how pretty and energetic your sister grew up...

423
00:46:07,123 --> 00:46:10,073
That would've been so nice to see them together.

424
00:46:31,863 --> 00:46:33,423
Oppa?

425
00:46:34,953 --> 00:46:39,413
Oh my! How can that be?

426
00:46:44,753 --> 00:46:47,683
My wish came true.

427
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:54,763
I wanted to have a picture with you.

428
00:46:56,583 --> 00:47:01,913
♫  Are we not destiny now?  ♫

429
00:47:01,913 --> 00:47:03,623
I'm sorry, Oppa.

430
00:47:03,623 --> 00:47:06,513
♫   Now are we strangers?  ♫

431
00:47:06,513 --> 00:47:11,673
Turning around because I wanted to, so meanly.

432
00:47:11,673 --> 00:47:14,853
Because I couldn't hold in how much I missed you.

433
00:47:14,853 --> 00:47:19,623
Trying to find you in any way I could because I'm a selfish wench.

434
00:47:19,623 --> 00:47:22,853
I'm sorry.

435
00:47:22,853 --> 00:47:29,393
Even though I knew that you were a person who had hard time forgetting about me,

436
00:47:29,393 --> 00:47:31,853
and I kept telling you to forget me.

437
00:47:31,853 --> 00:47:33,603
♫   Because I love you too much  ♫

438
00:47:33,603 --> 00:47:37,933
For constantly telling you to go away. For telling you to blow off.

439
00:47:37,933 --> 00:47:38,893
I'm sorry.

440
00:47:38,893 --> 00:47:41,223
♫   Always being greedy  ♫

441
00:47:41,223 --> 00:47:44,983
Because I...

442
00:47:44,983 --> 00:47:51,383
love you, Oppa.

443
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:54,293
♫   Not once  ♫

444
00:47:54,293 --> 00:47:59,723
I'm sorry.

445
00:47:59,723 --> 00:48:03,213
♫   Have I ever regretted  ♫

446
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:06,733
♫   The fact that I love you  ♫

447
00:48:06,733 --> 00:48:08,223
♫   And  ♫

448
00:48:08,223 --> 00:48:12,253
 Song Yi Yeon...

449
00:48:12,253 --> 00:48:16,873
 No, no need to be sorry.

450
00:48:16,873 --> 00:48:22,633
 Cha Jae Gook isn't the one who made Han Gi Tak like that.

451
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:24,893
 You don't have to feel guilty.

452
00:48:26,713 --> 00:48:32,063
 Cha Jae Gook is probably very worn out by what's been going on.

453
00:48:32,063 --> 00:48:39,553
 So you have to take care of Yeung Chan, right?

454
00:48:39,553 --> 00:48:42,173
 I came to say that.

455
00:48:42,173 --> 00:48:46,053
 Then, I'm going to go.

456
00:48:54,993 --> 00:49:01,583
 Show me your face. I have to leave soon.

457
00:49:01,583 --> 00:49:06,753
 since I finished everything I had to do here.

458
00:49:35,803 --> 00:49:38,693
 Sunjin

459
00:49:38,693 --> 00:49:42,943
 15th Sunjin department store Extraordinary Directors Meeting

460
00:49:42,943 --> 00:49:44,753
CEO!

461
00:49:47,273 --> 00:49:50,093
Long time no see, Directors.

462
00:49:51,013 --> 00:49:56,793
I heard something odd. I heard something has been added.

463
00:50:05,143 --> 00:50:09,153
1) Dismissal of the President.

464
00:50:09,153 --> 00:50:12,323
2) Putting the mall up for sale

465
00:50:14,323 --> 00:50:17,493
Number one, do you think this will pass?

466
00:50:17,493 --> 00:50:23,023
But, who's idea would this have been?

467
00:50:23,023 --> 00:50:26,713
Was it you? Did you do it?

468
00:50:26,713 --> 00:50:29,753
What kind of bastard would dare to fire me?!

469
00:50:29,753 --> 00:50:35,073
It was me.

470
00:50:36,253 --> 00:50:39,743
Lee Hae Joon, with what authority you dare to—

471
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:44,253
That's because I'm the majority shareholder.

472
00:50:44,253 --> 00:50:45,313
What?

473
00:50:45,313 --> 00:50:51,603
Until now, I was buying it up a bit by bit, thanks to you who made the stock price drop significantly.

474
00:50:51,603 --> 00:50:55,753
It's enough if it's 4.9%, right?

475
00:50:59,963 --> 00:51:06,023
For making an employee accidental death into suicide, internal corruption to make the revenue fall, overworking the staff,

476
00:51:06,023 --> 00:51:08,703
embezzlement and mishandling of company funds.

477
00:51:08,703 --> 00:51:11,243
Damaging the company image by causing scandals.

478
00:51:11,243 --> 00:51:15,053
The image of Sunjin Mall is being shaken by the continuous deteriorating image of the chairman.

479
00:51:15,053 --> 00:51:18,823
To move in the direction that the company wants and

480
00:51:18,823 --> 00:51:23,193
to withstand the adverse wind where our roots don't shake, we have to make Sunjin like that.

481
00:51:23,193 --> 00:51:28,883
For those reasons, I request that we dismiss President Cha Chae Gook..

482
00:51:30,453 --> 00:51:34,523
Father, you raised a son well.

483
00:51:34,523 --> 00:51:38,663
You must be happy, since you got one out of the two right.

484
00:51:38,663 --> 00:51:42,393
The voting for the dismissal of Cha Jae Gook has started.

485
00:51:42,393 --> 00:51:46,133
We will vote now.

486
00:51:46,133 --> 00:51:49,483
Everyone who wishes this to pass, please raise your hands.

487
00:52:02,693 --> 00:52:08,383
Cha Jae Gook's dismissal has passed with everyone in favor.

488
00:52:12,793 --> 00:52:19,303
For now, Lee Hae Joon, you take over as the president

489
00:52:20,463 --> 00:52:23,083
It is a great decision you made.

490
00:52:38,083 --> 00:52:39,933
It was for the company.

491
00:52:39,933 --> 00:52:41,373
Are you trying to comfort me?

492
00:52:41,373 --> 00:52:44,573
I know that you weren't trying to kill Han Gi Tak.

493
00:52:45,903 --> 00:52:47,713
Get lost.

494
00:52:59,363 --> 00:53:02,763
You finally got the company.

495
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:05,243
Yeah.

496
00:53:05,243 --> 00:53:08,643
But why are we seeing each other here? It's awkward.

497
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:10,193
It's to meet Da Hye

498
00:53:10,193 --> 00:53:11,533
What?

499
00:53:11,533 --> 00:53:16,173
Sit down. You know you've been wanting to see her.

500
00:53:16,173 --> 00:53:17,853
She's the one that said she wanted to meet you first.

501
00:53:17,853 --> 00:53:19,463
What?

502
00:53:20,343 --> 00:53:22,303
Hong Nan!

503
00:53:27,823 --> 00:53:33,723
This... I found it when I was cleaning your room.

504
00:53:34,723 --> 00:53:40,553
The kid in this picture is me. I don't know why it was there.

505
00:53:40,553 --> 00:53:44,223
Tell me, how did get have this?

506
00:53:44,223 --> 00:53:46,143
Truthfully...

507
00:53:47,853 --> 00:53:50,353
I found your brother.

508
00:53:52,733 --> 00:53:58,613
But I can't tell you about his name, his age or his whereabouts.

509
00:53:58,613 --> 00:54:00,653
It's something the person doesn't want.

510
00:54:00,653 --> 00:54:05,273
Although he can't can't show himself to you, one thing I am sure about is

511
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:12,223
that he loves you very much and let you go because he wanted to protect you.

512
00:54:16,683 --> 00:54:23,133
My brother... is Han Gi Tak?

513
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:40,763

514
00:54:50,313 --> 00:54:52,433
It's too far.

515
00:54:59,953 --> 00:55:02,473
What are you doing? You have no guts?

516
00:55:14,283 --> 00:55:17,103
Wait. They saw us!

517
00:55:21,313 --> 00:55:22,183
Hey!

518
00:55:22,183 --> 00:55:24,373
Father!
