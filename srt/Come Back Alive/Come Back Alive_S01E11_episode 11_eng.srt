1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210

2
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,190
Did Han Gi Tak really have a younger sibling?

3
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,540
When should I come see you? One moment please.

4
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,930
Were you really startled?

5
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,320
No, why would I be?

6
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,120
I think your friend's waiting for you.

7
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,180
I'll contact you later.

8
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,300
Let's get off work together.

9
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,850
He says, "Bring Song Yi Yeon as the model."

10
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:17,640
I felt it since the fashion show. President is really cool.

11
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,590
You're not going to end up getting screwed, are you?

12
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,260
What are you talking about?

13
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,390
I needed a radical strategy to save the department store.

14
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,970
What strategy is more radical than this?

15
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:32,050
Anyway, I did end up getting great backing from my netherworld alumni.

16
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,580
Please take good care of me, Hyung.

17
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,730
Are we strangers? If you keep acting like that, I'm going to be disappointed.

18
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,330
Let's hurry and get Song Yi Yeon's stamp, and let's go drink.

19
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,240
- What do you think?
- Call!

20
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,270
 Sunjin Department store Model Contract

21
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,840
Why would I?

22
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,270
My worth is increasing and your side is decreasing.

23
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,930
What good will come if I get involved with Sunjin again?

24
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,540
It's not getting involved but...

25
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,840
It's fighting Cha Jae Gook, face-to-face.

26
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,340
If I go along with your point of view, I guess Sunjin Department store's image will get better.

27
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,790
But what if another pathetic situation happens, and my image also becomes poop,

28
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,930
who's going to take responsibility then?

29
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,790
Ah. There is no way it'll become poop.

30
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,560
Unlike Cha Jae Gook who only makes cosmetic changes,

31
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,460
I'm fixing it by starting from the rotten inside.

32
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,620
Hey, Song Yi Yeon! Do you know how hard we worked to make this opportunity?

33
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,750
If both of you are going to gloss over this emotionally, both of you get out.

34
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,220
I'm the original Hallyu goddess, Song Yi Yeon.

35
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,700
I only work with pros.

36
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,500
Yes, it's obvious that you would think about it carefully.

37
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,390
And also, did I ask you to do this?

38
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:46,100
Are you going to be like this? If we worked our butts off, we should be at least be able to enjoy you going along with us.

39
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,790
Don't be so condescending when you did things I didn't even ask you to.

40
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,710
Let's not get angry, and talk it out—

41
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,040
What? Am I doing this so only I can benefit?

42
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,740
Gosh, so pathetic.

43
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,800
Pathetic?!

44
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,290
I'm not pathetic. I'm Lee Hae Joon!

45
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,710
Why didn't you pick up your phone? I said let's go home from work together.

46
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:39,000
I thought about it, and if I repay you for the two months of advanced rent, please leave.

47
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,380
Since you can't even look me in the eyes, I'm guessing you've started to care for me.

48
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,230
Yes, you're really getting on my nerves.

49
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,720
I'm leaving in one month and never coming back.

50
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,980
I'm just a passing person. Things you can't tell anyone,

51
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,230
you can tell me as if I were a passing breeze.

52
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,320
If you're having a hard time, you can lean on me for a while or get mad and complain. That will be okay with me.

53
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,390
That will be okay with me.

54
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,890
I will take it all for you. Where on earth, like winning a lottery, would you find a chance like this?

55
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,790
Branch Manager. Why go this far...

56
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:31,250
You can think of it as me doing the things that Kim Yeong Soo couldn't do before leaving.

57
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,370
I just want to protect your family.

58
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,900
♬   I'm sorry   ♬

59
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:46,000
♬   Don't leave me. Don't leave me  ♬

60
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,210
♬  A day without you, I feel like I'm going to cry   ♬

61
00:05:53,210 --> 00:06:00,060
♬   It hurts a lot, I feel like crying honestly   ♬

62
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,700
Go first.

63
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,190
♬   If I close my eyes  ♬

64
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:11,670
♬   If I close my eyes again  ♬

65
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,740
If you're tall and your voice is good, does that make you complete?

66
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,380
Why is he playing with my emotions?

67
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,560
What a weirdo.

68
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,690
Gang Ja, don't worry. I won't fall for it.

69
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,920
- Oh.
 - Sister-in-law, I didn't hear anything.

70
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,680
Nothing.

71
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,080
Ahjumma, can I request something to eat, with drinks?

72
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,990
Is this a bar or something?

73
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,880
See what happens when he gives up all the stickers.

74
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,520
So, you ran away from home?

75
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,800
Wench! I Must be gone for her to see that I'm valuable.

76
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,020
It's not like I'm even half of a Buddha. I can't stand that ball of rudeness anymore.

77
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,440
Thank you.

78
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,780
Ah, Sister-in-law, have a drink with us.

79
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,390
No, I'm fine.

80
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,890
Don't be like that and sit.

81
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:49,420
I regretted not being able to drink with you last time.

82
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,820
I'm not really good at drinking.

83
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,900
This is a golden drink.

84
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,460
Next.

85
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:09,340
Put the napkin on top. Tornado.

86
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,420
Tornado.

87
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,940
There!

88
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,480
What did you just teach her?!

89
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,970
Sister-in-law needs to feel the satisfaction of heaven and earth.

90
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:26,150
Her heart needs to clear and become filled with truth,

91
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:30,320
and feel her whole body becoming a statement. That Feeling!

92
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,290
It's good. Good.

93
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,200
Do it more. More.

94
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,580
I'll try now.

95
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,130
It's here.

96
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,080
Let's drink.

97
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,480
Anyway, but how can you cute Da Hye—

98
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,620
No, how did you end up marrying with Yeong Soo?

99
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:09,770
I, originally didn't want to get married to Yeong Soo

100
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:15,150
Because he was such a good person.

101
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:19,070
and I was raised so lonely.

102
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:27,910
But I really wanted to have lots of babies with him.

103
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:33,830
So we even got a nice house with a yard.

104
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,450
But cutting the grass is so hard.

105
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,350
Then what about a man like this?

106
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,540
Our Branch manager Lee is so cool.

107
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,740
He is cool.

108
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,150
But...

109
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:01,090
This man... is kind of weird.

110
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,350
- A lot.
 - What is?

111
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:09,300
Sometimes he seems a lot like Yeong Soo.

112
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,560
Making me confused, really.

113
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,280
I talked too much today, right?

114
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,180
What a waste? And to whom...

115
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:38,350

116
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,570
What are you doing?

117
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:48,710
Excuse me, not that. Come over here.

118
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,850
I'll take care of your girl.

119
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,510
Come here.

120
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,690
Ah, so warm. This is nice.

121
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,510
Mom...

122
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,250
Mom...

123
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,190
What should I do? This is bad.

124
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,910
Han Na...

125
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,970
Han Na... Mom can't breathe.

126
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,510
Mom...

127
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,670
Mom... Hug me..

128
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,370
You joker!

129
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,690
I like you so much, Mom.

130
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,530
I thought I was going to die from suffocation.

131
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:13,650
No, hug me. Hug me.

132
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:23,130
It's normal that you've misunderstood!

133
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:29,690
Dad...ah, Ahjussi went into your mom's room because ummm of momentary memory loss.

134
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:33,970
Homing instinct... like the instinct that your body finds its way to where you were from.

135
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,390
And because I used to live on the first floor.

136
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,930
And I had a bit of a sickness before...

137
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,030
Really... Oh!

138
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,850
Oh oh I wanted to get your mom's hair clip! Your mom's hair clip!

139
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,590
It was totally my style!

140
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:53,350
If mom finds out, you'll be kicked out.

141
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:58,150
Don't be like this. What do you want me to do?

142
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:00,950
What?

143
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,510
Type in your phone number.

144
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,250
So suddenly?

145
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:14,770
This wench. The size of her heart is a worm's.

146
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:18,590
You... Do you by chance know where Hong Nan went?

147
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,550
So you don't know.

148
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:25,370
Well then, I have another method.

149
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,850
Song Yi Yeon.

150
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:46,070
Try to eat well and live well without me.

151
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:52,370
Oh my gosh. Who is she alike that she's so smart and meticulous, even getting my phone number.

152
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,090
Honey... Song Yi Yeon is...!

153
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,570
What?

154
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,050
Song Yi Yeon is really coming here?

155
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,430
It seems as though Branch Manager Lee Hae Joon will really go through with the modeling contract.

156
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:12,730
Then I will take care of it personally. Send a lawyer to her.

157
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,490
Since she can't live without her child, she'll be careful with her conduct.

158
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,850
I understand.

159
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,110
Get out of my way.

160
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,210
♬   Oh I see it all  ♬

00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:29,330
♬  Oh I see it now   ♬

162
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,790
♬  Let it one   ♬

163
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,590
♬  Two   ♬

164
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,730
♬  Three get set go   ♬

165
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:42,690
♬  Bye bye bye goodbye no no no   ♬

166
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,170
♬  Oh you tell me more   ♬

167
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,170
Those little...

168
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,970
Is it a bit dry in here?

169
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:52,570
♬   Because I know you  ♬

170
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:57,830
Please sign this for me!!

171
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:01,910
You're so pretty!

172
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,050
I guess my leaving the house has had a positive effect.

173
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,170
I know, right?

174
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:10,310
Making such a scene...

175
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,250
What are you?

176
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:15,550
Wait a moment.

177
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,930
Song Yi Yeon.

178
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,470
I'd like to see you for a moment.

179
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:23,490
♬   You choose me  ♬

180
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,110
♬   Let it go  ♬

181
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:30,630
♬   Thank you make some noise I love you  ♬

182
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:34,070
♬   Tell me you love everything about me  ♬

183
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,810
Doing everything together now, huh?

184
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:44,410
Okay, let's hear it. What are your terms?

185
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:50,250
First, treat me like Class A star, just like when I debuted.

186
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,210
Because you've been on break for such a long time you must have forgotten how negotiating goes.

187
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,530
Okay, deal. We will treat you like a top class actor in the country.

188
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,610
You're too easy, Branch Manager. Are you sane?

189
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,230
Yes, I'm fine.

190
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:06,390
If it's Song Yi Yeon, she's worth it.

191
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,290
Second, I only deal with top class people.

192
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:14,710
Make the mall's value good enough for me to put my face on it.

193
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:19,770
Between you two, whoever does it, then we shall see and decide.

194
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,190
If you mean that value of the...

195
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:25,930
What kind of senseless demand is that? Give some hints...

196
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:31,590
No! I ask the questions and you have to find the answers.

197
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:35,870
We're done talking now. I'll go home to be devoted to our child.

198
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:40,690
I'll take that deal. I'll raise the value of the department store.

199
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:46,630
But... I really don't know...

200
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:50,310
This contract will have a

201
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:54,590
profound effect on the successor decision. Is that true?

202
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:58,150
They do say so.

203
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:06,450
You sent a request for child custody...

204
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:10,930
What to do? I guess you should work hard.

205
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,890
I'll watch you.

206
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:36,370
If you decide to sign with Lee Hae Joon, the game is over, but why did you have to provoke Cha Jae Gook?

207
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:39,530
Again, again, ruining my mood when I'm feeling good again?

208
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:45,270
Why are you giving him another chance? Do you by chance still have lingering feelings for that guy?

209
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,910
A child's father.

210
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,810
He needs to at least show some effort in front of his child.

211
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:53,710
And so? You used an opportunity that was directed towards you?

212
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,250
Do you not know what kind of a person he is that you're doing this?

213
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,610
Hey, doesn't it seem like she's jealous about something?

214
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:04,310
Jealous?! I shouldn't have said anything.

215
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,870
You haven't become that popular yet. Don't go overboard!

216
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,000
-Where are you going?
-None of your business!

217
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,260
-Are you going to sleep out again?!
- That's right!

218
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:19,430
What's with her, doing things she's never done before?

219
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,870
Why are you following me?

220
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,380
You can't sleep out.

221
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,340
I spent all my youthful days sleeping out, so wha—

222
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,890
- Were you worried about me?
- Na Seok Cheol will be monitoring you.

223
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:37,140
Don't go around on your own.

224
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,210
 This woman's name is Hong Nan?

225
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:07,210
 After Han Gi Tak died, she appeared a month later claiming she's his younger sibling.

226
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,800
 Right now she's acting as Song Yi Yeon's manager.

227
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,400
 She has gathered all the guys who used to be under Han Gi Tak.

228
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,330
Are you saying you are Han Gi Tak's younger sister?

229
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:33,500
I don't think I put you in that seat to look at Song Yi Yeon's infuriating face.

230
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,960
I'm saying to get it right!

231
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,110
Don't worry.

232
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:42,650
The bubble will burst soon and her glory will soon fade.

233
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:46,380
I do know this field well, don't I, President?

234
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,030
I'm sorry I'm late.

235
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:00,550
I told you to look into that manager girl. What did you find out?

236
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:04,130
She's just a girl who wants to get popular.

237
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,490
You don't have to worry about her at all.

238
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,360
I see.

239
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,040
Whenever I assign work to you President Na, you always tell me not to worry about it.

240
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,760
What do I have to believe that I can entrust work to you?

241
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,630
To say something like that...

242
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:19,780
Song Yi Yeon probably didn't come to the department store just to model.

243
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,560
I thought she was just going to let the other side win, but

244
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,990
seeing how she gave us a chance, I'm sure there is some flexibility.

245
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:29,470
So, now you want me to hang Song Yi Yeon's face in my department store?

246
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:34,160
Isn't it more profitable than just handing over the contract to Branch Manager Lee?

247
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,170
How about approaching her manager?

248
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,980
Yes. That's what I've been thinking as well, since she is my actress.

249
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:44,530
My Jeong Ji Hoon will take charge of work this time.

250
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,230
Pardon?

251
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:02,620
 According to the information, he is digging into Han Gi Tak's car accident.

252
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,310
- Sunjin? 
 -  His name is Jeong Ji Hoon.

253
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:08,380
 He is Jeong Ji Hoon. I think he is on Cha Jae Gook's side.

254
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:29,190
Come on. You said you were going to reveal Gi Tak Hyung's cooking secret but what are you doing a taste test for?

255
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:33,660
Hey! After eating your pasta I almost croaked.

256
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:38,340
You can't get that bad of a taste without having a sense of taste.

257
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:42,650
Pick out the salt, sugar, and msg.

258
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:47,750
Gosh. Making me do everything now.

259
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:51,760
This one is sugar.

260
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,200
Salt.

261
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,850
Msg.

262
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,150
Salt.

263
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,860
Sugar.

264
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:10,230
Na Seok Cheol, that bastard. What has he been feeding you? His sense of taste is totally dead!

265
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,660
This is sugar.

266
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,430
This is salt.

267
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:17,830
Stop eating it! They're all salt!

268
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:35,080
 Hey pretty one.  Some bastard is digging into your brother's past. What do you think?

269
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,440
What are you talking about?

270
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,650
His name is Jeong Ji Hoon from Sunjin Department Store.

271
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:42,190
Jeong Ji Hoon?

272
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:47,020
It's because I thought you will be had by him before you get Cha Jae Gook.

273
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:53,210
 After I gave some freedom to Song Yi Yeon,  my main meal line is about to rot.

274
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:58,570
So you, pretty one, should exert some more effort, right?

275
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,770
I'm sorry, but we're closed for today.

276
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,090
Hong Nan?

277
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,970
Jeong Ji Hoon?

278
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,440
What are you doing here?

279
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,130
 Did Cha Jae Gook send you?

280
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:44,300
I don't know who this guy is but I think I saw him somewhere. He's making me feel bad.

281
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:48,360
You're surely not 100% on Branch Manager Lee Hae Joon's side right?

282
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,260
Help us out as well. Song Yi Yeon's mission is too hard.

283
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,520
It is a bit hard.

284
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:01,440
Although my taste buds are dead, my sense of sight is one of the best.

285
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,320
Oh, oh, oh!

286
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:28,980
 If the pretty one has met with Jeong Ji Hoon, tell me what they talked about immediately.

287
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:40,510
 Is the person in charge here named Han Gi Tak?

288
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:43,460
 Yes, that's correct.

289
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,850
 Thank you.

290
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,960
Jeong Ji Hoon is digging into Han Gi Tak Hyung's past? For what?

291
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,250
It's obvious, Cha Jae Gook is trying to dig up weaknesses on Song Yi Yeon.

292
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:03,610
How could he not only do work at his job but do personal work for him...

293
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,530
Just what is this bastard doing?

294
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:08,050
He asked for a hint about Song Yi Yeon's contract.

295
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:10,680
What? What kind of mindless thing...

296
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,490
If I meet him tomorrow...

297
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:17,240
I must give it to him

298
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,380
Is your back okay?

299
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,340
It's fine.

300
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,840
Your throat doesn't hurt? Did you sleep well?

301
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,380
Yes.

302
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,770
Why are you being like this?

303
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:49,610
Stay still. I need you right now.

304
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:09,270
How is it? Is it comfortable?

305
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,610
This pillow is new and is supposed to help you sleep well.

306
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,070
Hello, Sister-in-law.

307
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,410
Oh hello.

308
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:26,700
I think she really liked that pillow.

309
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,970
You idiot.

310
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,670
She really liked it.

311
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:40,030
He is a good person but you're an Ahjumma.

312
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,580
Han Na, give me some strength.

313
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,790
Charging power!

314
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:50,050
Mom! I can't breathe!

315
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:52,600
Father-in-law!

316
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,610
What's wrong?

317
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:57,010
Give me your strength.

318
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:02,960
♬  cuz I’m still waiting for you   ♬

319
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,840
This is the wine you like, right?

320
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,920
I didn't think you'd remember this much.

321
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:37,100
It seems that you don't know, but I have a lot of interest in you.

322
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,100
That's scary.

323
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,310
Hurry up and get to your point.

324
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:53,030
If you're going to sign a contract with Sunjin mall, then do it with me. It looks better in every way.

325
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:57,010
I think doing it with you is the worst option.

326
00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:00,750
I will do what you want and treat you like a Class A person.

327
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:04,280
Really? What about the store's value?

328
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,660
What? So my face can be on it, what are you willing to do?

329
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,630
Since you're the president, it's not like you don't have thoughts on the matter.

330
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:16,060
Why and what? Should I put a golden bow on the department's roof for you?

331
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,960
You'll need to try harder.

332
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:52,110
I am Lee Hae Joon. I am Lee Hae Joon.

333
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:56,290
I am Lee Hae Joon. You are a genius, Lee Hae Joon.

334
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:01,160
How can I increase the value of the department store?

335
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,880
This drives me crazy. I can't think of anything!

336
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,230
Now look what he's doing.

337
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:12,590
He is carrying out a rival mission, with the president, for Song Yi Yeon.

338
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:16,840
The promise he made about the employee benefits would be all lies.

339
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,090
I almost forgot about this.

340
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:39,840
Now it's good that you know. Take care of him.

341
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,300
He will be of great help in selling our department store.

342
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,670
Good Afternoon, Branch Manager.

343
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,410
Lee He Sa, Who are you to direct a person to here and there?

344
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:00,440
This parking lot is for female customers only.

345
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,470
Hey! Since you're doing your job so poorly the cars don't know where to go

346
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:09,070
I earn $100,000 a minute. You just wasted 10 minutes of my time here.

347
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:13,740
How much do you earn? What kind of work do you do that makes you think you can get in my way?

348
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,340
Chairman Jang. Welcome!

349
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:19,500
President Cha! You should train your employees better than this.

350
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,870
Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

351
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,870
Hey, parking attendant. Go home.

352
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,260
Yes?

353
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:29,750
President. Please wait. I didn't do anything wrong.

354
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,200
What are you doing?

355
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,220
Uh, I'm sorry.

356
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,410
If you don't abide by the employee policy, you have no reason to be here.

357
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:37,300
Secretary Go, why are you just standing there?

358
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,050
Wait, President! President.

359
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:42,910
He was fine handling customer vehicles.

360
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:46,370
He always fires employees whenever they get a complaint from customers.

361
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:47,500
This is annoying.

362
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,740
I did wrong, President.

363
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,590
I did wrong.

364
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,130
I apologize to you.

365
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:02,460
If you didn't talk back in the first place this wouldn't be happening,

366
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:06,040
making a person's face wrinkle.

367
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,420
What are you doing? Remove him.

368
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,520
Yes.

369
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,190
Wait a second.

370
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:13,600
Here comes Hong Gil Dong again .   (Korean "Robin Hood")

371
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,100
What's up again, Branch Manager Lee Hae Joon?

372
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,440
It seems that you have a problem with my employee.

373
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,290
I just can not let this kind of thing slide.

374
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:22,300
What? The brothers are fighting to gain favor?

375
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,140
Heol! This is big.

376
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:29,770
Lee Hae Sang, that name tag is not for someone to threaten you.

377
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:31,970
Don't bow your head to just anyone.

378
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,470
Yes.

379
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:38,700
Branch Manager is so arrogant.

380
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,230
Branch Manager Lee. Don't make a fuss and just drop it.

381
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,790
Do you know who you're talking to? What kind of attitude are you giving me right now?

382
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:50,390
Our department store is the place we sell products, not attitudes.

383
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:53,240
Selling a product and it's benefit is a fair deal.

384
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:59,080
We don't need to provide good service to the arrogant customers

385
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,120
who think they are above our employees.

386
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,720
What the owner says is the employee policy. Do you still not get it?

387
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,680
Do you understand?

388
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,440
Yes, Branch Manager.

389
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,280
Branch Manager Lee!

390
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,040
And we should take this opportunity to change the policy.

391
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,280
You should also study the updated policy.

392
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,860
Secretary Go, take care of your boss,

393
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,030
so he won't be embarrassed like he was embarrassed today.

394
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:25,440
Then I'll get going to greet the real VIP.

395
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,980
Then...

396
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:33,590

397
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,710
Han Nah!

398
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:59,150
I thought you were not coming.

399
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:03,110
Dad promised to teach you how to ride a bike.

400
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:06,360
I'm teaching you instead of your dad.

401
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,010
Let's do it.

402
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,950
Good job!

403
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,740
To the left. To the left.

404
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,590
Here.

405
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,060
Oh, oh, oh.

406
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,840
Yes, yes.

407
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,460
Then, you should hold on to me.

408
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,140
Great!

409
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,930
You're riding the bike very well.

410
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:27,220
Don't let go of me.

411
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,680
I won't.

412
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,350
♫   My eyes miss you  ♫

413
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:37,040
♫  The tears tell me to find you  ♫

414
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:42,480
♫  The image of you that goes away as I turn around  ♫

415
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,850
♬   It gets harder  ♬

416
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:54,340
♫  Why haven't I been able to forget?  ♫

417
00:35:54,340 --> 00:36:02,910
♫  Deep inside my heart. I know I need you  ♫

418
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:06,890
Even the food preference and favorite music,

419
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:09,940
does the planning department do this kind of work?

420
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:13,120
Its a basic thing to know about the person who is going to be our department store's model.

421
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,850
Song Yi Yeon has high expectations.

422
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,620
towards guys too.

423
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:22,980
Anyway, you're very close to Song Yi Yeon?

424
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,140
Yes, we met in the States.

425
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,070
You met Lee Hae Joon in the States too?

426
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:31,100
Are you a reporter? You have lots of questions today.

427
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:34,030
At the fashion show I watched you carefully.

428
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:37,360
I think you are a very attractive person. You might be very good at acting.

429
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,640
I hear that a lot.

430
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:44,270
Isn't it hard to live somebody else's life?

431
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,520
I know your brother very well.

432
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,860
I mean Han Gi Tak.

433
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,840
I don't think he knows you.

434
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,990
You are Han Gi Tak's little sister?

435
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:04,060
You're telling a lie, Hong Nan?

436
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,530
  He knows I am not the real one.

437
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:10,630
  Who is it? Cha Jae Gook? Na Seok Cheol?

438
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,540
Why do you think I am lying, Jeong Ji Hoon?

439
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:21,500
If you want to know, let's have dinner together tomorrow.

440
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:33,700
 Explain. I had a makeover.

441
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:40,550
If Cha Jae Gook had known that I am Han Gi Tak's little sister,

442
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,940
he wouldn't have stayed like this.

443
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:47,180
There would be no reason for Jeong Ji Hoon to come to me to say I am the fake one.

444
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:50,000
He's a guy that I can't figure out.

445
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,700
I need to see him tomorrow.

446
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,900
What?

447
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,410
What is this?

448
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,380
What is this?

449
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:08,480
I'm waiting for your call--X

450
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:19,330
Who's X? What pretty lady's heart did you shake up

451
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,770
This look

452
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:24,010
It's not like I can write "I'm taken" on me.

453
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,780
Hehehehe

454
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,860
I'm going to go crazy.

455
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:33,640
  Our department store is the place we sell products, not attitudes.

456
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,380
Oh my. Awesome!

457
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,690
He is so cool.

458
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,340
We were mistaken about him.

459
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,410
I believed in him, the Branch Manager.

460
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,050
What the heck? Let's watch it again.

461
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:44,940
Press play.

462
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,730
  Our department store is the place we sell products, not attitudes.

463
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,930
Oh Branch Manager. He is awesome.

464
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,740
I knew he would be like that.

465
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,450
Did you want to see me?

466
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:05,270
Department Manager, Jeong Ji Hoon. You know how important it is for us to enter into a contract with Song Yi Yeon as a model.

467
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,130
Of course.

468
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:12,760
Knowing that, how could you go around saying her manager is lying about her identity?

469
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,240
Then what are we?

470
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,060
As expected, you two talk to each other often.

471
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,170
Just answer my questions.

472
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:21,360
- Like people are saying, is it your specialty using a dead person to get to the top?
 - What?

473
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,940
To use Song Yi Yeon, Isn't she pretending to be Han Gi Tak's sister?

474
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,630
That woman.

475
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:33,550
So to get to Cha Jae Gook, you're saying I created Han Gi Tak's sister? Is that it?

476
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,940
Yes. And what is the evidence that makes you say that?

477
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,250
You'll soon find out.

478
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,570
What are you waiting for?

479
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,220
I've brought the document for the new products.

480
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,730
Leave it there

481
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:14,450
I didn't want to say this because this is going against my pride, but why can't I be with you when Lee Hae Joon can?

482
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:15,310
Manager!

483
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:20,190
That night when Sunbae died, was it because we were together?

484
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,590
I feel the same way as you.

485
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:26,570
I suffered too, from Sunbae's death.

486
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:28,060
For that reason, I hesitated countless times,

487
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:33,760
but I was afraid that you were going to get hurt, so I couldn't leave and watch you suffer.

488
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,660
Yes,

489
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:39,110
I hate myself for sitting at that same seat with you that night.

490
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:41,370
If I could, I would turn back time.

491
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:47,060
- Da Hye 
 - I was always sad whenever I was with Yeong Soo.

492
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:53,050
At that time, when you appeared, I could be happy again.

493
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:58,150
But then, when you appeared, Yeong Soo died.

494
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:03,620
So whenever I see you, Ji Hoon, I remember his death and I am so tired of that.

495
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:06,810
That night, when we met, do you think that was just a coincidence?

496
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:07,830
I had something to say to you.

497
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,440
Stop it. I don't want to hear it.

498
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,480
Da Hye.

499
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:47,220
♬   In my two empty eyes  ♬

500
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:53,070
♬   The image of you going away from me appears  ♬

501
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,810
I'm sorry.

502
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,970
I misunderstood you, like a stupid bastard.

503
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:08,630
I couldn't even treat you out for dinner or celebrate our anniversary, like a stupid bastard.

504
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:15,650
I'm sorry that I left you alone and told you to only look at me.

505
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:19,290
Because the only thing I can tell you is I'm sorry,

506
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:24,090
♬  The time you won't come to me  ♬

507
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:25,290
I'm sorry.

508
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:30,260
♬  Even if I wish for it and wish for it again  ♬

509
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:39,050
♬  The person who can't stay with me.  ♬

510
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,860
From when were you here?

511
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,300
Since you were here.

512
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,920
I was always with you by your side.

513
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,430
You just didn't know.

514
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,450
Really?

515
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:55,750
I'm not going to say I'm sorry, like a stupid bastard,

516
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:02,400
so I won't have any regrets when I leave here.

517
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:12,610
♬   Like the star over there,   ♬

518
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:23,300
♬  With neither a promise nor a hope  ♬

519
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:35,340
 Isn't it hard to live as a different person?

520
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:42,490
  You're Han Gi Tak's sister? Are you lying, Hong Nan?

521
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:46,300
Jeong Ji Hoon, that bastard.

522
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,640
What does he know?

523
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:57,570
Does he know the identity of my younger sibling?

524
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,890
Why? What does the person named Jeong Ji Hoon say?

525
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:13,790
He knows that Hong Nan is Han Gi Tak's sister.

526
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:17,120
Oh my God. His knowledge is extensive.

527
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,280
We must fix this before it reaches the ears of President Cha.

528
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,180
Right.

529
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:27,800
If President Cha hears about this, he will be very disturbed.

530
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,490
Right?

531
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:40,600
Jeez! You surprised me.

532
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:43,410
Did you put some kind of tracker in my body?

533
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:45,830
I said to not come up suddenly next to me at any time.

534
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:47,690
I'm sorry, President.

535
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:50,880
There was an urgent issue and I felt a bit rushed.

536
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,770
Yes, I'm sorry.

537
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:54,060
What is it?

538
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,980
You know that younger girl who is Song Yi Yeon's Manager.

539
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:01,710
I mean Hong Nan. I found out her true identity.

540
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:08,040
She's Han Gi Tak's little sister.

541
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:17,220
And the place where Song Yi Yeon is at is...

542
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:25,750
  Hello, this is the Branch Manager.

543
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:28,310
  To all customers who are visiting Sunjin Department Store,

544
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:32,170
  and to all employees of Sunjin Department Store, I will be making an announcement.

545
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:35,720
 - Sunjin Department Store, as we are trying to be family friendly,  
- What is he talking about?

546
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:39,540
 - for all customers who are visiting us with the family on Family Day twice a month, we will be giving you special promotions.

547
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:43,870
  And for all employees of Sunjin Department Store, we will be be giving a thirty minute early dismissal.

548
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:47,970
What is this? A gag?

549
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:51,800
We are planning to close at 7:30 PM so I hope you'll have no objection.

550
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:57,440
Don't think of staying overnight and go home early.

551
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,510
What is this I'm hearing?

552
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:03,350
Customers, it is time for you all to return to your families.

553
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:05,260
  Then, I will be leaving.

554
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:20,580
What? It's really early dismissal?

555
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:24,420
This is so great!

556
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:35,180
How are you leaving work? Get moving!

557
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,300
What are you doing?

558
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,090
Date!

559
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:54,930
♬  The road I accidentally was walking   ♬

560
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:59,830
♬  felt familiar and I stopped there  ♬

561
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:04,840

♬  How much will it change   ♬

564
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:19,200
♬  Will you give a smile as bright as moonlight?   ♬

565
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:23,780
♬  You were always beautiful   ♬

566
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:29,490
♬  It’s only you who left just me alone   ♬

567
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:31,690
Wear it.
♬  Moon light  ♬

568
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:37,220
- Store Manager. 
 - We will go and eat dinner when you wear that. 
 ♬  Thinking about you tonight   ♬

569
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:42,930
♬  you appear in my sweet dream   ♬

♬  cuz I’m still waiting for you   ♬

575
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,450
Will you trust in me one more time?

576
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:46,740
♬   Then, because I didn't know everything   ♬

577
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:55,930

582
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:22,830
Why? Were you disappointed it was your house? 
♬   Although we are saying goodbye now  ♬

583
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:27,340
♬  The painful memory of letting you go   ♫

584
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:30,860
  is left to me. I feel deep regret.  ♬

585
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:32,780
Does it look delicious?
♫  My eyes missing you  ♫

586
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,630
I will grill it deliciously!
♫  The tears tell me to find you  ♫

587
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:40,560
♫  The tears tell me to find you but   ♫

588
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:48,690
It looks really good. 
♬   Turning away, going farther away, your imaged is fading.♬

589
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:50,780
The smell is good, right?

590
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:54,720
Aren't you guys happy while spending time with your family?

591
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:58,910
Mom, I'm so hungry.

592
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:01,590
Yeah, let's eat fast.

593
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:03,660
Yes, Father.

594
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:09,570
I think the meat isn't grilling properly.

595
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:11,550
Did the fire go out?

596
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,310
Han Na, just wait a little. It's almost done.

597
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:16,080
Father, wait a bit. I will grill it deliciously.

598
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,450
We will spend the night waiting for him to grill meat.

599
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:21,560
Should I help you?

600
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,740
The man is supposed to do everything outside!

601
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:25,010
Stay still.

602
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:27,940
Daughter, why don't we just eat some ramen?

603
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:30,340
Should we? Han Na, you're hungry, right?

604
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:33,310
- Ramen. 
- That's better, right?

605
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:35,710
Yeah.

606
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:48,420
Aigoo, what is this?

607
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:52,240
Aigoo, Daughter-In-Law, the table things are going to fly off.

608
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,620
Han Na, are you okay?

609
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:55,940
Father, are you okay?

610
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,750
Han Na's Mom.

611
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:00,600
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

612
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,690
How can you push away a person who is trying to help?

613
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:17,350
♫  My eyes miss you, The tears tell me to find you but  ♫

617
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:05,620
Mom is now going to appear on TV a lot. You see, your Mom got really popular.

618
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:09,040
You'll spend the whole day watching me on TV.

619
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,800
Wow.

620
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:12,940
Is Dad treating you well?

621
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:16,200
Dad made me fried rice and he even kicked the ball with me.

622
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,090
Really?

623
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:20,130
He told me say that to you.

624
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:26,410
I see. I guess you liked it, my son.

625
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:31,120
Where did the Lightning girl and Uncle go?

626
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:34,820
I know. I guess both are busy today.

627
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:39,200
When I come next time, I'll make sure I come with them.

628
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,960
 The Last Goodbye

629
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:55,880
 Strongly. Move fast.

630
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:59,460
Ahhh, yess.

631
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:06,550
Now, he must have felt a bit of my wrath?

632
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:09,960
You cute little President Cha Jae Gook bastard.

633
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:14,500
I think the game will get more interesting.

634
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:18,390
I want to see it happen quickly!

635
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,580
Welcome.

636
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:06,220
You who are not Han Gi Tak's younger sibling.

637
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,720
You want to have a beer first?

638
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,430
What's the reason for wanting to see me at your house?

639
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:37,100
So that I can tell you that you are a fake.

640
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:45,980
As if Han Gi Tak wasn't enough, did he tell you to get rid of everybody around him?

641
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:49,370
DId Cha Jae Gook tell you to do that?

642
00:55:56,930 --> 00:55:59,730
If Cha Jae Gook knows, does it become dangerous?

643
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:06,020
Even knowing this you're pretending to be Hong Gi Tak's sibling

644
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:08,630
Is it because of money or because of loyalty?

645
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:12,780
What? That is amazing, however,

646
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:17,720
now I wish for you to stop, because that person is going to be very sad.

647
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,020
What do you mean by that person?

648
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:22,110
The real Han Gi Tak's younger sibling?

649
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:22,780
What?

650
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:25,550
I know Han Gi Tak's real younger sibling.

651
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,650
Really.

652
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,670
What do you mean, Really?

653
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:51,370
 The real Justice Dude

654
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:55,800
 The real Han Gi Tak's younger sibling is looking for her family.

655
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:00,030
I intended to keep a promise I made a long time ago but

656
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:04,600
it cannot get ruined by you.

657
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:07,230
Who is the person?

658
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:09,640
Someone who is close...

659
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,120
Where is that child right now?

660
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:21,960
 Where are you going?

661
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:37,720
♬   Wherever I am filling me with   ♬

662
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:42,960
♬   A memory which was lost in space   ♬

663
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:53,080
♬   The memories of a time I turned far away from   ♬

664
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:59,060
♬   Whether it was a matter of something which was forgotten   ♬

665
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:04,070
♬   or whether it was matter of going toward somewhere   ♬

666
00:58:04,070 --> 00:58:14,920
♬   I’m spending a day once again among the days I dreamed of.   ♬

667
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:20,240
♬   It might be too late   ♬

668
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:24,500
♬   Maybe in a place that I can’t even go back to   ♬

669
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:28,170
- Is it good? 
 - It's delicious! 
 ♬   My whole love is alive and breathing.   ♬

670
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:35,420
Here! 
 ♬   My whole love is alive and breathing.   ♬

671
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:37,420
♬   My whole love is alive and breathing.   ♬

672
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:39,500
 Eat a lot.

673
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:42,710
I'll cut it for you

674
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:51,720
♬   The one reason always in my life   ♬

675
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,250
Hey!

676
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:00,380
Omo! Hong Nan! You came at the perfect time. Come over and eat! 
 ♬   My everything is like that   ♬

677
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:01,890
Come on! 
 ♬   My everything is like that   ♬

678
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:07,580
♬   In the air which is given   ♬

679
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:14,590
♬   Forever in my every dream   ♬

680
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:16,340
Punk.

681
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:21,320
It's been a long time.

682
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,670
Han Yeong Tan.

683
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:39,880

684
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:44,260
 Epilogue

685
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:47,940
Five cargo ships, six container ships and

686
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:51,420
Three planes have passed,

687
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:56,910
but this is the twelveth ship to pass.

688
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:28,510
 Han Hong Nan. She looked, she looked.

689
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:31,130
 Do you know why I agreed to do that?

690
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:34,370
 Why did you make such a commotion?

691
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:37,760
 This... It belongs to Cha Jae Gook!

692
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,670
 I want to play with you, Han Na. But I don't have a lot of time left.

693
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:43,630
 Ahjussi, are you going somewhere?

694
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:46,890
 From now on, don't make things difficult for Da Hye. I'm going to protect her from now on.

695
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:50,010
 In your memories, leave just a small space for me.

696
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:52,720
 -What's wrong? 
- What did you say to Han Na when you came over?

697
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,210
 She's gone. She disappeared.

698
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:57,460
 Where are you right now?
