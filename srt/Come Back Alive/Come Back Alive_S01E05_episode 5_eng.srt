1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:06,520

2
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,530
This is very moving.

3
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:41,010
But, you said that this company bears responsibility for the death of Manager Kim.

4
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,860
Then, does that mean that Shin Da Hye over there

5
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,730
is working at the company that killed her husband?

6
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,600
If she had any doubts about her husband's death,

7
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,300
then how could she work at this company like nothing happened?

8
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,400
Isn't that right, Shin Da Hye?

9
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,700
To put it bluntly, the important thing right now is

10
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,240
didn't Kim Yeong Soo die because he was bribed?

11
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,410
Do you have any proof he was bribed?!

12
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,230
He bought a very expensive necklace for his wife.

13
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,430
It cost over $1,000.

14
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,200
Is that something a salary man can afford?

15
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,110
Wasn't that purchased with a bribe?

16
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:25,430
The necklace was purchased in ten monthly payments.

17
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:29,130
 I'm not very sure when it comes to cosmetics or jewelry.

18
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,880
 Look at these and pick something.

19
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,720
 It's for your wedding anniversary so how could I?

20
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,330
 This one. The one that looks a bit yellowish. How about this one?

21
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,170
 Wouldn't that be too burdensome? It's really small.

22
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,210
 What about the one next to it?

23
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,850
 Your wife's neckline is long,

24
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,640
 and she has a white face so...

25
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,770
 As expected.

26
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,970
 If I had a younger sister,

27
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,870
 I would make you my brother-in-law.

28
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,060
 He would have been Younger Brother-in-law.

29
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,950
 Is that so? Of course!

30
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,290
He was being careful, while he was using his coworker.

31
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,890
While accepting bribes.

32
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,070
It was to cover up the truth about himself.

33
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,090
Why are you all so certain?

34
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,600
If it gets proven that Kim Yeong Soo is innocent,

35
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,970
will it hurt you in any way or something?

36
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,340
This is...

37
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,360
We're just saying...

38
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,650
But why would he go up to the roof

39
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,530
and jump to his death?

40
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,840
Let's stop this now. In front of the dead person's wife

41
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,900
you're going too far.

42
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,520
That's it for today.

43
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,010
The people who work in this building,

44
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,350
are people who live and eat thanks to this company.

45
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,380
The truth about the death of a sad worker?

46
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,100
Nobody is curious about that.

47
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,370
Look at this.

48
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,810
Even after her husband died, how she's looking for a new path with him.

49
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,490
I thought you were a smart one, but I was wrong.

50
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,190
You spoke for a very long time.

51
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,140
Can you organize what the director just said?

52
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,650
Although it's only two scenes, it's a character that I need.

53
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,030
Because of the actress who couldn't come today, due to tonsillitis,

54
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,180
he says he desperately wants you to fill in the role.

55
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,750
In summary!

56
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,590
You are not the female lead.

57
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,510
Even if you refuse,

58
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,450
how should I say this... It's fine by me.

59
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,490
I'm okay. That's okay.

60
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,760
No no no no problem.

61
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,410
- Really okay? 
- Yes.

62
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,800
That's okay?

63
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,130
I mean, I'm coming back from a ten-year break. A lead role would be too much.

64
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,680
Just to dip my toes in the water again,

65
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,250
like a cameo appearance. Yes, like a cameo appearance. That sounds good.

66
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,090
If you think that way, than I'm thankful, Actress Song.

67
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,690
You're welcome.

68
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,800
Then I'll get ready for the shoot. Where's the dressing room?

69
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,800
D-Dressing room... That's right. I need to get one for you but...

70
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,600
That's uh... Oh!

71
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,660
That one?

72
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,080
Let's talk for a moment.

73
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,620
Go ahead.

74
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,800
There are a lot of eyes here so...

75
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,270
Why? You spoke so well earlier.

76
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,390
Have you ever lost a family member?

77
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:33,270
For people like you who have money in front of their eyes, does it not matter?

78
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:38,340
But then if you were a person with any manners,

79
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,260
you wouldn't have come like this.

80
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:56,940
Unni, you know I seduced him, right?

81
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,550
What's with your expression?

82
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,520
Do you still have some pride left over?

83
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,870
An actress like you, who always had the role of an innocent girl,

84
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,870
would never have a role of slapping another woman's face like this.

85
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,030
I'm the expert on things like this.

86
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,760
I'm the one who was hit, changed and did everything instead of you.

87
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,930
Now it's your turn because I'm going continue rising to the top.

88
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,170
Would you go fetch some water for me, Unni?

89
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,370
Director, don't you think that the amount of water we used is not enough?

90
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,270
The whole effect doesn't come off because there's so little water.

91
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,390
 Cut! Cut!

92
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,770
We'll start again after five minutes.

93
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,290
Cover her up.

94
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,660
- Did you play with him a little? 
- What did you say?

95
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,520
If you're dreaming about living in the master bedroom of Sunjin Group,

96
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,440
just work hard on acting.

97
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,680
There are 15 other kids like you in line.

98
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,780
Even if it did work out, you'd end up like me, too.

99
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,740
Is she out of her mind?!

100
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,630
Let go of me!

101
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,340
I'm sorry, please use the washroom a little later.

102
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,020
Why? Why won't you let us through?

103
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,180
Did something happen?

104
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,950
Be more gentle.

105
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,020
I'm pretty sure I told you not to show up.

106
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,980
If I left because you told me to leave, you'd get mad at me because I left.

107
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,290
When you tell me to go away and I don't,

108
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:18,000
you get mad because I didn't leave.

109
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,130
Were you like this to Han Gi Tak too?

110
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,840
What? What? What did I do?

111
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,850
What's so likable about this kind of wench?

112
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,720
I could be in a film, a drama, a CF ( commercial ).

113
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,430
he was going around like a crazy person trying to make it to everything on time.

114
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,260
Is that so?

115
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,970
I thought he was just crazy about boxing.

116
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:43,270
Han Gi Tak was always shining in the ring.

117
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:49,590
But, aren't you embarrassed?

118
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,980
Because you got chirped at by some little chick,

119
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,610
are you becoming less confident, Song Yi Yeon?

120
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:08,820
You draw it on hair by hair. You have to get the gradation right so that it gets spread out.

Great! Let's go eat!

155
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,160
Shin Da Hye, let's talk for a moment.

156
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,920
I don't want to hear it. Please just leave me alone.

157
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,760
Shin Da Hye!

158
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,920
Let go!

159
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,180
Let go of me!

160
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:12,300
Look at it! Look at it closely. If you don't you can't do anything.

161
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:21,220
What are you afraid of? Manager Kim is dead and is not by your side anymore.

162
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,040
You have that many people to fight so how long are you going to keep on running away?

163
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,720
Why? Why did he die?

164
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,120
You guys are supposed to tell me.

165
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,220
That person... Why did that person have to die?

166
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,920
I'm sorry.

167
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,660
The reply to that question,

168
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,640
I will answer soon. Please wait.

169
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,260
Ah, this isn't it.

170
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,020
Jae Il.

171
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:41,990
You betraying bastard. Where do you think this is? Go away.

172
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:49,650
Go! Go, you bastard! Go, go, go!

173
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,660
Do you have any food?

174
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:56,760
You crazy bastard. What are you doing without making sure to eat?

175
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,480
Hello, Noonims.

176
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:24,580

177
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,300
Looks like it satisfies her taste buds.

178
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,460
I'm so hungry that I could even eat a shoe.

179
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,480
You can't.

180
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:56,060
That part is only for employees!

181
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,280
You've done some cooking.

182
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,460
Plate.

183
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:42,920
Awesome. This taste is awesome. This taste...

184
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,780
You got Hyungnim Gil Tak's taste just right! How'd you do it?

185
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,540
I said to parboil it.

186
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,380
 What should I do with this, should I stir-fry it or boil it?

187
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:02,700
 Par boil it. It's tough to chew.

188
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,460
 Hey, mister. Menu.

189
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,560
 It's nice, isn't it?

190
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:24,520
 Goosebumps! Our fates are really something.

191
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:43,740
♫  Whenever I see your eyes, I feel uneasy  ♫

192
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:49,280
♫  Being near you makes me feel lonely  ♫

193
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:55,520
♫  The only person in my heart is you  ♫

194
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:03,990
♫  Don't turn around like you don't know me  ♫

195
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,360
♫  I love you  ♫

196
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,280
 Han Na's mom, who I love. My Da Hye.

197
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,980
♫  Don't hide  ♫

198
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,800
 You've been through hard times because you met an incompetent husband, right?

199
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,980
 I said that I'd make you happy, but

200
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,140
 all I did was make you go through hard times. I'm sorry.

201
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:35,060
 I'm working hard for the sake of my family, but sometimes I waver.

202
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:40,830
  Occasionally I think, if I work like an ordinary person in an ordinary household it would be better for our family.

203
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:45,280
 But one day I will be a man

204
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,890
 who won't embarrass you or Han Na.

205
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,320
 I believe that you will believe in me and be understanding.

206
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,060
 I'm always thankful. I love you.

207
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:02,920
♫  There are so many things I want to say to you  ♫

208
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:10,540
 As a symbol of my everlasting love, I present you this necklace.

209
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:16,870
♫  Please don't hide in front of me  ♫

210
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:24,710
♫  Even after 10 years go by  ♫

211
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:30,540
♬   I will love you  ♬

212
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:59,540
I bought this earlier, but she said that she didn't like it. Her preferences are rather strange.

213
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,580
I'm sorry, I'll return it tomorrow.

214
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,460
I mean what do I become? It's new clothing and I can't just throw it away.

215
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,240
You can wear it. It'll match your size.

216
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,060
No, I can't do that.

217
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,280
Am I asking for money? If I say to wear it, just wear it.

218
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,000
What's wrong with you?

219
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,410
If you don't want to wear it then go sell it or something!

220
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:21,220
Stop being stubborn like that and just wear it!

221
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,850
When will you ever get to wear a brand name? Well...

222
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,640
It looks like it'll look good on you.

223
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,460
Look here! Excuse me! I have a letter.

224
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,580
Inside the necklace case.

225
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:43,970
It is right that it was written by him.

226
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,490
Excuse me.

227
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,550
If this is going to be a debt also. Take it with you.

228
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:44,840
The owner of the necklace that you asked about is also in the afterlife.

229
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,060
How did you know that?

230
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,270
The little kid from that household came looking for the necklace.

231
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:52,140
And her mother is completely...

232
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,510
That fox, she was seducing a younger guy.

233
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:00,480
That was the night our big brother passed away.

234
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,070
I remember clearly.

235
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:10,090
 This is suppose to be a wedding anniversary dinner. Something is fishy

236
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,220
 What are you doing?

237
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,370
 - This might be useful.
-Go back to your work.

238
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,810
 He's here. The man is here.

239
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,920
 Hey honey.

240
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:42,070
Aren't you the guy who gave the necklace as your anniversary gift at our place?

241
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:45,910
Yes, that's right. That was your place?

242
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:51,280
 No wonder. I thought sister-in-law looked familiar. Fate is crazy.

243
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,160
I know, right?

244
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,740
 I don't know if I'm doing the right thing.

245
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,570
Sister-in-law might be

246
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:07,340
Wait, why is that friend...?

247
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:11,380
She came that day. The day we died.

248
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,250
Huh?

249
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,730
 With some guy.

250
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,260
What do you mean?

251
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:20,060
I'm positive you know that guy.

252
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,730
He's a hundred times better looking than you.

253
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:34,650
 Hey, Honey? Are you listening?

254
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,870
 Branch Manager?

255
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,350
 You punk!

256
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:49,310
 How long has this been going on between the two of you?

257
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,750
 What's with you?

258
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,880
 Are you okay?

259
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,820
 You guys betrayed me?!

260
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,760
 How could you two?!

261
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:10,180
 How could these two betray me?!

262
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:14,920
 How could these two do this to me?

263
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,150
 How long has it been going on?

264
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:46,220

265
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,500
Yes, Director Goo?

266
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,310
She'll be here soon.

267
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,340
She's here.

268
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:09,240
Hey actress Song! Our Song Yi Yeon.

269
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,870
Oh, Director Goo!

270
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,050
My goodness.

271
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,970
It's really been a long time.

272
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:22,200
Hey, our hallyu star never ages.

273
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,410
You're still the same.

274
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,330
Thank you.

275
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:30,610
Who is he to be hugging someone else's woman like that?

276
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:33,370
 The Story That Only You Didn't Know.

277
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:36,810
This work is wonderful, Director.

278
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:41,460
However, it's my comeback after ten years.

279
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:48,260
It's a lead role, not even a supporting actress. I'm sorry.I don't think I can do it.

280
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:53,210
What were you looking at? You are the lead actress.

281
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:57,880
Honestly, I was happy when I heard that you divorced and were making a comeback.

282
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,110
This role won't work unless it's Song Yi Yeon.

283
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:08,070
Let's go. This damn...

284
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:11,120
This guy is a pure gangster con-artist.

285
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,620
What complete bullsh*t! What crazy person would use you as a lead actress these days?!

286
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,200
♫  Say it once  ♫

287
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,720
Of course, if someone were to cast you as the leading actress, there would be lot of talk.

288
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,320
However, I saw you acting earlier and

289
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,410
I became completely confident.

290
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:35,730
Will this really be alright? It's such a big production.

291
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:40,900
Don't you know me? A crazy dog that never lets go once bitten.

292
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,890
Thirteen years ago, when everyone opposed Song Yi Yeon,

293
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:50,090
I'm the director that pushed you to become a Hallyu star.

294
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:56,810
Trust in me. Let's re-create the honor of that day together.

295
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,490
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you, Director.

296
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:10,870
I put her safely in your hands.

297
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:14,500
Take this also.

298
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,850
This person. There isn't any reason to do such...

299
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:21,720
Tada, forget the words in your head.

300
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,270
It's to forget what I said earlier.

301
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:37,960
I'm going to keep it a secret until all the complications are smoothed out.

302
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,130
I'm going to surprise everyone at the press conference in a week.

303
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:44,780
Just prepare for filming.

304
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,300
You go first. I have to go see a friend.

305
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:24,260
- Hey, Honey! 
 - Let me go!

306
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,480
Why are you acting so irrationally?

307
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,540
Those two are dating!

308
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,440
What?

309
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:36,260
They were dating before we married. They fooled me completely.

310
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,480
No, I think I saw wrong.

311
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,310
Right, right. I just saw wrong!

312
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:45,540
I didn't come back to see this.

313
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,460
What's the point of living?

314
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:54,280
Honey! Honey! Honey!

315
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:58,660
Honey! Honey!

316
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,480
You can't!

317
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,000
That scared me!

318
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:20,710
I could have told you, there are many cases of people seeing what they didn't want to.

319
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:23,350
What shall we do? Should we go back now?

320
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:26,760
I can take you all the way, non-stop.

321
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:31,210
Stop fanning a flaming house and go! Go!

322
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,950
Oh.

323
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:46,030
Let me reiterate. Revealing your former self is prohibited. Revenge is prohibited.

324
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:51,000
Revenge is prohibited! Remember these two rules.

325
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,870
I'm going to get revenge!

326
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:58,020
Hey Miss! Would you like me to give you a warning?

327
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:02,770
It seems that you haven't any idea how scary the punishment is.

328
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:05,850
It would be beneficial to everyone if you two returned with me.

329
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:09,530
Alright. Do you want to go back with the help of my hands?

330
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:14,280
Where did you go? Where?

331
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:18,150
You! Come out! Come back!

332
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:24,130
Get back here, I said! Come back!

333
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,400
As I thought it was strange.

334
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:43,250
When I said I was going to marry Da Hye, I thought that he was too surprised.

335
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:53,940
 I did hear rumors that he and Da Hye were a good match but I didn't pay much attention to it.

336
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,840
 In a place where rumors fly around, Da Hye was really popular.

337
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,770
I was older and not good looking...

338
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:06,180
A guy without a good background—not enough to even give her a business card.

339
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:09,350
No wonder.

340
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:16,160
It's not that I didn't think that she had another man.

341
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:21,870
One day when she had a bad expression on her face, I thought it was my chance.

342
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:26,770
That's why I asked for a date, and for once she said yes!

343
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:31,820
No wonder. That guy had something about him.

344
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,540
That's right! Your place.

345
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,010
That's the place, out of all places, that he recommended to me as the "hot place."

346
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:41,330
As expected, men who seduce women have a different outlook.

347
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:45,270
I didn't even know about something like that...

348
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,510
I didn't know.

349
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:00,630
No! Even if all the women in the world do something like that,

350
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,790
my Da Hye would never do something like that!

351
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:06,280
This won't do. I have to go confirm it for myself.

352
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,580
Would you tell a debt collector if it were you?

353
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,020
It's not possible, but...

354
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,040
It keeps... It keeps...!

355
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,700
Why? Do you think they both did it?

356
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,210
"Did they do it? How many times did they do it?"

357
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:22,240
Or maybe, "Was it better than when I did it?"

358
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,340
- That's enough! 
 - Why?

359
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,250
Boo boo to you.

360
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:38,440
From the way I see it, didn't you barge into their relationship?

361
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:42,240
While sister-in-law's heart was unsteady, you slid in.

362
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,390
Intercept. If you follow the rules, it's a game you can't win.

363
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:49,580
Regardless, the winner was you.

364
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:01,970
There must be a breeze in this place. It's cold.

365
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:04,260
It's so cold.

366
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,170
Please be careful of Maya.

367
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,000
Achoo.

368
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:34,110

369
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,630
 Wedding anniversary! 
I have to live!

370
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:58,120
 The new manager's words might be right.

371
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:02,360
 A person who leaves a letter like this wouldn't commit suicide, right?

372
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,380
 I want to believe that too.

373
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,940
 How did he seem to you that day?

374
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:09,560
 Was there anything strange about him?

375
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,250
 I don't think that Sunbae was that kind of person, but

376
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,750
 stop this.

377
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:18,260
 If you keep doing this, it'll only be harder on you and your family.

378
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:53,240
Welcome and thank you for coming.

379
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:06,820
 You people need to say it, about why he died!

380
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:10,360
 I'm sorry. I'll give you the answer soon.

381
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,560
 Please wait a little longer.

382
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,590
 It seems like there's going to be a meeting to plan out the first six months of our business.

383
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:20,790
 The CEO is going to be here for this meeting.

384
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,530
Shin Da Hye.

385
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:52,340
It's hard for me to see you.

386
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,760
Those childish anklets!

387
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:01,110
Do you think those old fashioned anklets are suitable for our store?!

388
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,180
Ah-jum-ma.

389
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:06,650
Those... Those heels...

390
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:09,780
You got them in 2008, those old models.

391
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:12,140
Did you possibly get them when they were 70% off!?

392
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,420
Those cheap heels.

393
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:18,610
We can not serve our V.I.P.S with those standards!

394
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,080
Do you understand, Shin Da Hye?

395
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,970
He's so cool.

396
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:30,710
He was raised drinking water from abroad. He's not ordinary.

397
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:33,000
I want him.

398
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:41,470
Welcome, and thank you.

399
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:50,990
 What's wrong with this store? We are people who sell visually enticing items.

400
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:56,550
 Do you think this kind of visual is appropriate for our department store?

401
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,480
 I did exactly the same thing to Da Hye...

402
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,800
 So what if I did? After driving nails into my heart.

403
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,270
Aish!

404
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:24,190
Did he just glare at me or are his eyes normally slanted?

405
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:26,140
Both.

406
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:30,420
In this fashion show, where there will be brand names, the focus will be our VIP guests.

407
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:34,340
It will be a place to preview the upcoming season's trend.

408
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:39,530
We can also expect the stakes to be raised with our new brand names.

409
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:51,530
I knew I was right. It was a good idea giving him a higher position.

410
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:55,890
I'm not saying this because I raised him but he is a trustworthy man.

411
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,990
No!

412
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:00,360
I can never believe that!

413
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,730
I mean...

414
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,390
Well I...

415
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:15,650
I'm trying to say that I need to see it with my own eyes.

416
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,220
I'm sorry.

417
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:28,060
Then let's put the new manager in charge.

418
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,240
- That's what he said. 
- However the new fashion show is—

419
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:42,220
That's the insight of one who was born with the talent.

420
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:55,970
These are the brands that will be participating in the fashion show.

421
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:59,720
 What did you do with Da Hye on the day that I died? Did you two meet again?

422
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,820
 Since when? In secret without me knowing?

423
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:04,480
 Did you get divorced because of Da Hye?

424
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,670
 Could you not forget each other?

425
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:11,190
You left your car behind? At Manager Kim's house?

426
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:15,500
 Jeez, when did he see that? What should I say?

427
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,030
Why are you lurking around their family members?

428
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,940
 Should I say that I'm a debt collector again? No, no.

429
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,880
 He'll say that he'll pay it off immediately.

430
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:29,160
Leaving these ridiculous items behind.

431
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,510
This is... I... Yesterday...

432
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,230
 Now you're stealing my presents?

433
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:35,810
What are you thinking?

434
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,880
What are your thoughts, Manager Jeong?

435
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,900
Do you think that Manager Kim committed suicide?

436
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,360
Are my thoughts on that matter important?

437
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,840
Wasn't it you?

438
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,980
The hoobae that he trusted and cherished the most.

439
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:52,700
If you want my thoughts then it's that suicide wasn't the only thing to it.

440
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,690
- You should know as the Branch Manag—
- No.

441
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:57,790
There are many things that I thought, but my thoughts have changed.

442
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:02,090
Yesterday I saw something that I shouldn't have seen.

443
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:03,760
The possibility of him committing suicide.

444
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,340
It is exactly you, Jung Ji Hoon!

445
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:09,060
The wife that he lived with for nine years

446
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,940
was meeting another man.

447
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:16,390
If he knew this fact, he might have killed himself.

448
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:21,770
 What? Why? Why isn't he answering?

449
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:23,560
 Why are you so proud?

450
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,400
 Make an excuse at least.

451
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,320
You must also check your employees now?

452
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:36,520
Keep digging because nothing will come out about my relationship with Da Hye.

453
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,400
A misunderstanding? It's a misunderstanding?

454
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,440
Then why were you hugging the manager's wife?

455
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,990
Is that your way of consoling?! Is this America or Europe?!

456
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:48,960
I have nothing to say and I don't see any reason for you to act like this.

457
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,020
I'm going to find out everything without missing a single detail.

458
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:55,180
Why? First, there is no where in my heart where I want to keep a face like this here.

459
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,740
Why? First, there is no where in my heart where I want to keep a face like this here.

460
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,350
Second, I have the power to prevent someone like you

461
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:01,240
from ever setting foot in Sunjin department store again.

462
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,830
Third, there are many elites in Sunjin Mall,

463
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,480
and I have the mouth

464
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,610
to tell everyone what you did.

465
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:11,310
Do you understand now?

466
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,030
There's something that Sunbae Yeong Soo didn't know.

467
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,220
 Something I don't know?

468
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,840
Something occurred between the two of us.

469
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,290
 We?

470
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:23,660
However, it's not the kind of relationship you're thinking.

471
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:27,700
- What does that—
- I told you everything without leaving anything out.

472
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,060
So please focus on your work.

473
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:45,750
Bring the evidence that shows proof that it wasn't a suicide.

474
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:49,250
Then we can resolve that misunderstanding.

475
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:55,080
Fine, but this isn't to resolve the misunderstanding.

476
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,830
It's for the sake of my senior who passed away.

477
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:00,480
 It's probably to capture Da Hye's heart.

478
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,310
Did you call me, Sir?

479
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:09,220
Manger Ma, let Manager Jeong take over your position right now.

480
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,610
Go back to your other position.

481
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,550
Well, even if you probably didn't do anything before either.

482
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:16,550
Letting him take over as in...

483
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,950
This drama, I earned it myself.

484
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:29,510
And what else? The lead character is me.

485
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:32,460
So, since you didn't do anything at all to help,

486
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,120
don't touch the income on this drama.

487
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,670
Don't touch, okay?

488
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,930
Yeah right. What else?

489
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:40,940
From now on, I'm going to go on as an independent actress.

490
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:44,860
So don't mind me. I don't need your offers.

491
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:49,150
Cha Jae Gook's money? I'm not even going to use a cent of it.

492
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,780
My stomach hurts so much.

493
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,280
What's with her?

494
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:59,200
No!

495
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,920
That water dispenser is Cha Jae Gook's. Don't drink it.

496
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,520
I was just trying to drink the water, not the water dispenser...

497
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,450
Don't drink it!

498
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:11,520
Madame, I understand your pride, but

499
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,910
this is a bit much.

500
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:20,420
From now on, just calculate the money going under my name.

501
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:24,320
After this drama, I'm going to throw a breach of contract fee at you.

502
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:29,860
You precious princess—the person who never had to worry about money.

503
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,960
How are you living like that when you don't have any right now?

504
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,110
Even so, since they keep giving us the previews,

505
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:40,980
I'll give you a little, very little.

506
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,650
I will look forward to it.

507
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:50,720
So cute. They don't even think about serving me coffee.

508
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,090
You're on Cha Jae Gook's land, in Cha Jae Gook's house,

509
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,920
and on Cha Jae Gook's sofa?

510
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,290
Why? Even the air here is here. Then don't breathe.

511
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,380
I really want to do that.

512
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,670
I just want to get rid of all of them.

513
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:20,790
The air that human Cha Jae Gook took in and spat out.

514
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:23,580
If you really want to stay by me, then...

515
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,370
I'll let you be my manager.

516
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:27,970
No. In this day and age,

517
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:30,580
you, who have no experience nor talent,

518
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:34,420
becoming world star Song Yi Yeon's manager

519
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:38,040
is really something God was just like saying, "Yeah, here.

520
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,680
Live it up this once!"

521
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,960
It's at that level. You know that, right?

522
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,560
What about my salary?

523
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,220
I'm Song Yi Yeon.

524
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,960
So, what about my salary?

525
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,790
What? What? What? Do you want me to write a contract?

526
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:56,830
I don't need anything really, but only if you let me stay here.

527
00:44:56,830 --> 00:45:01,220
Alright! That's okay. That much is no problem.

528
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:06,900
From now on, answer my phone calls before three rings.

529
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,680
Drive carefully, since I'm special.

530
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,160
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

531
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:33,300
Make sure that nothing useless touches my body in the future.

532
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:36,070
Understand, Jeong Ji Hoon?

533
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:51,650
What are you doing?

534
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:55,900
Go.

535
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:20,230
 I wasn't sure what to do with it so I kept it.

536
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:25,210
 I didn't want to throw it away, but I thought it would be kind of odd giving it to you now.

537
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:37,010
♫  Even if I close my eyes, even if I close my eyes again  ♫

538
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:39,040
 Oh, I feel like I'm going to die.

539
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,510
♫  Even if  ♫

540
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:47,680
 Oh, Honey. What's with this? Like a child.

541
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,920
 It's because I didn't have time to have a meal.

542
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:56,820
 You have time to drink alcohol but you don't have time to eat a meal?

543
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:00,590
 You have time to eat chocolate bars but you don't have time to eat vegetables?

544
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,580
 All right, I got it, I got it. I'll eat it.

545
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:09,630
 I pack them for you every day, but you never eat them and bring them back.

546
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:14,100
 How can you be rude so prettily too?

547
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:20,960
♫  I really feel like I'm going to cry  ♫

548
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:27,170
♬   If I close my eyes again, I see you  ♬

549
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:29,970
 Ah, please do me this favor.

550
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:33,450
 Am I doing this business for one or two days or something?

551
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:37,160
 Ah, do me this favor.

552
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:40,080
  I don't even have time to eat properly. Just do this favor for me.

553
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,560
 Just do it for me, okay?

554

♫  Don't leave me  ♫

557
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:01,860
I'm sorry. I'll go right away.

558
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:07,360
♫  Really, if I close my eyes  ♫

559
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,150
♫  You  ♫

560
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,610
Out of all the CCTVs on the roof, it seems like only one could see Sunbae Yeong Soo.

561
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:19,620
But when we checked, after the incident, it was already broken.

562
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:22,010
We already tried to fix it.

563
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:23,730
What about the video? Did you check it?

564
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:25,360
I confirmed it myself.

565
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:29,100
Nothing was recorded or saved.

566
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:32,770
 So someone messed with it so it couldn't be saved.

567
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,360
What an idiot.

568
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,040
Oh? What brand is that?

569
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:46,520
Get up. Get up!

570
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,900
Shin Da Hye!

571
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,520
Yes?

572
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:00,170
Why were you sitting for three minutes?

573
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:01,650
Pardon?

574
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:07,440
I'm sorry. My legs were really hurting.

575
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,860
But it was when I was alone.

576
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:11,920
You think you were alone?

577
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,850
Is a manual there just for looks?

578
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:18,750
If you're tired, just resign instead of ruining the atmosphere.

579
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:21,220
I'm sorry. I'll be careful next time.

580
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:23,240
Oh, really.

581
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:50,160

582
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:55,750
What's wrong with you?

583
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:31,030
Starting from today, I'm going to organize all things that are Cha Jae Gook's property.

584
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:34,260
And, you! You're fired.

585
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:38,540
Hold on! You don't have to fire Seung Jae.

586
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:41,950
He is certainly Cha Jae Gook's property.

587
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:42,830
 Cha Jae Gook's object

588
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:50,570
I belong only to myself.

589
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:54,020
Why are you being like that?

590
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:00,780
I am a person who receives a salary from President Na. Until he fires me, I'm still the manager of Song Yi Yeon.

591
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:05,550
If you have complaints, settle them directly with President Na.

592
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:14,700
Stop eating.

593
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:18,650
Starting today you have to go through rigorous training with me until the production release date.

594
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:19,530
Me too?

595
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:21,540
Yes, you too.

What are you talking about? You're crazy.

They can't do it.

623
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,360
I am Jeong Ji Hoon from the Strategic Planning Department.

624
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:16,550
Is this department the place where you strategically plan to seduce other women?

625
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:25,830
There is no fat on my belly to lose.

626
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,220
I am starving to death.

627
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:39,350
I didn't starve this much when I had to work.

628
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:53,850
Just as I thought... I see. You. It's you, right?

629
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,450
You did't think I knew about that?

630

How did you...?

00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:15,360
You thought you could deceive me until now?

632
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,560
Is that so?

633
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:49,840
Oh man. I can't get into the emotion because you're a woman. Jeez.

634
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:03,930
That b**ch just makes people scared.

635
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:06,690
Aish, I'm hungry.

636
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:10,470
She's on a diet, but why doesn't she let other people eat?

637
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:14,140
She has a weird personality.

638
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:17,280
Ah, women! It takes time to find out what kind of people they are.

639
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:22,600
Aish. Relax your eyes! Is this a workplace?

640
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:31,010
Bossing people around is really tiring.

641
00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:33,290
It's luck, whether you're dead or alive.

642
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:35,590
Live it separately.

643
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:39,680
I thought you were naive but bossing people around is your nature.

644
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:45,850
This is the result of fifteen years of experience.

645
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:49,330
People say the daughter-in-law that took lots of CFs become the mean mother-in-law.

646
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:53,530
Just do it enough. Do you know how hard it is to live like that?!

647

♬  Even though I close my eyes   ♬

648
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:14,640
♫  The short memories we have won't go away  ♫

649
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:21,550
♬  I call your name indifferently  ♬

650
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:27,710

651
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:33,740
♬  Don't leave. Don't leave me.  ♬

652
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:40,760
♬  I feel like crying everyday I am without you.  ♬

653
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:49,410
♬  It is so painful. You might cry.   ♬

654
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:55,730
♬  When I close my eyes again, you...   ♬

655
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:02,600
 - You're going to be late?
- Sorry, I'll be late.

656
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,400
 - What about dinner?
- You eat first.

657
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:11,510
 My Happines Han Na

658
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,180
 Customer, the package you sent to Jeong Flower Lady (6400-425-87196) on 16.01.26 has been processed and on it's way.

659
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:24,130
When someone died, privacy becomes so important?

660
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:28,950
Why are you coming here with a complicated situation in the morning?

661
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:33,640
Just know that this can be used as evidence when doing an investigation.

662
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:39,490
I will come back with a lawyer and the police, so be ready with the information on the CCTV

663
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:46,830
Earlier, the thing you said about the evidence and stuff. Is it real?

664
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,660
I don't know either.

665
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:55,620
Restore this as soon as possible.

666
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:58,510
 Customer, the package you sent to Jeong Flower Lady (6400-425-87196) on 16.01.26 has been processed and on it's way.

667
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,520
Are you looking at your phone while at work?

668
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,750
Are you just dumb or ignoring me?

669
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,440
January 26th?

670
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:13,290
You! Are you ignoring me just because I'm younger than you?

671
00:58:15,770 --> 00:58:18,380
What is it now, Ajumma?

672
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:20,670
How did you get a job in retail without knowing the fundamentals?

673
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:21,520
I'm sorry.

674
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,100
Is that the attitude of a sorry person? Ajumma?

675
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,450
Please stop! I can take care of this.

676
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:28,500
How long has it been since you were told not to interfere?

677
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:33,330
What did you do with the phone? Ajumma. Are you dating someone?

678
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:35,020
If you lose your senses like this, everything gets ruined!

679
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:40,100
The customers start leaving, then the rates start lowering and before you know it, the store closes its doors!

680
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:44,120
Ah, be quiet! Just stay where you are!

681
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:50,200
I am sorry. I have something urgent to take care of. Excuse me!

682
00:58:55,590 --> 00:58:58,240
She is not the same woman I used to know.

683
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,010
 Recipient: Jeong Flower Lady 
Sender: Kim Young Soo

684
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,780
I thought I was going to die of hunger.

685
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:15,050
Aigoo, it looks good.

686
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:17,980
By the way, if we get caught, are we going to get in trouble?

687
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:19,880
There is no place in the employee lounge.

688
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,750
Aish! I can't go there because I'm scared.

689
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:26,610
Yesterday someone saw a ghost there again, during the night shift.

690
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:30,950
Really? Was the ghost of Department Head Kim, the one who committed suicide?

691
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:35,550
Maybe he is appearing now because his wife is working here?

692
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:39,430
It freaks me out. It makes me lose my appetite.

693
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:43,790
Who is there starting a false rumor?

694
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:47,620
I told you not to run away.

695
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:50,900
I'll be going.

696
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:54,080
Are you dumb? That doesn't make you mad?

697
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,370
You don't know how to get angry?

698
00:59:57,090 --> 01:00:02,760
I can get angry. I can get angry too. Then I'll get angry towards you.

699
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,440
Why are you like this to me?

700
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,080
What happened? You said that you would come after my husband died.

701
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,960
Why are you like this suddenly? What did I do wrong?

702
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:13,920
You think you didn't do anything wrong?

703
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:22,870
What the heck did you do?

704
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,150
You believe your husband committed suicide. You aren't suspecting anything.

705
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:32,420
You didn't think about how it contradicts his personality. It means that you don't know your husband very well.

706
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:35,400
So, I...

707
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:39,150
I don't like you, Ajumma.

708
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:57,570

709
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:00,990
 What kind of relationship do you two have?

710
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,250
 - We're just aquain—
- We're friends

711
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:05,310
 I have this nice body. How nice and easy. WOW!

712
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:07,690
 We are going to be in a fashion show.

713
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:10,310
 What are you trying to plan with Lee Hae Joon?

714
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,670
 Stay still!

715
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:14,780
 No! No!

716
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:17,080
 I said no!

717
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,110
 What are you doing?
