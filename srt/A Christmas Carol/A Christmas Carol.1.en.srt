00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,030
12.25 Monday 10:00 a.m.

2
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,280
12.25 Monday 10:00 a.m.
It's true.

3
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,930
12.25 Monday 10:00 a.m.
The water tank of the apartment.

4
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,890
12.25 Monday 10:00 a.m.
There is a dead person in the water tank of the apartment.

5
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,220
12.25 Monday 10:00 a.m.

6
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,250
We don't know whether it’s suicide
or something else until police comes to investigate.

7
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,530
Shit.

8
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,600
Shit.

9
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:51,710
follow message highlight

10
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,270
Turn around.

11
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,950
My name is Jo Soon-woo.

12
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,040
I am in charge of consultation.

13
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,200
I will be your head teacher for two years.

14
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,520
Well.

15
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,060
Joo ll-woo.

16
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,520
28 years old.

17
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,220
You dropped out of Sung Guk High School.

18
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:08,220
You live in Sung Guk Dong Apartment with grandma and sister, right?

19
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,150
How's your grandma doing?

20
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,040
Since you are here, your grandma must be alone.

21
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,300
She's dead.

22
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,420
I see.

23
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,190
Sorry about that.

24
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,110
If you have nothing to say, let's finish soon.

25
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,560
Personal Information

26
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,740
I have something to say.

27
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,200
It's about your brother, Joo Wo-loo.

28
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,130
You think your brother didn't die by accident.

29
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,000
I know you feel wronged.

30
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,770
Your grandma also

31
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,630
agreed to finish it as an accident case.

32
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,880
How do you know?

33
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,250
You come to Wo-loo's funeral, right?

34
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,100
You are the person who cried that day.

35
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,060
I took part in a volunteering activity.

36
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,870
So I go to your apartment every week.

37
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:19,210
I met Wo-loo and Wo-loo's grandma.

38
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,270
I taught Wo-loo in the welfare center.

39
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,490
Then you meddle in my affair?

40
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,490
Because you send some instant noodles to my poor family?

41
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,430
Whatever,

42
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,860
I do want to help your family.

43
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,810
Help us?

44
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,430
By sending some photos of some poor guys online?

45
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,810
Well

46
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,300
you can say anything about me.

47
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,580
Don't do it.

48
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,830
What?

49
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,270
You come here to

50
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,480
avenge Moon Ja-hoon, Baek Young-jun, Chae Nu-li and Son-heon.

51
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,350
Am I right?

52
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,820
There's a rumor about you come to avenge because of your brother.

53
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,470
You may feel wronged or the result of investigation is wrong.

54
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,510
Korean police and procurater are not like what you think.

55
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,320
Moon Ja-hoon's parents and procurater are friends.

56
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,890
But he can't make the case ended as he wants to.

57
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,840
How did those son of a bitch run away from this?

58
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,630
Those son of a bitch.

59
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,860
Don't overreact.

60
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,100
Mind your own business.

61
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,980
Today, we have a new member.

62
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,870
You will be together for two years.

63
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,420
Be nice.

64
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:42,770
Joo ll-woo.

65
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,340
Joo ll-woo.

66
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,650
Have a seat.

67
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,790
Shit, they look like the same.

68
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,240
Moon Ja-hoon, stop talking.

69
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,860
OK, let's begin for class.

70
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,180
Stop him.

71
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,590
Son of a bitch.

72
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,750
I will kill you.

73
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,820
Shit.

74
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,860
Let go of me.

75
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,310
Shit.

76
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,430
Let go of me.

77
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,280
Let go of me, shit.

78
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,730
Shit.

79
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:40,670
Come on, son of a bitch.

80
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,840
I will kill you.

81
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,720
Fuck you, Moon Ja-hoon.

82
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,460
Fuck, Baek Young-jun.

83
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,600
Fuck, Moon Ja-hoon.

84
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,520
Shit.

85
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,470
You are dead.

86
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,630
Shit.

87
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,390
You are dead, shit.

88
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,480
Shit.

89
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,250
It's great.

90
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,280
It works.

91
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,040
It's really...

92
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,320
Hey, it's the psycho.

93
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,940
You are not students but criminals.

94
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,960
You come here because you did something wrong.

95
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,620
Sorry, let's do it according to the law.

96
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,840
Teacher makes order according to rules.

97
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,540
Students should follow teacher's order.

98
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,440
So there are two kinds of students.

99
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:04,040
Students who follow the order and students who break the rules.

100
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,640
If you know that you made a mistake,

101
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:11,340
bark like a dog and I won't punish you.

102
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,650
Why don't you do it?

103
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,530
I didn't do anything wrong.

104
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,620
They started the thing first.

105
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,100
Stand up.

106
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,250
Why do you beat me?

107
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,210
I will call the police, shit.

108
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,270
You can try.

109
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,040
Do you think this is your home?

110
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,210
Shit.

111
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:49,640
Senior Class 1
Shit.

112
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,090
Senior Class 1

113
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:55,730
Let go of me.

114
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,890
Let go of me.

115
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,090
Let go of me.

116
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,920
Violence is wrong.

117
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,540
Because violence will cause another violence.

118
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,600
Violence will give victims serious wound

119
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,590
so victims will also use violence.

120
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,470
School violence starts from anger.

121
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,710
Sometimes,

122
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,830
criminals choose people who have nothing to do with as the target to release anger.

123
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,710
Punishment is so great.

124
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,430
Joo ll-woo is caught by the psycho.

125
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,350
How dare he come here?

126
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,000
What a fool.

127
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,600
Say it.

128
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,690
Son of a bitch.

129
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,750
You didn't do anything wrong?

130
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,130
Han Chan-woo.

131
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,490
Please stop.

132
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,570
It's his first day.

133
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,040
That's it, please stop.

134
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,240
If only he can follow my order.

135
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,840
He should know about rules sooner or later.

136
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,390
You are useless.

137
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,110
You should be in a seperate room.

138
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,240
You are the same.

139
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,090
Because it hurts.

140
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,740
It hurts.

141
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,500
His name is Joo Wo-loo.

142
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,570
He has mental disorder.

143
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,500
His brain is same as a third or fourth grade pupil's brain.

144
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,460
He acts unusually because he is abnormal.

145
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,440
You think he may die by accident?

146
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,290
Yes.

147
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,030
What?

148
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,130
Shit.

149
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,630
Don't you see his face?

150
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,390
Am I the only one who see this?

151
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,410
It's obvious that he was beaten by someone.

152
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,660
You can't blame others.

153
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,960
You should take care of your family.

154
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,950
Shit, who do you think you are?

155
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,460
Let go of me.

156
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,850
How many times have you come to my home?

157
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,180
When you are not home, your grandma and Wo-loo have nothing to eat.

158
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,130
Calm down.

159
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,480
Let's talk outside.

160
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,220
Wo-loo.

161
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,240
My Wo-loo is painful.

162
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,020
He is painful.

163
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,570
You are foolish.

164
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,240
Why are you smiling?

165
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,130
What are you doing?

166
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,430
Is there any painkiller?

167
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,640
Hey, have you prepared?

168
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,590
Hurry, shit.

169
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,060
Hey.

170
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,720
The way Joo ll-woo looks at us,

171
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,390
isn’t it drives you crazy?

172
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,930
He looks the same as the dead.

173
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:28,660
What a surprise.

174
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,280
Son-heon.

175
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,260
Watch carefully.

176
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,590
OK, I will.

177
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:42,720
The foolish used to be afraid to look into my eyes.

178
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:47,380
He slavered and trembled.

179
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,820
He said" I am sorry".

180
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,670
How funny, shit.

181
00:13:53,270 --> 00:14:00,660
It is said that Joo ll-woo used to be born in a great family.

182
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,020
He used to live in a rich apartment.

183
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,390
Is he famous?

184
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:10,360
e should have killed the psycho.

185
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:14,760
Son, are you watching?

186
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,340
Shit, why don't you answer me?

187
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,320
Shit.

188
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,460
Why are you doing this to me?

189
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,600
You beated my brother to death.

190
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,050
You didn't do it?

191
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,510
I met him that day.

192
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,810
But I didn’t kill him.

193
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,870
I really didn't do it.

194
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,980
Joo ll-woo.

195
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,230
Come outside.

196
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,590
Joo ll-woo.

197
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,650
Joo ll-woo.

198
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,720
Don't lie to me.

199
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,450
-Joo ll-woo. -I didn't do it.

200
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,420
-Open the door. -I didn't do it.

201
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,470
I'll kill you.

202
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,010
Don't lie to me.

203
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,640
If you didn’t do it, then who did it?

204
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,370
Joo ll-woo.

205
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,690
I didn't do it.

206
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,890
I really didn't do it.

207
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,990
He’s smiling, fool.

208
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,560
Are we funny?

209
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:29,000
Fool, live your life with your brain.

210
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,450
Should we just kill him?

211
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,650
Sure, he's a fool.

212
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,500
Come on.

213
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,870
Do you want to die?

214
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,410
Stop.

215
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,730
Calm down.

216
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,390
Don't do it.

217
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,470
Stop.

218
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,640
If you become a murderer,

219
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,630
what about Wo-loo

220
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,190
and your grandma?

221
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,190
They're dead.

222
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,770
Isn't that Joo ll-woo?

223
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,700
He’s crazy.

224
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,750
I will kill you.

225
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,810
Son of a btich.

226
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:21,530
Let go of me.

227
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,730
Son of a btich.

228
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,460
I will kill you.

229
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,500
Son of a btich.

230
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,240
Wait.

231
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:47,300
Il-woo, stay in the punishment room for one more day.

232
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,210
Listen to me.

233
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,970
You are acting unusually.

234
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,490
What does usual mean?

235
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,330
What?

236
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,910
Stand up.

237
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:05,750
You kill Joo Wo-loo, right?

238
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,600
Joo Wo-loo.

239
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,270
Why do you mention about him?

240
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,250
Shit, he's dead.

241
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,700
Fuck.

242
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,840
On Christmas,

243
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,390
Moon Ja-hoon, you and Chae Nu-li

244
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,370
went to that place.

245
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:36,460
You took him away while he was doing part-time job.

246
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:42,120
You took him away to beat him.

247
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,940
And you killed him.

248
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:51,010
You dumped his body into the water tank.

249
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:54,040
No.

250
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,460
We wanted to steal something at the conveniece store.

251
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:06,050
We were afraid that he would call the police or the owner.

252
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,450
So you killed him?

253
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,720
No.

254
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,900
I didn't do it.

255
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:19,400
Well, I don't think you have the guts.

256
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,510
I didn't kill him.

257
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,190
I didn't kill him.

258
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,710
But you killed Joo Wo-loo.

259
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:33,840
You treated him badly who always smiled like a fool.

260
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,210
You took off his pants,

261
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,810
took his money,

262
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,390
cut his hairs,

263
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,160
locked him in a toilet,

264
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,840
peed on him

265
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,010
and spat on his face.

266
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,830
Wo-loo

267
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,500
was killed that day.

268
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,500
No.

269
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:05,520
I didn't kill him.

270
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,750
An San Training Center

271
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,160
An San Training Center oung-jun who is seriously injured was taken to the hospital.

272
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,730
Young-jun who is seriously injured was taken to the hospital.

273
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:56,930
Students claimed that his tooth were accidentally broken during educational activities.

274
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,680
He is accidentally beaten...

275
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,270
Young-jun also said so.

276
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,750
Teacher Han never be blamed.

277
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,520
He always punish the students immediately.

278
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:13,500
After getting punished, students won't break the rule for some time.

279
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,320
I don't understand why Joo ll-woo should be sent away.

280
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,320
As his teacher, I will talk to him.

281
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:29,910
At this place, what Han Ei-sang says is the truth.

282
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,780
While you are in the punishment room,

283
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,500
he suggested that you should be sent away.

284
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:42,710
While you stay at another training center for two years,

285
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,330
they will get out of this place after six months.

286
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,550
It's possible that you will never meet them.

287
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,350
I am sorry.

288
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,100
I shouldn't have sent you to the punishment room again.

289
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:06,450
I didn't know Mr.Han will do that.

290
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,390
There's no shop.

291
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,390
I want to ask you a question.

292
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,200
Do you really think that

293
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:30,400
Moon Ja-hoon, Baek Young-jun, Chae Nu-li

294
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,680
try to escape from the punishment

295
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,300
of killing your borther

296
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:41,150
so they make small accident to get into training center?

297
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,920
On Christmas Eve,

298
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,100
they came to the convenience store where Wo-loo worked.

299
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,050
It was captured by the CCTV camera.

300
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,670
I saw it.

301
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,890
On that day,

302
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,090
I heard them beating Wo-loo

303
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,870
through the phone.

304
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,790
I know their voice so I come here.

305
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:13,020
Shit, how can it not be true?

306
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,760
The McDonald's where they made trouble is near the police station.

307
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:22,310
They knew police would come in 5 minutes so they did it on purpose.

308
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,100
One day,

309
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,010
the police said they would reopen investigation into Wo-loo's case.

310
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,750
They said they find the guys who were captured by the CCTV camera.

311
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,630
However,

312
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:36,760
they suddenly said those guys went to training center so they stopped investigating.

313
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,230
They came here on purpose.

314
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,780
So you did the same thing?

315
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,780
You smashed the coffee shop in front of police station and beat innoncent people

316
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,700
in order to come here?

317
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,010
Don't do it.

318
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,320
Or you will become like them.

319
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,350
So what?

320
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,840
They will be fine after staying at training center for 6 months.

321
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,690
They won't pay for anything.

322
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:03,110
Am I right?

323
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,520
Il-woo.

324
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,860
Son of a bitch.

325
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:08,690
I will treat him the same as they used to treat Wo-loo.

326
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,390
If that makes me become trash,

327
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,980
then I would become trash, shit.

328
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:31,120
introspection

329
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,970
After finishing this, you can get out of punishment room.

330
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,050
I want to give you a chance.

331
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,820
If you make trouble again, you will be sent to another place.

332
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,540
You can't come here anymore.

333
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:04,330
So there is only one chance.

334
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:16,570
introspection

335
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,680
Son-heon, raise your hand.

336
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,350
Go sit next to him.

337
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:14,810
Are you all right?

338
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,690
Don't ask, just have it.

339
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,350
This will relieve the pain.

340
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:47,830
Hurry.

341
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,330
You can't get addicted to it with this amount of pills.

342
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,980
Are you kidding me?

343
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:47,430
Hey.

344
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,630
Why are you doing this while he's eating?

345
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,320
Heon.

346
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:04,560
Yes?

347
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,400
No matter what other people say, you are with us.

348
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:12,100
Right?

349
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:14,170
Yes.

350
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,740
Just eat.

351
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:17,920
Let's have lunch.

352
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,130
ould you like to have a drink?

353
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:03,330
Until last December, I have been wearing this clothes to visit your apartment.

354
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,840
I can't wear it anymore.

355
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:08,700
Why?

356
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:10,480
Well.

357
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,820
I used to volunteer a lot.

358
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,790
I wonder why I do it.

359
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,700
At last, I can't even help Wo-loo.

360
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,210
He must have been waiting for you.

361
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,590
What?

362
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,230
He thought you would come on Christmas.

363
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:33,810
Yes.

364
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,480
He’s a kind boy.

365
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,800
He always smiles.

366
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,860
I should have paid more attention to him.

367
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:51,220
How did this happen?

368
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,380
Il-woo.

369
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:06,870
I thought maybe Wo-loo beat by Ja-hoon and those guys and he was accidentally killed.

370
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,780
Then why did you stop me?

371
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,820
People make mistakes.

372
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,050
You and I also make mistakes.

373
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:22,190
But that dosen't mean we are born to be evil.

374
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,270
It's because people feel things hard to deal with

375
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,040
or they have no choice.

376
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,030
They have reasons for their mistakes.

377
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,450
So they need people to help them.

378
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:48,350
So it's necessary to forgive others.

379
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,010
Why do victims have to forgive?

380
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:04,020
Seeing you like this, I think maybe you are right.

381
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:11,870
Thinking about how they treated Wo-loo, I can't forgive them.

382
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,660
Yes.

383
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,010
They don't think they are wrong.

384
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,460
They almost killed you when you were in punishment room.

385
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,130
What do you mean?

386
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,880
I want you to do something so I change the consulting schedule.

387
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,900
Go to the laundry room and you can see the laundry.

388
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,900
Bring it to the dormitory.

389
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,810
Do you want to hear me sing Christmas carol?

390
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:29,430
Look outside the window.

391
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:32,900
It’s snowing.

392
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,940
Here comes the cigarrette.

393
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:58,040
Shit.

394
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,610
Is the amount right?

395
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,690
Did you hide some in the toilet?

396
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:05,230
I have given you some last time, son of a bitch.

397
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,010
This is all I got.

398
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:10,680
Shit.

399
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,430
Hey.

400
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:14,750
Stop.

401
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,330
You are lucky.

402
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:22,520
Do your job well.

403
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,610
Are you all right?

404
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:44,870
Yes.

405
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,120
I am fine.

406
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,760
Really?

407
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,340
You seem tired.

408
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,090
No, I am fine.

409
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,390
Then why do you stare at me?

410
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,760
No, I don't.

411
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,450
Yes, you do.

412
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,470
This means you are tired because of me.

413
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,560
No.

414
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,570
Shit, it makes me angry.

415
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,800
You say it with your eyes, right?

416
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,020
Yes or no? Shit.

417
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:30,170
Your eyes look like Joo ll-woo's eyes.

418
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:32,940
People like you who live in cheap apartment are all the same.

419
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,740
You make me want to gouge your eyes.

420
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:43,640
When I give you some money, you run to me happily.

421
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,650
But you still have your pride.

422
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:47,480
Shit.

423
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:50,080
You like to pretend that you are somebody.

424
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,510
Shit.

425
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,200
Take it off.

426
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:03,300
Take off your pants.

427
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:08,430
Don't you get cigarette by pleasing the crazy dog?

428
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,420
Why do you act like you are somebody?

429
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,180
You don't take off your pants?

430
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,950
You don't listen to me?

431
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:19,900
I will do it.

432
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,940
Take off your underwear, shit.

433
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,110
Can't you understand what I say?

434
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:50,480
I hate people who live in cheap apartment.

435
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:53,510
They can't live their life well.

436
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:56,510
Just because a fool died, he acts like it's a big deal.

437
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,530
Who is that?

438
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:03,300
What's the big deal about a fool?

439
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,400
Don't you take it off?

440
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:22,240
I give you three minutes.

441
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,510
If you don't pee, you should know that this is a hell for you until you get out.

442
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,090
Son of a bitch.

443
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,170
Hey.

444
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:42,610
You're here.

445
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,490
Are you so desperate for smoking to do that kind of things?

446
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:04,470
I saw you leave the boiler room.

447
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,520
Drugs are also given by the crazy dog?

448
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,130
Shit.

449
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,610
Are you willing to do it for those guys?

450
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:20,320
Why do you follow them to here?

451
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,330
What a fool.

452
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,210
You should stop doing this.

453
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,590
—What about you?

454
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:37,110
Why do you come here?

455
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:39,910
What else do you want?

456
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,630
You weren't interested in people like me and Wo-loo , were you?

457
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,700
What the fuck?

458
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,930
Is that wrong?

459
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,120
You don't like him because he's a psychopath

460
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,920
even if you're twins,and I was in a rental apartment with you, so you don't like me either.

461
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:57,490
Isn't it?

462
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,460
Shut up if you don't know the details.

463
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,310
How could I not know?

464
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:09,770
That day, the day when he died.

465
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:13,440
You had an appointment with him, why didn't you keep it?

466
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:15,840
At the Lotteria on Christmas Eve.

467
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,290
Don't you even remember it?

468
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,460
Fuck, how did you know about that?

469
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,510
How did I know that?

470
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:24,080
Because I was with him at that time.

471
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:30,780
Wo-loo also knew that you hate him in particular.

472
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:39,580
But, but, but why are you doing this now?

473
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,250
What are you babbling about?

474
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:43,830
You thought because Wo-loo is a psychopath that he doesn't know anything, do you?

475
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:49,440
Even if he is a psychopath, he knows who despises himself.

476
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:55,140
That's why the Wo-loo disobeyed when you told him to wait for you and went to that fucking shop.

477
00:42:55,140 --> 00:43:02,260
But if you listened to Wo-loo when I was at the Lotteria.

478
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,940
Fuck, what about you, where have you been?

479
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,120
Shit, where were you that day?

480
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,240
Why did you let him go to the store to suffer death when you knew all about it?

481
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,930
Are you happy now as the lapdog of that group?

482
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:22,290
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

483
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,080
Son of a bitch.

484
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:52,570
Even if you're backed up, I can easily turn you into a lunatic.

485
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:57,020
Do you think I came here to wipe your ass, bitch?

486
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:08,850
I know that you are the king of this place.

487
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:16,810
But for people like us who are scraping by at the bottom, evidence is life.

488
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:19,980
I have to catch the jokers first.

489
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,280
I need to get close to the gangsters first.

490
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:26,920
But I made the teacher's documentary.

491
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:29,520
Son of a bitch.

492
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:31,790
How dare you threaten the teacher?

493
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:32,640
Fuck.

494
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:39,570
What are you pretending?

495
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,000
I told you there was a documentary about you.

496
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:43,940
What?

497
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,690
Son of a bitch!

498
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,210
Fine.

499
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,590
Shit, I shot a disgusting thing.

500
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:57,170
I didn't know they had only recently graduated from secondary school

501
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:04,330
because children are developing these days so quickly.

502
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,210
What should I do?

503
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:07,280
What should I do?

504
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:09,980
Do you want me to upload a video on the platform?

505
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,630
I told you I was here to make money.

506
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,180
Don't take it too seriously.

507
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,100
Teacher.

508
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,590
Let me introduce the new friend.

509
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:37,360
His name is Go Bang-cheon, a transfer from Chung Joo Juvenile Hall.

510
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:44,170
He's going to spend a year with you guys afterwards. There's no one in the back row, so go there.

511
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:25,670
Bitch, bitch, bitch, go to hell.

512
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:44,210
Room leader, takes him to the health room.

513
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:44,840
I see.

514
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,690
Roll call ends.

515
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,580
Hey, it's been a long time.

516
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:56,750
Hello.

517
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:04,130
How nice it used to be when Go Bang-cheon was in the Chung Joo Juvenile Hall.

518
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:08,680
My father and I had him transferred here, and it cost a lot of money.

519
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:15,900
But I heard that Bang-chean went to Jo Tae-woo's organization and became completely crazy.

520
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:20,180
Because only a crazy person can undertake the task of killing.

521
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:21,640
What?

522
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:26,370
Kill, killing? Really?

523
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:30,160
Did he really kill people?

524
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:31,810
Certainly.

525
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:36,240
Joo ll-woo would've killed it.

526
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:41,380
But Mad Dog couldn't kill him.

527
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:50,920
You'll see it tomorrow.

528
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:59,010
If you give enough money, people who are born to pander will contract everything.

529
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:07,710
Fuck, he just came yesterday, despite the Mad Dog standing next to him and kicked a person.

530
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,180
Did the Mad Dog let him go?

531
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,450
Shit, he didn't say anything.

532
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:12,400
What? He's so cool.

533
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:12,840
Cool, huh?

534
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:13,870
Yeah.

535
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:16,240
Fuck, he's so cool.

536
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,280
Hey, Bang-cheon.

537
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:33,810
Hi, Ja-hun.

538
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:37,360
It's been a while.

539
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,340
I heard you did very well at the presentation yesterday.

540
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,810
It's not a big deal.

541
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,000
But, Ja-hun.

542
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:05,620
Why do I hear you've done something big? Did you do it?

543
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:09,790
How could our good J-hun do something so wicked?

544
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:12,600
What? Do you think I can't do it?

545
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:16,140
I did it.

546
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:23,270
I stepped on him, not realising how weak he was, and he died straight away.

547
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:26,380
Thanks to him, I've had a disciplined six months.

548
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,360
Why did you ask me to come then?

549
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:30,360
Because I don't want to come with my own hands.

550
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:35,630
Our Ja-hun has grown up.

551
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:47,200
Bang-cheon came here to kill you.

552
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:51,850
Why are you acting like this now?

553
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,100
Didn't you stop caring?

554
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:04,640
Didn't you say I was making a fool out of Joo Wo-loo?

555
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:06,110
What about you?

556
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,220
Why did you let him go that day?

557
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,600
I didn't know it would turn out that way.

558
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:17,910
On that day, I went to the Lotteria with Wo-loo.

559
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:24,240
The day Wo-loo says he'll wait for you is the day they say they' do the shopkeeper a favour.

560
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,080
Doesn’t he answer the phone?

561
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,040
Give me your phone.

562
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:28,850
Called three times, did you?

563
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:31,040
What should I do? I've got something at five o'clock today.

564
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,510
I've waited a long time.

565
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:36,860
No, no, don't send it, don't send it.

566
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:38,330
What's wrong again?

567
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:41,810
Il-woo is busy, very busy.

568
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:45,700
If I said I was waiting for him, he'd be furious.

569
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:48,100
I'm speechless, here you go.

570
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,600
I had to be at the convenience store at 6 o'clock to sort out

571
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,000
the things that had arrived at the convenience store.

572
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,870
So you need to stay here today because of that?

573
00:50:55,870 --> 00:50:59,370
I have to be there at six o'clock, can't be .

574
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:02,560
Can you listen to me and not go there?

575
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,760
I won't get paid if I'm absent.

576
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:09,240
That's what the shopkeeper said.

577
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:16,460
Hey, I have to go now.

578
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:18,780
Don't go to the convenience store today and wait here for ll-woo.

579
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,580
What did you say? A good day? Happy day?

580
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:22,530
Christmas Eve.

581
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:25,630
Yeah, yeah, wait here because it's a good day, got it? I'm off now.

582
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:30,450
I have to go, and you're not answering your phone.

583
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:34,580
Fuck, I'm too busy in the Cheol Goo-chon to pick up the phone.

584
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:39,850
You knew those bastards were going to make a scene at the convenience store

585
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:42,370
and you still let Wo-loo go there.

586
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:48,170
I didn't think they'd really kill him either, really.

587
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,870
But he said today.

588
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:55,800
He killed Wo-loo.

589
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:06,820
Shit, shit.

590
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,210
You're really lame.

591
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:18,580
I heard from Go Bang-cheon that he's close to you.

592
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:22,100
He came here to kill me.

593
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:28,400
Let's not go any further.

594
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,370
I will apply for you to be transferred.

595
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:38,600
If you go to another Juvenile Hall, there's nothing Go Bang-cheon can do for you.

596
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,440
Stay out of other people's business.

597
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:49,190
Il-woo, I can't let anything else happen to you.

598
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:52,270
Hmm? Wo-loo would have wanted it that way.

599
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,020
Please mind your own business.

600
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,610
What do you want me to do?

601
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:01,190
Those who live must continue to live

602
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:03,910
and what good does it do if you don't get your revenge before you die?

603
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:05,260
Fuck.

604
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,750
I don't know.

605
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:23,650
Although I didn't know it, a week after Wo-loo's death my grandmother also died

606
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:31,650
because there was no one to look after her and I was dead by then.

607
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:38,890
It won't take long.

608
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:42,020
Bang-cheon isn't the type to dawdle either.

609
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:16,580
Those m the fhst and second rows, stand up.

610
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:18,730
Removing tne tables

611
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:50,990
Go in yourself.

612
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,840
Rental Apartments.

613
00:55:58,350 --> 00:55:59,200
Come out.

614
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:07,110
Fuck, son of the bitch. Get out now!

615
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,220
Ja-hun, get out.

616
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:48,730
Beat him up. You'll get beaten up if you don't.

617
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:57,910
Don't come any closer, you'll be gone if you do.

618
00:56:57,910 --> 00:56:59,780
Shit, what's your arrogance?

619
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:12,240
Dog-eyed bitches.

620
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,320
Can you still be considered delinquent students?

621
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:18,640
Because of some fools, delinquent students have forgotten the rules.

622
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:22,500
Because you can't tame a son of the bitch, so he called me.

623
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,070
Beat him!

624
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:25,560
If you don't, I'll beat you to death.

625
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:40,550
Do you want to be beaten? If you don't want to die, hit him as hard as I did.

626
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:52,600
Hey, Beak Young-jun.

627
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,050
Me?

628
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:57,470
Fuck, don't make me say it again, do you want to die?

629
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:11,940
Cheer up, cheer up.

630
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:13,690
Beak Young-jun, cheer up.

631
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:19,260
Hitting it hard.

632
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:21,860
Prove yourself a loser when they're all watching.

633
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:23,940
Especially for that active son of a bitch.

634
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:30,730
We will return the beatings we received a hundredfold.

635
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:36,540
Shit.

636
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:38,710
Hey, bitch.

637
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:45,610
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

638
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:47,060
Give me the bat. Give me the bat.

639
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:49,160
Son of a bitch.

640
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:58,590
Hurt? Hurt? Hurt? Hurt? Hurt? Hurt?

641
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:01,650
Shit, son of a bitch, shit.

642
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,640
Moon Ja-hun.

643
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:18,580
What?

644
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:22,010
Are you scared? Shit.

645
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:29,310
How could I possibly let you play the delinquent student game?

646
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:33,530
You beat up your own person, how romantic it is.

647
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:38,980
Il-woo, are you feeling better?

648
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:43,300
This is all for today.

649
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:51,040
Let's go out and have a smoke.

650
01:00:57,970 --> 01:01:00,590
Hey, you guys sort it out.

651
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:52,440
Ju ll-woo, wait, wait a minute.

652
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:57,220
I... I can't move my arms.

653
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:16,760
That day, I went with Nu-li to find Jeong Joo, for I was there on the orders of the Ja-hun.

654
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:23,500
Ja-hon was alone next to your brother.

655
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:28,980
I ended up meeting with them without finding Jeong-joo.

656
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:33,730
I asked him how the part-time job was going.

657
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:39,640
He didn’t say anything and just drank.

658
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:50,710
I'm sorry, Jo ll-woo.

659
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,140
Listen, Pyo Hyeong-jun.

660
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:05,090
Are you sorry to Jo Wo-loo?

661
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,050
Fuck.

662
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:18,400
What is Jo Wo-loo's existence to you?

663
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:44,670
Hello?

664
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:46,010
Why did you call?

665
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:52,340
I can't answer the phone when guests come in. the phone.

666
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,190
So I don't get sacked.

667
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,740
Hey, don't you hurry up and come out?

668
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:57,090
Is the shopkeeper not here?

669
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:58,760
The shop manager hasn't come yet.

670
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:01,510
Where are you? Bitch.

671
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:03,690
Who the hell are you to report me?

672
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:06,580
Told to open your mouth, bitch.

673
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,300
Report, you want to report me?

674
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:12,470
What the fuck, did the bitch shopkeeper teach you that?

675
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:15,670
Are you kidding me, bitch?

676
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:19,120
Should we kill him?

677
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,050
I'm sorry.

678
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:23,270
Even if he was killed, the shopkeeper wouldn't dare say anything.

679
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:24,950
I'm sorry.

680
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:26,000
Pull him out.

681
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,380
Fuck, get out of there, bitch!

682
01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:32,490
Jo Wo-loo, where are you, Jo Wo-loo!

683
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:57,090
Come in, the door's open.

684
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:07,350
Today's consultation is with Son-heon.

685
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:10,230
Son-heon can't make it.

686
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:12,470
’Why?

687
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:14,850
Wouldn't the teacher know better?

688
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:20,410
Please help me.

689
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:25,490
You let me run errands in the spare room earlier to help me out, didn't you?

690
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:28,500
To catch Mon Ja-hun, we need to take down Mad Dog first.

691
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:31,220
It's in a different state now.

692
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:34,340
Here comes Go Bang-cheon.

693
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:35,520
Teacher.

694
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:41,440
You might laugh at me for rejecting you earlier.

695
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:43,990
But,

696
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:48,240
I have felt since I was a child that I should protect Wo-loo.

697
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:51,590
That's all I really have.

698
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:55,880
Those guys killed him.

699
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,960
What do I do afterwards?

700
01:06:00,610 --> 01:06:02,280
I'll never get over it.

701
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:07,370
I also feel a sense of responsibility for Wo-loo's death.

702
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:08,100
So.

703
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:08,720
No.

704
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:13,490
I also hate them and want to do something.

705
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,900
But you're the only one who will die.

706
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:18,100
You're the only one who can will be bad.

707
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:20,870
This is not something done for Wo-loo.

708
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:27,020
I'm a teacher and an adult who needs to protect you, and I can't keep you from dying.

709
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:30,200
Aren't teachers nice people?

710
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:36,760
Not someone who has only taken photos and thrown instant noodles.

711
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:40,410
You're the one who cares about Wo-loo, didn't you say you wanted to help him?

712
01:06:41,550 --> 01:06:43,200
But.

713
01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:45,680
Wo-loo.

714
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:52,320
Wo-loo died in that cold water tank.

715
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:56,530
No one cares for him, shit.

716
01:06:57,470 --> 01:06:58,700
No one.

717
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:03,080
Only the teacher.

718
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:07,250
Please help me.

719
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:11,590
For Wo-loo.

720
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:18,160
Il-woo, can't you really forgive them?

721
01:07:19,070 --> 01:07:24,320
Can’t we just forgive everyone and start again?

722
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:27,790
Will I forgive them and be done with it?

723
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:32,660
What if I forgave them and Wo-loo didn't?

724
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:34,530
What then?

725
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:44,150
I think I would have lost if it was any later.

726
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:45,710
Please.

727
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:10,840
Thanks.

728
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:17,990
Wo-loo will thank you too.

729
01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:30,100
Fuck.

730
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:34,960
Where do you hurt? Asshole or cock?

731
01:09:36,230 --> 01:09:39,330
Come on, tell me where it hurts.

732
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:47,300
Nothing, nothing at all.

733
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:50,630
It's okay, Wo-loo is okay.

734
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:53,630
Then why did you make that noise?

735
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,820
Fuck, how annoying.

736
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:03,640
Sorry, I'm sorry, ll-woo.

737
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:06,630
I'm fine, I'm really fine.

738
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,020
Ah, never mind.

739
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:11,550
If you're not going to say it, then don’t pretend it hurts.

740
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:15,970
Wol-woo doesn't hurt, not at all.

741
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:33,590
How dare you threaten me?

742
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:38,500
You son of a bitch!

743
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:46,500
Just listen to my dad and put someone in the water for five minutes, and they’ll behave.

744
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,650
Just five minutes.

745
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:55,670
Put it in the water and take it out again.

746
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:57,670
Fuck.

747
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:00,780
I'll kill them.

748
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:32,710
Fuck.

749
01:11:39,310 --> 01:11:40,850
Fuck.

750
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:06,000
Wo-loo got this too?

751
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:16,370
You know that, right?

752
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:20,330
I've seen.

753
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:24,530
Just that morning.

754
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:41,550
Don't pretend, the bastard who came in the morning.

755
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:43,600
Sundays.

756
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:46,730
He comes over every Sunday.

757
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:50,570
No, he didn’t just come for a visit, right?

758
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:52,540
Who is he? Who is he?

759
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:57,140
I don't know, what you're talking about.

760
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:59,110
I've seen it all.

761
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:02,420
I saw what the bastard did to you.

762
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,310
I need to go to Lotteria.

763
01:13:06,310 --> 01:13:09,660
I have an appointment with ll-woo, with ll-woo.

764
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:24,100
Look, you're shaking.

765
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:27,900
Even if you pretend you don't understand, your body will remember that stuff.

766
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:29,880
I, I have to go.

767
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,480
I know what you feel, so.

768
01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:40,620
Anywa , when ll-woo comes, you'll tell him what happened this morning, right?

769
01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:46,770
It's Christmas, Christmas Eve.

770
01:13:46,770 --> 01:13:48,520
It's a good day.

771
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,590
I can't talk about this on a good day.

772
01:13:51,410 --> 01:13:53,060
I can't let him worry.

773
01:13:55,390 --> 01:13:56,960
Il-woo is very tired.

774
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:02,220
Because of me, he's tired.

775
01:14:02,230 --> 01:14:04,190
You're crazy.

776
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:06,990
He should have said it.

777
01:14:06,990 --> 01:14:09,390
Why did he have to suffer this?

778
01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:11,060
You don't know.

779
01:14:13,710 --> 01:14:16,380
You're not the same kind of person as Wo-loo.

780
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:20,450
You can lie down as much as you like.

781
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:24,780
And I'm like you said as the loser.

782
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:28,920
Still feel scared and shaky on my legs.

783
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:34,470
Wo-loo should be the same as me.

784
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:36,870
Even then.

785
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,390
Even then, he should have told me.

786
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:43,520
Would you say that if you were him?

787
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:49,320
If this happened to you, would you tell Wo-loo?

788
01:14:50,670 --> 01:14:52,520
Shit, can he and I be the same?

789
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:08,780
If I had gone to Lotteria,

790
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,630
would he not have gone to the convenience store?

791
01:15:34,050 --> 01:15:37,290
What exactly should I have done then?

792
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:38,860
Whether you slash him in the stomach or send him to the sea

793
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:42,370
you'll have to think for yourself about how you're going to get paid.

794
01:15:42,510 --> 01:15:46,780
He's not my dad anymore, why are you calling me When that bitch goes crazy?

795
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:48,760
Hey, Jo Wo-loo.

796
01:15:50,810 --> 01:15:53,630
Do you have any idea how tired I am?

797
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,810
I don't suppose you have any ideas.

798
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:00,480
You're lucky to be so happy, shit.

799
01:16:01,310 --> 01:16:04,950
Dad and Mum? What the fuck?

800
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:07,450
I'm your father, bitch.

801
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:12,010
I'm your father, bitch.

802
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,860
Il-woo.

803
01:16:29,310 --> 01:16:31,140
Merry Christmas.

804
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:37,890
Are you kidding me?

805
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:56,190
Until the end of the year, leaving them without any ideas to party

806
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,130
Did you get it?

807
01:16:57,130 --> 01:16:58,280
Yes.

808
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,520
What the hell is he saying?

809
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,890
-20 degrees, fuck.

810
01:17:49,730 --> 01:17:52,410
There's a night shifts today, who's up for it?

811
01:17:59,730 --> 01:18:02,110
Get out, get out, get out. You're such a villain.

812
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:04,200
We really can't tear down our home.

813
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:14,070
Why do you poor people spend Christmas? In such a shitty place.

814
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:14,990
Fuck, fuck.

815
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:17,040
Bitch!

816
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,090
Sons of bitches.

817
01:18:18,090 --> 01:18:19,340
Bad man.

818
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:20,990
You can't, I said you can't.

819
01:18:20,990 --> 01:18:22,370
Give up, shit.

820
01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:25,170
Fuck, fuck.

821
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:27,870
No dismantling here.

822
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:46,390
Bitch!

823
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,030
Bitch!

824
01:18:52,170 --> 01:18:57,730
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

825
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:04,720
Give us a break, please give us a break.

826
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:11,620
Give us a break, please give us a break.

827
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:13,500
You penniless bunch, you penniless bunch.

828
01:19:15,770 --> 01:19:19,260
How poor you are, how poor you are.

829
01:19:20,170 --> 01:19:26,760
You're mean, don’t you have any parents?

830
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:31,980
It's been three years since they left home, bitch.

831
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:59,510
What smell of piss, just go home.

832
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:00,850
What about night shifts?

833
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,440
The smell of urine will be in my car, just go home.

834
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:08,120
No way, I have to go to the night shift.

835
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:10,070
Didn't you not even pay your bonus today?

836
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:13,960
Don't you already get paid 100,000 a day, bitch?

837
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:15,110
Hey, brother.

838
01:20:17,570 --> 01:20:18,610
Bonus.

839

Thank you.

840
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,320
Fuck it.

841
01:21:03,770 --> 01:21:05,120
Joo Wo-loo, where are you?

842
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:09,040
Joo Wo-loo, where are you?

843
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:16,220
Damn it. Joo Wo-loo, where are you? Joo Wo-loo?

844
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:25,480
I'm sorry.

845
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:40,610
I didn't want this to happen.

846
01:21:43,570 --> 01:21:45,220
Sorry...

847
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:54,310
Sorry.

848
01:21:54,310 --> 01:21:58,210
I didn't want this to happen...

849
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:11,190
One week?

850
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:16,990
Yeah, we plan it on next Wednesday.

851
01:22:16,990 --> 01:22:20,160
Never say anything to anyone.

852
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,860
Sorry to disappoint you.

853
01:22:24,130 --> 01:22:24,950
mom!

854
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:29,200
Mom is not disappointed yet.

855
01:22:29,810 --> 01:22:31,050
I trust you.

856
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:33,220
It's alright.

857
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:35,130
You can do anything.

858
01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:37,000
Mom will take care of it for you.

859
01:22:38,670 --> 01:22:40,720
Just don't be too bad.

860
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:47,190
Yeah, I will be kind in the future.

861
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:50,640
Will the teacher come?

862
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:51,770
Yeah.

863
01:22:51,770 --> 01:22:53,640
No one has any spirit.

864
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,420
So get some quiet sleep.

865
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:05,330
Crazy. It's in the middle of a class.

866
01:23:16,510 --> 01:23:17,870
When exactly?

867
01:23:19,330 --> 01:23:21,600
That's why I told you to hurry up.

868
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:24,000
I don't know, asshole.

869
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,250
What?

870
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,970
I thought you fucking said no.

871
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:31,150
What are you gonna do to that psycho idiot?

872
01:23:31,270 --> 01:23:33,720
I'll see what I can do tomorrow, asshole.

873
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:38,500
The lunatic was really scared. He spent a lot of money.

874
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:39,850
You'd do it though, right?

875
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:44,740
What the fuck you are insane really...

876
01:23:44,740 --> 01:23:46,590
You think I don't know?

877
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:51,260
Didn't you fake these like shit?

878
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:55,270
Fuck. What the bullshit.

879
01:23:57,630 --> 01:24:01,580
A guy who doesn't even know how to use a gun is rotting away in his cell.

880
01:24:02,210 --> 01:24:04,210
But he took all the money.

881
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:09,650
You think you can walk out of here with nothing to show for it?

882
01:24:11,330 --> 01:24:12,380
No way.

883
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,330
Think about it.

884
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:24,110
If you don't keep your end of the bargain, you won't get paid,

885
01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:29,070
and you won't get out of this cell.

886
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:33,990
Didn't my father tell you that?

887
01:24:36,770 --> 01:24:39,570
It's a piece of shit, you idiot.

888
01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:05,960
You must have had something yesterday, right?

889
01:25:08,730 --> 01:25:10,280
You have.

890
01:25:12,030 --> 01:25:13,200
I don't...don't know.

891
01:25:14,630 --> 01:25:15,570
Really.

892
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:17,330
You don’t know?

893
01:25:17,330 --> 01:25:18,280
Yeah.

894
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,730
You don't forget all of a sudden, do you?

895
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:25,390
Go out to the bathroom.

896
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:32,110
Go and have a cigarette and cheer yourself up.

897
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:57,000
Don't go.

898
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:03,350
Stay there.

899
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:16,830
After class, go to the director.

900
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:19,940
It's your session today, not mine.

901
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,150
Just do it for an hour.

902
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:26,770
When it's over, it's over.

903
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:30,020
You...will you...?

904
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:32,310
Don't be with that guy.

905
01:26:35,370 --> 01:26:36,910
Or you will die.

906
01:26:52,980 --> 01:27:03,680
Even if you come, or my brother come, he'd go to convenient shop.

907
01:27:11,790 --> 01:27:14,050
One, eat this.

908
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:16,450
What?

909
01:27:20,370 --> 01:27:23,650
But how do I get expired stuff?

910
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:26,060
The boss said I could take it.

911
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:31,390
You can give it to Grandma. It's for Grandma.

912
01:27:32,530 --> 01:27:39,660
But ll-woo didn't eat, so busy...

913
01:27:42,130 --> 01:27:44,090
Yeah. Would a fool like you take that?

914
01:27:44,710 --> 01:27:47,680
But worth it, right?

915
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:49,250
I need to work hard.

916
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:51,360
I'll get paid at the end of the month.

917
01:27:57,430 --> 01:28:04,220
With that money, we can get water in home.

918
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:09,350
You can get some water in home.

919
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:12,590
Well, that's what happens when you get paid.

920
01:28:18,390 --> 01:28:20,440
And he wanted to do something for you.

921
01:28:21,970 --> 01:28:22,720
Water.

922
01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:36,200
Fool, I really hate it when he says the same thing over and over again.

923
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:44,730
I want to hear it now.

924
01:28:54,530 --> 01:28:57,150
All right, let's get those shirts off.

925
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:01,200
After class on Friday, it's shower time.

926
01:29:02,350 --> 01:29:05,760
Teachers and discipline will not follow into the bathhouse.

927
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:11,540
CCTV would watch when it goes crazy.

928
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:16,490
But if there's no trouble, just turn off the lights.

929
01:29:16,490 --> 01:29:17,820
They can't get here early.

930
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:23,540
No, there's a lot crazier than me.
No, if the last one gets off, you have to wait until the next one.

931
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:30,610
Everyone is in the bathroom, under cctv.

932
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:33,230
We'll have about 40 minutes.

933
01:29:33,850 --> 01:29:35,090
A lot.

934
01:29:36,350 --> 01:29:41,630
So 40 minutes, if nothing goes wrong, in the bathroom.

935
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:45,980
There is no one but the teacher.

936
01:29:49,570 --> 01:29:51,300
What?

937
01:29:58,820 --> 01:30:00,570
What you doing, get your cloths off.

938
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:06,570
I have a consultation today.

939
01:30:07,310 --> 01:30:08,360
Really?

940
01:30:09,910 --> 01:30:11,060
Yes.

941
01:30:11,770 --> 01:30:13,920
After the consultation, come to the bathroom immediately.

942
01:30:15,710 --> 01:30:16,980
Yes.

943
01:30:21,530 --> 01:30:25,680
In case you fail, then...

944
01:30:26,610 --> 01:30:27,140
Anyway...

945
01:30:27,150 --> 01:30:32,850
There's no way I'm getting out of there.

946
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:40,230
If the night shift comes, there's nothing else I can do for you.

947
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:44,670
Until there's nothing. 40 minutes.

948
01:30:45,290 --> 01:30:46,830
It's gonna be over before then.

949
01:30:50,490 --> 01:30:51,650
Now get in.

950
01:31:15,740 --> 01:31:16,690
Sorry.

951
01:31:25,210 --> 01:31:26,700
God bless us.

952
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:32,760
Forgive us our sins.

953
01:32:20,420 --> 01:32:22,710
Draw a picture

954
01:32:22,730 --> 01:32:24,030
of your mental state.

955
01:34:16,930 --> 01:34:18,420
All out except Moon Ja-hoon.

956
01:34:38,010 --> 01:34:40,720
Fucking asshole.

957
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:43,520
You got to fight in your pants.

958
01:34:43,530 --> 01:34:45,280
It's embarrassing.

959
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:49,410
I said all out except Moon Ja-hoon.

960
01:35:00,530 --> 01:35:03,580
A man like you could die here.

961
01:35:09,650 --> 01:35:12,400
You killed him? Joo Wo-loo.

962
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:18,280
And you dropped in the water tank?

963
01:35:23,660 --> 01:35:27,150
Damn it, that stupid boy.

964
01:35:34,940 --> 01:35:37,090
Fuck.

965
01:35:42,490 --> 01:35:45,890
I really, really feel sick.

966
01:35:52,010 --> 01:35:58,330
Hey, how did that kid end up dead? That psycho would've be that way anyway.

967
01:35:58,330 --> 01:36:01,000
You'd better stop whether that guy is still alive.

968
01:36:02,050 --> 01:36:05,980
But why are you so hung up on that retarded kid?!

969
01:36:05,980 --> 01:36:07,330
Ok.

970
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:25,010
I'm gonna do exactly what you did to him asshole.

971
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:50,060
Can you explain why it's drawn this way?

972
01:36:59,050 --> 01:37:00,500
Because I'm a fucking wimpy guy.

973
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:20,520
Fuck.

974
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:05,900
Get out of the way, damn it.

975
01:39:05,900 --> 01:39:11,570
You fucking asshole.

976
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:28,840
Moon Ja-hoon you prick, you asshole.

977
01:39:57,620 --> 01:39:58,660
Teacher.

978
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:02,870
Don't go.

979
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:10,710
5 minutes.

980
01:40:14,310 --> 01:40:16,490
Just wait for 5 minutes.

981
01:40:25,780 --> 01:40:27,760
I didn't kill him.

982
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:30,160
I said it's not me.

983
01:40:30,170 --> 01:40:32,250
I didn't fucking kill him.

984
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:33,080
Shut up.

985
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:34,830
You want to know the truth don’t you?

986
01:40:34,830 --> 01:40:36,720
Now it's not necessary.

987
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:38,370
Trust me.

988
01:40:38,370 --> 01:40:39,920
That night.

989
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:42,700
I tricked him into going there and beating him. Yeah.

990
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:44,270
But I didn't kill him, really.

991
01:40:44,270 --> 01:40:46,270
He was alive.

992
01:40:46,270 --> 01:40:49,090
I don't know since I got the fuck out of there.

993
01:40:49,090 --> 01:40:52,070
I don't know who dragged your brother here, really.

994
01:40:56,270 --> 01:40:58,660
Fuck.

995
01:40:59,820 --> 01:41:02,090
Actually that day,

996
01:41:02,710 --> 01:41:04,760
At convenient shop I beat him.

997
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:08,520
That idiot is not lucky, he died.

998
01:41:08,630 --> 01:41:11,550
My dad's a lawyer so I dragged him here.

999
01:41:11,550 --> 01:41:14,860
That's why I came here on purpose.

1000
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:17,490
It's not because of your brother.

1001
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:19,900
Be clear, idiot.

1002
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:25,700
In the end, you fucking killed him.

1003
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:27,650
Not me! Damn it!

1004
01:41:27,650 --> 01:41:29,720
I’m losing my fucking mind!

1005
01:41:33,050 --> 01:41:34,850
I'm sorry.

1006
01:41:35,690 --> 01:41:36,820
I was wrong.

1007
01:41:38,270 --> 01:41:40,340
Just give me a break for once.

1008
01:41:40,340 --> 01:41:42,390
Just once, sorry.

1009
01:41:42,390 --> 01:41:44,470
Please bare me.

1010
01:41:44,470 --> 01:41:46,640
It's fucking late...

1011
01:41:48,090 --> 01:41:52,910
You killed him...Asshole..

1012
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:58,930
You asshole..

1013
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:04,430
Save me teacher...

1014
01:42:04,430 --> 01:42:06,060
You fucking prick fuck.

1015
01:42:55,890 --> 01:42:59,230
Fuck, teacher, it's really not kidding.

1016
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,670
Save me.

1017
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:43,360
There's something about Wo-loo.

1018
01:43:49,780 --> 01:43:52,960
Il-woo, Il-woo.

1019
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:56,060
Would you like to hear a Christmas carol?

1020
01:43:57,530 --> 01:44:06,330
Look at the outside of window,
Look at the outside of window.

1021
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:10,280
Snow is falling.

1022
01:44:15,470 --> 01:44:19,080
Not by any stretch of the imagination.

1023
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:25,610
Why did the teacher do that?

1024
01:44:29,490 --> 01:44:34,560
The dean's presence in other classrooms is also detrimental to the teacher.

1025
01:44:34,970 --> 01:44:39,360
Now, there is no possibility

1026
01:44:39,860 --> 01:44:42,860
of self-defense during a fight.

1027
01:44:44,190 --> 01:44:48,940
- I'm gonna pay the price.

1028
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:52,780
Just leave it as it is,

1029
01:44:52,780 --> 01:44:54,740
and sentence it.

1030
01:44:58,050 --> 01:45:00,730
The defendant, as a consulting teacher.

1031
01:45:01,050 --> 01:45:06,300
He devoted his life to rehabilitating prisoners.

1032
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:10,770
And, for the past year, every Sunday,

1033
01:45:11,580 --> 01:45:15,600
voluntary visits to dysfunctional families, etc.

1034
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:22,670
In the long run, to rehabilitate troubled youths in their area...

1035
01:45:30,890 --> 01:45:33,620
I never once thought of killing anyone.

1036
01:45:35,790 --> 01:45:38,660
It was really something that had to happen.

1037
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:44,760
But.

1038
01:45:45,300 --> 01:45:47,610
All the responsibility lies with me.

1039
01:45:48,230 --> 01:45:50,530
Please go back.

1040
01:45:58,650 --> 01:46:00,650
You can't do that in court.

1041
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:38,930
Teacher.

1042
01:46:40,900 --> 01:46:42,250
Yeah.

1043
01:46:45,030 --> 01:46:47,410
Does it take long?

1044
01:46:48,250 --> 01:46:51,650
Yeah, it's Christmas.

1045
01:46:52,490 --> 01:46:53,720
Yes.

1046
01:46:56,320 --> 01:47:21,770
Look at the outside of window, look at the outside of window. The snow is falling...

1047
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:31,410
Even so, thank you.

1048
01:47:31,460 --> 01:47:35,210
Thanks for killing those idiots.

1049
01:47:35,210 --> 01:47:38,850
Thank you for killing those idiots, motherfucker.

1050
01:47:38,850 --> 01:47:41,650
Thanks for killing those idiots.

1051
01:47:41,750 --> 01:47:46,280
Because of the defendant's sincere repentance.

1052
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:48,250
If there is no intentional homicide,

1053
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:52,490
let the superior refer to the case before making a decision.

1054
01:47:53,420 --> 01:47:54,950
A note of judgment.

1055
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:59,250
You are sentenced to four years in prison.

1056
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:10,810
Sorry, ll-woo.

1057
01:48:11,740 --> 01:48:13,840
Are you angry?

1058
01:48:16,930 --> 01:48:19,480
Forget it, just sleep.

1059
01:48:23,930 --> 01:48:24,980
It's Christmas.

1060
01:48:25,710 --> 01:48:30,060
It's Christmas tomorrow, ll-woo.

1061
01:48:33,350 --> 01:48:34,930
It's eve. What?

1062
01:48:36,270 --> 01:48:41,050
Dad, when I was little, Dad..

1063
01:48:41,570 --> 01:48:46,450
On Christmas Eve, say Santa Claus will come to give presents.

1064
01:48:46,450 --> 01:48:47,600
Gift.

1065
01:48:50,170 --> 01:48:51,600
Shit.

1066
01:48:52,740 --> 01:48:58,670
Dad will put away the presents at this time.

1067
01:48:59,310 --> 01:49:03,020
Cheer up, boy. Are you too old to believe in Santa Claus?

1068
01:49:05,690 --> 01:49:07,760
Ah for fuck sake..

1069
01:49:15,710 --> 01:49:18,040
Santa Claus gave us a box of Ramen and gone.

1070
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:20,330
But...

1071
01:49:20,330 --> 01:49:23,030
Fuck go to grandma to cook it.

1072
01:49:23,030 --> 01:49:23,980
No...

1073
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:36,580
But Santa Claus found me..

1074
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:38,590
Why.

1075
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,170
He said he likes me.

1076
01:49:49,170 --> 01:49:52,650
Ah you crazy punk.

1077
01:50:02,140 --> 01:50:05,140
Il-woo, ll-woo.

1078
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:07,940
Why again? Why, why.

1079
01:50:08,860 --> 01:50:11,360
Would you like me to sing you a Christmas carol?

1080
01:50:12,190 --> 01:50:17,860
Tomorrow is Christmas Eve, isn't it?

1081
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:21,050
Ah shit, hey...

1082
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:24,380
From midnight on, let's just stop, okay?

1083
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:43,990
The cold wind blows the cold wind blows.

1084
01:50:43,990 --> 01:50:47,300
Snow is falling.

1085
01:50:48,460 --> 01:50:56,090
The cold wind blows the cold wind blows..

1086
01:50:57,660 --> 01:51:00,660
Snow is falling...

1087
01:51:38,490 --> 01:51:40,590
Merry Christmas.

1088
01:51:42,460 --> 01:51:44,210
I think he already knew.

1089
01:51:44,210 --> 01:51:46,590
That's when he came to cry.

1090
01:51:46,590 --> 01:51:49,410
I volunteer for interviews every week,

1091
01:51:49,410 --> 01:51:51,620
so I go to your apartment every week.

1092
01:51:51,620 --> 01:51:53,160
He's a kind kid.

1093
01:51:55,860 --> 01:51:57,530
Smile well.

1094
01:51:57,530 --> 01:52:03,560
He said he likes me.

1095
01:52:03,980 --> 01:52:06,760
-The way he smiles and lives, to other people.

1096
01:52:07,700 --> 01:52:09,160
You too.

1097
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:10,330
Me too.

1098
01:52:10,850 --> 01:52:13,860
Il-woo, you can't forgive?

1099
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:19,850
Can't we just drop it all and start over?

1100
01:52:20,550 --> 01:52:26,450
In the morning, let's wait for Santa.

1101
01:52:26,450 --> 01:52:31,840
Isn't grandma at home, wait for granny.

1102
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:49,280
I had so many wishes for Wo-loo that I didn't help him fulfill.

1103
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:54,590
Yes.

1104
01:52:55,830 --> 01:52:58,110
I really loved Wo-loo.

1105
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:02,370
So I did the same to Wo-loo.

1106
01:53:02,370 --> 01:53:04,330
It's really painful.

1107
01:53:05,980 --> 01:53:08,470
I really wanted to help him.

1108
01:53:10,420 --> 01:53:12,530
How the hell did that happen.

1109
01:53:15,030 --> 01:53:17,420
That’s when you said you wanted revenge.

1110
01:53:17,420 --> 01:53:18,770
I know the answer.

1111
01:53:19,470 --> 01:53:21,870
It's all because of those guys.

1112
01:53:24,140 --> 01:53:27,470
But I thought I was gonna kill those guys before you got here.

1113
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:31,670
My heart hurts so much.

1114
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:37,320
So I want to take your place.

1115
01:53:38,060 --> 01:53:41,160
Thought I could pay off Wo-loo like this.

1116
01:53:48,690 --> 01:53:53,040
Wo-loo would like my choice, too.

1117
01:53:54,510 --> 01:53:56,300
Cause I protected you.

1118
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:06,330
What I did to Wo-loo, I paid it off by saving you.

1119
01:54:12,040 --> 01:54:14,230
Now I feel light.

1120
01:54:16,840 --> 01:54:18,590
Wo-loo's death..

1121
01:54:22,170 --> 01:54:23,020
Was that you?

1122
01:54:25,940 --> 01:54:27,420
No.

1123
01:54:29,260 --> 01:54:30,590
Didn't you say.

1124
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:33,620
The kid killed him.

1125
01:54:36,830 --> 01:54:39,560
So they were put on trial.

1126
01:54:46,280 --> 01:54:47,860
Because I got my revenge.

1127
01:54:49,510 --> 01:54:51,310
I came to the prison, too.

1128
01:54:54,580 --> 01:54:56,450
Aren't you free?

1129
01:54:56,870 --> 01:55:00,580
So get on with your life.

1130
01:55:03,150 --> 01:55:05,500
That's all it takes ll-woo.

1131
01:55:07,600 --> 01:55:10,050
Come out, you cunt.

1132
01:55:10,350 --> 01:55:13,470
Come out, bitch. Come out.

1133
01:55:14,190 --> 01:55:15,740
How did you killed him..

1134
01:55:15,740 --> 01:55:18,770
What did you do to him..

1135
01:55:41,530 --> 01:55:47,860
Sunday, December 24 at 9:57 PM
The cold wind blows...

1136
01:55:47,860 --> 01:55:49,300
The cold wind blows..

1137
01:55:50,330 --> 01:55:52,910
Winter is coming...

1138
01:56:22,140 --> 01:56:26,910
Wo-loo can't be fired. No..

1139
01:56:27,130 --> 01:56:30,860
What if dean know...

1140
01:56:36,530 --> 01:56:37,780
Ah.

1141
01:56:38,510 --> 01:56:41,860
Ah, cell phone.

1142
01:56:41,860 --> 01:56:45,000
I lost my phone, too.

1143
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:49,130
Will be taught a lesson by ll-woo...

1144
01:57:05,020 --> 01:57:06,570
Hello.

1145
01:57:32,680 --> 01:57:34,950
The motherfuckers, damn it.

1146
01:57:36,700 --> 01:57:38,180
It's ok, it's ok.

1147
01:58:48,250 --> 01:58:49,600
Wo-loo.

1148
01:58:56,470 --> 01:58:58,310
Hey Wo-loo, Wo-loo!

1149
01:59:00,910 --> 01:59:02,490
Wake up Wo-loo, wake up!

1150
01:59:02,590 --> 01:59:06,660
Wo-loo wake up you kid.

1151
01:59:07,180 --> 01:59:10,080
Don't fall asleep, you bastard.

1152
02:00:02,860 --> 02:00:04,860
Why am I doing this? Fuck.

1153
02:00:05,780 --> 02:00:08,460
What did I do wrong?!

1154
02:01:13,650 --> 02:01:17,980
Bad luck. Bad luck. Shit.

1155
02:01:19,930 --> 02:01:24,330
Yeah, it's just bad luck, shit.

1156
02:01:32,550 --> 02:01:33,590
Thanks.

1157
02:01:38,290 --> 02:01:39,960
Teacher is here.

1158
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:45,510
Yeah? Ah, just..

1159
02:01:48,380 --> 02:01:49,860
Then you must know Ja-hoon.

1160
02:01:50,680 --> 02:01:51,420
Who?

1161
02:01:52,260 --> 02:01:53,430
Ja-hoon?

1162
02:01:58,530 --> 02:01:59,860
Moon Ja-hoon?

1163
02:02:00,710 --> 02:02:03,610
His dad had a good time saying hi.

1164
02:04:12,670 --> 02:04:14,990
Ok, ok, ok.

1165
02:04:15,510 --> 02:04:16,750
Hey.

1166
02:04:20,080 --> 02:04:21,740
If there is a god.

1167
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:30,510
Would he know about that shit?

1168
02:04:30,930 --> 02:04:32,180
When?

1169
02:04:33,310 --> 02:04:35,280
The whole fucking death thing?

1170
02:04:35,280 --> 02:04:38,610
Damn it, don't believe that stuff.

1171
02:04:38,610 --> 02:04:40,180
You might as well trust me on this shit.

1172
02:04:44,210 --> 02:04:48,660
But you laugh like Wo-loo.

1173
02:04:48,670 --> 02:04:50,230
Ah shit.

1174
02:05:03,200 --> 02:05:04,040
Hey.

1175
02:05:04,890 --> 02:05:06,050
Do you want to hear carols?

1176
02:05:07,610 --> 02:05:09,590
What? No head, no tail.

1177
02:05:09,590 --> 02:05:10,740
Don't.

1178
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:16,720
Cold wind blows, cold wind blows.

1179
02:05:17,340 --> 02:05:18,490
Shut up.

1180
02:05:18,490 --> 02:05:19,440
Snow is falling.

1181
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:20,390
What carol..

1182
02:05:20,390 --> 02:05:21,640
It's Christmas.

1183
02:05:27,060 --> 02:05:32,930
-Cold wind blows, cold wind blows. -Ah lunatic.

1184
02:05:32,930 --> 02:05:36,960
Hard winter is coming.

1185
02:05:41,300 --> 02:05:46,550
Cold wind blows, cold wind blows.

1186
02:05:46,680 --> 02:05:50,370
Snow is falling.

1187
02:05:50,370 --> 02:05:52,670
Ah it's really Christmas.

1188
02:05:52,670 --> 02:05:54,670
Yeah.

1189
02:05:54,670 --> 02:06:02,850
Cold wind blows, cold wind blows...

1190
02:06:04,070 --> 02:06:07,420
Hard winter is coming.
