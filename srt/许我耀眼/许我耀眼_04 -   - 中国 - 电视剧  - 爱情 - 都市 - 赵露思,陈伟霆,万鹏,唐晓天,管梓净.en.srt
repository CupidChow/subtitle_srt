of Dayun County.

00:01:53,232 --> 00:01:54,031
Now, Dayun County

has developed well.

34

00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:08,512
By the way,

41
00:02:10,072 --> 00:02:11,871
didn't you stay longer
on your business trip?

42
00:02:12,192 --> 00:02:12,632
No,

43
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,671
I only cut the ribbon.

44
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:14,671
It was a quick trip.

45
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:18,151
Don't watch the news.
I want to watch cartoons.

47
00:02:19,952 --> 00:02:20,831
do you have time now?

48
00:02:21,232 --> 00:02:22,431
I want to talk about

50
00:02:23,671 --> 00:02:24,431
Sure.

51
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:26,391
Talk over there.

54
00:02:30,591 --> 00:02:32,151
I've told you many times

00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:34,551
it will damage your eyes.

- Ms. Sha, getting a perm?

61
00:02:52,752 --> 00:02:53,312
Yes.

62
00:02:54,312 --> 00:02:54,831
Yazhen,

63
00:02:55,312 --> 00:02:57,111
Qiao is quite popular now.

64
00:02:57,551 --> 00:02:58,752
On TV,

65
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:00,151
he spoke so eloquently,

66
00:03:00,512 --> 00:03:02,352
even upstaging the county mayor!

67
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:04,551
Of course.

68
00:03:05,192 --> 00:03:06,352

69

be the merchant representative.

I had to do my best.

71
00:03:09,711 --> 00:03:10,232
Right?

72
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:12,391
No wonder you raised
such good daughters.

73
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:14,512
The younger one

74
00:03:14,551 --> 00:03:15,192
is working now?

75
00:03:18,711 --> 00:03:19,671
What's the point?

76
00:03:20,632 --> 00:03:21,912
She never calls,

77
00:03:22,111 --> 00:03:23,391
and only sends a text

78
00:03:23,952 --> 00:03:24,991
during holidays.

79
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:26,792
Lin is better.

80
00:03:27,111 --> 00:03:27,871
She stays

81
00:03:27,871 --> 00:03:28,912
with us.

82
00:03:29,271 --> 00:03:31,151
She is our sweet daughter.

83
00:03:32,632 --> 00:03:32,991
Right.

84
00:03:33,271 --> 00:03:34,032
Is Lin

85
00:03:34,072 --> 00:03:35,072
about to marry soon?

86
00:03:35,912 --> 00:03:36,632
Very soon.

88
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:40,671

Beauty.

90
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:44,752

91
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:46,352
largest fertilizer factory.

92
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:49,711

group purchase benefits.

93
00:03:52,352 --> 00:03:53,352
Add me on WeChat.

94
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:54,591

95
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:55,192
I'll tell you.

96
00:03:56,312 --> 00:03:57,032
Feel free to come

97
00:03:57,032 --> 00:03:58,151
to our counter.

98
00:03:58,711 --> 00:03:59,352
Take this.

99
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:03,032
You are so rigid.

100
00:04:03,032 --> 00:04:04,431
How can you make money?

101
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,831
Many salesgirls want my contact,

102
00:04:06,952 --> 00:04:07,871
yet they can't get it.

103
00:04:10,671 --> 00:04:12,072
Your hands are so fair.

104
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:14,032
Are you insane?

105
00:04:15,072 --> 00:04:16,391
I'll pick you up after work.

106
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:18,992
Are you insane?

107
00:04:19,952 --> 00:04:20,351
You!

108
00:04:20,391 --> 00:04:21,031
Stop there!

109
00:04:22,351 --> 00:04:23,271
Don't touch me.

110
00:04:23,911 --> 00:04:24,432
Honey.

111
00:04:25,112 --> 00:04:25,992
She hit me!

112
00:04:26,151 --> 00:04:27,192
Why did you hit him?

113
00:04:27,312 --> 00:04:28,231
Why did you hit me?

114
00:04:28,271 --> 00:04:29,391
You wretch!

115
00:04:29,432 --> 00:04:30,672
Are you insane?

116
00:04:30,711 --> 00:04:31,271
Let go of me!

117
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:31,952
What's going on?

118
00:04:31,952 --> 00:04:32,552
Let go of me!

119
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:33,791
Let go!

120
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:34,831
I'll report you!

121
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,904
(Police)

122
00:04:42,512 --> 00:04:42,952
Lin.

123
00:04:43,552 --> 00:04:43,872
Lin.

124
00:04:45,391 --> 00:04:47,231
We agreed to discuss
the wedding at my place.

125
00:04:54,432 --> 00:04:55,031
Dad. Mom.

126
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:55,992
We're back.

127
00:05:01,231 --> 00:05:02,031
Troublemaker.

128
00:05:02,391 --> 00:05:03,271
How dare you come!

129
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:04,072
Auntie. I...

130
00:05:04,072 --> 00:05:04,512
Lin.

131
00:05:09,632 --> 00:05:10,072
Dad.

132
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:11,752
Here.

133
00:05:12,432 --> 00:05:13,151
Have some fruits.

134
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:18,112
Dad.

135
00:05:18,512 --> 00:05:19,552
This is the money from you

136
00:05:19,632 --> 00:05:21,031
(Details of wedding costs)
and my mom for our marriage.

137
00:05:21,351 --> 00:05:23,072
Excluding the betrothal money
for Lin family,

138
00:05:23,312 --> 00:05:23,911
wedding rings,

139
00:05:24,112 --> 00:05:25,312
and other

140
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:26,312
expenses,

141
00:05:26,552 --> 00:05:29,711
there is still 98,654 yuan.

142
00:05:30,192 --> 00:05:31,072
I'll ask one question.

143
00:05:31,672 --> 00:05:33,151
What about the cash gifts?

144
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:35,351
You'll have it.
Lin and I agreed on this.

145
00:05:39,432 --> 00:05:40,591
Let me break it down.

146
00:05:42,031 --> 00:05:44,031
The wedding photos cost

147
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:45,271
9,588 yuan.

148
00:05:45,872 --> 00:05:46,872
I chose a moderately

149
00:05:46,872 --> 00:05:48,112
priced wedding planner,

150
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:49,432
costing 18,800 yuan.

151
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:51,831
For accommodation
for out-of-town guests,

152
00:05:52,112 --> 00:05:53,271
I booked 20 standard rooms.

153
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:55,552
Each room costs 288 yuan,

154
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:57,992
totaling 5,760 yuan.

155
00:05:58,591 --> 00:05:59,552
About the return gifts,

156
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:00,591
we'll prepare them.

157
00:06:01,351 --> 00:06:02,512
15,000 yuan should suffice.

158
00:06:02,872 --> 00:06:04,432
I booked 20 banquet tables.

159
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:05,512
Each table costs

160
00:06:05,512 --> 00:06:06,672
1,288 yuan.

161
00:06:07,271 --> 00:06:08,231
20 tables?

162
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:09,391
That's not enough.

163
00:06:10,151 --> 00:06:10,672
Mom.

164
00:06:11,112 --> 00:06:12,512
Our bank has rules.

165
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,112
For weddings,
not more than 20 tables are allowed.

166
00:06:15,312 --> 00:06:15,992
No exceptions.

167
00:06:16,351 --> 00:06:17,591
Otherwise, my superior and I

168
00:06:17,591 --> 00:06:18,591
would be affected.

169
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,391
Did your bank mention

170
00:06:20,831 --> 00:06:22,351
if your fiancee frequently visiting

171
00:06:22,391 --> 00:06:22,992
police stations

172
00:06:23,112 --> 00:06:24,192
would affect your career?

173
00:06:29,512 --> 00:06:29,791
Auntie.

174
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,031
Get straight to the point.

175
00:06:31,151 --> 00:06:32,231
Stop being so sarcastic,

176
00:06:32,231 --> 00:06:32,711
okay?

177
00:06:33,952 --> 00:06:35,151
I'm being sarcastic?

178
00:06:35,432 --> 00:06:36,992
As a young woman,

179
00:06:37,351 --> 00:06:38,872
you always cause trouble.

180
00:06:39,752 --> 00:06:40,632
Why don't you

181
00:06:40,632 --> 00:06:41,872
think of the consequences?

182
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:42,872
Do you live

183
00:06:42,872 --> 00:06:43,872
in the police station?

184
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:45,711
You go there many times a month!

185
00:06:47,231 --> 00:06:47,791
Auntie.

186
00:06:48,031 --> 00:06:49,312
This wasn't my fault!

187
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:50,672
Today, that man

188
00:06:50,672 --> 00:06:51,791
harassed me first.

189
00:06:51,992 --> 00:06:52,471
Enough!

190
00:06:54,031 --> 00:06:54,992
Be quiet.

191
00:06:57,112 --> 00:06:57,791
Qiao Lin.

192
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,911
You're Lin Tao's fiancee.

193
00:07:00,872 --> 00:07:01,952
Our town is small.

194
00:07:02,432 --> 00:07:03,791
If you keep causing trouble

195
00:07:04,192 --> 00:07:05,151
and word gets out,

196
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:06,831
it'll affect Tao's career.

197
00:07:07,112 --> 00:07:07,711
Understand?

198
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:09,312
If his career gets affected,

199
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:10,672
you'll be affected too.

200
00:07:10,992 --> 00:07:11,831
My son

201
00:07:12,112 --> 00:07:13,672
graduated from a top university

202
00:07:13,752 --> 00:07:14,872
with a master's degree.

203
00:07:15,271 --> 00:07:16,911
He's a bank client manager now,

204
00:07:17,072 --> 00:07:19,112
and will become a department head,

205
00:07:19,312 --> 00:07:21,072
branch manager, and even bank president!

206
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:22,711
Look at you.

207
00:07:22,952 --> 00:07:24,391
You're ruining my son's

208
00:07:24,432 --> 00:07:25,552
bright future!

209
00:07:25,872 --> 00:07:26,831
We are to blame

210
00:07:26,911 --> 00:07:28,312
for accepting your marriage.

211
00:07:43,552 --> 00:07:47,911
Lin. I've calculated it.

212
00:07:48,151 --> 00:07:48,632
We still

213
00:07:48,632 --> 00:07:49,911
have 17,866 yuan.

214
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:50,791
It's enough

215
00:07:50,831 --> 00:07:51,591
for our honeymoon.

216
00:07:52,952 --> 00:07:53,752
Enjoy it yourself.

217
00:07:55,952 --> 00:07:56,432
Lin.

218
00:08:12,632 --> 00:08:19,072
(- What're you doing?)
(- At work. What's wrong?)

219
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:25,632
(Nothing.)

220
00:08:27,312 --> 00:08:28,471
(When will you come home?)

221
00:08:34,991 --> 00:08:35,432
Lin.

222
00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:36,272
Have an apple.

223
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:37,471
Thanks, Dad.

224
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:50,991
Dad.

225
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:54,432
Have you used the betrothal money

226
00:08:54,432 --> 00:08:55,192
from Lin Tao?

227
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:56,511
Yes.

228
00:08:56,991 --> 00:08:58,231
We agreed to use

229
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:00,991
the money for renovating the new store.

230
00:09:02,312 --> 00:09:03,471
After we sell the old store,

231
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:04,672
we'll return it to you.

232
00:09:05,432 --> 00:09:05,991
What now?

233
00:09:06,552 --> 00:09:07,511
Did Lin Tao's parents

234
00:09:07,552 --> 00:09:08,312
say anything?

235
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:09,711
Not exactly.

236
00:09:09,711 --> 00:09:10,672
I'm Just asking.

237
00:09:12,471 --> 00:09:13,552
How's your wedding

238
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:14,792
preparations going?

239
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:16,631
He's been busy with work.

240
00:09:17,072 --> 00:09:18,591
I've been busy lately too.

241
00:09:29,831 --> 00:09:30,231
Right.

242
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:32,672
I need to go on a business trip soon.

243
00:09:33,552 --> 00:09:34,912
A study trip

244
00:09:34,912 --> 00:09:35,672
in Jingzhou.

245
00:09:36,392 --> 00:09:37,111
To Jingzhou?

246
00:09:38,471 --> 00:09:39,272
How long?

247
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:40,672
Have you told Lin Tao?

248
00:09:41,432 --> 00:09:41,831
Not yet.

249
00:09:42,111 --> 00:09:42,432
Wait.

250
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:43,351
Lin.

251
00:09:43,432 --> 00:09:44,591
You should at least

252
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:46,471
inform Lin Tao about the trip.

253
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,552
Lin Tao is a key talent

254
00:09:48,552 --> 00:09:49,471
at the bank now.

255
00:09:49,471 --> 00:09:50,672
He has his pride.

256
00:09:51,032 --> 00:09:52,192
You need to get along well.

257
00:09:52,631 --> 00:09:53,231
Exactly.

258
00:09:53,312 --> 00:09:54,792
You're about to get married.

259
00:09:54,952 --> 00:09:55,991
You should be considerate.

260
00:09:56,072 --> 00:09:56,591
Understand?

261
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:57,591
You should

262
00:09:57,591 --> 00:09:59,152
discuss everything with Lin Tao.

263
00:09:59,392 --> 00:10:00,032
You hear me?

264
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:00,831
Yes.

265
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:01,831
Right.

266
00:10:02,032 --> 00:10:03,192
You two should live

267
00:10:03,231 --> 00:10:04,432
a peaceful life together.

268
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:05,672
Just stay

269
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,032
with us.

270
00:10:07,672 --> 00:10:08,792
Don't be like your sister.

271
00:10:09,111 --> 00:10:09,711
This daughter

272
00:10:09,711 --> 00:10:10,711
is like she never exists.

♪I'll make you adore me,

The list and procedures
of the Family Feast

281
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,591
need double-checking.

282
00:10:50,952 --> 00:10:52,312
Contact me immediately

283
00:10:52,511 --> 00:10:53,392

00:10:53,912 --> 00:10:54,351
Alright.

285
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:56,152
Yan.

286
00:10:56,591 --> 00:10:57,152
We have

287
00:10:57,152 --> 00:10:58,032
a gathering tonight.

288
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:58,672
Want to join us?

289
00:10:59,351 --> 00:11:00,312
I'll pass.

290
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:01,432
My boyfriend will come.

291
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:02,751
Boyfriend?

292
00:11:03,072 --> 00:11:04,272
He is your fiance, right?

293
00:11:05,152 --> 00:11:06,432
Go home early tonight, alright?

294
00:11:06,711 --> 00:11:07,111
Okay.

295
00:11:07,432 --> 00:11:08,991
Have a good date tonight.

296
00:11:09,072 --> 00:11:09,631
I'm leaving.

297
00:11:23,272 --> 00:11:23,751
Yan.

298
00:11:25,032 --> 00:11:25,711
Qiao Yan!

299
00:11:31,312 --> 00:11:33,792
I am so lucky today, meeting you
right after work.

300
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:34,351
Otherwise,

301
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:35,231
I couldn't find you.

302
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:44,192
- Why are you here?
- I called off the wedding.

303
00:11:45,312 --> 00:11:47,032
I'm now free from all worries,

304
00:11:47,351 --> 00:11:48,711
so I thought to try my luck

305
00:11:48,912 --> 00:11:49,751
in a big city.

306
00:11:50,272 --> 00:11:51,351
I haven't found a place.

307
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:52,432
Can I go to your place?

308
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,552
There's a cafe opposite.

309
00:12:00,072 --> 00:12:00,831
Let's talk there.

310
00:12:02,072 --> 00:12:02,711
Alright.

311
00:12:02,831 --> 00:12:03,952
No need for cafe.

312
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:04,552
What a waste.

313
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:04,991
Let's go.

314
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:05,751
We can talk

315
00:12:05,751 --> 00:12:07,111
in your place.

316
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:16,312
Yan.

317
00:12:24,072 --> 00:12:24,831
Your boyfriend?

318
00:12:31,032 --> 00:12:32,152
My future brother-in-law?

319
00:12:32,192 --> 00:12:32,711
Hi.

320
00:12:35,392 --> 00:12:35,952
This is...

321
00:12:35,952 --> 00:12:36,231
I'm...

322
00:12:36,231 --> 00:12:36,912
My cousin.

323
00:12:37,831 --> 00:12:38,552
She came to me.

324
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:41,392
Hello.

325
00:12:42,192 --> 00:12:43,672
I'm picking her up for dinner.

326
00:12:43,711 --> 00:12:44,511
Want to join us?

327
00:12:45,111 --> 00:12:46,111
She just arrived,

328
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:47,272
and is a bit tired.

329
00:12:47,511 --> 00:12:48,272
I'll find a hotel

330
00:12:48,312 --> 00:12:49,072
to settle her in.

331
00:12:49,552 --> 00:12:49,912
Alright.

332
00:12:50,672 --> 00:12:51,032
Alright.

333
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:53,991
We can only
go to the restaurant another day.

334
00:12:54,152 --> 00:12:54,552
Okay?

335
00:12:54,751 --> 00:12:54,991
Okay.

336
00:12:55,231 --> 00:12:56,072
Go home then.

337
00:12:57,032 --> 00:12:57,591
I'll call you

338
00:12:57,792 --> 00:12:58,871
when I get home.

339
00:13:02,751 --> 00:13:03,152
Go.

340
00:13:04,272 --> 00:13:04,991
Bye then.

341
00:13:06,591 --> 00:13:07,072
Be careful.

342
00:13:07,192 --> 00:13:07,991
Drive safely.

343
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,552
The place is great
with convenient transportation.

344
00:13:36,511 --> 00:13:38,552
Qiao Yan. Why did you say
I'm your cousin?

345
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:41,792
There's a refrigerator.
A convenience store is nearby.

346
00:13:42,831 --> 00:13:43,711
I can see it now.

347
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:44,792
Your boyfriend

348
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,672
is well-off,

349
00:13:45,751 --> 00:13:46,591
so you look down on

350
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:47,511
me, a loser,

351
00:13:47,511 --> 00:13:47,912
right?

352
00:13:48,152 --> 00:13:48,871
Go back soon.

353
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:50,591
What do you mean?

354
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:53,231
You canceled the wedding,

355
00:13:53,392 --> 00:13:54,552
and didn't tell our parents.

356
00:13:55,272 --> 00:13:56,392
They'll search for you.

357
00:13:57,672 --> 00:13:57,991
Right.

358
00:13:58,432 --> 00:13:59,392
After I get settled,

359
00:13:59,432 --> 00:14:00,392
I'll tell them then.

360
00:14:00,432 --> 00:14:01,072
It's the same.

361
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:02,751
Wait, get back to the point.

362
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:03,392
I'm asking you

363
00:14:03,511 --> 00:14:04,991
why you didn't tell your boyfriend

364
00:14:05,072 --> 00:14:06,312
I'm your elder sister.

365
00:14:22,231 --> 00:14:24,111
Grandma and I share
a household registration.

366
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:25,432
My surname is Xu,

367
00:14:26,351 --> 00:14:27,152
not Qiao.

368
00:14:28,032 --> 00:14:28,711
So,

369
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:29,471
you should know

370
00:14:30,312 --> 00:14:31,072
my only family

371
00:14:31,351 --> 00:14:31,991
is Grandma.

372
00:14:34,272 --> 00:14:34,631
Right.

373
00:14:35,511 --> 00:14:36,552
I know you've never been

374
00:14:36,591 --> 00:14:37,751
close with our parents.

375
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,111
But I never thought

376
00:14:39,192 --> 00:14:39,912
we weren't family.

377
00:14:39,952 --> 00:14:40,672
Only you think so.

378
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:49,631
Qiao Lin.

379
00:14:50,072 --> 00:14:51,272
You came here

380
00:14:51,312 --> 00:14:52,111
without telling me.

381
00:14:53,231 --> 00:14:54,432
What I've done for you

382
00:14:55,952 --> 00:14:57,351
is already more than enough.

383
00:14:57,471 --> 00:14:58,312
Go home after running

384
00:14:58,511 --> 00:14:59,432
out of money.

385
00:14:59,912 --> 00:15:00,871
Don't make them worry.

386
00:15:03,072 --> 00:15:04,432
You can stay if you want,

387
00:15:07,111 --> 00:15:09,272
but I'm not obligated

388
00:15:09,312 --> 00:15:10,231
to take care of you.

389
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:12,711
Qiao Yan.

390
00:15:12,952 --> 00:15:13,991
Had I known it,

391
00:15:14,032 --> 00:15:14,591
I would've

392
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:15,432
never come to you.

393
00:15:15,432 --> 00:15:15,912
Understand?

394
00:15:21,751 --> 00:15:22,552
My surname is Xu.

395
00:15:23,392 --> 00:15:24,032
Xu Yan.

396
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,032
You are Qiao Yan.

397
00:15:29,111 --> 00:15:30,272
You are Qiao Yan! Qiao...

398
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,034
(Transfer to Qiao Lin)

399
00:15:51,312 --> 00:15:52,831
(The price of your heartlessness.)

400
00:16:21,751 --> 00:16:22,471
So heartless!

401
00:16:24,152 --> 00:16:25,792
I shouldn't have saved you back then!

402
00:16:31,192 --> 00:16:33,552
- Wild child!
- Wild child!

403
00:16:33,631 --> 00:16:34,792
Wild child.

404
00:16:34,871 --> 00:16:36,152
Wild child!

405
00:16:36,312 --> 00:16:37,312
- Wild child!
- Wild child!

406
00:16:37,351 --> 00:16:39,432
Move! Let me go home!

407
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:42,591
Qiao Yan, unwanted one.

408
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,351
Wild child, without parents!

409
00:16:48,672 --> 00:16:51,032
How dare you push me?

410
00:16:52,152 --> 00:16:53,552
None of your business!

411
00:16:54,672 --> 00:16:56,032
Who dares bully my sister?

412
00:16:57,591 --> 00:16:58,312
Do you dare?

413
00:16:58,912 --> 00:17:00,511
- No.
- No.

414
00:17:05,152 --> 00:17:06,432
You're my sister now.

415
00:17:11,592 --> 00:17:12,271
Yan is old enough

416
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:13,632
to start elementary school,

417
00:17:14,912 --> 00:17:16,471
and she must start studying.

418
00:17:17,231 --> 00:17:18,991
You must find her

419
00:17:19,031 --> 00:17:20,311
a primary school in the county.

420
00:17:21,031 --> 00:17:21,912
All these years,

421
00:17:22,672 --> 00:17:23,832
as parents,

422
00:17:24,352 --> 00:17:25,471
you've never fulfilled

423
00:17:25,551 --> 00:17:26,592
your responsibilities.

424
00:17:28,952 --> 00:17:31,832
But regarding the school enrollment,

425
00:17:32,311 --> 00:17:33,071
both of you must

426
00:17:33,112 --> 00:17:34,271
make every effort

427
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,432
to make it right.

428
00:17:36,832 --> 00:17:38,112
Right, Mom.

429
00:17:38,751 --> 00:17:39,672
We came here

430
00:17:39,872 --> 00:17:42,352
to take Yan back
for attending the school.

431
00:17:42,672 --> 00:17:43,632
All these years,

432
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:45,751
you've been raising her alone,

433
00:17:46,592 --> 00:17:47,912
and it's been hard.

434
00:17:48,112 --> 00:17:48,751
Enough!

435
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:49,991
Save your sweet talk.

436
00:17:50,271 --> 00:17:51,071
Do you even know

437
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:52,471
what Yan tells

438
00:17:52,511 --> 00:17:53,192
the neighborhood

439
00:17:53,352 --> 00:17:54,352
and kids?

440
00:17:55,471 --> 00:17:56,592
She says her parents

441
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:57,751
are abroad.

442
00:17:58,112 --> 00:17:59,471
How did such a young child

443
00:17:59,592 --> 00:18:01,231
learn to lie?

444
00:18:03,231 --> 00:18:04,791
After having Lin,

445
00:18:04,832 --> 00:18:06,751
you insisted on trying for a boy.

446
00:18:07,271 --> 00:18:08,352
You knew perfectly well

447
00:18:08,632 --> 00:18:09,991
Yazhen has poor health.

448
00:18:10,551 --> 00:18:11,152
These years

449
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,592
her health is completely ruined.

450
00:18:14,872 --> 00:18:16,192
Now you've got a girl,

451
00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:17,511
with congenital heart disease,

452
00:18:17,952 --> 00:18:19,432
and you don't like her.

453
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:20,791
Won't you even

454
00:18:20,832 --> 00:18:21,632
save her life?

455
00:18:22,112 --> 00:18:23,231
As parents,

456
00:18:23,471 --> 00:18:25,271
don't you feel any guilt?

457
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:28,672
Mom.

458
00:18:29,912 --> 00:18:30,392
Mom.

459
00:18:30,432 --> 00:18:31,751
We know we were wrong.

460
00:18:32,592 --> 00:18:33,952
We will treat Yan well

461
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:34,991
and make it up for her

462
00:18:35,872 --> 00:18:37,872
after taking her back.

463
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:38,511
Mom.

464
00:18:47,672 --> 00:18:48,392
Be careful.

465
00:18:49,511 --> 00:18:49,991
Alright.

466
00:18:50,071 --> 00:18:50,592
We're home.

467
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,912
Come in.

468
00:18:53,392 --> 00:18:54,912
This is Mom and Dad's home.

469
00:18:55,112 --> 00:18:56,511
From now on, it's yours too.

470
00:18:57,271 --> 00:18:57,952
From today on,

471
00:18:57,991 --> 00:18:58,791
share this room

472
00:18:58,832 --> 00:18:59,791
with your elder sister.

473
00:18:59,991 --> 00:19:00,632
Okay?

474
00:19:01,192 --> 00:19:02,231
I will bring in

475
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,071
your luggage.

476
00:19:07,352 --> 00:19:08,751
I packed these pretty clothes

477
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,071
for you.

478
00:19:11,432 --> 00:19:12,672
At Mom and Dad's place,

479
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:15,031
be sensible and obedient.

480
00:19:16,392 --> 00:19:17,471
Do things yourself

481
00:19:17,511 --> 00:19:18,592
whenever possible.

482
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:21,311
I also packed these things you like

483
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,791
for you.

484
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:27,311
At mealtimes,

485
00:19:27,632 --> 00:19:29,071
don't fight with your sister.

486
00:19:30,392 --> 00:19:30,952
Understand?

487
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,551
I will miss you.

488
00:19:46,672 --> 00:19:47,392
Take a look.

489
00:19:48,071 --> 00:19:49,231
This is your home now.

490
00:19:52,031 --> 00:19:53,071
Alright, it's late.

491
00:19:53,432 --> 00:19:54,751
Let's bathe and sleep.

492
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:55,912
Come on, I will bathe you.

493
00:19:56,471 --> 00:19:58,352
Mom, I can bathe myself.

494
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:01,872
Alright.

495
00:20:02,632 --> 00:20:03,872
You can bathe yourself.

496
00:20:04,231 --> 00:20:04,832
Then,

497
00:20:04,952 --> 00:20:05,872
take off the clothes

498
00:20:05,912 --> 00:20:07,031
and I will wash them. Okay?

499
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,711
Mom, I can wash my clothes.

500
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:04,711
Why is the smell of gas so strong?

501
00:21:14,311 --> 00:21:14,791
Lin!

502
00:21:15,991 --> 00:21:16,471
Lin!

503
00:21:18,872 --> 00:21:19,352
Lin!

504
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:29,751
Wake up! Don't scare me!

505
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:30,192
What?

506
00:21:30,192 --> 00:21:30,832
Help!

507
00:21:31,071 --> 00:21:31,872
Help! Help!

508
00:21:32,352 --> 00:21:33,071
What's going on?

509
00:21:33,071 --> 00:21:33,952
Gas poisoning!

510
00:21:34,152 --> 00:21:35,432
Lin, wake up!

511
00:21:35,672 --> 00:21:36,112
Lin!

512
00:21:36,751 --> 00:21:37,592
Call the ambulance!

513
00:21:37,592 --> 00:21:38,791
Okay, stay calm.

514
00:21:38,952 --> 00:21:39,392
Lin!

515
00:21:39,392 --> 00:21:40,751
Wake up! Wake up!

516
00:21:40,872 --> 00:21:42,311
Don't scare me.

517
00:21:42,311 --> 00:21:42,791
Lin.

518
00:21:43,271 --> 00:21:44,751
Wake up, wake up. Lin!

519
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:45,751
Lin!

520
00:21:46,031 --> 00:21:46,991
What's going on?

521
00:21:47,311 --> 00:21:47,791
Qiao?

522
00:21:47,832 --> 00:21:48,592
Lin has poisoned...

523
00:21:49,231 --> 00:21:50,192
Where have you been?

524
00:21:50,231 --> 00:21:51,672
You didn't turn off the gas.

525
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:52,392
Lin!

526
00:21:52,592 --> 00:21:53,551
Lin, are you okay?

527
00:21:53,592 --> 00:21:54,271
Stop shouting!

528
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,071
Go call an ambulance!

529
00:21:57,352 --> 00:21:57,872
Qiao!

530
00:21:58,432 --> 00:21:59,031
Where's Yan?

531
00:22:02,912 --> 00:22:03,432
Yan!

532
00:22:04,311 --> 00:22:05,271
Another one?

533
00:22:05,592 --> 00:22:06,152
Yan!

534
00:22:07,311 --> 00:22:07,872
Help out!

535
00:22:09,872 --> 00:22:10,991
It is all my fault.

536
00:22:11,311 --> 00:22:12,511
I'm so sorry.

537
00:22:12,672 --> 00:22:13,511
My daughter.

538
00:22:15,592 --> 00:22:16,031
Here.

539
00:22:17,231 --> 00:22:17,952
Have a banana.

540
00:22:18,551 --> 00:22:19,711
Let Dad feed you.

541
00:22:20,751 --> 00:22:21,632
Open your mouth.

542
00:22:22,271 --> 00:22:24,071
One more bite. A big bite.

543
00:22:24,112 --> 00:22:24,672
Come on.

544
00:22:28,511 --> 00:22:29,071
Good girl.

545
00:22:29,511 --> 00:22:30,551
I will make you

546
00:22:30,592 --> 00:22:31,872
your favorite braised pork.

547
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,711
Okay?

548
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,640
(Qiao Yan: 12 years old,
Qiao Lin: 14 years old)

549
00:22:47,352 --> 00:22:47,872
Yan!

550
00:22:48,152 --> 00:22:48,952
Perfect timing.

551
00:22:49,152 --> 00:22:50,551
Lin got into a fight.

552
00:22:50,711 --> 00:22:51,711
We need to go there.

553
00:22:52,031 --> 00:22:53,152
You can have instant noodles.

554
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,071
Qiao, hurry up!

555
00:22:57,311 --> 00:23:00,991
(Happy birthday)
♪Happy birthday to you♪

556
00:23:01,872 --> 00:23:05,432
♪Happy birthday to you♪

557
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:09,112
♪Happy birthday♪

558
00:23:14,112 --> 00:23:15,751
Yan? Is that you?

559
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,471
Happy birthday.

560
00:23:17,912 --> 00:23:19,071
Grandma.

561
00:23:22,711 --> 00:23:24,392
Alright, don't cry.

562
00:23:24,991 --> 00:23:25,751
Come to my place.

563
00:23:25,991 --> 00:23:27,271
I'll make you delicious food.

564
00:23:27,872 --> 00:23:28,551
Okay?

565
00:23:37,952 --> 00:23:38,711
You are

566
00:23:39,112 --> 00:23:40,872
always getting into fights.

567
00:23:41,271 --> 00:23:42,711
You even fought with a boy!

568
00:23:45,432 --> 00:23:46,471
That's your classmate.

569
00:23:46,511 --> 00:23:47,872
What if you hurt him?

570
00:23:48,672 --> 00:23:49,112
See?

571
00:23:49,231 --> 00:23:49,952
The teacher

572
00:23:49,991 --> 00:23:50,912
always calls us in

573
00:23:51,432 --> 00:23:52,311
to apologize.

574
00:23:52,352 --> 00:23:52,952
Keep quiet.

575
00:23:53,751 --> 00:23:54,311
She's asleep.

576
00:23:55,672 --> 00:23:56,551
Compensate them,

577
00:23:56,952 --> 00:23:58,112
treat them meals,

578
00:23:58,912 --> 00:23:59,952
(Mom, Dad, I'm going to bed.)
and apologize!

579
00:23:59,952 --> 00:24:00,976
(I've eaten. Don't worry.)

580
00:24:01,152 --> 00:24:01,791
See?

581
00:24:02,271 --> 00:24:03,192
Yan is well-behaved.

582
00:24:03,471 --> 00:24:03,991
But you

583
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:05,432
spend all day fighting,

584
00:24:05,551 --> 00:24:06,711
not giving us a break.

585
00:24:06,872 --> 00:24:08,271
Mom, I'm hungry.

586
00:24:08,471 --> 00:24:09,071
Alright.

587
00:24:09,112 --> 00:24:09,872
You're hungry.

588
00:24:10,071 --> 00:24:11,311
We're busy apologizing,

589
00:24:11,471 --> 00:24:12,392
and haven't eaten.

590
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:13,231
Here.

591
00:24:13,392 --> 00:24:14,311
I'll reheat this.

592
00:24:15,031 --> 00:24:15,471
Come here.

593
00:24:15,551 --> 00:24:16,711
What do you want? Noodles?

594
00:24:16,751 --> 00:24:17,271
Okay.

595
00:24:17,471 --> 00:24:17,991
I'm hungry.

596
00:24:17,991 --> 00:24:18,471
Take a bath.

597
00:24:18,471 --> 00:24:18,791
Mom.

598
00:24:18,912 --> 00:24:19,711
Eat after your bath.

599
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:20,672
I'm hungry.

600
00:24:24,592 --> 00:24:25,231
Bathe yourself.

601
00:24:26,912 --> 00:24:28,432
I need to wash these clothes.

602
00:24:28,471 --> 00:24:29,632
You need them tomorrow.

603
00:24:34,231 --> 00:24:35,112
Wrap yourself up.

604
00:24:35,152 --> 00:24:35,991
Don't catch a cold.

605
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:47,152
(Qiao Yan: 18 years old)
Qiao Yan obtained great scores

606
00:24:47,271 --> 00:24:48,392
(Qiao Lin: 20 years old)
in recent mock exams.

607
00:24:48,592 --> 00:24:50,031
She's ranked top 30 in her grade.

608
00:24:50,551 --> 00:24:52,271
She can get into a top college
in Jingzhou.

609
00:24:53,031 --> 00:24:54,432
As for the major,

610
00:24:54,551 --> 00:24:55,071
you should

611
00:24:55,071 --> 00:24:56,231
discuss it with her,

612
00:24:56,632 --> 00:24:57,751
and guide her.

613
00:25:01,912 --> 00:25:03,311
She can obtain

614
00:25:03,352 --> 00:25:04,352
such outstanding results,

615
00:25:04,751 --> 00:25:07,192
thanks to your dedicated guidance.

616
00:25:08,551 --> 00:25:11,912
But, she won't attend
the college entrance exam.

617
00:25:12,352 --> 00:25:13,912
We have other plans for her.

618
00:25:14,592 --> 00:25:15,912
What?

619
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:18,751
Given her academic performance,

620
00:25:19,511 --> 00:25:20,751
it would be a pity.

621
00:25:21,551 --> 00:25:22,112
Have you

622
00:25:22,352 --> 00:25:23,471
discussed this with her?

623
00:25:24,192 --> 00:25:25,112
What does she think?

624
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:28,432
A child can't understand

625
00:25:28,471 --> 00:25:29,551
our family's hardships.

626
00:25:30,832 --> 00:25:31,632
I can decide this

627
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:32,991
for her.

628
00:25:35,271 --> 00:25:36,991
Why forbid me from attending the exam?

629
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:40,832
I'm talking with your teacher.

630
00:25:40,952 --> 00:25:41,551
Why forbid me

631
00:25:41,592 --> 00:25:43,152
from attending the exam?

632
00:25:47,271 --> 00:25:48,271
Because I'm your dad!

633
00:25:48,751 --> 00:25:50,071
I'm the head of our family!

634
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:54,071
Sorry, Miss.

635
00:25:54,112 --> 00:25:54,551
Sorry

636
00:25:54,551 --> 00:25:55,511
for the embarrassment.

637
00:25:56,952 --> 00:25:58,152
This decision is final.

638
00:25:58,872 --> 00:25:59,432
Go home.

639
00:26:06,592 --> 00:26:08,791
Why won't you let me attend the college?

640
00:26:08,832 --> 00:26:09,511
Dad!

641
00:26:10,592 --> 00:26:13,511
Why won't you let me attend the college?

642
00:26:17,751 --> 00:26:19,192
Dad, wait for me!

643
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:20,751
Wait!

644
00:26:22,711 --> 00:26:24,432
Wait!

645
00:26:24,632 --> 00:26:26,511
Wait for me!

646
00:26:31,271 --> 00:26:32,711
Why?

647
00:26:32,872 --> 00:26:33,791
Why?

648
00:26:33,952 --> 00:26:35,192
Why?

649
00:26:35,952 --> 00:26:36,912
Why?

650
00:26:37,912 --> 00:26:39,152
Because we're poor.

651
00:26:39,592 --> 00:26:40,952
Because the expenses

652
00:26:41,031 --> 00:26:41,872
for college are high,

653
00:26:42,112 --> 00:26:42,991
and we can't support

654
00:26:42,991 --> 00:26:44,112
two college students.

655
00:26:44,471 --> 00:26:45,432
So we choose

656
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:47,071
to let Lin go to college.

657
00:26:48,832 --> 00:26:50,231
Dad, what about me?

658
00:26:52,392 --> 00:26:53,711
What about me?

659
00:26:56,912 --> 00:26:58,271
After you finish high school,

660
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:01,672
we'll help you find a job.

661
00:27:02,392 --> 00:27:04,392
This way, you can stay with us.

662
00:27:04,432 --> 00:27:06,672
And we can take care of you.

663
00:27:07,952 --> 00:27:08,471
Wait.

664
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:09,672
I...

665
00:27:10,392 --> 00:27:11,632
I want to know why...

666
00:27:14,231 --> 00:27:16,311
Why have you always been

667
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,991
so biased all the time?

668
00:27:21,952 --> 00:27:25,471
Why does Qiao Lin
get all the good things?

669
00:27:26,471 --> 00:27:27,271
Am I...

670
00:27:27,311 --> 00:27:29,632
Am I not your biological child?

671
00:27:31,791 --> 00:27:34,711
Why do you always make me feel

672
00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:37,192
that you don't love me?

673
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:43,031
I thought if I kept lying to myself

674
00:27:43,231 --> 00:27:45,471
and kept studying hard,

675
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:46,632
behaving well,

676
00:27:46,672 --> 00:27:47,952
and listening to you,

677
00:27:48,031 --> 00:27:50,152
you'd finally love me.

678
00:27:51,592 --> 00:27:55,551
Why can't I keep lying to myself now?

679
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:55,991
What...

680
00:27:57,352 --> 00:27:59,432
What have I ever wronged you?

681
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,952
We've provided you

682
00:28:01,311 --> 00:28:03,392
everything you needed,

683
00:28:04,071 --> 00:28:06,112
so why can't you be considerate?

684
00:28:06,192 --> 00:28:07,991
You forbid me from attending the college

685
00:28:08,071 --> 00:28:10,311
without consulting me!

686
00:28:11,832 --> 00:28:13,711
What you're doing is theft!

687
00:28:14,432 --> 00:28:15,872
What you're doing is robbery!

688
00:28:15,872 --> 00:28:17,751
How dare you speak
to your dad like this!

689
00:28:18,112 --> 00:28:19,152
So outrageous!

690
00:28:19,952 --> 00:28:22,912
You will only be an ungrateful child

691
00:28:23,031 --> 00:28:24,352
even with a college degree!

692
00:28:25,432 --> 00:28:27,592
How horrible am I?

693
00:28:31,432 --> 00:28:34,311
What terrible thing have I done?

694
00:28:36,231 --> 00:28:37,832
I don't understand.

695
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:41,592
I don't understand

696
00:28:41,672 --> 00:28:45,711
why you have to prove

697
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,551
how much you don't love me.

698
00:28:48,952 --> 00:28:50,112
Why?

699
00:28:50,392 --> 00:28:52,912
Why do I have to be your daughter?

700
00:30:01,832 --> 00:30:02,751
Grandma.

701
00:30:05,751 --> 00:30:06,551
Grandma.

702
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:07,471
Coming.

703
00:30:10,311 --> 00:30:10,991
Yan.

704
00:30:11,872 --> 00:30:12,271
You...

705
00:30:13,031 --> 00:30:13,592
Grandma.

706
00:30:17,511 --> 00:30:18,352
I know

707
00:30:18,832 --> 00:30:19,952
you've been wronged.

708
00:30:23,192 --> 00:30:25,952
Look, you're all wet.

709
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,929
(Incoming call from Shen Haoming)

710
00:31:08,912 --> 00:31:09,751
Hello, Haoming.

711
00:31:10,632 --> 00:31:14,192
- What are you doing?
- I'm on my way home.

712
00:31:15,352 --> 00:31:17,632
Can you come to my studio?

713
00:31:18,832 --> 00:31:19,471
Now?

714
00:31:20,152 --> 00:31:20,551
Yes.

715
00:31:20,872 --> 00:31:21,271
Hurry.

716
00:31:21,751 --> 00:31:22,231
Okay.

717
00:31:27,271 --> 00:31:28,511
Change the address, please.

718
00:31:37,952 --> 00:31:38,511
What's wrong?

719
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:48,192
A flower stalk has grown?

720
00:31:52,432 --> 00:31:53,711
This plant is sixty years old.

721
00:31:55,112 --> 00:31:56,071
I think

722
00:31:56,511 --> 00:31:57,432
tonight

723
00:31:57,592 --> 00:31:58,511
it will bloom.

724
00:32:00,432 --> 00:32:02,031
If it does bloom,

725
00:32:03,112 --> 00:32:04,832
this will undoubtedly be

726
00:32:04,872 --> 00:32:05,991
its most glorious moment.

727
00:32:06,952 --> 00:32:08,551
I want to witness this with you.

728
00:32:14,672 --> 00:32:16,672
I remember you once mentioned

729
00:32:17,672 --> 00:32:21,031
the agave only blooms
once in its lifetime.

730
00:32:22,912 --> 00:32:25,192
So after blooming,

731
00:32:26,832 --> 00:32:27,632
it will die.

732
00:32:31,592 --> 00:32:32,592
After blooming,

733
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:36,031
it will wither rapidly

734
00:32:37,672 --> 00:32:38,592
and drain

735
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,432
until

736
00:32:41,112 --> 00:32:41,872
returning to dust.

737
00:32:43,832 --> 00:32:45,311
It has exhausted all the nutrients

738
00:32:45,432 --> 00:32:46,872
throughout its life

739
00:32:48,672 --> 00:32:49,832
and endured hardship

740
00:32:51,632 --> 00:32:53,551
just for this moment to bloom.

741
00:32:55,471 --> 00:32:56,311
This is truly

742
00:32:56,311 --> 00:32:57,311
its swan song.

743
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:05,711
What's wrong?

744
00:33:08,031 --> 00:33:09,231
I just feel

745
00:33:11,112 --> 00:33:12,392
it is pitiful.

746
00:33:14,832 --> 00:33:16,952
Its whole life
is spent battling hardships,

747
00:33:16,991 --> 00:33:17,952
and growing tenaciously,

748
00:33:18,471 --> 00:33:20,031
just for a single moment to bloom.

749
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,071
Because it has no choice.

750
00:33:28,471 --> 00:33:29,392
It must

751
00:33:29,432 --> 00:33:30,632
stay stronger,

752
00:33:30,832 --> 00:33:31,551
work harder,

753
00:33:32,231 --> 00:33:33,152
and endure more

754
00:33:34,952 --> 00:33:36,071
than others to achieve

755
00:33:36,152 --> 00:33:37,112
their beautiful endings.

756
00:33:38,031 --> 00:33:39,192
Waiting for long

757
00:33:40,071 --> 00:33:41,912
and suffering the torment

758
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:43,791
are all the price it pays.

759
00:33:56,711 --> 00:33:58,192
Blossoming, fruiting,

760
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:01,672
aging, and being reborn

761
00:34:02,952 --> 00:34:03,952
happen in cycles.

762
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:05,751
This is the law of nature.

763
00:34:07,551 --> 00:34:09,591
But when each agave

764
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:10,671
blooms,

765
00:34:11,432 --> 00:34:12,111
its pollen

766
00:34:12,191 --> 00:34:13,912
scatters around,

767
00:34:15,151 --> 00:34:16,712
and meets another agave.

768
00:34:18,232 --> 00:34:19,631
They cross-pollinate

769
00:34:19,832 --> 00:34:21,752
and produce more seeds.

770
00:34:23,031 --> 00:34:24,031
These seeds

771
00:34:24,671 --> 00:34:25,511
become

772
00:34:25,511 --> 00:34:26,432
their legacy

773
00:34:26,872 --> 00:34:27,952
in this world,

774
00:34:28,872 --> 00:34:30,031
just like humans.

775
00:34:32,151 --> 00:34:32,792
Meeting,

776
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:34,111
loving,

777
00:34:35,432 --> 00:34:36,912
marrying, and having children.

778
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:39,832
A century later,

779
00:34:41,272 --> 00:34:41,952
though the people

780
00:34:41,991 --> 00:34:42,991
may be gone,

781
00:34:44,511 --> 00:34:46,272
their love endures.

782
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:54,191
When two agaves meet,

783
00:34:55,712 --> 00:34:56,872
they do everything

784
00:34:59,392 --> 00:35:00,551
for each other,

785
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:02,712
even at the cost of their lives.

786
00:35:03,712 --> 00:35:04,912
Because they know

787
00:35:05,232 --> 00:35:05,952
their love

788
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:07,912
is worth it.

789
00:35:08,792 --> 00:35:09,872
They never regret it.

790
00:35:10,671 --> 00:35:11,591
Just like you and me.

791
00:35:12,312 --> 00:35:13,272
Meeting you

792
00:35:15,752 --> 00:35:16,872
and being with you.

793
00:35:18,752 --> 00:35:19,631
No matter what price

794
00:35:19,671 --> 00:35:20,671
I must pay,

795
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:24,272
I will never

796
00:35:26,471 --> 00:35:27,471
regret it.

797
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:31,272
And you?

798
00:35:33,551 --> 00:35:34,752
Think it carefully.

799
00:35:36,352 --> 00:35:37,912
I do regret...

800
00:35:43,511 --> 00:35:44,912
I regret getting married next month.

801
00:35:45,832 --> 00:35:47,912
I should've married you earlier.
