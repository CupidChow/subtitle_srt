(Leave me alone!)

33
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:08,348
Right.

34
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:09,909
You've never

35
00:02:10,549 --> 00:02:11,868
mentioned you had a cousin.

36
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,348
Should we invite her to our wedding?

37
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:17,468
She's a distant relative.

38
00:02:17,628 --> 00:02:18,708
We weren't so close.

39
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:19,748
Never mind.

40
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,468
Alright.

41
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:25,669
Your call.

42
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:29,389
Here.

43
00:02:39,468 --> 00:02:41,188
I moved out.

44
00:02:42,468 --> 00:02:43,748
Here's...

45
00:02:45,148 --> 00:02:46,748
(I moved out and canceled the hotel.)

46
00:02:47,148 --> 00:02:47,949
(Here's the money.)

47
00:02:52,868 --> 00:02:55,109
What else do I need?

48
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:01,069
Can't you take a hint?

49
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:02,989
Bad sister! Bad Xu Yan!

50
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:04,468
I'm done with you.

51
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:10,349
(Lin, I'm sorry.)

52
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:20,389
(I shouldn't have
let my parents scold you.)

53
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:21,588
(Come back, please?)

54
00:03:21,628 --> 00:03:22,069
Get lost.

55
00:03:24,428 --> 00:03:24,868
(Get lost.)

56
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,308
Tao.

57
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:37,868
You're here for Lin?

58
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:40,588
She's on a business trip to Jingzhou.

59
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:41,468
Jingzhou?

60
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:43,628
Didn't she tell you?

61
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:45,349
Qiao.

62
00:03:45,868 --> 00:03:46,509
Qiao.

63
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:48,028
Come on, Tao's here.

64
00:03:48,148 --> 00:03:48,789
Look.

65
00:03:49,148 --> 00:03:50,308
Hello, Tao.

66
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:51,000
Mr. Qiao.

67
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:52,028
Perfect.

68
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:53,349
We don't have much work.

69
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:55,588
Let's go for a drink somewhere.

70
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:57,069
- Mr. Qiao...
- Drink with him.

71
00:03:59,628 --> 00:04:01,349
Didn't Qiao Lin tell you anything

72
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,628
before she left for Jingzhou?

73
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:05,669
Did she?

74
00:04:05,908 --> 00:04:07,269
Nothing at all.

75
00:04:07,628 --> 00:04:08,829
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

76
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:09,949
Well.

77
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:13,468
We've...

78
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:16,148
broken up.

79
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:17,868
What?

80
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:19,069
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:19,188 --> 00:04:21,588
The number you dialed is unavailable.

82
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:22,989
Please try again later.

83
00:04:24,109 --> 00:04:24,708
Well?

84
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:25,752
Can't get through.

85
00:04:26,828 --> 00:04:27,789
She...

86
00:04:27,948 --> 00:04:28,989
She didn't even tell us

87
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,268
about breaking up.

88
00:04:30,388 --> 00:04:31,669
Is she avoiding us?

89
00:04:32,149 --> 00:04:33,068
No way.

90
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:35,188
Didn't she say she went to
Jingzhou for training?

91
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:36,669
Jingzhou?

92
00:04:36,868 --> 00:04:38,589
I'll call Qiao Yan right now.

93
00:04:38,589 --> 00:04:39,188
Yeah.

94
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:43,109
We'll try the clothes later.

95
00:04:43,308 --> 00:04:44,628
I've visited this store.

96
00:04:45,068 --> 00:04:46,508
Try these. Nothing else.

97
00:04:48,948 --> 00:04:50,469
Remember. Stay quiet.

98
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:51,828
Be polite.

99
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,748
After that,

100
00:04:53,948 --> 00:04:55,109
Haoming's parents

101
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,989
might come home with us.

102
00:04:57,508 --> 00:04:58,268
Once we're back,

103
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:00,989
tell them you have to meet some friends.

104
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:01,948
Got it.

105
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:05,268
So pretty.

106
00:05:07,493 --> 00:05:09,208
(Incoming call from Qiao Jianbin)

107
00:05:10,828 --> 00:05:11,709
Someone's calling.

108
00:05:24,068 --> 00:05:25,909
Sorry, the number you dialed...

109
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:27,589
- Well?
- She's not answering.

110
00:05:28,948 --> 00:05:29,349
This...

111
00:05:29,989 --> 00:05:30,628
Forget it.

112
00:05:31,149 --> 00:05:33,068
I'll book tickets to Jingzhou now.

113
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:34,868
Ask your mom

114
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:36,349
where Qiao Yan lives.

115
00:05:36,428 --> 00:05:37,388
Let's do it now.

116
00:05:37,868 --> 00:05:38,469
Okay.

117
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:44,589
Is this the place?

118
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:45,508
So many buildings.

119
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:46,589
Which one exactly?

120
00:05:46,748 --> 00:05:47,789
How would I know?

121
00:05:47,868 --> 00:05:49,669
This address is from two years ago.

122
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:50,868
How should I know?

123
00:05:50,989 --> 00:05:51,709
W-What a mess.

124
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:53,109
Let's try calling Yan again.

125
00:05:53,109 --> 00:05:54,229
She's not answering.

126
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,508
Try it one more time.

127
00:05:55,508 --> 00:05:56,469
Fine, I'll try again.

128
00:05:58,308 --> 00:06:00,508
We just tried on so many dresses.

129
00:06:01,748 --> 00:06:03,029
They all look great.

130
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:05,989
In the end, it's about
the style you like.

131
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:07,789
Ms. Yu,

132
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:08,989
any advice?

133
00:06:10,424 --> 00:06:11,709
For traditional Chinese style,

134
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:13,508
the Zhou-style Hanfu
with phoenix coronet

135
00:06:13,508 --> 00:06:14,789
and embroidered cape

136
00:06:15,188 --> 00:06:16,308
has majestic patterns

137
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:17,469
and suits you well.

138
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:18,669
And it's said

139
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:20,669
to bring fortune to the bride.

140
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:22,229
For Western style,

141
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:23,748
take the last wedding dress

142
00:06:23,868 --> 00:06:25,589
you tried with a very long train.

143
00:06:26,188 --> 00:06:28,109
It looks elegant and graceful.

144
00:06:28,828 --> 00:06:29,909
Check over there.

145
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:31,508
Don't rush.

146
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:36,469
In the end, it's about what you prefer.

147
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:37,709
Qiao Yan.

148
00:06:39,388 --> 00:06:39,989
Yan.

149
00:06:41,508 --> 00:06:42,349
Yan, what's wrong?

150
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:44,748
- Qiao Yan.
- Yan.

151
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:56,549
Qiao Yan?

152
00:06:57,229 --> 00:06:58,868
A-Aren't you Xu Yan?

153
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:02,109
Who are you?

154
00:07:02,428 --> 00:07:03,628
We're her parents.

155
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:08,909
You're her parents?

156
00:07:08,989 --> 00:07:11,188
Then who are they?

157
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:12,828
Tell us.

158
00:07:13,109 --> 00:07:13,989
Who are they?

159
00:07:14,948 --> 00:07:15,508
Xu Yan.

160
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:18,428
Explain this right now.

161
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:19,428
Ms. Yu,

162
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:21,469
please let me explain.

163
00:07:21,948 --> 00:07:22,628
I see.

164
00:07:23,628 --> 00:07:24,709
Your name is fake.

165
00:07:25,109 --> 00:07:26,709
Your family background is fake.

166
00:07:26,868 --> 00:07:28,109
So are your parents, huh?

167
00:07:28,828 --> 00:07:29,428
Tell me.

168
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:30,748
How many more secrets

169
00:07:30,828 --> 00:07:31,948
are you hiding?

170
00:07:32,628 --> 00:07:34,029
We treated you with sincerity,

171
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:36,469
yet you've fooled our entire family.

172
00:07:36,828 --> 00:07:37,948
Why are you so manipulative?

173
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:38,989
This is fraud.

174
00:07:39,109 --> 00:07:39,709
Marriage fraud.

175
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:42,469
This is fraud. Marriage fraud.

176
00:07:42,948 --> 00:07:43,428
Qiao Yan.

177
00:07:43,628 --> 00:07:44,748
What have you done?

178
00:07:45,828 --> 00:07:47,149
What's wrong with you?

179
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:48,149
Yan.

180
00:07:48,508 --> 00:07:49,789
I'm so disappointed in you.

181
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:51,589
Stop pestering my son.

182
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:54,109
You've gone too far.

183
00:07:55,388 --> 00:07:56,120
Haoming, let's go.

184
00:07:58,789 --> 00:07:59,709
We're done.

185
00:07:59,868 --> 00:08:00,428
Haoming.

186
00:08:00,868 --> 00:08:01,628
Don't pester me.

187
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:07,029
Hurry up.

188
00:08:08,549 --> 00:08:09,229
Don't go.

189
00:08:12,748 --> 00:08:13,388
Haoming.

190
00:08:18,868 --> 00:08:19,428
Yan.

191
00:08:20,068 --> 00:08:20,669
Yan.

192
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:22,109
"Don't go?"

193
00:08:23,388 --> 00:08:24,868
What's wrong? You seem distracted.

194
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:27,628
I forgot.

195
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:29,709
Why are you so jumpy today?

196
00:08:30,068 --> 00:08:32,589
Third Uncle's flight arrives today.

197
00:08:33,308 --> 00:08:34,149
What time?

198
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:34,948
Five o'clock.

199
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,789
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

200
00:08:36,828 --> 00:08:37,388
Sorry.

201
00:08:37,388 --> 00:08:37,868
I forgot.

202
00:08:38,109 --> 00:08:38,549
Sorry.

203
00:08:38,628 --> 00:08:40,109
We won't come up then.

204
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:40,508
Okay?

205
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:42,109
We need to pick up my brother.

206
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,069
Qiao Yan.

207
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:46,069
It's fine.

208
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:47,148
I'm so sorry.

209
00:08:47,349 --> 00:08:48,189
Let's hurry then.

210
00:08:48,189 --> 00:08:48,589
Hurry up.

211
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:48,989
Okay.

212
00:08:49,148 --> 00:08:49,748
I'm so sorry.

213
00:08:49,748 --> 00:08:50,268
No problem.

214
00:08:50,388 --> 00:08:51,628
Yan, walk them out.

215
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:52,388
Let's go.

216
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:53,748
Okay.

217
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:55,189
Let's go.

218
00:08:56,229 --> 00:08:57,069
What's going on?

219
00:08:57,229 --> 00:08:58,628
Let's walk them out.

220
00:08:58,628 --> 00:08:59,788
What's going on here?

221
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:01,069
Ms. Yu.

222
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:03,268
I'll pick you up for dinner tomorrow.

223
00:09:03,548 --> 00:09:04,989
I'll call you after work.

224
00:09:05,748 --> 00:09:06,189
Alright.

225
00:09:08,989 --> 00:09:09,709
Mr. Xu, Mrs. Xu.

226
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:10,268
I have to go.

227
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:10,709
Okay.

228
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:11,829
Bye.

229
00:09:16,148 --> 00:09:16,829
Bye.

230
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:20,829
Qiao Yan.

231
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:22,788
- Qiao Yan.
- Yan.

232
00:09:23,668 --> 00:09:25,868
That was Mr. Shen

233
00:09:25,989 --> 00:09:27,268
from Jinda Group, right?

234
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:28,388
How do you know him?

235
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:31,148
Who was that young man?

236
00:09:35,229 --> 00:09:36,309
You two are...?

237
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:37,989
We're her parents.

238
00:09:38,189 --> 00:09:39,028
You are...?

239
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:44,628
We're from the wedding planning company.

240
00:09:46,349 --> 00:09:47,429
Congratulations.

241
00:09:47,668 --> 00:09:48,388
Congratulations.

242
00:09:48,508 --> 00:09:49,268
Those people

243
00:09:49,349 --> 00:09:51,788
are your future in-laws.

244
00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:54,868
Miss Xu.

245
00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:56,028
If there's nothing else,

246
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:57,709
Ms. Zhang and I will take our leave.

247
00:09:58,429 --> 00:09:59,309
You can transfer

248
00:09:59,429 --> 00:10:00,829
the remaining payment now.

249
00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:02,709
Feel free to contact us anytime.

250
00:10:03,748 --> 00:10:04,268
Let's go.

251
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:04,989
Okay, Mr. Gao.

252
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:06,589
Congratulations.

253
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:07,829
Bye.

254
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:08,388
Bye.

255
00:10:09,189 --> 00:10:09,668
Let's go.

256
00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:14,989
Yan, what is going on here?

257
00:10:19,788 --> 00:10:20,628
I'm getting married.

258
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:21,589
What...?

259
00:10:23,268 --> 00:10:24,028
Getting married?

260
00:10:24,408 --> 00:10:24,868
Wait.

261
00:10:25,229 --> 00:10:26,868
Y-You're getting married?

262
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:28,469
But I don't even know

263
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:30,229
who my future son-in-law is

264
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:31,508
or what he looks like.

265
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:33,508
This is ridiculous.

266
00:10:34,229 --> 00:10:35,748
Aren't you going to tell us

267
00:10:36,148 --> 00:10:37,628
before marrying someone?

268
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:40,229
Your sister broke off an engagement.

269
00:10:40,469 --> 00:10:41,548
You're getting married.

270
00:10:41,868 --> 00:10:43,349
Neither of you discussed with us.

271
00:10:43,469 --> 00:10:44,709
Are you ignoring us?

272
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:46,589
You don't need to overreact.

273
00:10:46,868 --> 00:10:48,589
It has nothing to do with you.

274
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:50,949
What?

275
00:10:53,268 --> 00:10:55,309
I'm not inviting you to my wedding.

276
00:10:56,429 --> 00:10:58,429
Grandma is my only family.

277
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:03,908
This is outrageous.

278
00:11:04,628 --> 00:11:05,628
Being in the big city

279
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,148
doesn't mean you can look down on us.

280
00:11:09,229 --> 00:11:09,868
Yan.

281
00:11:10,868 --> 00:11:12,829
You've hurt our feelings.

282
00:11:13,229 --> 00:11:14,989
After all, we're your parents.

283
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:16,189
So what?

284
00:11:21,989 --> 00:11:23,508
You'll never admit you're wrong.

285
00:11:24,469 --> 00:11:27,349
How can children judge their parents?

286
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:29,829
Fine.

287
00:11:30,628 --> 00:11:32,109
That young man is from

288
00:11:32,469 --> 00:11:33,908
the wealthy Shen family, huh?

289
00:11:34,469 --> 00:11:37,069
He was born with a silver spoon, huh?

290
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:38,429
Alright.

291
00:11:39,148 --> 00:11:40,788
We won't overreach.

292
00:11:41,469 --> 00:11:42,788
I won't go to your wedding

293
00:11:42,989 --> 00:11:44,668
even if you invite me.

294
00:11:45,109 --> 00:11:46,748
You're no longer my daughter.

295
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:48,949
Yazhen, let's go find Lin.

296
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:49,949
Got her address?

297
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:57,349
I'll send it to you.

298
00:12:03,109 --> 00:12:03,748
Jianbin.

299
00:12:07,469 --> 00:12:08,388
You finally picked up.

300
00:12:08,868 --> 00:12:10,668
I had to switch on my phone.

301
00:12:12,388 --> 00:12:13,208
Where do you live?

302
00:12:13,388 --> 00:12:14,229
Here.

303
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:17,628
How many bedrooms?

304
00:12:18,349 --> 00:12:19,229
Three.

305
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:22,109
You live alone in such a big apartment?

306
00:12:22,268 --> 00:12:22,748
No.

307
00:12:22,788 --> 00:12:23,229
Here.

308
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,748
I rented one of the rooms.

309
00:12:26,109 --> 00:12:27,388
The other two rooms

310
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:29,589
are rented by two other girls.

311
00:12:30,109 --> 00:12:31,388
A shared apartment?

312
00:12:31,788 --> 00:12:32,829
Who are your roommates?

313
00:12:33,109 --> 00:12:34,268
Hello, my lovelies.

314
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:36,589
Today's another special discount.

315
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:38,429
Classic soy aroma.

316
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:40,668
That's it.

317
00:12:40,668 --> 00:12:42,520
Let me chug it down.

318
00:12:43,992 --> 00:12:44,868
Dive in.

319
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:46,949
No headaches.

320
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:48,709
Who is that?

321
00:12:49,548 --> 00:12:50,668
She's my roommate.

322
00:12:50,788 --> 00:12:51,429
A livestreamer.

323
00:12:53,388 --> 00:12:54,028
Your room?

324
00:12:54,349 --> 00:12:54,908
Here, Dad.

325
00:12:55,148 --> 00:12:55,548
Not there.

326
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:56,189
Here.

327
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:02,469
I apologize.

328
00:13:02,469 --> 00:13:03,349
I'm sorry.

329
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:05,229
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

330
00:13:06,028 --> 00:13:07,548
It's just that

331
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:08,949
it happened so suddenly.

332
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:10,989
I didn't want you to worry.

333
00:13:11,268 --> 00:13:13,589
So I thought I should
get settled here first

334
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:14,709
before telling you.

335
00:13:14,868 --> 00:13:15,868
Get settled?

336
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:18,429
This is Jingzhou.

337
00:13:19,469 --> 00:13:21,148
Talented people flock here.

338
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:23,388
Competition is heated here.

339
00:13:23,548 --> 00:13:24,349
You're here alone,

340
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:25,268
away from home.

341
00:13:25,908 --> 00:13:28,589
No diplomas, connections, or background.

342
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:30,949
It's not so easy to live here.

343
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,109
Your dad's right.

344
00:13:33,268 --> 00:13:35,429
You have to let me try first.

345
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:36,829
Anyway, it's better than

346
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:38,189
suffering at Lin Tao's home.

347
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:40,069
Makes sense.

348
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:43,668
We didn't know
Lin Tao's family was like that.

349
00:13:45,349 --> 00:13:46,148
But Lin,

350
00:13:46,508 --> 00:13:46,949
well...

351
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:50,709
I still think you should
come home with us.

352
00:13:51,349 --> 00:13:52,349
It's just a town,

353
00:13:52,469 --> 00:13:53,908
but you'll live

354
00:13:55,388 --> 00:13:57,868
a peaceful life with us, right?

355
00:13:58,349 --> 00:13:59,508
Try harder

356
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:00,868
and be a civil servant.

357
00:14:01,028 --> 00:14:02,709
Make the Lins jealous. Okay?

358
00:14:03,949 --> 00:14:05,548
Civil servant?

359
00:14:05,868 --> 00:14:06,788
You know very well

360
00:14:06,788 --> 00:14:08,229
I was never cut out for studying.

361
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:09,628
Take the civil service exam?

362
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:10,388
No way.

363
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:12,469
Now you admit you're not
cut out for studying?

364
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:14,668
Who begged us for money

365
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:16,668
to retake exams to come here?

366
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:19,949
We didn't even let
Qiao Yan take the exam.

367
00:14:20,508 --> 00:14:21,949
Now you're blaming it on me?

368
00:14:22,109 --> 00:14:23,388
You drove her away, okay?

369
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:32,548
Do you know that she has a boyfriend?

370
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:33,589
Forget about it.

371
00:14:35,069 --> 00:14:36,908
We're not even invited to her wedding.

372
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:37,628
Wedding?

373
00:14:39,989 --> 00:14:40,888
She didn't tell me.

374
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:41,868
Mom, Dad,

375
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:45,069
do you want to attend her wedding?

376
00:14:47,028 --> 00:14:47,949
All parents

377
00:14:48,668 --> 00:14:50,668
want to witness
their daughter's wedding.

378
00:14:50,748 --> 00:14:51,628
No, I don't.

379
00:14:52,508 --> 00:14:54,229
She's materialistic and ashamed of us.

380
00:14:54,349 --> 00:14:55,788
She's not my daughter.

381
00:14:56,109 --> 00:14:56,788
Dad.

382
00:14:57,268 --> 00:14:58,788
Yeah, I'm cursing you. So what?

383
00:14:59,469 --> 00:15:00,788
Aren't you ignoring calls

384
00:15:00,908 --> 00:15:02,148
to get compensation?

385
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:03,949
Go ahead. File a complaint.

386
00:15:05,069 --> 00:15:05,829
The other roommate.

387
00:15:06,268 --> 00:15:06,748
That's it.

388
00:15:11,908 --> 00:15:12,429
Yan.

389
00:15:12,668 --> 00:15:13,589
I'm magnanimous.

390
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:14,748
I can let it slide.

391
00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:17,508
But it's just angry talk
that Mom and Dad aren't

392
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:19,829
invited to your wedding, right?

393
00:15:20,748 --> 00:15:22,429
Since they are still here,

394
00:15:22,748 --> 00:15:24,268
let's find a chance

395
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:26,548
to sit together and clear the air.

396
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:27,349
What do you think?

397
00:15:28,668 --> 00:15:29,148
Okay.

398
00:15:29,748 --> 00:15:30,388
Okay, right?

399
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:31,469
I'm coming in.

400
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:41,508
Who are you looking for?

401
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:44,229
Isn't this Xu Yan's home?

402
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:47,469
This is my daughter's home.

403
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:49,109
Are you her colleague?

404
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:50,189
Your daughter?

405
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:52,028
You are...?

406
00:15:52,309 --> 00:15:53,908
We're Yan's parents.

407
00:15:54,028 --> 00:15:55,229
We've been working overseas.

408
00:15:55,628 --> 00:15:57,028
Since Yan's getting married soon,

409
00:15:57,229 --> 00:15:59,109
we came back for her wedding.

410
00:15:59,548 --> 00:16:00,548
She's getting groceries.

411
00:16:00,628 --> 00:16:01,548
She'll be right back.

412
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:05,229
You're her parents?

413
00:16:05,469 --> 00:16:06,508
You live abroad?

414
00:16:07,028 --> 00:16:08,429
Yeah, w-we work

415
00:16:08,429 --> 00:16:10,028
at a university overseas.

416
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:11,709
Yan.

417
00:16:11,868 --> 00:16:12,589
Perfect timing.

418
00:16:13,109 --> 00:16:13,949
Your colleague.

419
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:23,868
Now I get it.

420
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,748
You've been lying all along.

421
00:16:26,148 --> 00:16:27,469
You hired fake parents

422
00:16:27,548 --> 00:16:29,548
and told everyone

423
00:16:29,548 --> 00:16:31,469
that they live abroad.

424
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:32,668
Yan.

425
00:16:38,548 --> 00:16:39,868
I know exactly what I'm doing.

426
00:16:40,028 --> 00:16:41,069
Thanks for the reminder.

427
00:16:41,748 --> 00:16:43,709
You've got some nerve.

428
00:16:43,868 --> 00:16:46,069
What if the Shen family finds out?

429
00:16:46,229 --> 00:16:47,908
No one will know if you keep quiet.

430
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:50,028
You'll keep lying to them?

431
00:16:50,628 --> 00:16:51,788
For someone so smart,

432
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:53,788
why would you do such stupid things?

433
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:58,349
Once you marry Shen Haoming,

434
00:16:58,552 --> 00:16:59,608
what are you going to do?

435
00:16:59,748 --> 00:17:01,069
Keep lying to him forever?

436
00:17:03,508 --> 00:17:04,908
I'll figure something out.

437
00:17:05,388 --> 00:17:06,268
Not now.

438
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:11,349
Haoming's mom

439
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:12,868
looks down on my background.

440
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:15,108
How else could I marry him?

441
00:17:21,788 --> 00:17:24,189
I've seen the girls she picked for him.

442
00:17:25,229 --> 00:17:26,429
They're all exceptional.

443
00:17:27,828 --> 00:17:29,669
I know you find it despicable.

444
00:17:29,869 --> 00:17:31,308
I admit I'm at fault.

445
00:17:32,508 --> 00:17:33,389
But you don't know

446
00:17:34,068 --> 00:17:35,548
what I've been through,

447
00:17:36,028 --> 00:17:37,348
and can't understand my choices.

448
00:17:38,828 --> 00:17:40,068
All I can say is that

449
00:17:40,588 --> 00:17:42,268
before meeting Shen Haoming,

450
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:44,149
my life was colorless.

451
00:17:44,949 --> 00:17:45,748
He's the only one

452
00:17:45,748 --> 00:17:47,028
willing to look after me.

453
00:17:47,588 --> 00:17:48,588
The only one.

454
00:17:56,748 --> 00:17:58,229
You may have a thousand excuses,

455
00:17:58,348 --> 00:17:59,629
but lying is wrong.

456
00:18:03,229 --> 00:18:05,189
If I told the truth,

457
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,709
they'd force me to break up with him.

458
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:11,869
Everything I've worked so hard for

459
00:18:13,469 --> 00:18:14,429
in Jingzhou

460
00:18:15,189 --> 00:18:16,909
would vanish instantly.

461
00:18:17,308 --> 00:18:18,189
Haven't I worked hard?

462
00:18:19,268 --> 00:18:21,068
Yes, I have. But what's the point?

463
00:18:25,548 --> 00:18:26,748
That's why I refuse

464
00:18:26,748 --> 00:18:28,149
to go back to being

465
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:31,268
that disposable young lady

466
00:18:32,788 --> 00:18:33,949
everyone looked down on.

467
00:18:40,949 --> 00:18:42,709
Life only has a few turning points.

468
00:18:43,308 --> 00:18:44,508
If we seize them,

469
00:18:44,949 --> 00:18:46,909
everything falls into place.

470
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:49,028
But if we miss those chances,

471
00:18:49,268 --> 00:18:51,229
we can't possibly turn the tide.

472
00:18:58,508 --> 00:18:59,629
Either I lose everything,

473
00:18:59,709 --> 00:19:00,348
or

474
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:02,389
gain everything.

475
00:19:06,869 --> 00:19:07,629
Do you love him?

476
00:19:08,828 --> 00:19:10,709
Or are you just

477
00:19:10,748 --> 00:19:12,469
a complete fraud after his money?

478
00:19:15,348 --> 00:19:17,028
I want both career and love.

479
00:19:18,989 --> 00:19:21,669
Why do we have to be poor

480
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:22,748
to prove our love?

481
00:19:26,828 --> 00:19:28,629
If you insist on exposing me...

482
00:19:32,248 --> 00:19:32,918

(Video Call, Audio Call)

484
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:42,788
I can't change your mind.

485
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,189
But I can't watch you go down that path.

486
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:47,828
I won't come again.

487

go down that path.)

490
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:52,149
Hello? What's up?

491
00:20:53,028 --> 00:20:53,508
Yan.

492
00:20:54,348 --> 00:20:56,429
We've confirmed our guest list.

493
00:20:56,748 --> 00:20:58,709
But I took a look at your list.

494
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,989
Your dad, your mom,

495
00:21:01,308 --> 00:21:02,508
Huanhuan, and Mr. Zhou.

496
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:04,229
Four people. Isn't that too few?

497
00:21:06,268 --> 00:21:08,189
My parents live abroad and rarely

498
00:21:08,788 --> 00:21:10,028
visit any relatives.

499
00:21:11,629 --> 00:21:14,028
If we suddenly reach out
for the wedding,

500
00:21:15,068 --> 00:21:17,348
it'll look like
we're just after gift money.

501
00:21:17,629 --> 00:21:18,149
Right?

502
00:21:19,149 --> 00:21:19,669
Got it.

503
00:21:21,389 --> 00:21:23,308
When are we bringing Grandma over?

504
00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:25,869
Let's bring her here soon.

505
00:21:26,189 --> 00:21:27,869
Let her enjoy her time in Jingzhou.

506
00:21:31,548 --> 00:21:33,308
I'll ask her about it when I go back.

507
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:36,949
You know she has aged.

508
00:21:38,909 --> 00:21:39,709
I'll go with you.

509
00:21:41,548 --> 00:21:43,348
You have so much work.

510
00:21:43,788 --> 00:21:44,189
Next time,

511
00:21:44,508 --> 00:21:45,788
we'll go together, okay?

512
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:49,028
I really want to see her.

513
00:21:49,748 --> 00:21:51,588
But I already promised to spend

514
00:21:51,588 --> 00:21:53,108
some days with her this time.

515
00:21:53,588 --> 00:21:55,068
If you come along,

516
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,709
it'll disrupt our plans.

517
00:21:56,869 --> 00:21:57,429
Right?

518
00:21:58,588 --> 00:21:59,149
Got it.

519
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:01,068
Take care of yourself.

We want to attend your wedding.

Mr. Gao.

Grandma said

544
00:24:23,108 --> 00:24:24,869
you went to work
as a tailor in the city.

545
00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:26,548
Why did you come back?

546
00:24:27,068 --> 00:24:28,469
That was years ago.

547
00:24:28,709 --> 00:24:30,429
Our village is better than the city now.

548
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,788
I started a small orchard,

549
00:24:33,229 --> 00:24:34,189
opened a tavern,

550
00:24:34,469 --> 00:24:35,629
and leased a fishing pond.

551
00:24:35,869 --> 00:24:38,268
I sometimes host fruit-picking groups

552
00:24:38,828 --> 00:24:39,832
and fishing enthusiasts.

553
00:24:40,108 --> 00:24:41,828

I...

558
00:24:50,348 --> 00:24:52,229
I'm not a chef.

559
00:24:52,629 --> 00:24:54,268
I run a food show.

560
00:24:55,429 --> 00:24:56,508

561
00:24:56,669 --> 00:24:58,308
- Like those on TV?
- Yeah.

00:25:55,068 --> 00:25:56,709
It looks so dangerous.

575
00:25:57,548 --> 00:25:59,548
What's so dangerous about it?

576
00:26:00,189 --> 00:26:01,348
Alright.

577
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:04,068
Let me do it. Sit down.

578
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:05,588
There's been more rain

579
00:26:05,629 --> 00:26:07,149
and it's been colder this year.

580
00:26:07,588 --> 00:26:08,949
I'm worried

581
00:26:08,949 --> 00:26:10,429
these osmanthus flowers

582
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,149
won't get picked in time.

583
00:26:12,229 --> 00:26:13,629
Then we won't get to make

584
00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:15,028
nice osmanthus jam.

585
00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:16,949
I'll pick them. Don't worry.

586
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:17,949
Just sit tight.

587
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:20,108
Didn't I tell you?

588
00:26:20,748 --> 00:26:21,869
When no one's home,

589
00:26:21,949 --> 00:26:23,068
don't stand so high up.

590
00:26:23,068 --> 00:26:24,028
It's dangerous.

591
00:26:24,268 --> 00:26:25,869
But I'm using the stool.

592
00:26:26,548 --> 00:26:27,828
That's even worse.

593
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:32,989
You're still good at this.

594
00:26:34,949 --> 00:26:35,588
You remember.

595
00:26:35,788 --> 00:26:36,828
Of course.

596
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:38,389
How could I forget the skills

597
00:26:38,588 --> 00:26:39,268
you taught me?

598
00:26:43,828 --> 00:26:44,709
Is everything okay?

599
00:26:44,828 --> 00:26:45,588
Yeah.

600
00:26:45,788 --> 00:26:46,389
Really?

601
00:26:46,508 --> 00:26:48,268
It's even better now that you're back.

602
00:26:51,588 --> 00:26:52,348
Yan.

603
00:26:52,348 --> 00:26:55,308
I learned how to make pan-seared cod.

604
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:57,548
I'll cook it for you next time.

605
00:26:59,189 --> 00:27:00,508
Why don't you try

606
00:27:00,508 --> 00:27:04,028
the mixed fruit platter
I made for you first?

607
00:27:04,709 --> 00:27:05,028
Here.

608
00:27:05,989 --> 00:27:06,548
My child.

609
00:27:07,028 --> 00:27:07,869
It's a huge plate.

610
00:27:07,869 --> 00:27:09,669
Can we finish all this?

611
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:10,669
No worries.

612
00:27:10,788 --> 00:27:12,229
We can put them in the fridge.

613
00:27:14,788 --> 00:27:15,268
Sweet, huh?

614
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:24,669
This apple must be homegrown.

615
00:27:25,028 --> 00:27:26,548
Homegrown apples are the best.

616
00:27:28,548 --> 00:27:29,028
So tasty.

617
00:27:32,229 --> 00:27:32,748
Grandma.

618
00:27:33,548 --> 00:27:35,028
Remember that boyfriend

619
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,508
I told you about?

620
00:27:37,788 --> 00:27:38,469
Of course.

621
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:39,989
You mention him

622
00:27:40,028 --> 00:27:40,909
every time you call.

623
00:27:41,469 --> 00:27:42,748
Things are going well.

624
00:27:44,189 --> 00:27:45,949
I've met his family.

625
00:27:46,588 --> 00:27:47,869
So we're planning

626
00:27:48,588 --> 00:27:50,429
to get married next month.

627
00:27:54,788 --> 00:27:56,068
How could you keep

628
00:27:56,068 --> 00:27:57,949
such happy news from me until now?

629
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:02,229
Yan,

630
00:28:04,989 --> 00:28:06,709
I've finally lived to see you

631
00:28:07,108 --> 00:28:08,709
getting married.

632
00:28:10,348 --> 00:28:12,548
I've been waiting for this moment.

633
00:28:14,348 --> 00:28:15,548
I'm so happy.

634
00:28:23,189 --> 00:28:23,909
What's wrong?

635
00:28:27,189 --> 00:28:28,389
Is something bothering you?

636
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:36,869
I knew it.

637
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:38,949
Nothing escapes you.

638
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:44,389
Mom and Dad went to Jingzhou.

639
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:50,949
You know that

640
00:28:52,828 --> 00:28:54,828
I've never been close to them.

641
00:28:56,389 --> 00:28:58,268
So I don't want them at my wedding.

642
00:28:58,909 --> 00:29:00,909
I won't invite them.

643
00:29:01,989 --> 00:29:03,469
But if I tell them that,

644
00:29:04,028 --> 00:29:05,389
given Dad's temper,

645
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:07,989
he'll make trouble.

646
00:29:10,189 --> 00:29:12,028
But my wedding's next month...

647
00:29:14,748 --> 00:29:15,389
Grandma.

648
00:29:16,348 --> 00:29:17,828
I know what to do.

649
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:21,108
I'll ask them to come back.

650
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:24,828
They won't go there again.

651
00:29:28,028 --> 00:29:28,629
Yan,

652
00:29:30,629 --> 00:29:32,949
you've been struggling
in the city alone.

653
00:29:33,709 --> 00:29:35,748
I know better than anyone

654
00:29:37,229 --> 00:29:38,669
how much you've suffered.

655
00:29:40,348 --> 00:29:40,989
So

656
00:29:41,629 --> 00:29:43,069
your wedding

657
00:29:44,248 --> 00:29:45,949
will be

658
00:29:46,989 --> 00:29:48,068
proper,

659
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:49,348
splendid,

660
00:29:50,709 --> 00:29:51,989
and beautiful.

661
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:10,108
Grandma,

662
00:30:14,629 --> 00:30:15,989
Jingzhou's too far.

663
00:30:20,869 --> 00:30:22,068
It's a huge trip for you.

664
00:30:29,508 --> 00:30:30,469
Exactly.

665
00:30:30,669 --> 00:30:32,788
You know I've aged.

666
00:30:33,068 --> 00:30:34,949
With these old legs,

667
00:30:35,068 --> 00:30:37,108
traveling all the way

668
00:30:37,389 --> 00:30:38,389
back and forth...

669
00:30:38,989 --> 00:30:39,909
I can't do it.

670
00:30:40,229 --> 00:30:42,469
My bones would rattle apart.

671
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:43,909
Yan.

672
00:30:44,308 --> 00:30:44,828
Really.

673
00:30:45,389 --> 00:30:47,629
I won't go to Jingzhou.

674
00:30:47,709 --> 00:30:49,268
After the wedding,

675
00:30:49,629 --> 00:30:51,189
keep a copy of your wedding photo.

676
00:30:51,348 --> 00:30:54,748
Bring it when you visit again.

677
00:30:55,068 --> 00:30:55,508
Okay?

678
00:30:55,629 --> 00:30:56,709
I'll hang it in my room

679
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,028
and see you kids every day.

680
00:30:59,068 --> 00:31:01,108
That'll make me happy.

681
00:31:03,189 --> 00:31:06,709
I can't travel with these old legs.

682
00:31:06,828 --> 00:31:07,508
At night,

683
00:31:07,629 --> 00:31:08,748
they swell up.

684
00:31:09,028 --> 00:31:09,828
Imagine me

685
00:31:10,028 --> 00:31:11,548
in a strange city,

686
00:31:12,308 --> 00:31:14,389
while you're celebrating...

687
00:31:14,828 --> 00:31:16,108
If I fall ill there,

688
00:31:16,268 --> 00:31:18,108
I'd cause you so much trouble.

689
00:31:18,469 --> 00:31:19,429
No, I won't go there.

690
00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:20,508
I'm not going.

691
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:21,588
I'll stay

692
00:31:21,788 --> 00:31:23,709
and wait for your good news.

693
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,629
What if I end up...

694
00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:30,788
You'll be overwhelmed.

695
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:31,949
Sit tight.

696
00:31:32,788 --> 00:31:34,828
Really. I...

697
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:36,268
Look.

698
00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:37,788
Every night,

699
00:31:37,869 --> 00:31:39,268
my legs swell up.

700
00:31:39,308 --> 00:31:39,949
Press here.

701
00:31:40,229 --> 00:31:41,189
It sinks right in.

702
00:31:41,788 --> 00:31:43,028
Stop massaging me.

703
00:31:43,709 --> 00:31:44,469
Just a bit more.

704
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:45,469
Come on.

705
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:47,748
That's enough.

706
00:31:48,669 --> 00:31:50,469
Should I prepare a foot bath for you?

707
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:51,828
Alright.

708
00:32:52,869 --> 00:32:55,588
Aren't you putting fruit in the fridge?

709
00:32:55,629 --> 00:32:56,308
Why...

710
00:33:00,189 --> 00:33:01,949
Why are you crying?

711
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:04,508
What's wrong?

712
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:08,588
What happened?

713
00:33:12,389 --> 00:33:14,348
I haven't been home for so long.

714
00:33:16,469 --> 00:33:18,828
I can't finish all this osmanthus jam.

715
00:33:20,108 --> 00:33:21,909
Do you know why I've been making

716
00:33:21,949 --> 00:33:23,508
so much sweet osmanthus jam for you

717
00:33:23,508 --> 00:33:24,989
since you were a kid?

718
00:33:25,229 --> 00:33:26,508

00:43:41,628 --> 00:43:43,148
(Only by becoming strong)

958
00:43:43,309 --> 00:43:44,829
(can I achieve permanent success.)

959
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:47,349
(Only by achieving all goals)

960
00:43:48,188 --> 00:43:50,068
(can I make up for all my mistakes)

961
00:43:50,869 --> 00:43:51,508
(and make up)

962
00:43:52,269 --> 00:43:53,548
(to those I've let down.)

963
00:44:17,309 --> 00:44:18,789
Is the risk analysis

964
00:44:19,389 --> 00:44:20,708
on Plot 178 ready?

965
00:44:21,068 --> 00:44:21,668
Mr. Shen.

966
00:44:22,949 --> 00:44:23,749
I'm Fang Lei.

967
00:44:24,269 --> 00:44:25,429
I'll present

968
00:44:25,469 --> 00:44:26,508
the risk assessment report

969
00:44:26,588 --> 00:44:27,548
on Plot 178.

970
00:44:29,188 --> 00:44:29,588
Mr. Shen,

971
00:44:29,909 --> 00:44:32,148
she's new to the investment
strategy department.

972
00:44:38,989 --> 00:44:39,588
Let's start.

973
00:44:41,148 --> 00:44:43,389
There are four major
risks for this plot.

974
00:44:43,588 --> 00:44:44,108
First,

975
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:45,389
the auctioned land

976
00:44:45,548 --> 00:44:46,989
has existing encumbrances.

977
00:44:47,508 --> 00:44:48,909
There are two bank mortgages

978
00:44:49,188 --> 00:44:50,309
and objection registrations.

979
00:44:50,668 --> 00:44:51,588
If we don't clarify

980
00:44:51,749 --> 00:44:53,668
property rights before bidding,

981
00:44:54,028 --> 00:44:56,269
they might eventually become our debts.

982
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:57,508
Second,

983
00:44:57,869 --> 00:45:00,028
according to the government's
new planning policy,

984
00:45:00,508 --> 00:45:01,749
the land's lease term

985
00:45:02,068 --> 00:45:03,309
may be adjusted.

986
00:45:10,389 --> 00:45:10,989
Lisa.

987
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:11,469
Bye.

988
00:45:11,588 --> 00:45:11,989
Let's go.

989
00:45:14,309 --> 00:45:15,269
Fang Lei, see you.

990
00:45:15,628 --> 00:45:16,668
- Bye.
- Bye.

991
00:45:17,588 --> 00:45:18,269
Bye, Mr. Shen.

992
00:45:18,389 --> 00:45:18,909
Bye.

993
00:45:19,389 --> 00:45:19,989
Mr. Shen.

994
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,869
Why did you suddenly come back

995
00:45:28,269 --> 00:45:29,188
and join our company?

996
00:45:29,628 --> 00:45:30,989
Isn't it a pleasant surprise

997
00:45:31,668 --> 00:45:32,829
for you?

998
00:45:34,548 --> 00:45:36,188
Or perhaps you are not happy

999
00:45:37,188 --> 00:45:38,108
to see me?

1000
00:45:39,668 --> 00:45:41,989
You have to readjust to many things.

1001
00:45:42,829 --> 00:45:44,749
If I have any problems at work,

1002
00:45:45,228 --> 00:45:46,429
can I consult you?

1003
00:45:47,869 --> 00:45:49,148
The HR policies require you

1004
00:45:49,469 --> 00:45:51,028
to report to your direct supervisor.

1005
00:45:52,628 --> 00:45:53,749
I was just kidding.

1006
00:45:55,429 --> 00:45:55,989
Haoming.

1007
00:45:57,309 --> 00:45:58,548
Do you remember this jacket?

1008
00:46:04,749 --> 00:46:05,789
You won this as a prize

1009
00:46:06,148 --> 00:46:07,749
at the collegiate kayak championship

1010
00:46:07,789 --> 00:46:08,869
during your sophomore year.

1011
00:46:09,668 --> 00:46:10,668
I said I liked it,

1012
00:46:10,749 --> 00:46:12,508
and you gave it to me
without hesitation.

1013
00:46:12,909 --> 00:46:13,749
I was so happy.

1014
00:46:14,068 --> 00:46:15,869
So I took this photo as a memento.

1015
00:46:17,389 --> 00:46:18,389
I didn't give it to you.

1016
00:46:18,869 --> 00:46:19,789
You snatched it.

1017
00:46:21,588 --> 00:46:22,588
So you remember.

1018
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:27,789
I remember everything you said, too.

1019
00:46:29,309 --> 00:46:31,469
When you left London, you told me

1020
00:46:32,628 --> 00:46:34,028
to focus on my studies there

1021
00:46:34,588 --> 00:46:36,508
and return after graduation.

1022
00:46:37,749 --> 00:46:38,349
Now,

1023
00:46:39,909 --> 00:46:40,668
