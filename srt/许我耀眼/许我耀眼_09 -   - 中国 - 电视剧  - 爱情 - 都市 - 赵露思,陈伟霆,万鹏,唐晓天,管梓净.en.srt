28
00:01:44,413 --> 00:01:45,333
First, let's turn to

29
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:46,853
the latest on global markets.

30
00:01:47,452 --> 00:01:49,773
(Host, Xu Yan)
Renewed confidence

31
00:01:49,853 --> 00:01:51,732
fueled a global market rally yesterday.

32
00:01:52,053 --> 00:01:53,853
(Nasdaq hits all-time high)
The Nasdaq index,

33
00:01:53,892 --> 00:01:55,372
fueled by tech giants,

34
00:01:55,413 --> 00:01:56,853
has surged to a new record high,

35
00:01:57,133 --> 00:01:58,693
climbing over 1 percent.

36
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,053
I think

37
00:02:01,613 --> 00:02:03,812
delivering it in a steadier pace

38
00:02:04,053 --> 00:02:04,532
is better.

39
00:02:04,812 --> 00:02:05,773
I don't agree.

40
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:07,053
I think it's great.

41
00:02:09,173 --> 00:02:09,733
Moreover,

42
00:02:09,773 --> 00:02:10,773
this suits her better

43
00:02:10,812 --> 00:02:12,053
than food programs.

44
00:02:17,412 --> 00:02:17,893
Yan.

45
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:23,972
A surprise for you.

46
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:26,493
Want to know?

47
00:02:30,412 --> 00:02:31,252
We two

48
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,453
have been thinking about

49
00:02:35,092 --> 00:02:36,453
giving you a special gift.

50
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:37,072
Here.

51
00:02:37,173 --> 00:02:38,293
Congratulations!

52
00:02:38,812 --> 00:02:40,613
Thank you, Mom, Dad.

53
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:42,053
Open it and check.

54
00:02:46,572 --> 00:02:47,692
This is too expensive.

55
00:02:48,213 --> 00:02:48,933
Do you like it?

56
00:02:50,092 --> 00:02:50,933
I'm glad you like it.

57
00:02:53,013 --> 00:02:53,812
Thank you.

58
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:00,293
Both of us think

59
00:03:00,412 --> 00:03:02,213
now that you're an anchor,

60
00:03:02,692 --> 00:03:03,652
your on-screen presence

61
00:03:03,773 --> 00:03:05,053
should be more elegant.

62
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:06,252
Rubies are perfect.

63
00:03:09,213 --> 00:03:10,333
Let me put them on you.

64
00:03:11,173 --> 00:03:12,572
You're always thoughtful.

65
00:03:13,213 --> 00:03:14,493
I'd only know

66
00:03:14,532 --> 00:03:15,173
to buy bags,

67
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:16,773
which are useless here.

68
00:03:17,652 --> 00:03:18,652
If you think in this way,

69
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:19,933
you must strive to

70
00:03:19,972 --> 00:03:22,013
keep your wife satisfied.

71
00:03:23,252 --> 00:03:23,733
Right?

72
00:03:23,952 --> 00:03:24,372
Right.

73
00:03:24,652 --> 00:03:25,173
Haoming.

74
00:03:26,132 --> 00:03:26,532
Haoming.

75
00:03:26,893 --> 00:03:28,272
I'll switch horses next Saturday.

76
00:03:28,272 --> 00:03:29,264
Can you go with me?

77
00:03:30,053 --> 00:03:30,613
Saturday?

78
00:03:31,053 --> 00:03:31,812
Not Saturday.

79
00:03:32,173 --> 00:03:32,933
He and I

80
00:03:32,972 --> 00:03:34,053
have a meeting with Mr. Wu.

81
00:03:34,652 --> 00:03:35,132
Fine.

82
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,412
I'm not important.

83
00:03:40,372 --> 00:03:40,852
Haochen.

84
00:03:43,652 --> 00:03:44,572
Maybe I'll go with you.

85
00:03:44,972 --> 00:03:46,333
Do you know about horse switching?

86
00:03:46,692 --> 00:03:47,453
This kid...

87
00:03:48,532 --> 00:03:49,213
Alright.

88
00:03:51,213 --> 00:03:51,692
Forget it.

89
00:03:53,092 --> 00:03:54,412
Let me try these earrings on you.

90
00:03:57,572 --> 00:03:58,013
Catch!

91
00:03:58,173 --> 00:03:58,692
Go!

92
00:03:58,692 --> 00:03:59,092
Pass it!

93
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:06,213
- Stop fighting!
- Stop!

94
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,213
Stop it!

95
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:07,972
Bu!

96
00:04:09,412 --> 00:04:10,412
Throw it farther.

97
00:04:12,493 --> 00:04:13,053
Bu.

98
00:04:13,372 --> 00:04:13,893
Bu.

99
00:04:14,812 --> 00:04:15,333
Bu, come.

100
00:04:16,012 --> 00:04:16,372
Come.

101
00:04:17,372 --> 00:04:17,692
Come.

102
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:19,933
(Parents' Group)

103
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:21,053
What happened?

104
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:22,252
So annoying.

105
00:04:22,293 --> 00:04:23,173
Ready, Bu?

106
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:25,613
Trouble again.

107
00:04:25,653 --> 00:04:26,093
Mr. Wang.

108
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:31,212
What's up, Mom?

109
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:33,613
Haochen's teacher texted me.

110
00:04:34,053 --> 00:04:35,252
He hit a classmate again

111
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:36,252
during P.E. class.

112
00:04:36,452 --> 00:04:37,493
Not his first offense.

113
00:04:37,892 --> 00:04:39,312
His parents insist me to go.

114
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:40,272
I'm so busy!

115
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:42,173
Hosting ten feasts

116
00:04:42,613 --> 00:04:43,692
is easier than dealing

117
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:44,892
with his teacher's message.

118
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:47,173
Haochen always causes trouble.

119
00:04:47,452 --> 00:04:48,252
I'd be lectured

120
00:04:48,252 --> 00:04:50,012
by these young teachers.

121
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:51,892
We are all busy.

122
00:04:52,212 --> 00:04:52,812
And I have

123
00:04:53,012 --> 00:04:53,692
to handle these.

124
00:04:53,812 --> 00:04:55,533
I'm overwhelmed. This is annoying.

125
00:04:55,853 --> 00:04:57,173
Every time the teacher calls,

126
00:04:57,212 --> 00:04:58,053
my heart aches.

127
00:05:02,653 --> 00:05:03,973
You're more patient than I am.

128
00:05:05,212 --> 00:05:06,252
I'll add you to the group,

129
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:07,093
and I'll exit.

130
00:05:08,053 --> 00:05:08,733
Deal then.

131
00:05:09,973 --> 00:05:10,692
Is it okay, Mom?

132
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:11,533
It's perfectly okay.

133
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:12,733
You married Haoming,

134
00:05:12,772 --> 00:05:13,653
and we are family now.

135
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:15,173
You are also Haochen's guardian.

136
00:05:15,653 --> 00:05:16,293
Deal then.

137
00:05:16,572 --> 00:05:17,572
I'll tell his teacher.

138
00:05:19,692 --> 00:05:20,212
Okay.

139
00:05:23,452 --> 00:05:24,132
But, Mom.

140
00:05:24,853 --> 00:05:26,212
It's my first time being a parent.

141
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:27,572
There's much I don't understand.

142
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:28,653
Please guide me.

143
00:05:29,012 --> 00:05:30,653
No need. Just follow instructions.

144
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:32,892
Apologize when needed. Alright.

145
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:34,533
I've added you.

146
00:05:35,372 --> 00:05:35,812

150

151
00:05:42,012 --> 00:05:42,892

Here.

153
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:45,733

I'll talk to him when we get home.

165
00:06:08,892 --> 00:06:10,252
Sorry, we'll take the blame.

166
00:06:11,093 --> 00:06:13,012
When you get home, talk it out with him.

167
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:14,093
As his family,

168
00:06:14,132 --> 00:06:15,812
you can't just dump him at school

169
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:17,012
and leave him alone.

170
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,093
This doesn't work.

171
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:20,533
Understood.

172
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:21,812
After we go back,

173
00:06:21,853 --> 00:06:23,053
I'll talk to him.

174
00:06:23,293 --> 00:06:23,772
Alright.

175
00:06:24,012 --> 00:06:24,653
That's it.

176
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:25,572
Thank you.

177
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:26,480
Goodbye.

178
00:06:36,173 --> 00:06:36,533
Okay.

179
00:06:37,132 --> 00:06:37,653
Next one.

180
00:06:39,372 --> 00:06:40,452
Move to the center.

181
00:06:42,132 --> 00:06:42,653
Next one.

182
00:07:02,572 --> 00:07:03,533
Want to tell me

183
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:04,892
what happened today?

184
00:07:12,252 --> 00:07:13,252
Don't worry.

185
00:07:14,252 --> 00:07:15,053
The kid's parents

186
00:07:15,093 --> 00:07:16,533
won't pursue it further.

187
00:07:17,173 --> 00:07:18,173
But I think

188
00:07:19,332 --> 00:07:20,653
we need to talk it out.

189
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:28,692
Can you hear me?

190
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:42,012
Back?

191
00:07:44,613 --> 00:07:45,772
Yan, how was it?

192
00:07:46,653 --> 00:07:49,012
The kid's parents
won't pursue it further.

193
00:07:51,933 --> 00:07:54,053
He really needs to control his temper.

194
00:07:54,053 --> 00:07:54,973
He's only twelve.

195
00:07:55,332 --> 00:07:56,080
When he's older,

196
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,136
we can't control him.

197
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:59,452
What we're providing him with

198
00:07:59,493 --> 00:08:00,853
the best educational resources.

199
00:08:00,892 --> 00:08:01,812
An excellent school.

200
00:08:02,212 --> 00:08:02,653
Right?

201
00:08:03,173 --> 00:08:04,332
Now we need

202
00:08:04,413 --> 00:08:05,212
to focus on

203
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:07,533
solving the problem.

204
00:08:09,173 --> 00:08:10,772
Maybe we should consider

205
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:12,093
sending him abroad.

206
00:08:17,053 --> 00:08:17,493
Mom.

207
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:19,772
Haochen is only twelve.

208
00:08:20,252 --> 00:08:21,613
Isn't it too early for him?

209
00:08:22,093 --> 00:08:23,053
Ms. Sun's child

210
00:08:23,093 --> 00:08:24,452
went abroad even younger than him.

211
00:08:24,812 --> 00:08:25,933
Went to Australia at eight.

212
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,933
Wait, this varies case by case.

213
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,332
He just turned twelve.

214
00:08:29,372 --> 00:08:30,413
If we send him abroad now,

215
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:31,493
he might

216
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:32,373
go astray,

217
00:08:32,492 --> 00:08:33,612
and no one will

218
00:08:33,653 --> 00:08:34,572
correct him then.

219
00:08:34,572 --> 00:08:35,893
But he's a boy.

220
00:08:36,253 --> 00:08:37,253
He could benefit from it.

221
00:08:37,293 --> 00:08:38,533
I don't oppose it.

222
00:08:38,612 --> 00:08:39,492
But we must

223
00:08:39,612 --> 00:08:40,612
find the right timing.

224
00:08:40,972 --> 00:08:41,893
It varies case by case.

225
00:08:42,092 --> 00:08:43,053
Maybe it works

226
00:08:43,173 --> 00:08:44,053
for other kids,

227
00:08:44,092 --> 00:08:44,812
but not ours.

228
00:08:44,893 --> 00:08:46,933
Listen, he's been spoiled...

229
00:08:55,612 --> 00:08:57,212
The school isn't over yet.

230
00:08:59,092 --> 00:08:59,773
I'll go check.

231
00:09:10,253 --> 00:09:11,092
I think we should

232
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,253
discuss this with him.

233
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,612
Let's hear what Haochen thinks.

234
00:09:15,413 --> 00:09:16,332
If he rejects,

235
00:09:16,373 --> 00:09:17,013
don't force him.

236
00:09:17,612 --> 00:09:18,013
Haoming.

237
00:09:18,972 --> 00:09:19,893
In this entire family,

238
00:09:20,332 --> 00:09:21,373
you spoil him the most.

239
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:22,653
You take the blame

240
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:23,812
for turning him this way.

241
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:26,173
Reflect on this.

242
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:33,773
Haochen.

243
00:09:44,013 --> 00:09:45,092
I think

244
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:47,013
the school isn't over yet.

245
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:47,972
Why you...?

246
00:09:48,013 --> 00:09:48,773
Let me ask you.

247
00:09:50,972 --> 00:09:52,492
Did you tell my parents

248
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:53,732
to send me abroad?

249
00:09:56,732 --> 00:09:57,812
Why would I do that?

250
00:10:00,053 --> 00:10:01,653
Stop pretending.

251
00:10:02,013 --> 00:10:04,173
You made my brother fall for you,

252
00:10:04,373 --> 00:10:05,612
and then pleased my parents,

253
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:07,212
until everyone adored you.

254
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,452
But I didn't fall for your tricks.

255
00:10:09,732 --> 00:10:10,852
Now trying to drive me away?

256
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:11,972
- Right?
- Right.

257
00:10:15,413 --> 00:10:16,852
You guessed it right.

258
00:10:18,332 --> 00:10:20,293
I do want to drive you away.

259
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:21,413
And then

260
00:10:21,452 --> 00:10:22,572
make them all adore me.

261
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:24,373
How clever of me!

262
00:10:26,053 --> 00:10:26,612
Shen Haochen.

263
00:10:27,173 --> 00:10:28,692
Use that little brain of yours.

264
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:30,133
Does this make any sense?

265
00:10:32,253 --> 00:10:32,933
Let me tell you.

266
00:10:32,972 --> 00:10:34,212
I'm not going abroad.

267
00:10:34,332 --> 00:10:35,812
No matter what tricks you pull,

268
00:10:36,013 --> 00:10:36,972
I, Shen Haochen,

269
00:10:37,253 --> 00:10:38,212
fight you to the end.

270
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:39,092
I don't know why

271
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:40,293
you're so hostile toward me,

272
00:10:40,893 --> 00:10:41,773
but let me remind you,

273
00:10:42,253 --> 00:10:43,413
I married your brother.

274
00:10:43,452 --> 00:10:45,293
I'm your sister-in-law,
and we're family now.

275
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:46,933
I love you

276
00:10:47,092 --> 00:10:48,013
how much they love you.

277
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:49,173
I won't hurt you,

278
00:10:49,812 --> 00:10:50,572
so I don't need

279
00:10:50,612 --> 00:10:51,413
to send you abroad.

280
00:10:51,893 --> 00:10:53,092
Before you came,

281
00:10:53,212 --> 00:10:54,812
my brother spent every day with me.

282
00:11:03,732 --> 00:11:05,253
If you listen to me,

283
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:07,133
and no more

284
00:11:07,253 --> 00:11:08,492
of today's incident,

285
00:11:09,413 --> 00:11:10,173
I can make

286
00:11:10,852 --> 00:11:12,173
Haoming spend more time with you.

287
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:13,972
I can guarantee

288
00:11:15,173 --> 00:11:16,053
you would stay.

289
00:11:16,972 --> 00:11:17,572
Deal?

290
00:11:19,452 --> 00:11:20,773
What's this new trick?

291
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:29,692
We're in an advantageous position.

292
00:11:30,492 --> 00:11:31,092
Have some tea.

293
00:11:34,972 --> 00:11:36,293
What does this mean?

294
00:11:36,812 --> 00:11:38,293
Jinda Group has agreed

295
00:11:38,492 --> 00:11:39,972
to grant us exclusive coverage

296
00:11:40,173 --> 00:11:42,332
of the New District development project.

297
00:11:43,173 --> 00:11:45,013
This is an extraordinary opportunity!

298
00:11:45,852 --> 00:11:47,893
Many media outlets are vying for this.

299
00:11:48,293 --> 00:11:50,092
And you're the perfect candidate
for this.

300
00:11:53,533 --> 00:11:54,413
I'm telling you.

301
00:11:55,092 --> 00:11:56,212
Once this project launches,

302
00:11:56,812 --> 00:11:58,413
it'll boost your career.

303
00:12:01,492 --> 00:12:01,893
Of course,

304
00:12:02,572 --> 00:12:04,133
your professional skills are excellent.

305
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:06,053
But this will

306
00:12:06,373 --> 00:12:07,612
be the icing on the cake.

307
00:12:09,492 --> 00:12:10,133
Thank you, Sir.

308
00:12:10,572 --> 00:12:11,452
Not at all.

309
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:12,612
Come on. Have some tea.

310
00:12:18,773 --> 00:12:19,344
Yan.

311
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:23,692
There's a Mr. Zhou

312
00:12:23,732 --> 00:12:25,332
waiting for you downstairs.

313
00:12:28,972 --> 00:12:29,572
Okay.

314
00:12:33,893 --> 00:12:35,293
It's been so long.

315
00:12:35,452 --> 00:12:37,933
Five or six years, I think?

316
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:39,568
How are you?

317
00:12:41,373 --> 00:12:42,053
Not bad.

318
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,173
Seeing you on TV

319
00:12:44,452 --> 00:12:45,812
after all these years,

320
00:12:46,173 --> 00:12:47,253
you've fulfilled your dream

321
00:12:47,293 --> 00:12:48,452
of becoming a news anchor.

322
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:49,692
I'm happy for you.

323
00:12:50,612 --> 00:12:51,053
Thank you.

324
00:12:55,893 --> 00:12:56,692
Remember?

325
00:12:57,373 --> 00:12:58,293
Our first meeting

326
00:12:58,332 --> 00:12:59,253
was also in a cafe.

327
00:13:01,136 --> 00:13:01,852
(Five Years Ago)

328
00:13:01,852 --> 00:13:03,092
Zhou, your project

329
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:05,133
is too theoretical for me.

330
00:13:05,653 --> 00:13:06,173
Mr. Chen,

331
00:13:06,373 --> 00:13:07,253
there are

332
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:07,972
very few experts

333
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:09,136
involved in this research

334
00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:10,533
and not many people understand

335
00:13:10,612 --> 00:13:11,452
its systems.

336
00:13:11,812 --> 00:13:13,332
I believe in the upcoming future,

337
00:13:13,373 --> 00:13:14,092
it will become

338
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:15,653
the prevailing trend in healthcare

339
00:13:15,893 --> 00:13:18,133
and empower doctors
to better serve patients.

340
00:13:18,293 --> 00:13:18,812
Alright.

341
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,533
I understand your point.

342
00:13:21,013 --> 00:13:22,173
Let's stop here for today.

343
00:13:22,373 --> 00:13:23,253
I have a meeting soon.

344
00:13:23,492 --> 00:13:24,773
I'll consider it.

345
00:13:25,293 --> 00:13:25,893
Fine.

346
00:13:26,053 --> 00:13:26,852
Call me.

347
00:13:29,692 --> 00:13:30,212
Mr. Chen,

348
00:13:30,452 --> 00:13:31,212
the proposal.

349
00:13:31,293 --> 00:13:31,852
No need.

350
00:13:35,653 --> 00:13:36,253
Xu Yan.

351
00:13:37,852 --> 00:13:39,373
I've reviewed your resume, impressive.

352
00:13:40,373 --> 00:13:41,173
Finished the form?

353
00:13:41,972 --> 00:13:42,492
Yes.

354
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:43,612
Here you go. Please.

355
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:50,732
The family members
and occupations section

356
00:13:51,173 --> 00:13:52,092
is left blank here.

357
00:13:52,253 --> 00:13:53,133
Why?

358
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:02,332
May I ask

359
00:14:03,492 --> 00:14:04,812
this section is mandatory?

360
00:14:05,413 --> 00:14:06,812
This top-tier media company

361
00:14:07,053 --> 00:14:09,013
puts great emphasis
on employees' backgrounds.

362
00:14:09,452 --> 00:14:11,133
Beyond education
and professional skills,

363
00:14:11,373 --> 00:14:12,533
family background serves as

364
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,253
a part of background checks.

365
00:14:16,053 --> 00:14:16,653
Understood.

366
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:20,773
I grew up with my grandma.

367
00:14:23,013 --> 00:14:23,612
Then I'll...

368
00:14:24,173 --> 00:14:25,212
May I ask

369
00:14:25,413 --> 00:14:26,692
about your parents' occupations?

370
00:14:30,893 --> 00:14:32,133
My family runs a barbershop.

371
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:34,053
Include that?

372
00:14:34,092 --> 00:14:35,133
Then better not.

373
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:37,492
This could get you a bonus,

374
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:38,533
but filling it in

375
00:14:38,572 --> 00:14:39,373
will be unfavorable.

376
00:14:41,732 --> 00:14:42,933
But you can't leave it blank.

377
00:14:43,972 --> 00:14:45,133
Here's my suggestion.

378
00:14:45,492 --> 00:14:46,933
Overseas business operations.

379
00:14:47,373 --> 00:14:47,933
Don't worry.

380
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:48,852
They usually

381
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,053
can't verify this.

382
00:14:50,492 --> 00:14:51,212
It's safer.

383
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:53,013
I advise you not to listen to her.

384
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:54,653
Fabricating resumes

385
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:56,653
is equivalent to planting

386
00:14:56,692 --> 00:14:58,133
a time bomb in your career.

387
00:14:58,173 --> 00:14:58,692
One day,

388
00:14:58,692 --> 00:14:59,773
it would suddenly explode.

389
00:15:00,212 --> 00:15:01,413
Then all your credibility

390
00:15:01,452 --> 00:15:02,653
and your previous efforts

391
00:15:02,692 --> 00:15:04,533
would be completely wasted.

392
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:06,092
These despicable headhunters

393
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:06,893
are increasing.

394
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:08,972
What if they use this to threaten you?

395
00:15:09,013 --> 00:15:09,653
Nonsense.

396
00:15:11,013 --> 00:15:12,053
Miss.

397
00:15:12,173 --> 00:15:13,293
You're eavesdropping us,

398
00:15:13,692 --> 00:15:14,773
and now slandering me?

399
00:15:18,373 --> 00:15:19,332
Just fill it in here.

400
00:15:24,612 --> 00:15:25,533
- Here?
- Right.

401
00:15:27,536 --> 00:15:29,264
(Family Members)

402
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:40,212
Miss.

403
00:15:41,013 --> 00:15:42,373
I just graduated.

404
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:44,572
I want to be honest.

405
00:15:45,572 --> 00:15:46,653
If it's really

406
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:48,533
as he said...

407
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:49,933
Then I can't handle

408
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:50,773
this case for you.

409
00:15:50,852 --> 00:15:51,332
Okay?

410
00:15:52,013 --> 00:15:53,173
I won't take the commission.

411
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,492
- Miss.
- Can't believe it.

412
00:16:14,332 --> 00:16:14,893
Sorry.

413
00:16:14,972 --> 00:16:15,653
No problem.

414
00:16:16,972 --> 00:16:18,533
Hello. I'm Xu Yan.

415
00:16:19,053 --> 00:16:21,053
I submitted my resume to your company.

416
00:16:21,092 --> 00:16:22,293
Sorry, we're not interested.

417
00:16:22,413 --> 00:16:23,812
Wait. Please hear me out.

418
00:16:33,212 --> 00:16:33,692
For you.

419
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:37,773
You failed today,

420
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:39,133
but don't be discouraged.

421
00:16:39,413 --> 00:16:40,773
Just like this sunflower,

422
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,533
thrive strongly and never give up.

423
00:16:45,732 --> 00:16:46,253
Thank you.

424
00:16:47,332 --> 00:16:47,812
Excuse me.

425
00:16:50,253 --> 00:16:50,653
Hello.

426
00:16:53,572 --> 00:16:54,013
Okay.

427
00:16:58,212 --> 00:16:58,852
Excuse me.

428
00:16:59,612 --> 00:17:00,692
Now I need one too.

429
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:02,612
The investor

430
00:17:02,732 --> 00:17:03,173
won't come.

431
00:17:07,853 --> 00:17:08,252
Alright.

432
00:17:08,853 --> 00:17:09,532
Then let's

433
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,373
thrive strongly together.

434
00:17:11,813 --> 00:17:12,413
Keep going!

435
00:17:15,772 --> 00:17:16,653
I-I want to ask

436
00:17:16,853 --> 00:17:17,573
if you made this

437
00:17:17,573 --> 00:17:18,813
from that proposal.

438
00:17:18,972 --> 00:17:19,452
Exactly.

439
00:17:19,492 --> 00:17:20,212
No one wants it.

440
00:17:20,613 --> 00:17:21,373
Need this resume?

441
00:17:21,532 --> 00:17:22,373
I can teach you.

442
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:23,052
No, thanks.

443
00:17:25,093 --> 00:17:25,813
What's your name?

444
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:26,972
I'm Zhou Zeyuan.

445
00:17:27,252 --> 00:17:27,692
And you?

446
00:17:28,052 --> 00:17:28,813
I'm Xu Yan.

447
00:17:29,052 --> 00:17:29,532
Xu Yan.

448
00:17:30,173 --> 00:17:31,452
Now you've become

449
00:17:31,532 --> 00:17:32,853
a genuinely successful woman.

450
00:17:34,292 --> 00:17:35,133
Not really.

451
00:17:36,012 --> 00:17:38,252
I just became a news anchor recently,

452
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:40,173
still waiting to see audience feedback.

453
00:17:40,653 --> 00:17:41,933
It's too early to say so.

454
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:44,212
Enough about me.

455
00:17:44,492 --> 00:17:45,732
What about you? What do you do?

456
00:17:47,173 --> 00:17:48,052
Those investors

457
00:17:48,093 --> 00:17:48,972
all doubted me,

458
00:17:49,052 --> 00:17:50,492
but I always believed in myself.

459
00:17:51,728 --> 00:17:53,933
When my company started,
there were only three.

460
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:55,573
And now we have

461
00:17:55,613 --> 00:17:56,732
over 160 people

462
00:17:56,772 --> 00:17:57,424
in the company.

463
00:17:57,813 --> 00:17:59,052
We got three funding rounds,

464
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:00,292
and expanded

465
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,732
from domestic to overseas markets.

466
00:18:01,813 --> 00:18:02,732
We established branches

467
00:18:02,893 --> 00:18:03,972
in New York, London,

468
00:18:04,052 --> 00:18:04,893
and Ottawa.

469
00:18:05,373 --> 00:18:05,853
Mr. Zhou.

470
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:09,212
And we signed a contract

471
00:18:09,252 --> 00:18:10,532
with a German institution.

472
00:18:10,613 --> 00:18:12,653
My plan is to collaborate with

473
00:18:12,653 --> 00:18:13,653
over 70 hospitals

474
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:14,613
in three years.

475
00:18:14,613 --> 00:18:15,692
(He is radiant with vigor,)

476
00:18:15,893 --> 00:18:17,252
(and full of ambitious spirit,)

477
00:18:17,772 --> 00:18:18,853
(just like he was)

478
00:18:18,893 --> 00:18:19,772
(when we first met.)

479
00:18:20,692 --> 00:18:21,732
(The only difference)

480
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:23,933
(might be his current outfit.)

481
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:25,972
(It looks casual,)

482
00:18:26,413 --> 00:18:27,613
(without flashy logos,)

483
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:29,972
(yet clearly expensive at first glance,)

484
00:18:30,653 --> 00:18:32,333
(perfectly embodying the image)

485
00:18:32,492 --> 00:18:33,772
(of a tech nouveau riche here.)

486
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,133
Moreover, I plan

487
00:18:35,173 --> 00:18:36,373
to go public on NASDAQ

488
00:18:36,413 --> 00:18:37,452
by next year's end.

489
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:41,052
- Have some water.
- Thanks.

490
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:44,012
When we first met,

491
00:18:44,173 --> 00:18:46,252
we were all novices.

492
00:18:46,613 --> 00:18:48,012
Now look at us.

493
00:18:49,732 --> 00:18:51,813
I've believed
in the mysticism of persistence.

494
00:18:52,212 --> 00:18:53,452
Persistence will get rewards.

495
00:18:53,573 --> 00:18:55,333
We achieve what we're determined to do.

496
00:18:59,052 --> 00:18:59,613
Xu Yan,

497
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:01,133
I know you married

498
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:02,413
Shen Haoming from Jinda Group.

499
00:19:02,692 --> 00:19:04,012
Jinda Group is top-tier

500
00:19:04,052 --> 00:19:05,093
in the construction field.

501
00:19:05,492 --> 00:19:07,133
Their Investment Division

502
00:19:07,173 --> 00:19:08,573
is also highly reputable.

503
00:19:09,613 --> 00:19:10,692
Given our relationship,

504
00:19:11,093 --> 00:19:12,173
I'll be direct.

505
00:19:12,373 --> 00:19:13,373
To be honest,

506
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,452
I came to you

507
00:19:15,492 --> 00:19:16,653
to connect through you

508
00:19:16,972 --> 00:19:17,772
with your husband.

509
00:19:18,413 --> 00:19:20,573
Collaborating with Jinda Group

510
00:19:20,772 --> 00:19:21,853
would benefit

511
00:19:22,093 --> 00:19:23,212
my company greatly.

512
00:19:29,212 --> 00:19:31,093
I deeply respect the industry

513
00:19:31,492 --> 00:19:32,732
and vision you've chosen.

514
00:19:34,893 --> 00:19:35,333
By the way,

515
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:37,012
could you first send me

516
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:38,732
your company's

517
00:19:38,853 --> 00:19:39,853
recent financial reports

518
00:19:39,893 --> 00:19:40,732
and business plans?

519
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:42,212
Then I'll tell my husband.

520
00:19:43,093 --> 00:19:44,933
No problem. I'll prepare it right away.

521
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:47,093
Thank you for your support.

522
00:19:47,573 --> 00:19:48,613
Not really.

523
00:19:49,292 --> 00:19:50,813
A worthwhile investment project

524
00:19:50,933 --> 00:19:52,613
can be beneficial, for my husband

525
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,212
and the group.

526
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:55,813
A win-win situation

527
00:19:56,972 --> 00:19:57,613
would be ideal.

528
00:20:00,452 --> 00:20:00,853
Mr. Zhou.

529
00:20:01,173 --> 00:20:02,333
Mr. Wang from Youkang Medical

530
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:03,173
is here again.

531
00:20:03,813 --> 00:20:04,333
We agreed...

532
00:20:06,532 --> 00:20:07,012
Zhou.

533
00:20:08,012 --> 00:20:08,452
Zhou.

534
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:09,732
I've tried to schedule you,

535
00:20:09,813 --> 00:20:10,772
but failed.

536
00:20:10,813 --> 00:20:12,560
Reserve this batch of equipment for me.

537
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,456
The price is flexible.

538
00:20:13,456 --> 00:20:15,613
Let's sign the contract today.

539
00:20:15,653 --> 00:20:16,080
No, no.

540
00:20:16,452 --> 00:20:16,976
Wang.

541
00:20:16,976 --> 00:20:18,093
I've been so busy lately.

542
00:20:18,212 --> 00:20:19,813
And I have a guest here today.

543
00:20:20,212 --> 00:20:20,813
Another day.

544
00:20:21,052 --> 00:20:21,413
Fine.

545
00:20:21,732 --> 00:20:23,212
You go ahead. I'll wait here.

546
00:20:25,373 --> 00:20:25,972
Then sorry.

547
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:26,813
Please wait here.

548
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:28,653
Wang, come with me.

549
00:20:29,173 --> 00:20:31,012
Listen, I've tried to schedule you.

550
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:32,252
I've been overwhelmed.

551
00:20:32,252 --> 00:20:32,732
Let's go.

552
00:20:35,312 --> 00:20:36,976
(New Medical Innovation Competition,
First Prize)

553
00:20:45,893 --> 00:20:46,532
Excuse me.

554
00:20:46,853 --> 00:20:47,692
Where's the restroom?

555
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:49,452
Go straight and turn left.

556
00:20:49,653 --> 00:20:50,333
Okay, thank you.

557
00:20:58,893 --> 00:21:00,012
I haven't had my break yet.

558
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:01,333
Yes.

559
00:21:01,653 --> 00:21:03,252
My current job is super easy.

560
00:21:03,732 --> 00:21:05,212
Just sit there doing nothing.

561
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:06,452
Five hundred a day.

562
00:21:06,893 --> 00:21:08,252
Much easier than the filming work.

563
00:21:09,133 --> 00:21:09,933
Want to join me?

564
00:21:10,613 --> 00:21:11,732
Let's come together.

565
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:14,573
Don't worry. No one notices you.

566
00:21:15,292 --> 00:21:16,532
Just sit at the desk

567
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:17,692
and pretend to work.

568
00:21:19,452 --> 00:21:19,853
Exactly.

569
00:21:21,252 --> 00:21:22,573
It's just a shell company.

570
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:23,813
Doesn't matter.

571
00:21:24,173 --> 00:21:25,252
They don't need skills.

572
00:21:38,653 --> 00:21:40,052
Can you show me?

573
00:21:43,972 --> 00:21:44,492
Of course.

574
00:21:46,532 --> 00:21:47,532
I-It's simple.

575
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,133
Under maintenance.

576
00:21:52,173 --> 00:21:53,853
Let me find Mr. Wang
over in Engineering.

577
00:22:01,532 --> 00:22:02,292
Hello.

578
00:22:02,492 --> 00:22:05,173
This is Shangze Xinhui
Medical Technology.

579
00:22:06,252 --> 00:22:09,692
Hello. This is Shangze Xinhui

580
00:22:10,252 --> 00:22:12,012

581
00:22:12,052 --> 00:22:13,813
comprehensive upgrades.

582
00:22:14,532 --> 00:22:15,972
Rest assured about our services.

feel free to contact us anytime.

586
00:22:31,173 --> 00:22:31,613
Liang.

587
00:22:32,212 --> 00:22:33,452
About the financial report,

588
00:22:33,492 --> 00:22:34,492
the CFO wants to see you.

589
00:22:34,772 --> 00:22:35,413
What?

590
00:22:36,252 --> 00:22:37,452
A payment from the 15th

591
00:22:37,492 --> 00:22:38,413
needs verification.

592
00:22:38,452 --> 00:22:39,853
A payment on the 15th?

593
00:22:50,608 --> 00:22:52,976
(Sales Department Archives)

594
00:23:12,252 --> 00:23:12,772
Xu Yan.

595
00:23:15,613 --> 00:23:16,492
Sorry to let you wait.

596
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:17,413
Mr. Wang left.

597
00:23:17,492 --> 00:23:18,573
Let's talk then.

598
00:23:21,012 --> 00:23:21,772
I didn't tell you

599
00:23:21,813 --> 00:23:22,772
I have plans tonight.

600
00:23:24,252 --> 00:23:24,692
It's okay.

601
00:23:25,532 --> 00:23:26,212
Call me.

602
00:23:26,373 --> 00:23:26,653
Okay.

603
00:24:02,292 --> 00:24:03,212
Honey, are you done?

604
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,093
Almost.

605
00:24:10,972 --> 00:24:11,532
By the way,

606
00:24:12,093 --> 00:24:13,212
is cousin still in Jingzhou?

607
00:24:16,853 --> 00:24:17,653
Probably.

608
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,052
She found a job?

609
00:24:24,173 --> 00:24:25,813
Selling cosmetics.

610
00:24:27,972 --> 00:24:28,613
Thank you.

611
00:24:30,813 --> 00:24:31,893
Let's treat her to a meal.

612
00:24:36,732 --> 00:24:37,373
Okay.

613
00:24:38,452 --> 00:24:39,252
However,

614
00:24:39,893 --> 00:24:41,373
she's working at a mall now.

615
00:24:42,012 --> 00:24:43,212
She might get off work late.

616
00:24:45,012 --> 00:24:45,573
It's okay.

617
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:46,573
Let her know

618
00:24:46,972 --> 00:24:49,052
I'll adjust to her schedule

619
00:24:49,413 --> 00:24:50,413
to show my sincerity.

620
00:24:51,772 --> 00:24:52,373
No problem.

621
00:24:53,052 --> 00:24:53,653
I'll tell her.

622
00:24:57,532 --> 00:24:58,292
Delicious.

623
00:25:10,452 --> 00:25:11,133
This way, please.

624
00:25:13,692 --> 00:25:15,093
So many koi fish here.

625
00:25:18,452 --> 00:25:19,692
Mind your words.

626
00:25:20,573 --> 00:25:21,133
Okay, okay.

627
00:25:29,252 --> 00:25:30,373
I've ordered some dishes.

628
00:25:30,692 --> 00:25:32,653
Let's see what else you'd like.

629
00:25:32,893 --> 00:25:34,212
I eat anything. Thank you.

630
00:25:35,532 --> 00:25:36,413
Any vegetable?

631
00:25:36,772 --> 00:25:38,373
Golden mushroom shreds,

632
00:25:38,492 --> 00:25:39,452
chrysanthemum moss,

633
00:25:39,732 --> 00:25:40,692
baby bok choy,

634
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:41,692
braised shallots,

635
00:25:41,813 --> 00:25:42,933
red peppers in sauce,

636
00:25:43,093 --> 00:25:44,052
counterfeit dish,

637
00:25:44,093 --> 00:25:45,692
and our signature stir-fry.

638
00:25:51,972 --> 00:25:52,413
Cousin,

639
00:25:53,692 --> 00:25:54,452
what do you want?

640
00:25:56,813 --> 00:25:57,692
I... I...

641
00:25:57,853 --> 00:25:59,093
Anything will do.

642
00:25:59,373 --> 00:26:01,532
Well, any spinach?

643
00:26:02,373 --> 00:26:03,333
Sorry, miss.

644
00:26:03,573 --> 00:26:05,133
We don't have a fixed menu here.

645
00:26:05,452 --> 00:26:06,853
Our menu changes daily based on

646
00:26:06,893 --> 00:26:09,333
the freshest seasonal ingredients
available at the market.

647
00:26:10,052 --> 00:26:11,573
Therefore, you can only order dishes

648
00:26:11,772 --> 00:26:12,292
on the menu.

649
00:26:14,212 --> 00:26:14,813
How about...?

650
00:26:16,173 --> 00:26:17,732
She prefers spinach.

651
00:26:18,373 --> 00:26:19,093
Go get some.

652
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:19,853
Thank you.

653
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:20,573
Yes, Mr. Shen.

654
00:26:21,093 --> 00:26:21,732
Thank you.

655
00:26:22,212 --> 00:26:22,933
Welcome.

656
00:26:23,212 --> 00:26:23,532
Here.

657
00:26:24,613 --> 00:26:24,933
Here.

658
00:26:25,452 --> 00:26:26,292
Welcome to Jingzhou.

659
00:26:26,532 --> 00:26:27,012
Thank you.

660
00:26:33,772 --> 00:26:35,492
Are you settling in well here?

661
00:26:35,933 --> 00:26:36,492
Very well.

662
00:26:36,853 --> 00:26:38,173
Both the food and accommodations.

663
00:26:39,012 --> 00:26:41,173
If you need any help,

664
00:26:41,413 --> 00:26:42,093
tell me anytime.

665
00:26:42,692 --> 00:26:43,813
I should be able to help.

666
00:26:44,373 --> 00:26:45,093
No need.

667
00:26:45,292 --> 00:26:46,012
Yan has been

668
00:26:46,052 --> 00:26:47,133
caring for me.

669
00:26:47,173 --> 00:26:47,933
My life now

670
00:26:47,972 --> 00:26:48,972
is back on track.

671
00:26:49,653 --> 00:26:50,452
Yan told me

672
00:26:50,492 --> 00:26:51,492
you're busy with work.

673
00:26:51,573 --> 00:26:52,972
Running such a large company,

674
00:26:53,173 --> 00:26:54,292
I shouldn't bother you.

675
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:55,292
We're family.

676
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:56,093
It's okay.

677
00:27:03,893 --> 00:27:05,133
You mentioned liking this dish,

678
00:27:05,813 --> 00:27:06,573
so I reserved it.

679
00:27:07,732 --> 00:27:08,853
I just mentioned it,

680
00:27:09,093 --> 00:27:10,093
yet you remembered.

681
00:27:10,452 --> 00:27:11,012
Try it?

682
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:11,972
No, you have it.

683
00:27:12,532 --> 00:27:13,893
I'm glad to see you two like this.

684
00:27:14,373 --> 00:27:15,933
Yan always

685
00:27:16,173 --> 00:27:18,133
praises you to me,

686
00:27:18,292 --> 00:27:19,893
saying you treat her so well.

687
00:27:20,212 --> 00:27:21,732
Witnessing it with my own eyes today,

688
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:22,653
it's wonderful.

689
00:27:28,853 --> 00:27:29,413
Thank you.

690
00:27:30,613 --> 00:27:31,093
Cousin,

691
00:27:31,532 --> 00:27:32,532
tell me more.

692
00:27:32,893 --> 00:27:34,173
What else did she say about me?

693
00:27:36,653 --> 00:27:37,893
She loves you deeply.

694
00:27:39,212 --> 00:27:40,893
Yan had always been top of her class.

695
00:27:41,133 --> 00:27:42,012
She studied hard,

696
00:27:42,173 --> 00:27:43,173
excelled in academic.

697
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:44,093
And she's pretty.

698
00:27:44,373 --> 00:27:45,333
Back in school,

699
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:46,212
she's a top student

700
00:27:46,252 --> 00:27:47,333
and the campus belle.

701
00:27:47,692 --> 00:27:49,333
Many boys wanted to pursue her.

702
00:27:49,893 --> 00:27:50,813
But Yan

703
00:27:50,853 --> 00:27:51,653
was only focused on

704
00:27:51,653 --> 00:27:52,413
her studies

705
00:27:52,452 --> 00:27:53,212
and ignored boys.

706
00:27:53,813 --> 00:27:54,772
I used to wonder,

707
00:27:54,813 --> 00:27:55,413
she is

708
00:27:55,492 --> 00:27:56,772
with such high standards,

709
00:27:56,893 --> 00:27:58,452
who could possibly win her heart?

710
00:27:59,052 --> 00:27:59,893
You're so lucky.

711
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,252
You are her first love.

712
00:28:06,613 --> 00:28:07,373
Really.

713
00:28:07,613 --> 00:28:08,853
When we were in school,

714
00:28:09,012 --> 00:28:10,532
she had zero interest in dating.

715
00:28:10,692 --> 00:28:11,492
To her,

716
00:28:11,532 --> 00:28:12,732
boys basically didn't exist.

717
00:28:12,853 --> 00:28:14,133
If the town had a girls' school,

718
00:28:14,252 --> 00:28:15,813
she would've transferred there.

719
00:28:18,012 --> 00:28:18,853
Were you two

720
00:28:18,893 --> 00:28:19,893
studying together?

721
00:28:21,012 --> 00:28:22,532
I remember Yan told me

722
00:28:22,613 --> 00:28:25,413
your hometown is Jincheng, Shanxi.

723
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:36,492
Well...

724
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:37,413
Good memory!

725
00:28:39,452 --> 00:28:39,972
Yes.

726
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:40,813
I...

727
00:28:42,173 --> 00:28:44,532
I wasn't good at studying.

728
00:28:44,573 --> 00:28:45,544
In high school,

729
00:28:45,544 --> 00:28:46,384
I repeated two grades

730
00:28:46,384 --> 00:28:47,212
and transferred to

731
00:28:47,252 --> 00:28:48,653
Yan's school

732
00:28:48,732 --> 00:28:50,732
for remedial classes.

733
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:52,093
So we ended up studying together.

734
00:28:55,413 --> 00:28:55,813
Excuse me,

735
00:28:55,933 --> 00:28:56,653
allow me to serve.

736
00:28:58,692 --> 00:28:59,933
She's exactly the same.

737
00:29:00,012 --> 00:29:01,413
Back in school,

738
00:29:01,893 --> 00:29:03,373
she'd always interrupt the teachers.

739
00:29:03,573 --> 00:29:04,573
She still does it now.

740
00:29:05,492 --> 00:29:06,653
Try the spinach.

741
00:29:07,653 --> 00:29:08,093
Here.

742
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:08,972
Don't be shy.

743
00:29:10,893 --> 00:29:11,732
We should

744
00:29:11,732 --> 00:29:12,573
meet up more often.

745
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:14,012
I really enjoy hearing you

746
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:15,012
talk about Yan's past.

747
00:29:15,292 --> 00:29:16,373
Sure, no problem.

748
00:29:19,173 --> 00:29:20,813
(Mind your words.)

749
00:29:20,972 --> 00:29:21,653
But I'm busy.

750
00:29:22,972 --> 00:29:23,972
You two just go dating.

751
00:29:24,093 --> 00:29:24,972
I'm glad that you two

752
00:29:25,012 --> 00:29:25,772
get along well.

753
00:29:28,813 --> 00:29:29,853
Here, have some more.

754
00:29:33,373 --> 00:29:34,173
Yan isn't the type

755
00:29:34,853 --> 00:29:36,133
to fall for anyone easily.

756
00:29:36,813 --> 00:29:38,173
But once she does,

757
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:40,012
it's for a lifetime.

758
00:29:43,492 --> 00:29:44,772
You better cherish her, okay?

759
00:29:48,692 --> 00:29:49,373
Don't worry.

760
00:29:50,093 --> 00:29:50,653
I will.

761
00:29:51,813 --> 00:29:52,333
Good.

762
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:00,613
Here.

763
00:30:09,853 --> 00:30:10,492
By the way,

764
00:30:10,933 --> 00:30:12,212
any plans after the meal?

765
00:30:15,933 --> 00:30:16,452
There is

766
00:30:16,933 --> 00:30:18,012
a Sky Lounge here

767
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:19,893
where you can see

768
00:30:19,933 --> 00:30:21,653
the Jingzhou's night view.

769
00:30:22,012 --> 00:30:22,692
It's stunning.

770
00:30:22,893 --> 00:30:23,813
I take her there often.

771
00:30:24,373 --> 00:30:25,573
Why not mention it sooner?

772
00:30:25,732 --> 00:30:26,813
We made plans

773
00:30:26,853 --> 00:30:27,692
to go shopping.

774
00:30:29,933 --> 00:30:31,333
But the Sky Lounge is amazing.

775
00:30:31,613 --> 00:30:32,853
It's a must-see in Jingzhou.

776
00:30:33,492 --> 00:30:34,212
Another day?

777
00:30:35,413 --> 00:30:35,853
Sure.

778
00:30:36,853 --> 00:30:37,292
Next time.

779
00:30:40,093 --> 00:30:40,573
Excuse me.

780
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:45,893
Eat raw food?

781
00:30:45,972 --> 00:30:46,853
Yes, okay.

782
00:30:46,893 --> 00:30:47,292
Eat it.

783
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:47,972
Okay, thanks.

784
00:30:48,212 --> 00:30:48,573
Here.

785
00:30:49,012 --> 00:30:49,532
I'll do it.

786
00:30:49,772 --> 00:30:50,252
Alright.

787
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:51,532
Thank you.

788
00:31:15,133 --> 00:31:16,613
You talked quite a lot today.

789
00:31:18,532 --> 00:31:19,413
Think I enjoy this?

790
00:31:19,813 --> 00:31:20,933
Just to let him know

791
00:31:20,972 --> 00:31:21,813
you love him deeply.

792
00:31:23,492 --> 00:31:24,093
Why?

793
00:31:25,933 --> 00:31:27,413
I consulted a lawyer.

794
00:31:27,692 --> 00:31:28,972
The lawyer said

795
00:31:29,373 --> 00:31:30,813
as long as your relationship

796
00:31:30,813 --> 00:31:31,573
is genuine,

797
00:31:31,813 --> 00:31:33,052
and the man believes

798
00:31:33,093 --> 00:31:33,813
you love him,

799
00:31:33,853 --> 00:31:35,012
while he loves you too,

800
00:31:35,413 --> 00:31:36,452
and then even if the truth

801
00:31:36,492 --> 00:31:37,692
comes out,

802
00:31:37,972 --> 00:31:38,893
as long as he chooses

803
00:31:38,933 --> 00:31:39,772
to stand by you,

804
00:31:39,813 --> 00:31:41,252
you won't be put in jail.

805
00:31:50,252 --> 00:31:51,492
Don't think this means

806
00:31:51,532 --> 00:31:52,893
I approve of what you're doing.

807
00:31:53,813 --> 00:31:54,373
Have any idea

808
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:55,613
what I felt today

809
00:31:55,653 --> 00:31:58,093
hearing those dishes name?

810
00:31:58,492 --> 00:32:00,613
I felt so worried.

811
00:32:00,692 --> 00:32:01,532
So scary!

812
00:32:03,252 --> 00:32:04,732
You must've been scared too, right?

813
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:08,012
Why that look?

814
00:32:11,813 --> 00:32:12,333
Nothing.

815
00:32:13,853 --> 00:32:14,972
I just want to say that

816
00:32:17,532 --> 00:32:19,093
you could join us for meals more often

817
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:20,933
to upgrade your dining.

818
00:32:24,972 --> 00:32:26,732
Not afraid I'll reveal your secret

819
00:32:26,772 --> 00:32:27,933
and cause you trouble?

820
00:32:30,093 --> 00:32:31,653
It's okay. Not that bad.

821
00:32:33,212 --> 00:32:33,853
That works.

822
00:32:34,573 --> 00:32:36,173
Then I'll just keep brainwashing him,

823
00:32:36,452 --> 00:32:38,052
and reminding him how much you love him.

824
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,052
No need.

825
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:43,972
He can feel

826
00:32:44,012 --> 00:32:45,012
how much I love him.

827
00:32:45,772 --> 00:32:46,933
Don't be that confident.

828
00:32:47,573 --> 00:32:48,893
Men are oblivious.

829
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:50,173
Think he understands,

830
00:32:50,373 --> 00:32:51,212
what if he

831
00:32:51,252 --> 00:32:52,413
feels nothing at all?

832
00:32:52,692 --> 00:32:53,853
Watched those TV commercials,

833
00:32:53,893 --> 00:32:54,452
didn't you?

834
00:32:54,653 --> 00:32:55,492
Remind him

835
00:32:55,653 --> 00:32:56,413
again and again.

836
00:32:56,452 --> 00:32:58,012
Even it means countless times.

837
00:32:58,012 --> 00:32:58,933
To let him remember

838
00:32:59,093 --> 00:33:00,093
how much you love him.

839
00:33:04,613 --> 00:33:05,653
I saw you smiling.

840
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,492
What's funny?

841
00:33:10,052 --> 00:33:10,972
You're quite adorable.

842
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:12,133
Talk less.

843
00:33:12,972 --> 00:33:14,333
Well, I know

844
00:33:14,373 --> 00:33:15,653
I'm adorable.

845
00:33:17,173 --> 00:33:18,292
But listen.

846
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:19,692
You still need

847
00:33:19,732 --> 00:33:20,452
to talk it out

848
00:33:20,492 --> 00:33:21,613
to your husband, okay?

849
00:33:26,692 --> 00:33:27,732
Feels like we haven't

850
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,133
walked like this in ages, right?

851
00:33:38,692 --> 00:33:39,532
Cool!

852
00:33:39,732 --> 00:33:41,452
Exactly. So cool!

853
00:33:57,692 --> 00:33:58,532
What are you seeing?

854
00:33:59,653 --> 00:34:00,492
Nothing.

855
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:01,613
Let's go home.

856
00:34:08,452 --> 00:34:09,132
Qiao Yan.

857
00:34:12,012 --> 00:34:12,853
Take it.

858
00:34:14,612 --> 00:34:15,572
What's this about?

859
00:34:16,092 --> 00:34:16,853
Keep it.

860
00:34:17,572 --> 00:34:18,213
I don't want it.

861
00:34:18,733 --> 00:34:19,853
Just take it.

862
00:34:20,132 --> 00:34:21,532
You always came

863
00:34:21,612 --> 00:34:22,813
to see this thing,

864
00:34:23,012 --> 00:34:24,012
so I'll give you mine.

865
00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:25,532
What about you?

866
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:27,413
My birthday is next month.

867
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:29,012
I'll have my parents buy me

868
00:34:29,052 --> 00:34:29,972
a new MP4 player.

869
00:34:32,213 --> 00:34:33,492
Alright, try it.

870
00:34:33,933 --> 00:34:34,933
The sound is great.

871
00:34:44,853 --> 00:34:46,172
Can you hear it?

872
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:48,532
No sound.

873
00:34:49,572 --> 00:34:50,532
Impossible.

874
00:34:54,452 --> 00:34:55,572
Can you hear it now?

875
00:34:59,012 --> 00:34:59,933
There are

876
00:35:00,092 --> 00:35:01,333
all my favorite songs in it.

877
00:35:02,572 --> 00:35:03,652
You can download

878
00:35:03,693 --> 00:35:04,853
your favorite songs.

879
00:35:04,972 --> 00:35:05,532
Okay.

880
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:07,333
Do you like the music?

881
00:35:07,492 --> 00:35:08,092
It's good.

882
00:35:17,012 --> 00:35:17,813
The night view

883
00:35:17,813 --> 00:35:19,213
is truly stunning.

884
00:35:22,132 --> 00:35:23,652
Sky Lounge, right?

885
00:35:23,853 --> 00:35:25,012
When do you take me there?

886
00:35:26,293 --> 00:35:27,132
Anytime.

887
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:29,293
Sky Lounge.

888
00:35:29,532 --> 00:35:31,213
I want to visit the museum,

889
00:35:31,652 --> 00:35:32,172
anime expos,

890
00:35:32,492 --> 00:35:33,733
water parks,

891
00:35:33,893 --> 00:35:34,532
and that

892
00:35:35,172 --> 00:35:35,693
aquarium.

893
00:35:42,213 --> 00:35:43,213
Ruyi!

894
00:35:43,293 --> 00:35:44,893
From now on, you're my horse.

895
00:35:45,132 --> 00:35:46,213
I'll take good care of you.

896
00:35:46,773 --> 00:35:47,253
Haochen.

897
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:50,293
Haochen.

898
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:51,612
Are you hot?

899
00:35:55,452 --> 00:35:57,132
Haoming had things to do,

900
00:35:57,373 --> 00:35:57,933
so I'm here.

901
00:35:59,092 --> 00:35:59,452
Look!

902
00:36:00,172 --> 00:36:00,773
This...

903
00:36:02,052 --> 00:36:02,813
The cooling spray.

904
00:36:02,893 --> 00:36:03,452
Feel cooler?

905
00:36:07,693 --> 00:36:09,012
Switched horses already?

906
00:36:09,413 --> 00:36:10,492
This horse is cool!

907
00:36:11,612 --> 00:36:12,612
Cooler than the last one.

908
00:36:13,253 --> 00:36:14,413
I just talked

909
00:36:14,452 --> 00:36:15,213
with your coach.

910
00:36:15,492 --> 00:36:16,132
He said

911
00:36:17,012 --> 00:36:18,253
after switching horses,

912
00:36:18,492 --> 00:36:19,373
take it slow

913
00:36:19,413 --> 00:36:20,333
and gradually adapt

914
00:36:20,733 --> 00:36:21,532
to the rhythm

915
00:36:21,572 --> 00:36:22,813
and movement.

916
00:36:23,172 --> 00:36:24,452
After you mount,

917
00:36:24,532 --> 00:36:25,293
be careful.

918
00:36:25,693 --> 00:36:26,652
And after that...

919
00:36:26,972 --> 00:36:27,693
Go away.

920
00:36:30,092 --> 00:36:30,693
Let's go.

921
00:36:31,092 --> 00:36:32,213
Be careful, Haochen.

922
00:37:25,733 --> 00:37:26,253
Haochen!

923
00:37:30,576 --> 00:37:33,904
(Jingzhou Yuekang Hospital)

924
00:37:34,813 --> 00:37:35,373
Haochen.

925
00:37:35,813 --> 00:37:36,452
This bone broth

926
00:37:36,492 --> 00:37:37,532
was simmered

927
00:37:37,572 --> 00:37:38,612
for three hours.

928
00:37:39,172 --> 00:37:40,293
It has Chinese herbs

929
00:37:40,373 --> 00:37:41,092
to help your leg

930
00:37:41,172 --> 00:37:42,293
recover soon.

931
00:37:42,813 --> 00:37:43,452
Look at you.

932
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:45,213
Why were you so careless?

933
00:37:45,893 --> 00:37:47,213
It wasn't his fault,

934
00:37:47,492 --> 00:37:48,652
but that riding club's fault.

935
00:37:48,972 --> 00:37:49,452
Understood?

936
00:37:49,652 --> 00:37:50,452
The coaches' fault.

937
00:37:51,092 --> 00:37:52,293
I'll find you a better club.

938
00:37:52,373 --> 00:37:53,012
Their coaches

939
00:37:53,132 --> 00:37:54,572
are all former professional racers

940
00:37:54,652 --> 00:37:55,333
with medals.

941
00:37:56,773 --> 00:37:58,693
You injured seriously.

942
00:37:59,413 --> 00:38:00,972
Don't move around out of impatience.

943
00:38:01,293 --> 00:38:02,012
It'd be terrible

944
00:38:02,172 --> 00:38:03,333
if you don't recover, got it?

945
00:38:04,132 --> 00:38:04,773
Hear that?

946
00:38:04,813 --> 00:38:05,773
Mom, Dad.

947
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:07,132
Caregiver.

948
00:38:07,253 --> 00:38:07,612
Good.

949
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,293
Hello.

950
00:38:11,452 --> 00:38:12,132
I'm his mother.

951
00:38:12,492 --> 00:38:13,693
He has a fracture.

952
00:38:13,773 --> 00:38:14,972
Don't let him off his bed.

953
00:38:15,132 --> 00:38:16,413
We're counting on you.

954
00:38:16,733 --> 00:38:17,253
Trust me.

955
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:18,052
Thank you.

956
00:38:18,172 --> 00:38:18,733
- Thank you.
- One last sip.

957
00:38:19,972 --> 00:38:20,532
Haochen.

958
00:38:20,893 --> 00:38:21,773
Dad and I

959
00:38:21,813 --> 00:38:23,172
have an engagement.

960
00:38:23,413 --> 00:38:24,492
We'll come tomorrow.

961
00:38:25,213 --> 00:38:25,813
We're leaving.

962
00:38:26,572 --> 00:38:27,893
Dinner with Shifeng's executives.

963
00:38:29,253 --> 00:38:29,652
Good boy.

964
00:38:31,132 --> 00:38:31,652
Yan.

965
00:38:31,733 --> 00:38:32,333
Thank you.

966
00:38:32,452 --> 00:38:33,012
Thank you.

967
00:38:33,052 --> 00:38:33,532
Okay.

968
00:38:35,893 --> 00:38:36,373
I'll do it.

969
00:38:36,452 --> 00:38:36,813
Here.

970
00:38:37,012 --> 00:38:38,092
Let me feed you, okay?

971
00:38:38,213 --> 00:38:38,773
Haoming.

972
00:38:44,933 --> 00:38:45,373
I need...

973
00:38:45,413 --> 00:38:46,213
I'm running late

974
00:38:46,452 --> 00:38:47,052
for a dinner.

975
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:49,813
Talk later.

976
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:54,333
Here, take a sip.

977
00:39:10,612 --> 00:39:11,813
Come on. Drink more.

978
00:39:12,172 --> 00:39:12,492
Here.

979
00:39:13,012 --> 00:39:13,333
Right.

980
00:39:13,733 --> 00:39:14,052
Good.

981
00:39:30,652 --> 00:39:31,333
No more drinking.

982
00:39:32,132 --> 00:39:32,813
No more?

983
00:39:33,293 --> 00:39:35,733
Then... how about some fruits?

984
00:39:36,052 --> 00:39:36,572
Okay?

985
00:39:36,933 --> 00:39:37,452
Look.

986
00:39:37,532 --> 00:39:38,733
Pick something you like.

987
00:39:38,972 --> 00:39:40,172
I don't eat fruits.

988
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:40,572
This...

989
00:39:41,293 --> 00:39:41,773
What's up?

990
00:39:41,773 --> 00:39:42,452
No!

991
00:39:42,893 --> 00:39:44,132
Leave! I don't want you!

992
00:39:44,213 --> 00:39:45,092
Just say it.

993
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,052
- Leave!
- Why hit me?

994
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:46,612
Outrageous!

995
00:39:46,652 --> 00:39:47,092
What's up?

996
00:39:47,373 --> 00:39:47,693
No.

997
00:39:47,773 --> 00:39:49,012
Leave!

998
00:39:49,492 --> 00:39:51,373
Stop talking to me!

999
00:39:52,132 --> 00:39:52,773
Stop it!

1000
00:39:52,816 --> 00:39:53,712
- Leave!
- I quit!

1001
00:39:55,373 --> 00:39:55,972
I'm sorry.

1002
00:39:56,092 --> 00:39:56,773
So sorry.

1003
00:39:56,813 --> 00:39:57,253
I quit.

1004
00:39:57,413 --> 00:39:58,452
What about more money?

1005
00:39:58,492 --> 00:39:59,333
No way.

1006
00:39:59,853 --> 00:40:01,052
Never seen a child like this.

1007
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:02,092
I can't do it.

1008
00:40:35,213 --> 00:40:36,733
I don't want to see you. Leave!

1009
00:40:39,172 --> 00:40:39,853
I refuse.

1010
00:40:40,253 --> 00:40:40,652
You!

1011
00:40:41,373 --> 00:40:41,652
You!

1012
00:40:41,693 --> 00:40:42,293
Kick me out.

1013
00:40:43,092 --> 00:40:43,733
Come down here.

1014
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:46,253
It hurts.

1015
00:40:46,452 --> 00:40:47,052
Can't get down.

1016
00:40:48,733 --> 00:40:49,532
Listen.

1017
00:40:49,933 --> 00:40:50,652
You'll stay in bed

1018
00:40:51,612 --> 00:40:52,933
for four weeks.

1019
00:40:54,092 --> 00:40:55,092
Your parents

1020
00:40:55,213 --> 00:40:55,693
and Haoming

1021
00:40:56,532 --> 00:40:58,052
entrust you to me.

1022
00:40:59,492 --> 00:41:00,693
During these four weeks,

1023
00:41:01,773 --> 00:41:02,933
behave yourself.

1024
00:41:04,052 --> 00:41:05,132
Otherwise,

1025
00:41:06,853 --> 00:41:07,652
you'll suffer.

1026
00:41:17,052 --> 00:41:17,652
Fine.

1027
00:41:18,532 --> 00:41:20,092
If you stay here,

1028
00:41:21,092 --> 00:41:22,253
get me some fruits.

1029
00:41:25,293 --> 00:41:26,733
Take those leftover ones.

1030
00:41:29,972 --> 00:41:30,413
I...

1031
00:41:32,612 --> 00:41:34,012
I-I want water.

1032
00:41:45,532 --> 00:41:48,172
Hurry up! I'm dying of thirst!

1033
00:42:01,132 --> 00:42:02,293
It's too cold.

1034
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:03,733
I always drink

1035
00:42:03,773 --> 00:42:04,933
warm water.

1036
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:06,333
Knock it off.

1037
00:42:09,373 --> 00:42:10,172
This is a hospital.

1038
00:42:11,373 --> 00:42:13,172
You don't know me.

1039
00:42:14,492 --> 00:42:15,733
I-I need food.

1040
00:42:31,213 --> 00:42:32,893
I can't reach the fruit.

1041
00:42:32,933 --> 00:42:33,652
Feed me one.

1042
00:42:33,933 --> 00:42:35,012
Feed me this meal too.

1043
00:42:37,532 --> 00:42:38,373
Your hands are hurt?

1044
00:42:39,773 --> 00:42:41,132
The doctor never said that.

1045
00:42:41,813 --> 00:42:42,413
Eat it.

1046
00:42:45,853 --> 00:42:46,853
When Haoming was here,

1047
00:42:46,893 --> 00:42:47,853
you treated me well.

1048
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:49,492
Now that he's gone,

1049
00:42:49,773 --> 00:42:50,733
you're bullying me?

1050
00:42:50,773 --> 00:42:51,813
When Haoming was here,

1051
00:42:51,853 --> 00:42:52,773
you were like an angel.

1052
00:42:52,972 --> 00:42:54,693
Now that he's gone, you're bullying me?

1053
00:42:55,612 --> 00:42:56,373
I'm injured.

1054
00:42:56,413 --> 00:42:57,972
I-I'm a kid!

1055
00:42:58,172 --> 00:42:59,012
If you bully me,

1056
00:42:59,773 --> 00:43:01,293
my brother will punish you.

1057
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:02,813
Alright.

1058
00:43:04,773 --> 00:43:05,360
Skip the meal.

1059
00:43:08,853 --> 00:43:09,413
Stop it.

1060
00:43:09,813 --> 00:43:11,492
What?

1061
00:43:14,612 --> 00:43:15,253
What's wrong?

1062
00:43:17,893 --> 00:43:18,733
I'll call the doctor.

1063
00:43:18,773 --> 00:43:19,213
Wait.

1064
00:43:19,612 --> 00:43:20,853
Hey,

1065
00:43:20,972 --> 00:43:22,933
I need to pee.

1066
00:43:23,293 --> 00:43:24,733
Just say it.

1067
00:43:25,213 --> 00:43:26,172
Don't you see

1068
00:43:26,213 --> 00:43:27,532
I'm clutching my stomach?

1069
00:43:32,213 --> 00:43:32,773
Is this okay?

1070
00:43:33,773 --> 00:43:34,213
I'll help.

1071
00:43:34,572 --> 00:43:35,452
No! I'll do it myself.

1072
00:43:39,893 --> 00:43:40,773
