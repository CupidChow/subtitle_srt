Well done.

You're so clever.

Let's do it again!

Come on. It's inedible.

00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:12,672
You can't eat it.

41
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:13,511
Ms. Yu.

42
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:14,431
Come on.

43
00:02:15,071 --> 00:02:15,711
Come here.

44
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:16,591
Ms. Yu.

45
00:02:17,032 --> 00:02:18,192
I bought you a scarf,

46
00:02:18,632 --> 00:02:20,112
the latest fashion.

47
00:02:20,231 --> 00:02:21,591
I hope you'll like it.

48
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:27,431
Miss Xu.

49
00:02:27,431 --> 00:02:28,112
Next time I...

50
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:30,911
Miss Xu, what did you buy?

51
00:02:30,952 --> 00:02:31,512
Let me see.

52
00:02:33,232 --> 00:02:34,352
A cashmere scarf?

53
00:02:35,512 --> 00:02:36,311
Miss Xu.

54
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:37,992
You're mistaken.

55
00:02:38,631 --> 00:02:40,591
Your future mother-in-law

56
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,591
prefers a solid-colored scarf

57
00:02:43,112 --> 00:02:44,751
without printed patterns.

58
00:02:45,992 --> 00:02:47,191
Ms. Ma.

59
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:49,672
If she hasn't paid much attention,

60
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,191
how would she know?

61
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:53,031
Then you should be careful.

62
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:55,272
Or you'll make a fool of yourself again.

63
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:56,311
Miss Xu.

64
00:02:56,992 --> 00:02:58,232
Cashmere scarves

65
00:02:58,272 --> 00:03:00,072
have many details to consider.

66
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:03,112
The higher the thread count,
the softer it is.

67
00:03:03,232 --> 00:03:04,871
She definitely won't

68
00:03:05,272 --> 00:03:06,792
wear the scarf you bought.

69
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:07,952
Bu.

70
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:08,952
Over here.

71
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:09,952
Sweetheart.

72
00:03:10,471 --> 00:03:11,191
Bu.

73
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:11,792
Here you are.

74
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,151
Thank you.

75
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:16,871
Amy, come.

76
00:03:28,471 --> 00:03:29,112
Miss Xu.

77
00:03:30,952 --> 00:03:32,352
The scarf Miss Xu bought

78
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:33,392
is Italian,

79
00:03:33,392 --> 00:03:34,751
100% cashmere.

80
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:35,751
It's good stuff.

81
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:37,512
Back then,

82
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:38,792
when I was at school,

83
00:03:39,031 --> 00:03:39,911
I didn't study hard.

84
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:41,311
I always ran off to travel.

85
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:42,431
When short on money,

86
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:43,471
I traded cashmere scarves

87
00:03:43,552 --> 00:03:44,431
for cash.

88
00:03:45,031 --> 00:03:46,352
That's why it's called cashmere.

89
00:03:48,272 --> 00:03:48,911
I already

90
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:50,352
have many scarves of the same color.

91
00:03:50,672 --> 00:03:52,352
It suits your fair complexion.

92
00:03:53,072 --> 00:03:54,112
Keep it for yourself.

93
00:03:58,072 --> 00:03:58,672
I have to go.

94
00:03:58,711 --> 00:03:59,552
Look, Bu.

95
00:04:01,352 --> 00:04:02,232
Brilliant!

96
00:04:03,751 --> 00:04:04,352
Come here.

97
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:05,911
Bu.

98
00:04:06,751 --> 00:04:07,512
Bu.

99
00:04:09,631 --> 00:04:10,232
Lan.

100
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:12,832
I think that girl

101
00:04:13,112 --> 00:04:14,871
has poor taste in every aspect.

102
00:04:15,711 --> 00:04:16,792
Think again.

103
00:04:17,392 --> 00:04:18,711
Don't rush the engagement.

104
00:04:30,152 --> 00:04:30,792
Claire.

105
00:04:32,152 --> 00:04:32,592
Come.

106
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:48,992
All done?

107
00:04:50,672 --> 00:04:51,511
Miss Xu.

108
00:04:51,951 --> 00:04:53,191
You're so kind.

109
00:04:53,352 --> 00:04:54,552
Very easygoing.

110
00:04:54,552 --> 00:04:55,992
You're even shopping with me.

111
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:57,831
Haochen and Haoming

112
00:04:57,871 --> 00:04:58,592
both love

113
00:04:58,592 --> 00:05:00,071
your cooking so much.

114
00:05:00,271 --> 00:05:01,191
You master

115
00:05:01,431 --> 00:05:02,271
both Chinese

116
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,751
and Western cuisine.

117
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:04,992
Hui.

118
00:05:05,032 --> 00:05:06,511
You must teach me how to cook.

119
00:05:07,311 --> 00:05:08,831
With enough practice,

120
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:10,271
you gain experience.

121
00:05:10,992 --> 00:05:11,592
Miss Xu.

122
00:05:11,992 --> 00:05:13,071
Grab me a box of lychees.

123
00:05:13,552 --> 00:05:14,032
Sure.

124
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:18,431
Is this okay?

125
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:20,032
Yes, absolutely.

126
00:05:20,032 --> 00:05:20,792
I'll put it in.

127
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:21,431
Thanks.

128
00:05:21,592 --> 00:05:22,071
No problem.

129
00:05:22,152 --> 00:05:22,592
Here.

130
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:27,472
Hui.

131
00:05:28,552 --> 00:05:30,352
I found another advantage of you.

132
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:32,311
You take good care

133
00:05:32,352 --> 00:05:33,191
of Ms. Yu's family.

134
00:05:33,552 --> 00:05:34,792
And you also

135
00:05:35,071 --> 00:05:36,672
care for her friends.

136
00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:38,191
You're a perfect domestic worker.

137
00:05:39,032 --> 00:05:40,112
Miss Xu.

138
00:05:41,112 --> 00:05:42,191
People like Ms. Meng

139
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:43,912
aren't as easygoing as you.

140
00:05:44,352 --> 00:05:45,712
They're all calculating.

141
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:46,831
Ms. Yu

142
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:48,152
spends much time with them.

143
00:05:48,592 --> 00:05:50,032
If they badmouth me,

144
00:05:50,071 --> 00:05:51,311
I'll lose my job.

145
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:54,431
But from what I see,

146
00:05:54,472 --> 00:05:55,992
Ms. Yu is an independent lady.

147
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:58,152
She actually listens to them?

148
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:03,352
Miss Xu.

149
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,271
I genuinely think you're a good girl,

150
00:06:06,311 --> 00:06:07,311
so I'm telling you this.

151
00:06:09,032 --> 00:06:10,071
In the past,

152
00:06:10,472 --> 00:06:11,792
someone tried to set Haoming up

153
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:13,032
with a girlfriend.

154
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:15,071
But that girl

155
00:06:15,592 --> 00:06:16,191
just couldn't

156
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:17,592
win Ms. Yu's friends over.

157
00:06:17,831 --> 00:06:19,152
They all

158
00:06:19,152 --> 00:06:20,352
chimed in

159
00:06:21,071 --> 00:06:22,552
and eventually convinced Ms. Yu.

160
00:06:22,831 --> 00:06:23,751
So, Ms. Yu

161
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:25,472
rejected that girl outright.

162
00:06:27,191 --> 00:06:28,431
Ms. Yu's friends

163
00:06:29,232 --> 00:06:30,672
hold significant influence, huh?

164
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:31,951
You said it.

165
00:06:32,472 --> 00:06:34,232
Those whom they dislike

166
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,992
won't be accepted by Ms. Yu.

167
00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:37,032
They're critical

168
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:38,672
of Ms. Yu's daughter-in-law.

169
00:06:44,552 --> 00:06:45,152
Hui.

170
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:47,032
Wait a moment.

171
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:48,871
Are two boxes enough?

172
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:53,552
In this season,

173
00:06:53,592 --> 00:06:54,472
cherries are a must.

174
00:06:54,871 --> 00:06:55,871
I remember

175
00:06:55,912 --> 00:06:56,831
you love cherries.

176
00:06:57,191 --> 00:06:58,152
I'll buy them for you.

177
00:06:58,792 --> 00:06:59,112
Go.

178
00:06:59,112 --> 00:07:00,751
These two boxes cost hundreds!

179
00:07:00,751 --> 00:07:01,472
This is too much.

180
00:07:01,472 --> 00:07:02,672
Take them for your children.

181
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:04,951
Thank you then.

182
00:07:07,271 --> 00:07:08,352
I forgot to buy shrimp.

183
00:07:08,831 --> 00:07:09,472
Let's buy it.

184
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:09,951
Alright.

185
00:07:15,232 --> 00:07:15,871
(I know)

186
00:07:16,992 --> 00:07:17,951
(Yu Lan and her friends)

187
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:19,311
(haven't truly accepted me.)

188
00:07:21,271 --> 00:07:22,391
(To marry Haoming,)

189
00:07:22,831 --> 00:07:24,592
(I must fully fit into the family)

190
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:25,631
(and the circle.)

191
00:07:27,352 --> 00:07:28,311
(My only option)

192
00:07:29,152 --> 00:07:30,631
(is to take the initiative.)

193
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:44,552
Nice shot!

194
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:45,592
Take a break.

195
00:07:49,912 --> 00:07:51,871
It feels good to sweat.

196
00:07:51,992 --> 00:07:53,352
It is hot today,

197
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:54,511
right?

198
00:07:56,592 --> 00:07:57,191
Coach.

199
00:07:57,751 --> 00:07:58,951
Let's take it easy today.

200
00:07:58,951 --> 00:07:59,352
Yes.

201
00:07:59,352 --> 00:08:00,472
Wipe your sweat.

202
00:08:00,472 --> 00:08:00,792
Hurry.

203
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:01,712
I'm sweaty.

204
00:08:02,352 --> 00:08:03,112
It's so hot.

205
00:08:03,112 --> 00:08:04,592
Ms. Yu is as energetic as ever.

206
00:08:04,831 --> 00:08:05,511
Absolutely!

207
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,472
After all, I do yoga every day.

208
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:24,191
You invited her?

209
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:28,712
Yes.

210
00:08:28,831 --> 00:08:29,951
She's free today,

211
00:08:30,032 --> 00:08:31,431
so I asked her here.

212
00:08:31,472 --> 00:08:33,071
It's a chance to get to know her.

213
00:08:33,352 --> 00:08:34,511
Unexpectedly,

214
00:08:34,672 --> 00:08:35,792
she can't play tennis.

215
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:37,951
Have you met her parents?

216
00:08:39,592 --> 00:08:40,112
Yes.

217
00:08:40,592 --> 00:08:41,712
They're intellectuals.

218
00:08:42,672 --> 00:08:43,968
They've lived abroad for years.

219
00:08:44,552 --> 00:08:45,071
Her father

220
00:08:45,112 --> 00:08:46,688
is a professor at Syracuse University.

221
00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:51,791
No wonder she's so well-mannered.

222
00:08:52,472 --> 00:08:53,352
She is

223
00:08:54,031 --> 00:08:55,031
quite sensible.

224
00:08:56,671 --> 00:08:58,511
To marry into Ms. Yu's family,

225
00:08:58,712 --> 00:09:00,112
she has to be sensible.

226
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:02,551
I think

227
00:09:02,631 --> 00:09:04,192
she is low-key and unassuming.

228
00:09:04,671 --> 00:09:05,952
She is not simple, anyway.

229
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:12,472
Miss Xu.

230
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:13,712
No need to do this.

231
00:09:13,712 --> 00:09:14,671
The coach will

232
00:09:14,712 --> 00:09:15,551
collect these balls.

233
00:09:15,712 --> 00:09:17,232
I can do it quickly.

234
00:09:17,551 --> 00:09:18,791
So you won't have to wait long.

235
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:20,712
Miss Xu.

236
00:09:23,112 --> 00:09:24,232
You really don't have to.

237
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:25,472
You're doing just fine.

238
00:09:25,992 --> 00:09:26,631
Just relax.

239
00:09:26,751 --> 00:09:28,312
Don't be on edge all the time.

240
00:09:28,952 --> 00:09:30,592
Sometimes, being too tense

241
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:31,911
is not good.

242
00:09:34,631 --> 00:09:35,871
Thanks, Meiling.

243
00:09:39,432 --> 00:09:40,432
Ms. Yu.

244
00:09:41,551 --> 00:09:42,671
Ms. Meng, Ms. Ma.

245
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:44,112
What a coincidence!

246
00:09:44,352 --> 00:09:45,671
You're here too.

247
00:09:46,952 --> 00:09:47,671
Ms. Meng.

248
00:09:47,871 --> 00:09:48,751
You look much slimmer

249
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:49,832
than the last time we met.

250
00:09:51,112 --> 00:09:52,192
Not really.

251
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:53,151
Honestly,

252
00:09:53,232 --> 00:09:54,192
you've lost weight.

253
00:09:54,312 --> 00:09:55,312
I've been

254
00:09:55,391 --> 00:09:56,072
to some parties

255
00:09:56,072 --> 00:09:57,271
with my husband.

256
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:58,511
Some late nights made me

257
00:09:58,551 --> 00:09:59,312
gain weight.

258
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:00,031
Really?

259
00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:01,352
You're not showing at all.

260
00:10:01,432 --> 00:10:02,112
- Exactly!
- You think?

261
00:10:02,112 --> 00:10:03,031
You're not showing.

262
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:03,751
Please.

263
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:04,832
We all know

264
00:10:04,832 --> 00:10:05,832
you're a social person.

265
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,511
Without you, your husband

266
00:10:07,592 --> 00:10:08,832
wouldn't have met Mr. Zheng

267
00:10:08,832 --> 00:10:10,232
and secured the biggest project.

268
00:10:11,832 --> 00:10:12,592
That's just

269
00:10:12,671 --> 00:10:13,551
part of my job.

270
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,551
You're luckier than me.

271
00:10:14,832 --> 00:10:16,432
You have a good husband and a good son.

272
00:10:16,712 --> 00:10:18,232
I'm just born to worry too much.

273
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,671
I-I've been the same lately.

274
00:10:20,952 --> 00:10:22,232
You know what?

275
00:10:22,271 --> 00:10:23,791
I've been hitting the gym daily.

276
00:10:24,192 --> 00:10:25,112
My husband

277
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,551
tries to do business with the CEO

278
00:10:26,551 --> 00:10:27,232
of Boyue Group.

279
00:10:27,391 --> 00:10:28,871
His wife happens to

280
00:10:28,871 --> 00:10:30,031
be a fashion designer.

281
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,992
To get closer

282
00:10:30,992 --> 00:10:31,832
to her, I need

283
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:33,072
to squeeze

284
00:10:33,072 --> 00:10:34,832
into the outfits she designs.

285
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,031
Going all out for your husband?

286
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:39,551
Demand a bigger bonus this year!

287
00:10:40,232 --> 00:10:42,312
Ms. Yu, stop teasing me!

288
00:10:43,631 --> 00:10:44,592
I'm telling you,

289
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:46,031
a socially adept wife

290
00:10:46,232 --> 00:10:47,832
is essential to her husband's business.

291
00:10:47,911 --> 00:10:49,151
Some bachelors

292
00:10:49,192 --> 00:10:50,511
focus solely on work.

293
00:10:50,631 --> 00:10:51,472
They're competent,

294
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:53,352
but without a wife's support,

295
00:10:53,432 --> 00:10:54,791
they're like one-legged men,

296
00:10:54,832 --> 00:10:55,712
unable to get far.

297
00:10:56,312 --> 00:10:57,712
Remember the last gathering?

298
00:10:57,832 --> 00:10:58,592
Ms. Qu is here.

299
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:10,271
Ms. Qu is here.

300
00:11:10,352 --> 00:11:11,712
Ms. Qu, you're finally here!

301
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:13,112
- You finally came.
- You made it!

302
00:11:13,151 --> 00:11:14,151
We haven't started yet.

303
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:15,192
You should've begun.

304
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:15,871
Take a seat.

305
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:16,472
Ms. Qu.

306
00:11:16,472 --> 00:11:17,952
Your complexion looks much better

307
00:11:17,952 --> 00:11:19,232
than last time.

308
00:11:19,391 --> 00:11:20,352
Truly,

309
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:22,352
you look so well.

310
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:24,631
By the way, Ms. Qu,

311
00:11:24,832 --> 00:11:25,712
I heard your husband

312
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:26,871
landed major projects.

313
00:11:27,992 --> 00:11:29,312
He never stays idle.

314
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:30,352
I keep telling him

315
00:11:30,671 --> 00:11:31,992
health matters more than money.

316
00:11:34,072 --> 00:11:34,671
Ms. Qu,

317
00:11:35,031 --> 00:11:36,312
could you have your husband

318
00:11:36,432 --> 00:11:37,992
help my husband?

319
00:11:38,592 --> 00:11:38,952
Let's go

320
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:39,551
and play.

321
00:11:39,592 --> 00:11:40,472
Come on.

322
00:11:40,712 --> 00:11:41,192
Let's go.

323
00:11:46,712 --> 00:11:47,712
Coach, I need a break.

324
00:11:47,712 --> 00:11:48,352
- Let me help.
- I'm tired.

325
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:50,352
Thanks, Miss Xu.

326
00:11:50,391 --> 00:11:50,992
No problem.

327
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:54,592
Have some water.

328
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,712
Thanks.

329
00:11:58,511 --> 00:11:59,671
Who is that?

330
00:12:00,232 --> 00:12:02,072
That is the director of Lanshan Capital,

331
00:12:02,271 --> 00:12:03,671
and also Mr. Xiao's wife.

332
00:12:04,511 --> 00:12:05,592
Lanshan Capital

333
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:06,671
is hot these days.

334
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:09,151
Women want to use her connections

335
00:12:09,192 --> 00:12:10,511
to benefit their own husbands.

336
00:12:12,391 --> 00:12:13,112
Impressive.

337
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,631
Women try to please her.

338
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:17,911
She is very proud.

339
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:20,192
I once asked my friend

340
00:12:20,232 --> 00:12:21,432
to arrange a meeting with her.

341
00:12:22,072 --> 00:12:23,352
But she put on airs

342
00:12:23,671 --> 00:12:24,352
and refused.

343
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:10,791
Go.

344
00:13:10,992 --> 00:13:15,511
Two, two, three, four.

345
00:13:16,112 --> 00:13:16,871
One.

346
00:13:17,312 --> 00:13:18,112
Two.

347
00:13:18,592 --> 00:13:19,671
Three.

348
00:13:30,271 --> 00:13:30,832
Not bad.

349
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:32,031
You're dancing very well.

350
00:13:32,671 --> 00:13:33,592
Let's try

351
00:13:33,592 --> 00:13:34,432
one more move.

352
00:13:34,432 --> 00:13:35,031
Okay.

353
00:13:35,432 --> 00:13:36,391
Watch me.

354
00:13:38,671 --> 00:13:39,271
See?

355
00:13:39,391 --> 00:13:40,271
Two wrist rotations.

356
00:13:40,551 --> 00:13:41,432
One up

357
00:13:41,551 --> 00:13:42,352
and one down.

358
00:13:42,432 --> 00:13:43,871
Combine two into one move.

359
00:13:44,072 --> 00:13:44,751
So one up,

360
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:45,391
and one down.

361
00:13:45,432 --> 00:13:46,352
Sure. Try it.

362
00:13:46,911 --> 00:13:48,871
One up, one down.

363
00:13:49,312 --> 00:13:49,871
Well?

364
00:13:50,072 --> 00:13:50,511
Like this?

365
00:13:50,511 --> 00:13:51,271
Too hard.

366
00:13:51,271 --> 00:13:52,192
Watch me again.

367
00:13:53,031 --> 00:13:53,511
Like this.

368
00:13:54,871 --> 00:13:56,192
My friend told me

369
00:13:56,631 --> 00:13:57,551
that Ms. Qu

370
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,911
doesn't have many hobbies,

371
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,432
except being crazy about Kunqu Opera.

372
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:02,952
She even funded

373
00:14:02,952 --> 00:14:04,072
a Kunqu Opera competition

374
00:14:04,112 --> 00:14:05,151
for amateurs.

375
00:14:09,352 --> 00:14:11,232
Up, down.

376
00:14:11,232 --> 00:14:11,871
Not like that.

377
00:14:12,511 --> 00:14:13,352
Take your time.

378
00:14:17,312 --> 00:14:17,952
Let me show you.

379
00:14:17,952 --> 00:14:18,871
This is so hard.

380
00:14:18,952 --> 00:14:19,832
It is challenging.

381
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:20,712
Here, watch.

382
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:22,952
One, two.

383
00:14:23,151 --> 00:14:24,472
One, two, yes.

384
00:14:24,871 --> 00:14:25,391
Today

385
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:26,631
is our first lesson.

386
00:14:26,671 --> 00:14:27,271
So,

387
00:14:27,312 --> 00:14:28,671
we'll start

388
00:14:28,671 --> 00:14:29,592
with the basics.

389
00:14:29,712 --> 00:14:30,992
- The opera...
- Ma'am!

390
00:14:31,352 --> 00:14:32,031
Excuse me,

391
00:14:33,592 --> 00:14:34,952
can you just teach me how to

392
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:36,031
swing sleeves?

393
00:14:36,631 --> 00:14:37,551
Swing sleeves.

394
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:40,192
Haste makes waste.

395
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:41,511
You're a beginner.

396
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:42,911
I suggest we start

397
00:14:42,952 --> 00:14:43,791
with the basics.

398
00:14:44,911 --> 00:14:45,952
I have a question.

399
00:14:46,992 --> 00:14:48,751
If I practice day and night,

400
00:14:49,151 --> 00:14:50,472
how long until I master it?

401
00:14:50,832 --> 00:14:51,952
At least a month.

402
00:14:52,031 --> 00:14:52,671
So we should

403
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,031
start with the basics.

404
00:14:54,151 --> 00:14:54,992
You have to

405
00:14:54,992 --> 00:14:55,832
be patient.

406
00:14:56,432 --> 00:14:56,911
No.

407
00:14:58,952 --> 00:15:00,192
I only learn water sleeves.

408
00:15:02,232 --> 00:15:04,031
Doing water sleeves, remember

409
00:15:04,072 --> 00:15:04,832
not to use

410
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:06,352
your upper arm.

411
00:15:06,352 --> 00:15:08,791
Use wrist and forearm.

412
00:15:09,112 --> 00:15:10,391
Switching sides,

413
00:15:10,671 --> 00:15:11,151
it's

414
00:15:11,312 --> 00:15:12,952
one up, one down.

415
00:15:12,992 --> 00:15:14,352
Up, down.

416
00:15:14,712 --> 00:15:15,072
Correct.

417
00:15:15,151 --> 00:15:16,712
Keep them flat.

418
00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:18,992
Your upper arms shouldn't

419
00:15:19,192 --> 00:15:20,592
exert too much force.

420
00:15:21,112 --> 00:15:22,592
Same with both hands.

421
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:24,992
See? The upper arms barely move.

422
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:27,232
Let your forearms and wrists lead.

423
00:15:27,952 --> 00:15:29,112
Then turn.

424
00:15:30,232 --> 00:15:32,432
Up, down. Up, down.

425
00:15:33,271 --> 00:15:34,031
Give it a try.

426
00:15:36,432 --> 00:15:38,072
Use your forearm and wrist.

427
00:15:38,112 --> 00:15:38,631
Like this.

428
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:39,592

Tenosynovitis.

447
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:28,192
Typing too much causes this.

448
00:16:28,352 --> 00:16:28,952

Go back and rest.

00:16:50,472 --> 00:16:51,631
That's all for today's class.

461
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,232
Ma'am.

462
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:54,352
Can I stay here

463
00:16:54,352 --> 00:16:54,992
and practice?

464
00:16:55,151 --> 00:16:55,671
Sure.

465
00:16:55,751 --> 00:16:56,871
No one's using it later.

466
00:16:56,911 --> 00:16:57,631
Keep practicing.

467
00:16:57,832 --> 00:16:58,271

(Grandma)
It's different.

473
00:17:09,551 --> 00:17:11,952
Kunqu Opera emphasizes posture

474
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:13,791
and techniques.

475
00:17:13,871 --> 00:17:15,192
Practice is essential.

476
00:17:17,072 --> 00:17:17,551
By the way,

477
00:17:17,992 --> 00:17:19,751
the hospital's follow-up report

478
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,071
came back.

479
00:17:21,232 --> 00:17:23,071
Your cholesterol levels are still high.

480
00:17:23,192 --> 00:17:24,551
So I got you fish oil capsules.

481
00:17:24,632 --> 00:17:25,392
Three times daily,

482
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,192
take them half an hour before meals.

483
00:17:27,232 --> 00:17:27,831
Remember

484
00:17:27,872 --> 00:17:28,672
to take them daily.

485
00:17:30,271 --> 00:17:30,751
Okay.

486
00:17:31,271 --> 00:17:32,432
Send them by courier.

487
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:34,551
I will

488
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:35,672
send them all.

489
00:17:35,744 --> 00:17:36,832
Remember to collect them.

490
00:17:37,712 --> 00:17:38,192
Okay.

491
00:17:39,311 --> 00:17:40,551
How's your Kunqu Opera practice

492
00:17:40,551 --> 00:17:41,632
coming along?

493
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,271
Did the teacher comment

494
00:17:43,392 --> 00:17:44,712
on your progress?

495
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:46,912
The teacher praised me,

496
00:17:46,912 --> 00:17:48,111
saying I'm learning fast.

497
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:50,551
I should thank you.

498
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:52,111
You always told me as a kid,

499
00:17:52,432 --> 00:17:54,311
"Learn various skills.

500
00:17:54,472 --> 00:17:56,111
Having more never burdens you."

501
00:17:56,392 --> 00:17:57,632
So the teacher praised me.

502
00:17:57,992 --> 00:17:58,992
Right?

503
00:17:59,232 --> 00:18:01,591
Listen to me more. It pays off.

504
00:18:01,672 --> 00:18:03,232
Okay, I will.

505
00:18:05,872 --> 00:18:07,271
Well, one more thing,

506
00:18:07,392 --> 00:18:09,472
do you have time to come visit me?

507
00:18:11,712 --> 00:18:12,712
After I

508
00:18:14,392 --> 00:18:15,511
finish this busy period.

509
00:18:15,952 --> 00:18:16,632
Then I'll return

510
00:18:16,632 --> 00:18:17,712
to keep you company.

511
00:18:18,351 --> 00:18:19,551
I even bought you a set

512
00:18:19,591 --> 00:18:20,872
of Kunqu Opera costumes.

513
00:18:21,111 --> 00:18:22,311
I'll teach you then.

514
00:18:22,472 --> 00:18:23,311
We'll both practice.

515
00:18:25,192 --> 00:18:26,912
Okay, you go ahead.

516
00:18:27,111 --> 00:18:28,311
I'm going to sleep.

517
00:18:29,031 --> 00:18:30,232
Okay, go and rest.

518
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,432
It's already late.

519
00:18:31,992 --> 00:18:33,271
Sleep soon. Goodnight.

520
00:19:15,831 --> 00:19:17,071
Focus on your waist movement.

521
00:19:18,311 --> 00:19:19,111
Side waist.

522
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:20,472
Watch the hands.

523
00:19:20,551 --> 00:19:21,311
Final pose.

524
00:19:21,472 --> 00:19:22,591
Finish with the waist.

525
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:23,591
Yes.

526
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:24,472
Right.

527
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:26,152
Good.

528
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:26,712
Excellent.

529
00:19:26,872 --> 00:19:28,192
That's all for today's lesson.

530
00:19:28,392 --> 00:19:29,632
Go rest early.

531
00:19:30,152 --> 00:19:30,591
Ma'am.

532
00:19:30,672 --> 00:19:31,192
I know.

533
00:19:31,432 --> 00:19:32,031
Extra time?

534
00:19:32,232 --> 00:19:32,712
Okay.

535
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:33,192
Bye.

536
00:19:33,192 --> 00:19:33,712
Thanks.

537
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:41,111
Miss.

538
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:43,432
Is that girl new here?

539
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,472
I haven't seen her before.

540
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:45,472
Right, she's new here.

541
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:46,551
She's smart.

542
00:19:46,672 --> 00:19:47,751
She achieved this in days.

543
00:19:53,351 --> 00:19:54,071
Hello.

544
00:19:55,632 --> 00:19:56,111
Hello.

545
00:19:56,152 --> 00:19:57,952
I noticed your water sleeve techniques

546
00:19:58,472 --> 00:19:59,591
are excellent.

547
00:19:59,712 --> 00:20:00,392
Thank you.

548
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:01,672
The teacher mentioned

549
00:20:01,672 --> 00:20:02,952
you just started learning?

550
00:20:03,712 --> 00:20:05,311
I've loved it since childhood.

551
00:20:05,912 --> 00:20:07,672
Back then, I just found it beautiful.

552
00:20:08,632 --> 00:20:09,712
Now that I'm older,

553
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,751
I finally grasp its deeper essence.

554
00:20:12,232 --> 00:20:13,311
So I'm studying it now.

555
00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:14,992
That's rare.

556
00:20:15,472 --> 00:20:17,351
To be so young
and already love Kunqu Opera.

557
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:19,351
Likewise, I've loved it since childhood.

558
00:20:19,872 --> 00:20:20,551
We're organizing

559
00:20:20,551 --> 00:20:22,392
a Kunqu Opera enthusiasts competition.

560
00:20:22,912 --> 00:20:24,071
I'm the organizer.

561
00:20:24,311 --> 00:20:25,152
I was thinking,

562
00:20:25,351 --> 00:20:26,511
as the organizer,

563
00:20:26,712 --> 00:20:27,872
if I couldn't perform,

564
00:20:27,912 --> 00:20:28,912
people might laugh at me.

565
00:20:29,111 --> 00:20:30,591
So I came here to learn intensively.

566
00:20:31,071 --> 00:20:31,831
By the way,

567
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,152
I'm Qu Li.

568
00:20:34,551 --> 00:20:35,432
Hello, Ms. Li.

569
00:20:36,432 --> 00:20:37,152
I'm Xu Yan.

570
00:20:37,591 --> 00:20:38,791
You're talented.

571
00:20:38,992 --> 00:20:40,152
You should join

572
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:40,872
our competition.

573
00:20:41,111 --> 00:20:41,751
No problem.

574
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:43,672
Wonderful!

575
00:20:44,472 --> 00:20:45,632
The class has ended.

576
00:20:45,831 --> 00:20:46,872
Let's practice together.

577
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,192
Help me get the rhythm right.

578
00:20:48,672 --> 00:20:49,271
Perfect.

579
00:20:49,311 --> 00:20:50,551
I was just needing a break.

580
00:20:50,952 --> 00:20:51,791
Let me observe you.

581
00:20:51,992 --> 00:20:53,672
My water sleeves

582
00:20:54,311 --> 00:20:55,591
never flow properly.

583
00:20:55,632 --> 00:20:57,232
Can you find out what's wrong?

584
00:20:57,271 --> 00:20:57,992
Look. See?

585
00:20:58,031 --> 00:20:59,351
I can't move them like you do.

586
00:20:59,831 --> 00:21:00,751
Try keeping

587
00:21:01,351 --> 00:21:02,632
some space between your body

588
00:21:02,632 --> 00:21:03,632
and your sleeves.

589
00:21:03,712 --> 00:21:05,071
Toss them outward slightly.

590
00:21:05,271 --> 00:21:06,271
- A gentle toss.
- Like this?

591
00:21:06,271 --> 00:21:06,712
Right.

592
00:21:06,952 --> 00:21:08,432
Release and retrieve smoothly.

593
00:21:08,551 --> 00:21:09,031
Right.

594
00:21:09,432 --> 00:21:09,872
Right.

595
00:21:09,952 --> 00:21:11,904
Maintain distance between
your hands and torso.

596
00:21:12,232 --> 00:21:12,712
Right.

597
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:13,351
Like this,

598
00:21:13,551 --> 00:21:14,511
they'll flow naturally.

599
00:21:15,472 --> 00:21:16,111
That's right.

600
00:21:17,712 --> 00:21:18,311
Got it.

601
00:21:18,392 --> 00:21:19,952
You pinpoint key details well.

602
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:21,591
That's it.

603
00:21:43,632 --> 00:21:44,712
I need to take this call.

604
00:21:44,751 --> 00:21:45,111
Okay.

605
00:21:49,591 --> 00:21:50,311
Zhao?

606
00:21:52,232 --> 00:21:52,831
Yes.

607
00:21:52,992 --> 00:21:53,791
That

608
00:21:55,071 --> 00:21:56,192
Rhine International School.

609
00:21:56,192 --> 00:21:56,551
Yes.

610
00:21:59,392 --> 00:22:00,551
It's for Hao.

611
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:04,311
They have

612
00:22:04,311 --> 00:22:05,992
absolutely no vacancies?

613
00:22:08,712 --> 00:22:09,472
Alright.

614
00:22:15,591 --> 00:22:17,111
You must have prior training.

615
00:22:17,152 --> 00:22:18,432
Judging by your posture,

616
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:19,912
you've surely studied dance.

617
00:22:20,432 --> 00:22:21,551
No, I haven't.

618
00:22:22,111 --> 00:22:23,192
Actually, I'm a TV host.

619
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:25,031
A host?

620
00:22:25,152 --> 00:22:26,071
What show?

621
00:22:26,591 --> 00:22:27,111
Family Feast.

622
00:22:27,351 --> 00:22:28,031
Seen it?

623
00:22:29,591 --> 00:22:30,472
Wait, I think

624
00:22:30,472 --> 00:22:31,432
I've watched your show.

625
00:22:31,472 --> 00:22:32,791
It features celebrities

626
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:33,712
cooking together?

627
00:22:33,912 --> 00:22:34,472
Right.

628
00:22:35,031 --> 00:22:35,751
But we're

629
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:37,192
revamping the format.

630
00:22:37,511 --> 00:22:38,872
We're planning to invite

631
00:22:38,952 --> 00:22:40,591
influential women from various fields

632
00:22:40,952 --> 00:22:41,511
to join us.

633
00:22:44,271 --> 00:22:44,872
I'm sorry.

634
00:22:45,311 --> 00:22:46,271
But I'm needed

635
00:22:46,472 --> 00:22:47,111
somewhere else.

636
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:01,751
Qu Li?

637
00:23:02,271 --> 00:23:03,311
She'll really come?

638
00:23:04,872 --> 00:23:05,791
Of course.

639
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:08,432
That's why I'm inviting you

640
00:23:08,632 --> 00:23:10,192
to join Family Feast.

641
00:23:11,152 --> 00:23:12,111
Miss Xu,

642
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,791
if Ms. Qu is coming,
I'll definitely be there.

643
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,111
Meiling,

644
00:23:17,351 --> 00:23:19,511
I've prepared a provisional guest list.

645
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:21,351
Please see if there's anyone you know.

646
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:22,992
For the show recording,

647
00:23:23,192 --> 00:23:24,551
having familiar faces around

648
00:23:24,992 --> 00:23:25,952
would be better.

649
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:27,311
Miss Xu,

650
00:23:27,952 --> 00:23:29,351
good thing you came to ask me.

651
00:23:29,672 --> 00:23:30,351
You should know

652
00:23:30,551 --> 00:23:31,912
there's a lot of tension

653
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:33,111
among these women.

654
00:23:34,992 --> 00:23:36,232
Let me explain in detail.

655
00:24:00,712 --> 00:24:01,872
You want to replace guests?

656
00:24:01,912 --> 00:24:02,351
Yes.

657
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:04,472
Here's the revised proposal.

658
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,232
Xiao Nanpeng's wife?

659
00:24:14,511 --> 00:24:15,392
Lanshan Capital's

660
00:24:15,591 --> 00:24:17,071
global executive partner.

661
00:24:18,472 --> 00:24:19,551
She's agreed

662
00:24:19,551 --> 00:24:20,751
to join our next episode.

663
00:24:22,511 --> 00:24:23,672
What about other guests?

664
00:24:24,232 --> 00:24:25,511
We've already secured Ms. Qu.

665
00:24:26,071 --> 00:24:26,831
I believe

666
00:24:26,992 --> 00:24:28,632
female representatives from other fields

667
00:24:29,271 --> 00:24:30,392
shouldn't be an issue.

668
00:24:34,632 --> 00:24:35,432
Mr. Zhou,

669
00:24:35,632 --> 00:24:36,311
our show has been

670
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:37,311
running for three years.

671
00:24:38,472 --> 00:24:39,111
Nowadays,

672
00:24:39,152 --> 00:24:40,511
celebrities are losing interest

673
00:24:40,511 --> 00:24:41,591
in our format.

674
00:24:42,511 --> 00:24:44,791
We need to reignite audience engagement.

675
00:24:45,872 --> 00:24:48,271
Besides keeping celebrity guests,

676
00:24:48,712 --> 00:24:50,351
we should invite

677
00:24:50,632 --> 00:24:52,632
influential figures from various fields

678
00:24:52,632 --> 00:24:53,311
to participate.

679
00:24:53,712 --> 00:24:55,351
This could create fresh dynamics.

680
00:24:56,192 --> 00:24:57,712
If the show delivers,

681
00:24:58,232 --> 00:24:59,311
viewers will naturally want

682
00:25:00,511 --> 00:25:02,111
to join future episodes.

683
00:25:02,511 --> 00:25:03,872
This is an excellent idea.

684
00:25:04,472 --> 00:25:05,192
I support you.

685
00:25:06,912 --> 00:25:08,152
But I have one condition.

686
00:25:10,472 --> 00:25:11,992
Resubmit my request

687
00:25:13,551 --> 00:25:14,232
to transition

688
00:25:14,511 --> 00:25:15,472
to hosting.

689
00:25:19,912 --> 00:25:20,831
I'll make it happen.

690
00:25:21,791 --> 00:25:22,672
Just go for it.

691
00:25:25,632 --> 00:25:26,432
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

692
00:25:39,351 --> 00:25:39,992
Ms. Li,

693
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:41,472
I understand

694
00:25:41,872 --> 00:25:42,912
you have zero interest

695
00:25:42,952 --> 00:25:44,111
in joining our show.

696
00:25:44,591 --> 00:25:45,791
Then why approach me?

697
00:25:46,271 --> 00:25:47,311
What if it's a show

698
00:25:47,831 --> 00:25:49,712
tailor-made for you?

699
00:25:53,376 --> 00:25:54,111
(Special Guest: An Yaqin)

700
00:25:54,111 --> 00:25:55,992
A board member
of Rhine International School

701
00:25:57,511 --> 00:25:58,232
will be attending.

702
00:25:59,311 --> 00:26:00,152
You investigated me?

703
00:26:01,751 --> 00:26:02,831
Just trying to assist.

704
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:05,632
I could meet them

705
00:26:05,712 --> 00:26:06,952
without your help.

706
00:26:08,751 --> 00:26:09,872
With your capabilities,

707
00:26:10,672 --> 00:26:12,111
connecting with them is possible,

708
00:26:12,511 --> 00:26:14,351
but building relationships quickly

709
00:26:15,111 --> 00:26:16,192
isn't that easy.

710
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:18,311
Through a TV show,

711
00:26:18,591 --> 00:26:19,551
you could naturally

712
00:26:19,551 --> 00:26:20,591
develop friendships.

713
00:26:21,351 --> 00:26:22,472
It's mutually beneficial.

714
00:26:24,192 --> 00:26:24,712
Right?

715
00:26:26,831 --> 00:26:27,712
Unfortunately,

716
00:26:28,271 --> 00:26:29,232
I don't cook.

717
00:26:30,031 --> 00:26:30,952
How about being

718
00:26:30,992 --> 00:26:32,071
the Kunqu Opera

719
00:26:32,111 --> 00:26:33,232
competition's initiator?

720
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:37,672
Join our show,

721
00:26:38,192 --> 00:26:40,232
and I'll create a special segment

722
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:41,872
showcasing Kunqu Opera for you.

723
00:26:42,472 --> 00:26:43,912
Joining our show

724
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:44,912
would both

725
00:26:44,912 --> 00:26:46,311
help promote Kunqu Opera

726
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:48,071
and allow you to connect

727
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,511
with like-minded individuals.

728
00:26:50,511 --> 00:26:51,632
Most importantly,

729
00:26:52,192 --> 00:26:53,551
the broadcast could spread

730
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:55,351
Kunqu Opera's beauty

731
00:26:55,551 --> 00:26:57,031
to wider audiences.

732
00:26:57,591 --> 00:26:58,232
You've devoted

733
00:26:58,232 --> 00:26:59,632
your life to this art form.

734
00:27:00,511 --> 00:27:01,712
Isn't this what you want?

735
00:27:04,632 --> 00:27:05,432
Additionally,

736
00:27:06,672 --> 00:27:08,232
I'm willing to host

737
00:27:09,351 --> 00:27:10,392
your opera fan competition

738
00:27:10,392 --> 00:27:11,472
free of charge.

739
00:27:12,071 --> 00:27:13,232
Though I wonder

740
00:27:14,111 --> 00:27:15,511
if I'm worthy of this honor.

741
00:27:39,432 --> 00:27:40,912
Thank you so much, Ms. Li,

742
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,031
for using a traditional Chinese opera,

743
00:27:43,031 --> 00:27:43,616
Kunqu Opera,

744
00:27:43,712 --> 00:27:44,791
to give us

745
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:45,872
such a magnificent opening.

746
00:27:49,232 --> 00:27:50,472
First, let me introduce

747
00:27:50,472 --> 00:27:52,152
today's distinguished new guests.

748
00:27:52,831 --> 00:27:53,952
The renowned actress,

749
00:27:53,992 --> 00:27:55,152
Ms. Xue Yuqing.

750
00:27:55,472 --> 00:27:55,992
Hello.

751
00:27:55,992 --> 00:27:57,632
I'm Xue Yuqing, an actress.

752
00:27:57,791 --> 00:27:58,872
Welcome to our show.

753
00:27:59,271 --> 00:28:00,791
National Class-A Public Nutritionist,

754
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:01,952
Ms. He Jingshu.

755
00:28:02,071 --> 00:28:02,912
Hello.

756
00:28:03,031 --> 00:28:04,872
Board member
of Rhine International School,

757
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:06,311
Ms. An Yaqin.

758
00:28:08,712 --> 00:28:11,111
And young female entrepreneur
representative,

759
00:28:11,511 --> 00:28:12,591
Ms. Sun Meiling.

760
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,791
Welcome, all of you.

761
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:14,551
By the way,

762
00:28:15,271 --> 00:28:16,192
Ms. Yuqing,

763
00:28:16,311 --> 00:28:18,432
I heard your new drama

764
00:28:18,632 --> 00:28:19,751
is currently trending.

765
00:28:20,111 --> 00:28:21,351
In the series, you play

766
00:28:21,351 --> 00:28:23,071
a strong-willed

767
00:28:23,111 --> 00:28:24,111
female imperial chef.

768
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:26,551
What dishes

769
00:28:28,192 --> 00:28:29,432
left a deep impression

770
00:28:29,432 --> 00:28:30,071
on you?

771
00:28:31,992 --> 00:28:33,152
Qianlong-style cabbage,

772
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:34,872
cherry-braised pork,

773
00:28:35,031 --> 00:28:36,672
and braised deer tendon.

774
00:28:36,831 --> 00:28:37,672
When you participate

775
00:28:37,712 --> 00:28:39,392
in the cooking process,

776
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,351
you realize

777
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:41,511
the craftsmanship,

778
00:28:41,591 --> 00:28:42,551
the precision,

779
00:28:42,672 --> 00:28:44,152
and every detail involved

780
00:28:44,192 --> 00:28:45,071
culminate in

781
00:28:45,392 --> 00:28:46,472
truly achieving

782
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:48,791
acme in color, aroma, taste,
concept, and presentation.

783
00:28:49,472 --> 00:28:50,672
Well articulated.

784
00:28:51,351 --> 00:28:51,872
Ms. Li,

785
00:28:52,311 --> 00:28:53,912
your husband is known
in business circles

786
00:28:53,952 --> 00:28:56,432
as the 'Iron Man of Commerce'.

787
00:28:56,632 --> 00:28:58,591
He often works around the clock.

788
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:00,872
Caring for such a dedicated partner

789
00:29:00,992 --> 00:29:02,511
must be demanding.

790
00:29:02,831 --> 00:29:03,751
Could you share

791
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,672
your signature homemade dish

792
00:29:05,672 --> 00:29:06,271
with us?

793
00:29:06,751 --> 00:29:08,992
Xiao's work keeps him extremely busy.

794
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:10,751
In terms of diet,

795
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,031
we prioritize quick and simple meals.

796
00:29:13,311 --> 00:29:14,672
What we regularly prepare

797
00:29:15,511 --> 00:29:16,791
are staple foods,

798
00:29:16,952 --> 00:29:19,472
paired with light congee
and side dishes.

799
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:20,672
The Qianlong-style cabbage

800
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:22,111
you mentioned earlier

801
00:29:22,192 --> 00:29:23,912
is also Xiao's favorite.

802
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:26,472
It's Qianlong-style cabbage too.

803
00:29:26,992 --> 00:29:28,791
Why don't we have

804
00:29:28,912 --> 00:29:30,351
a live cooking challenge?

805
00:29:30,472 --> 00:29:33,152
Let's have Ms. Li and Ms. Yuqing

806
00:29:33,351 --> 00:29:34,511
both prepare that dish

807
00:29:34,632 --> 00:29:35,952
and see whose is more authentic.

808
00:29:38,992 --> 00:29:39,751
Meiling,

809
00:29:40,511 --> 00:29:42,071
I heard your culinary skills

810
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,031
are exceptional too.

811
00:29:43,872 --> 00:29:45,031
My husband particularly loves

812
00:29:45,031 --> 00:29:45,712
my cooking.

813
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:46,351
So

814
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:47,831
I cook for him daily.

815
00:29:48,952 --> 00:29:50,712
Then let me divide the teams.

816
00:29:51,632 --> 00:29:52,311
Meiling,

817
00:29:52,632 --> 00:29:54,551
you'll join Ms. Li

818
00:29:54,591 --> 00:29:55,551
and Ms. Yaqin.

819
00:29:56,152 --> 00:29:57,712
I'll team up with Ms. Jingshu

820
00:29:57,791 --> 00:29:58,632
and Ms. Yuqing.

821
00:29:58,672 --> 00:29:59,192
Okay?

822
00:29:59,232 --> 00:30:00,031
Wonderful.

823
00:30:01,031 --> 00:30:02,071
Let's move to

824
00:30:02,071 --> 00:30:03,192
our kitchen.

825
00:30:03,232 --> 00:30:04,152
(Family Feast)
Many of my friends' kids

826
00:30:04,152 --> 00:30:04,952
attend Rhein School.

827
00:30:05,232 --> 00:30:06,672
They all praise its excellent ethos.

828
00:30:06,952 --> 00:30:08,152
This is the most meticulously

829
00:30:08,351 --> 00:30:10,031
prepared cabbage I've ever seen.

830
00:30:10,192 --> 00:30:11,551
I learned this during filming.

831
00:30:11,831 --> 00:30:13,071
Need any assistance?

832
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:14,031
Not just yet.

833
00:30:14,152 --> 00:30:15,712
You can observe first.

834
00:30:15,751 --> 00:30:16,751
Should I add honey first?

835
00:30:16,872 --> 00:30:17,551
Absolutely.

836
00:30:17,591 --> 00:30:18,912
Honey is essential.

837
00:30:19,591 --> 00:30:20,472
That explains it.

838
00:30:20,632 --> 00:30:22,071
I hadn't added honey before,

839
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:22,831
so it tastes odd.

840
00:30:23,192 --> 00:30:24,672
Check their progress.

841
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:26,031
When making this dish,

842
00:30:26,111 --> 00:30:26,992
the taste's not right.

843
00:30:28,192 --> 00:30:28,872
What's going on?

844
00:30:28,992 --> 00:30:29,591
Someone

845
00:30:29,591 --> 00:30:31,311
is trying to steal our secret.

846
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:32,432
Ms. Yuqing,

847
00:30:32,912 --> 00:30:33,511
Ms. Jingshu,

848
00:30:33,591 --> 00:30:34,912
they secretly added honey.

849
00:30:35,591 --> 00:30:36,232
It's fine.

850
00:30:36,351 --> 00:30:37,472
We have our own secret too.

851
00:30:37,751 --> 00:30:38,912
Don't copy us now.

852
00:30:38,992 --> 00:30:40,432
This is Ms. Li's secret recipe.

853
00:30:40,432 --> 00:30:41,472
Looks nice on camera.

854
00:30:53,432 --> 00:30:54,192
Meiling.

855
00:30:54,872 --> 00:30:56,311
Your husband's building

856
00:30:56,472 --> 00:30:57,791
a hot spring resort in Wenzhou.

857
00:30:58,071 --> 00:31:00,271
He's been wanting
to discuss investments with Xiao.

858
00:31:00,511 --> 00:31:01,432
Now you helped him

859
00:31:01,432 --> 00:31:02,591
connect with Qu Li.

860
00:31:02,872 --> 00:31:03,912
It's a major contribution.

861
00:31:04,311 --> 00:31:05,351
Looks like

862
00:31:05,672 --> 00:31:07,632
the year-end bonus came early this year.

863
00:31:09,432 --> 00:31:10,472
You mean this?

864
00:31:11,551 --> 00:31:12,432
Just a small reward.

865
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:13,672
The year-end bonus

866
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:14,912
has to be something bigger.

867
00:31:18,192 --> 00:31:18,791
Stop watching.

868
00:31:18,872 --> 00:31:19,912
Let's chat for a bit.

869
00:31:20,351 --> 00:31:21,432
You see how I am,

870
00:31:21,632 --> 00:31:22,952
not photogenic and a bit chubby.

871
00:31:23,031 --> 00:31:23,872
Not bad.

872
00:31:24,232 --> 00:31:24,952
Looks good.

873
00:31:25,192 --> 00:31:26,632
If you say so, then it must be.

874
00:31:27,672 --> 00:31:28,591
Miss Xu,

875
00:31:29,311 --> 00:31:31,712
your show is quite interesting.

876
00:31:32,511 --> 00:31:33,712
Thank you, Ms. Ma.

877
00:31:35,192 --> 00:31:37,111
For the next Family Feast episode,

878
00:31:37,192 --> 00:31:38,672
Ms. Qu will still attend.

879
00:31:39,551 --> 00:31:41,632
Ms. Ma, Ms. Meng, I wonder

880
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:42,831
if you will have time.

881
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,192
Ms. Yu said

882
00:31:44,472 --> 00:31:46,071
she reserved spots for both of you.

883
00:31:48,152 --> 00:31:49,591
Ms. Yu,

884
00:31:50,031 --> 00:31:52,111
why are you so kind to us?

885
00:31:53,031 --> 00:31:53,872
Thanks.

886
00:31:54,271 --> 00:31:55,031
Of course.

887
00:31:55,031 --> 00:31:56,311
When good things happen,

888
00:31:56,511 --> 00:31:57,872
I think of my besties first.

889
00:31:58,271 --> 00:31:59,111
So when's

890
00:31:59,111 --> 00:31:59,992
the next episode?

891
00:32:00,511 --> 00:32:01,311
Monday.

892
00:32:02,031 --> 00:32:02,712
Monday?

893
00:32:03,392 --> 00:32:04,591
That's just a few days away.

894
00:32:05,992 --> 00:32:06,791
I'll go back first

895
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:07,551
to do my hair.

896
00:32:09,071 --> 00:32:11,591
I also need to go get a facial
and a manicure.

897
00:32:11,591 --> 00:32:12,831
I get it.

898
00:32:13,152 --> 00:32:14,031
Alright, Ms. Yu.

899
00:32:14,031 --> 00:32:14,791
Thank you.

900
00:32:14,912 --> 00:32:15,551
I'm leaving.

901
00:32:15,672 --> 00:32:15,992
Bye.

902
00:32:15,992 --> 00:32:16,712
See you Monday.

903
00:32:16,712 --> 00:32:17,111
Bye.

904
00:32:17,111 --> 00:32:17,872
- See you Monday.
- Bye.

905
00:32:17,952 --> 00:32:18,791
Thanks. See you.

906
00:32:20,351 --> 00:32:21,232
Miss Xu.

907
00:32:24,071 --> 00:32:25,511
So can I be

908
00:32:25,672 --> 00:32:26,472
on the next episode?

909
00:32:28,271 --> 00:32:29,591
Of course.

910
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,952
Ms. Yu said

911
00:32:31,031 --> 00:32:32,551
you looked especially dazzling on TV.

912
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:34,831
Then I should go back

913
00:32:34,831 --> 00:32:36,472
and make myself presentable.

914
00:32:36,591 --> 00:32:37,351
I've got to go.

915
00:32:37,472 --> 00:32:38,232
I need to hurry

916
00:32:38,311 --> 00:32:39,432
and contact my tailor,

917
00:32:39,472 --> 00:32:40,031
Mr. Fang.

918
00:32:40,311 --> 00:32:41,511
My dresses have embroidery.

919
00:32:41,551 --> 00:32:42,232
Top-notch.

920
00:32:42,311 --> 00:32:43,271
I'll introduce him.

921
00:32:43,632 --> 00:32:44,672
Bye, Miss Xu. Thanks.

922
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:47,791
Yan.

923
00:32:56,831 --> 00:32:57,551
Ms. Yu.

924
00:32:58,232 --> 00:32:59,831
Running a show is tough work.

925
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,472
How could you casually push those favors

926
00:33:03,511 --> 00:33:04,672
onto me?

927
00:33:05,632 --> 00:33:06,551
The caliber of guests

928
00:33:06,912 --> 00:33:08,071
determines the show's quality

929
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:08,712
and value.

930
00:33:09,351 --> 00:33:10,392
I'm just a planner

931
00:33:10,632 --> 00:33:11,672
and on-screen host.

932
00:33:12,111 --> 00:33:13,591
I have limited influence.

933
00:33:14,472 --> 00:33:15,551
But you're different.

934
00:33:15,992 --> 00:33:17,992
With you guiding me

935
00:33:18,192 --> 00:33:20,311
and paving the way, I'm confident

936
00:33:21,271 --> 00:33:23,392
we can create

937
00:33:23,511 --> 00:33:24,872
a good and well-received show.

938
00:33:29,351 --> 00:33:30,031
Here, sit.

939
00:33:35,791 --> 00:33:37,031
Many people get things done,

940
00:33:38,311 --> 00:33:39,511
but few have real vision.

941
00:33:41,712 --> 00:33:43,392
I still have much to learn from you.

942
00:33:44,591 --> 00:33:45,392
Good girl.

943
00:33:59,632 --> 00:34:00,432
Ms. Yu.

944
00:34:00,551 --> 00:34:01,311
It's still hot.

945
00:34:08,392 --> 00:34:10,751
(To seize every opportunity
for a comeback,)

946
00:34:11,672 --> 00:34:12,992
(never pin your hopes)

947
00:34:12,992 --> 00:34:14,551
(on others.)

948
00:34:15,831 --> 00:34:17,111
(It's simply)

949
00:34:18,712 --> 00:34:19,712
(using what you have)

950
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:22,832
(to get what you want.)

951
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,992
(Ratings)

952
00:34:25,992 --> 00:34:26,912
Miss Xu.

953
00:34:28,272 --> 00:34:30,071
This episode's results are excellent.

954
00:34:30,472 --> 00:34:31,752
In both ratings and reviews.

955
00:34:32,031 --> 00:34:32,671
Impressive.

956
00:34:33,111 --> 00:34:34,191
Keep this up in the future.

957
00:34:36,832 --> 00:34:37,472
Sir,

958
00:34:38,832 --> 00:34:41,111
as for Sun Siwei...

959
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,912
Don't factor her in.

960
00:34:43,312 --> 00:34:44,272
Sent to outdoor shoots.

961
00:34:44,591 --> 00:34:45,711
You know her temperament.

962
00:34:45,952 --> 00:34:46,631
Arguments aside,

963
00:34:47,472 --> 00:34:49,151
she can't deny the show's quality.

964
00:34:49,832 --> 00:34:51,151
No grounds for complaints there.

965
00:34:52,832 --> 00:34:53,912
Thank you for your support.

966
00:34:54,071 --> 00:34:54,752
I'd surely

967
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:55,952
support a good idea.

968
00:34:57,711 --> 00:34:58,352
Miss Xu.

969
00:35:00,472 --> 00:35:01,472
Earlier, you mentioned

970
00:35:02,191 --> 00:35:03,832
there was something else to discuss?

971
00:35:04,992 --> 00:35:06,872
It's about the show's sponsorship fee.

972
00:35:10,352 --> 00:35:11,272
This company

973
00:35:11,352 --> 00:35:12,952
keeps pushing to finalize the contract.

974
00:35:13,191 --> 00:35:14,591
The sponsorship fee

975
00:35:14,671 --> 00:35:16,191
is 12% higher than before.

976
00:35:16,912 --> 00:35:18,191
If you approve,

977
00:35:18,752 --> 00:35:19,752
we can proceed.

978
00:35:22,071 --> 00:35:23,191
Why are you negotiating

979
00:35:23,191 --> 00:35:24,352
sponsorship fees with me?

980
00:35:24,711 --> 00:35:25,231
Mr. Liu,

981
00:35:26,231 --> 00:35:27,231
I'm in charge now.

982
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:28,912
(Celebrity and Special Guests)
The latest guest list

983
00:35:28,912 --> 00:35:30,151
for Family Feast.

984
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:30,912
Please review it.

985
00:35:33,752 --> 00:35:34,872
Are you sure these people

986
00:35:34,912 --> 00:35:35,671
can be invited?

987
00:35:35,752 --> 00:35:36,832
It can be written down,

988
00:35:37,472 --> 00:35:39,071
but with a 12% increase

989
00:35:39,591 --> 00:35:40,952
in the sponsorship fee.

990
00:35:41,312 --> 00:35:42,656
(12% sponsorship fee increase)

991
00:35:46,272 --> 00:35:47,231
Miss Xu.

992
00:35:48,231 --> 00:35:49,272
I knew you wouldn't

993
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,711
betray my trust.

994
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,752
(Party B: Anya Mountain Dairy Co., Ltd.)

995
00:35:52,752 --> 00:35:53,312
Pen.

996
00:36:04,472 --> 00:36:04,992
Yan.

997
00:36:05,231 --> 00:36:05,872
Did you see

998
00:36:05,912 --> 00:36:06,752
Mr. Zhou's expression

999
00:36:06,752 --> 00:36:07,952
when he saw the weekly report?

1000
00:36:08,071 --> 00:36:09,392
He was grinning from ear to ear.

1001
00:36:09,952 --> 00:36:11,631
Our show's comeback success

1002
00:36:12,151 --> 00:36:13,711
has agents bombarding our phones.

1003
00:36:13,752 --> 00:36:15,151
They're eager to collaborate.

1004
00:36:16,191 --> 00:36:18,191
Even the top-rated actress
for the next episode

1005
00:36:18,191 --> 00:36:18,912
is confirmed.

1006
00:36:20,392 --> 00:36:21,031
Thank you.

1007
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,904
(Yan, money transfer)

1008
00:36:24,591 --> 00:36:25,111
Yan,

1009
00:36:25,191 --> 00:36:26,151
what are you doing?

1010
00:36:26,312 --> 00:36:27,191
I can't take it.

1011
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,432
Your father's hospitalized.

1012
00:36:29,912 --> 00:36:30,832
You need money.

1013
00:36:30,832 --> 00:36:31,752
Don't refuse.

1014
00:36:33,432 --> 00:36:34,792
Introducing Director Lu to me

1015
00:36:35,031 --> 00:36:36,151
was helpful enough.

1016
00:36:36,591 --> 00:36:37,511
Without you,

1017
00:36:37,631 --> 00:36:38,392
I could never reach

1018
00:36:38,432 --> 00:36:39,432
a hospital director.

1019
00:36:40,992 --> 00:36:41,591
Huanhuan.

1020
00:36:42,631 --> 00:36:44,151
Resources exist to be utilized.

1021
00:36:44,792 --> 00:36:45,671
Besides, right now,

1022
00:36:46,151 --> 00:36:47,752
the surgery comes first.

1023
00:36:50,352 --> 00:36:51,591
May the operation go smoothly.

1024
00:36:53,591 --> 00:36:55,111
Juggling work and family lately

1025
00:36:55,151 --> 00:36:56,231
must be exhausting.

1026
00:36:56,472 --> 00:36:57,671
Eat a lot today to replenish.

1027
00:36:57,792 --> 00:36:58,432
Choose.

1028
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:00,272
My treat.

1029
00:37:03,352 --> 00:37:04,031
What'll you have?

1030
00:37:05,312 --> 00:37:06,111
The usual food.

1031
00:37:06,312 --> 00:37:06,752
Okay.

1032
00:37:11,631 --> 00:37:12,872
Congratulations, Yan.

1033
00:37:12,912 --> 00:37:14,272
You become Family Feast's host.

1034
00:37:14,511 --> 00:37:15,551
We've all witnessed

1035
00:37:15,551 --> 00:37:16,551
your dedication

1036
00:37:16,631 --> 00:37:18,031
to this show.

1037
00:37:20,631 --> 00:37:21,551
Thank you, Liao.

1038
00:37:22,312 --> 00:37:22,711
Oh,

1039
00:37:22,832 --> 00:37:24,392
join us for dinner tonight.

1040
00:37:25,111 --> 00:37:26,352
You're too kind.

1041
00:37:30,191 --> 00:37:30,952
Siwei.

1042
00:37:31,191 --> 00:37:32,671
You're here early today.

1043
00:37:32,832 --> 00:37:33,952
What are you implying?

1044
00:37:34,551 --> 00:37:35,511
Siwei always starts

1045
00:37:35,551 --> 00:37:36,472
makeup at this hour.

1046
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:37,031
Wait.

1047
00:37:37,111 --> 00:37:38,111
Your outdoor shoot

1048
00:37:38,151 --> 00:37:39,231
is scheduled for 6 PM,

1049
00:37:39,392 --> 00:37:40,711
arranged after Family Feast.

1050
00:37:41,071 --> 00:37:42,872
It's only 3 PM now.

1051
00:37:43,151 --> 00:37:43,832
Don't we usually

1052
00:37:43,832 --> 00:37:45,231
do makeup two hours beforehand?

1053
00:37:45,352 --> 00:37:46,511
Show schedules are one thing,

1054
00:37:46,591 --> 00:37:47,752
makeup schedules are another.

1055
00:37:48,272 --> 00:37:49,591
Since when does the makeup team

1056
00:37:49,591 --> 00:37:50,551
have the authority

1057
00:37:50,551 --> 00:37:51,231
to dictate

1058
00:37:51,231 --> 00:37:52,511
our filming schedule?

1059
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:54,752
I...

1060
00:37:55,992 --> 00:37:57,031
You can't do my makeup?

1061
00:37:57,352 --> 00:37:57,912
Fine.

1062
00:37:58,031 --> 00:37:58,671
Your phone.

1063
00:37:59,472 --> 00:37:59,912
Wait.

1064
00:38:00,071 --> 00:38:01,711
I'll call Mr. Zhou to clarify.

1065
00:38:01,752 --> 00:38:02,792
If the outdoor shoot today

1066
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:03,832
runs overtime,

1067
00:38:03,872 --> 00:38:05,992
who takes responsibility
for missing the golden hour?

1068
00:38:06,071 --> 00:38:06,912
No, Siwei.

1069
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:07,832
You got me wrong.

1070
00:38:07,832 --> 00:38:08,352
I mean...

1071
00:38:08,392 --> 00:38:08,952
Liao,

1072
00:38:10,551 --> 00:38:11,551
do her makeup first.

1073
00:38:11,671 --> 00:38:12,392
I can wait.

1074
00:38:13,832 --> 00:38:14,432
Okay.

1075
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:15,392
Siwei,

1076
00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:17,151
please wait a moment.

1077
00:38:17,352 --> 00:38:19,071
I'll get your touch-up kit.

1078
00:38:30,312 --> 00:38:31,792
You need touch-ups now?

1079
00:38:32,272 --> 00:38:33,312
Your makeup will be ruined

1080
00:38:33,392 --> 00:38:34,231
during the shoot.

1081
00:38:34,631 --> 00:38:35,952
Why make things hard for others?

1082
00:38:38,031 --> 00:38:39,792
Who do you think you are?

1083
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:42,832
You just hosted one episode

1084
00:38:43,671 --> 00:38:44,392
and suddenly act

1085
00:38:44,432 --> 00:38:45,711
like my equal?

1086
00:38:46,352 --> 00:38:47,952
Other shows invited me,

1087
00:38:48,591 --> 00:38:49,792
but I worry about you.

1088
00:38:50,872 --> 00:38:51,671
My episode averaged

1089
00:38:51,671 --> 00:38:53,111
a 4 rating.

1090
00:38:53,551 --> 00:38:54,832
Yours got 1.

1091
00:38:56,111 --> 00:38:56,992
How could I leave?

1092
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:02,191
Did you write

1093
00:39:02,191 --> 00:39:03,392
the proposal yourself?

1094
00:39:03,671 --> 00:39:05,191
Or did your rich boyfriend buy it?

1095
00:39:05,872 --> 00:39:07,551
You know my capabilities well.

1096
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:08,792
My team and I

1097
00:39:08,832 --> 00:39:09,752
can complete such tasks

1098
00:39:09,792 --> 00:39:10,711
on our own.

1099
00:39:11,151 --> 00:39:12,472
No boyfriend assistance needed.

1100
00:39:13,671 --> 00:39:14,792
You couldn't compete fairly,

1101
00:39:15,272 --> 00:39:17,191
so you went to get a rich boyfriend?

1102
00:39:17,551 --> 00:39:18,111
Xu Yan,

1103
00:39:18,111 --> 00:39:19,191
I never realized

1104
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:20,272
you were so ambitious

1105
00:39:20,272 --> 00:39:21,111
and scheming.

1106
00:39:25,551 --> 00:39:26,631
I secure exclusives,

1107
00:39:28,151 --> 00:39:29,272
handle full production

1108
00:39:30,631 --> 00:39:31,992
and have professional skills.

1109
00:39:33,111 --> 00:39:34,352
Why shouldn't I compete for it?

1110
00:39:37,432 --> 00:39:38,231
I never consider

1111
00:39:38,231 --> 00:39:39,231
ambition and strategy

1112
00:39:39,231 --> 00:39:40,191
to be insults.

1113
00:39:41,272 --> 00:39:42,352
I'll take it as praise.

1114
00:39:42,752 --> 00:39:43,472
Thanks.

1115
00:39:53,872 --> 00:39:55,511
How can she be this shameless?

1116
00:39:55,631 --> 00:39:56,352
Right.

1117
00:40:00,671 --> 00:40:02,312
When she first joined,

1118
00:40:02,511 --> 00:40:04,031
I distinctly remember

1119
00:40:04,031 --> 00:40:06,432
her saying she only had a grandmother.

1120
00:40:07,392 --> 00:40:09,511
Now, suddenly her parents are overseas?

1121
00:40:09,752 --> 00:40:10,912
A highly educated family?

1122
00:40:11,191 --> 00:40:11,992
Is she hiding

1123
00:40:12,031 --> 00:40:13,151
her background and working

1124
00:40:13,591 --> 00:40:14,671
'to experience life'

1125
00:40:14,832 --> 00:40:16,392
like some reality show folks?

1126
00:40:16,551 --> 00:40:17,231
Impossible.

1127
00:40:18,071 --> 00:40:18,952
Her shabby appearance

1128
00:40:18,952 --> 00:40:19,912
doesn't seem faked.

1129
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:21,631
Must be it.

1130
00:40:22,231 --> 00:40:23,031
The other day,

1131
00:40:23,031 --> 00:40:23,872
I saw her wearing

1132
00:40:23,872 --> 00:40:24,752
a diamond bracelet

1133
00:40:25,111 --> 00:40:26,432
with one-carat stones.

1134
00:40:27,312 --> 00:40:28,231
Isn't she marrying

1135
00:40:28,231 --> 00:40:29,671
a construction company's heir?

1136
00:40:30,231 --> 00:40:31,231
Those families

1137
00:40:31,591 --> 00:40:32,912
care most about women's status.

1138
00:40:41,591 --> 00:40:42,231
Yan.

1139
00:40:43,872 --> 00:40:45,111
I've emailed you the proposal.

1140
00:40:45,191 --> 00:40:46,231
Anything else?

1141
00:40:46,952 --> 00:40:48,071
Send the interview outline

1142
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:49,151
to the guests beforehand.

1143
00:40:49,872 --> 00:40:50,231
Okay.

1144
00:40:50,472 --> 00:40:51,231
I'm off.

1145
00:40:51,352 --> 00:40:51,832
Go.

1146
00:41:07,711 --> 00:41:08,872
(Good evening, everyone.)

1147
00:41:09,151 --> 00:41:09,792
(Welcome)

1148
00:41:09,792 --> 00:41:10,912
(Global Stock Market Trends)
(to tonight's Financial News.)

1149
00:41:11,472 --> 00:41:13,111
(This year,
the global stock market faces)

1150
00:41:13,231 --> 00:41:14,711
(both opportunities and challenges.)

1151
00:41:14,711 --> 00:41:15,352
(The downside,)

1152
00:41:15,472 --> 00:41:17,191
(the tech stock bubble burst)

1153
00:41:17,272 --> 00:41:18,752
(is still weighing on the market.)

1154
00:41:18,992 --> 00:41:19,752
(The upside,)

1155
00:41:19,912 --> 00:41:21,111
(the rise of emerging markets)

1156
00:41:21,272 --> 00:41:21,992

1157
00:41:21,992 --> 00:41:23,432
(new growth opportunities.)

(China, leveraging)

1159
00:41:24,472 --> 00:41:25,872
(its stable economic policies)

1160
00:41:26,071 --> 00:41:27,591
(and vast market potential,)

1161
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:29,111
(has captured global attention.)

1162
00:41:29,392 --> 00:41:30,671
Qiao Yan is recovering well.

1163
00:41:30,912 --> 00:41:32,432
She'll be discharged in two days.

1164
00:41:33,151 --> 00:41:34,231
Thank you, doctor.

1165
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:34,912
Thank you.

1166
00:41:35,071 --> 00:41:35,792
After discharge,

1167
00:41:35,912 --> 00:41:36,591
make sure she

1168
00:41:36,631 --> 00:41:37,631
gets enough sleep.

1169
00:41:37,832 --> 00:41:38,591
No exhaustion.

1170
00:41:38,752 --> 00:41:39,432
I will.

1171
00:41:39,432 --> 00:41:41,071
I'll take good care of her.

1172
00:41:41,191 --> 00:41:41,752
Good.

1173
00:41:42,151 --> 00:41:44,191
(Acquire and disseminate
cultural information.)

1174
00:41:45,912 --> 00:41:47,272
(It has made China's stock market)

1175
00:41:47,352 --> 00:41:48,472
(a prime target)

1176
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:49,752
(for international capital.)

1177
00:41:49,792 --> 00:41:50,312
Yan.

1178
00:41:54,752 --> 00:41:55,671
How did you get in?

1179
00:41:56,231 --> 00:41:58,191
I met Huanhuan downstairs.

1180
00:41:58,312 --> 00:41:59,151
She swiped me in.

1181
00:42:01,711 --> 00:42:02,952
Are you here alone?

1182
00:42:03,392 --> 00:42:04,151
Working overtime?

1183
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:07,792
What can I do for you?

1184
00:42:09,432 --> 00:42:10,111
Perfect timing.

1185
00:42:10,551 --> 00:42:11,711
I can't decide

1186
00:42:11,711 --> 00:42:12,551
on some dishes.

1187
00:42:12,792 --> 00:42:13,591
Your taste is good.

1188
00:42:13,711 --> 00:42:14,591
Help me choose.

1189
00:42:15,472 --> 00:42:16,111
Let me look.

1190
00:42:16,352 --> 00:42:16,792
Go.

1191
00:42:19,191 --> 00:42:19,992
(Hangzhou Cuisine)
Look.

1192
00:42:20,231 --> 00:42:21,671
This is the Hangzhou cuisine series.

1193
00:42:21,832 --> 00:42:23,952
Here's Longjing shrimp.

1194
00:42:24,191 --> 00:42:24,912
The recipe.

1195
00:42:25,071 --> 00:42:26,111
This is Dongpo pork.

1196
00:42:27,671 --> 00:42:28,352
This is...?

1197
00:42:29,231 --> 00:42:30,312
A pearl necklace.

1198
00:42:34,711 --> 00:42:35,392
Congratulations

1199
00:42:35,551 --> 00:42:36,352
on your promotion.

1200
00:42:37,312 --> 00:42:38,272
A gift for the hostess

1201
00:42:38,272 --> 00:42:39,352
of Family Feast.

1202
00:42:42,551 --> 00:42:43,151
Thank you.

1203
00:42:43,631 --> 00:42:45,272
Your surprises always come first.

1204
00:42:46,832 --> 00:42:47,472
Do you like it?

1205
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:48,591
Of course I do.

1206
00:42:52,591 --> 00:42:54,231
Now that you're officially a hostess,

1207
00:42:54,752 --> 00:42:56,191
do you have your own office?

1208
00:42:56,511 --> 00:42:57,872
Program hosts don't get one,

1209
00:42:58,711 --> 00:43:00,472
but news anchors

1210
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:01,872
have private offices.

1211
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:05,352
Then become a news anchor.

1212
00:43:11,432 --> 00:43:12,392
News anchoring

1213
00:43:12,752 --> 00:43:14,151
is highly competitive.

1214
00:43:14,711 --> 00:43:15,752
And I don't even

1215
00:43:15,832 --> 00:43:17,392
have news reporting experience.

1216
00:43:17,952 --> 00:43:18,992
It's an uphill battle.

1217
00:43:20,071 --> 00:43:21,551
Others might struggle,

1218
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:23,231
but for you,

1219
00:43:24,231 --> 00:43:25,992
I've always had faith.

1220
00:43:28,071 --> 00:43:28,671
I believe you

1221
00:43:28,671 --> 00:43:29,671
can make the impossible

1222
00:43:29,752 --> 00:43:30,472
possible.

1223
00:43:32,832 --> 00:43:34,231
You trust I can do this?

1224
00:43:35,111 --> 00:43:36,472
Pursue what you want.

1225
00:43:37,352 --> 00:43:38,031
I'm waiting

1226
00:43:38,031 --> 00:43:39,231
to throw a party for you.

1227
00:43:42,071 --> 00:43:43,272
But first,

1228
00:43:43,671 --> 00:43:45,071
let me solve your current problem.

1229
00:43:45,352 --> 00:43:46,231
Leave work soon.

1230
00:43:46,631 --> 00:43:47,671
It's getting late.

1231
00:43:51,912 --> 00:43:52,711
(Everything moves)

1232
00:43:52,711 --> 00:43:54,511
(towards my desired direction,)

1233
00:43:55,392 --> 00:43:56,832
(but I refuse to believe)

1234
00:43:57,352 --> 00:43:58,872
(that lies can be seamless.)

1235
00:43:59,591 --> 00:44:00,872
(They only tighten their grip)

1236
00:44:00,872 --> 00:44:02,071
(around my throat,)

1237
00:44:02,511 --> 00:44:04,151
(choking me slowly.)

1238
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:06,511
(Perhaps deception's purpose)

1239
00:44:06,511 --> 00:44:07,952
(isn't to fool others)

1240
00:44:08,792 --> 00:44:10,111
(but to delude oneself.)

1241
00:44:11,792 --> 00:44:13,432
(The family I tried to erase)

1242
00:44:14,511 --> 00:44:16,511
(was never truly gone.)

1243
00:44:19,671 --> 00:44:20,392
Look at this one.

1244
00:44:21,031 --> 00:44:22,031
It's truly exceptional.

1245
00:44:23,832 --> 00:44:24,671
Our past events

1246
00:44:24,671 --> 00:44:25,752
are all

1247
00:44:25,992 --> 00:44:27,111
pretty similar.

1248
00:44:27,792 --> 00:44:29,432
Everyone's long found them boring.

1249
00:44:29,992 --> 00:44:31,272
Your program is fantastic.

1250
00:44:31,591 --> 00:44:32,792
They are so enthusiastic now.

1251
00:44:32,912 --> 00:44:34,472
Some even pull strings to join.

1252
00:44:35,671 --> 00:44:36,231
True.

1253
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:37,472
Smart people always

1254
00:44:37,551 --> 00:44:39,832
know how to mobilize resources.

1255
00:44:39,872 --> 00:44:40,511
Right?

1256
00:44:41,792 --> 00:44:43,272
I didn't understand before,

1257
00:44:43,312 --> 00:44:43,912
Mr. Shen.

1258
00:44:44,392 --> 00:44:44,832
Thank you.

1259
00:44:44,832 --> 00:44:45,912
It's through spending time

1260
00:44:45,952 --> 00:44:46,792
with Ms. Yu recently

1261
00:44:47,031 --> 00:44:48,432
and attending several banquets

1262
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:49,631
that I've just started

1263
00:44:49,631 --> 00:44:50,392
learning a little.

1264
00:44:51,392 --> 00:44:52,472
Such a sweet talker.

1265
00:44:53,992 --> 00:44:54,752
You little rascal.

1266
00:44:54,752 --> 00:44:56,031
Slow down, okay?

1267
00:44:56,272 --> 00:44:57,231
I want cartoons!

1268
00:44:57,631 --> 00:44:58,832
- Your homework?
- Be careful.

1269
00:44:58,952 --> 00:44:59,952
- Homework done?
- Yes.

1270
00:45:00,071 --> 00:45:00,671
Remember.

1271
00:45:00,752 --> 00:45:01,711
Only half an hour of TV.

1272
00:45:01,952 --> 00:45:02,992
You're spoiling him again.

1273
00:45:04,151 --> 00:45:04,872
Have some tea.

1274
00:45:05,111 --> 00:45:05,832
(Now,)

1275
00:45:05,872 --> 00:45:06,872
(let's welcome...)

1276
00:45:07,312 --> 00:45:07,792
Dad!

1277
00:45:07,912 --> 00:45:08,912
Isn't that you?

1278
00:45:09,272 --> 00:45:10,392
(Mr. Shen Jinsong)

1279
00:45:10,511 --> 00:45:12,031
(and merchant representatives)

1280
00:45:12,272 --> 00:45:13,752
(will cut the ribbon)

1281
00:45:13,832 --> 00:45:15,031
(for the street project.)

1282
00:45:15,272 --> 00:45:17,151
(Let's count down together.)

1283
00:45:18,671 --> 00:45:19,191
(Three,)

1284
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:20,151
(two,)

1285
00:45:20,392 --> 00:45:20,872
(one.)

1286
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:22,591
(Please cut the ribbon.)

1287
00:45:23,392 --> 00:45:24,952
(Let's applaud to congratulate)

1288
00:45:25,031 --> 00:45:26,352
(Yunjiangli, Dayun County...)

1289
00:45:26,551 --> 00:45:28,191
Honey, you look good on camera.

1290
00:45:29,312 --> 00:45:30,631
Not too old to look at yet.

1291
00:45:30,792 --> 00:45:31,352
Right?

1292
00:45:31,472 --> 00:45:32,752
(Let's move to the center)

1293
00:45:32,872 --> 00:45:33,792
(for a group photo.)

1294
00:45:35,832 --> 00:45:37,111
(How do you feel?)

1295
00:45:39,312 --> 00:45:40,231
(Well, very...)

1296
00:45:40,312 --> 00:45:40,992
(I-I-I...)

1297
00:45:41,392 --> 00:45:42,792
(On behalf of all the merchants)

1298
00:45:43,071 --> 00:45:43,912
(in the street,)

1299
00:45:45,312 --> 00:45:46,432
(let me say thank you)

1300
00:45:47,071 --> 00:45:48,551
(to Jinda Group and Chairman Shen)

1301
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:49,711
(for creating)

1302
00:45:49,992 --> 00:45:51,312
(a good business environment)

1303
00:45:51,952 --> 00:45:52,792
(and boosting)

1304
00:45:53,352 --> 00:45:54,432
(commercial development.)

1305
00:45:54,432 --> 00:45:55,551
(Yunjiangli Commercial Street Project,
Dayun County, Shanxi Province)

1306
00:45:55,551 --> 00:45:56,912
(We'll continue as always)

1307
00:45:57,312 --> 00:45:58,231
(to fulfill our duties)

1308
00:45:58,792 --> 00:46:00,671
(and serve our fellow villagers.)

1309
00:46:00,912 --> 00:46:01,912
(Yunjiangli...)

1310
00:46:02,071 --> 00:46:02,671
Xu,

1311
00:46:02,992 --> 00:46:04,231
you're from Shanxi, right?

1312
00:46:04,231 --> 00:46:05,392
(A representative project)

1313
00:46:05,432 --> 00:46:06,992
(to promote urban development)

1314
00:46:06,992 --> 00:46:08,031
(and life quality.)

1315
00:46:08,392 --> 00:46:09,671
(The former Yunjiangli had)

1316
00:46:09,832 --> 00:46:10,551
(narrow roads.)

1317
00:46:10,551 --> 00:46:10,992
Right.

1318
00:46:11,312 --> 00:46:11,952
Uh,

1319
00:46:12,071 --> 00:46:13,312
have you been to Dayun County?

1320
00:46:13,472 --> 00:46:14,551
(Widening the roads)

1321
00:46:14,832 --> 00:46:16,272
(and adding accessible pathways)

1322
