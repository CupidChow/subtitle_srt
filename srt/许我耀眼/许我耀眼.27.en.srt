Timing and Translation carefully crafted by the Divine Destiny Team at Viki.com

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't get over it.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Even now,

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm still not used to it.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You're not surprised.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Happiness is hard to know.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's strange to be cursed.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The day we met again,

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I was so excited.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I want to remind myself

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
to be careful.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Who's lying?

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Who's not regretful?

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Everything about me is good.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The love you want to live.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let the world run away.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Only love can make you happy.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Or it won't be boring.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
How good it is to be fearless.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm better without you.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm not perfect.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This is how annoying it is to be convinced.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We always look back.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I hope we're all good.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Huo Da, you're always a man of courage.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You're not afraid of danger.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You're lucky.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Is it Mr. Shen from Jin Da?

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Or Shen Haoming?

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Isn't it all you?

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Mr. Shen,

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I have a suggestion.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Aren't we planning

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
a few cultural projects in Gubei?

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And you're going to Chencheng every year.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The mountains are good, the water is good, the air is good.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Why don't you go to the three stars?

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The company is full of...

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Instead of worrying about work,

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
why don't you leave the company alone?

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I heard that they're holding a folk festival.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The food street, handicraft,

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and the grass and the grass and the grass are all there.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's so noisy.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Help me deal with the company.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm going on a business trip these days.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I understand what you mean.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We'll discuss it later.

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay, I'm hanging up.

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Sister Lin, this is the online paid promotion plan I made.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm going to upload six to eight video clips

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
on the internet.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
After one or two hours of release,

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
if our play rate, likes, data, comments,

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and waiting data are all good,

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
we'll do a paid promotion.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay, do as you say.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'll take a look first.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm still on a diet. I'm going out first.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay.

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yan Yan, take a look and sign the paper.

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Oh, right, Director Zhang from Gubei Town just called me.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He asked when you were going.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I forgot everything.

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry, I've been busy.

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's okay. Just relax.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Take this opportunity to take a break.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Don't keep it in your heart, okay?

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
When the content of this episode is sad,

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll go if there's no problem.

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll leave this to you.

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Thank you.

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What's wrong?

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Sign the paper.

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Okay.

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'll go.

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Director Xu.

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The stars are afraid of the moon.

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I finally sent you here.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Hello.

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Long time no see, Director Zhang.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Thank you for your time.

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
No problem.

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Welcome to Director Xu's

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Gubei Town survey.

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Thank you for your hard work.

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This place is much more beautiful than I imagined.

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's even more beautiful inside.

90
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Let me show you around.

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Okay.

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Your seat is in front.

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Thank you.

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
This place is very well developed.

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yes.

96
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So we need someone like Director Xu

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
to promote us.

98
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Okay.

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Don't worry.

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Take care.

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Okay.

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
How is it?

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Not to mention,

104
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
it's been a few days,

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
it's really good.

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's better than mine.

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You taught me well.

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Thank you.

109
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's so beautiful.

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Look.

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's really beautiful.

112
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It has the rich and rich atmosphere

113
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
of the northern buildings.

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But it also has

115
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
the southern and southern waterways

116
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
with the nightlife and the spiritual.

117
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's really different from other places.

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's so special.

119
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Our Gubei Town

120
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
has been developing better and better.

121
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We've built our own canteen,

122
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
a leisure center,

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
organic vegetable base,

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and a grass-dye workshop.

125
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
All of these have greatly improved

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
our quality of life.

127
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's really well developed.

128
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
There aren't many tourists.

129
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So we need someone like Director Xu

130
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
to promote us.

131
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Don't worry.

132
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
We're definitely close to the first party.

133
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What are you doing?

134
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The leader is here this week.

135
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Take her to visit.

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Hello.

137
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Hello.

138
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm Xu Yan.

139
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Hello.

140
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Have we met somewhere?

141
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I think so.

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Let me introduce.

143
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
This is the owner of

144
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
our town's Shandong Bar.

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This is Director Xu.

146
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Hello, boss.

147
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Hello, Director Xu.

148
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Our Shandong Bar

149
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
is the best place

150
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
to see the scenery

151
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
of the whole of Gubei Town.

152
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Next time you come,

153
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'll give you a discount.

154
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Welcome.

155
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's my pleasure.

156
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay.

157
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Goodbye.

158
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'll come.

159
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Don't worry, boss.

160
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Okay.

161
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You're so enthusiastic.

162
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Wu.

163
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Xiao Shen.

164
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Where are you going?

165
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Why don't you come to my store

166
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
to make a kite today?

167
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
No.

168
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm going to the workshop

169
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
to make a straw hat.

170
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The kite you made last time

171
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
was sold out

172
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
after the class.

173
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You've stolen all my water

174
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
from the shop.

175
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What should I do?

176
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Can I open a branch

177
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
next time?

178
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You...

179
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You can just

180
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
take my shop as your branch.

181
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
No.

182
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You asked me to make

183
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
the dragon wheel kite this morning.

184
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'll get it for you.

185
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Okay.

186
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay.

187
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
When will the class

188
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
of the straw hat

189
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
start?

190
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I've arranged the schedule for you.

191
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The workshop of the Black Cloak Passengers

192
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
is near your house.

193
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You can take a break

194
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and go there

195
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
as soon as you're done.

196
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You can experience as much as you want.

197
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Thank you so much.

198
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
This is the last class.

199
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Okay.

200
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You can go ahead.

201
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I have several kite here.

202
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay.

203
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Take care.

204
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
This house

205
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
has a special kite.

206
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's high and far away.

207
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
People often think

208
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
it's gone.

209
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
But when they turn it around,

210
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
it's back.

211
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
They often wonder

212
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
if it's lost.

213
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
When they turn it around,

214
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
it's back.

215
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Many people

216
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
like their kites.

217
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Mr. Xu.

218
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Mr. Xu.

219
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What are you thinking about?

220
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Nothing.

221
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Let's go for a walk.

222
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This is

223
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
the best place to stay.

224
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
This room

225
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
is the best room

226
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
that our director

227
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
has ever given you.

228
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He has left it for you.

229
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's the best room.

230
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Thank you, Sister Hua.

231
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Thank you, director.

232
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You're welcome.

233
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
By the way,

234
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
in our town,

235
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
we don't have to be big.

236
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
We can be small.

237
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
We've prepared a small electric car for you.

238
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You can walk around.

239
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Mr. Xu.

240
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Mr. Xu.

241
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Can you ride it?

242
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yes.

243
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I thought you were kidding.

244
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Well,

245
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
take a good rest.

246
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Call me when you're done.

247
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'll show you

248
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
the schedule I've arranged for you.

249
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Thank you, director.

250
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Thank you.

251
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You can rest now.

252
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Okay.

253
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay. Bye.

254
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Bye.

255
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I don't know how to call.

256
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
In the long history of ancient people,

257
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
they have accumulated

258
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
a lot of feelings for colors

259
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
and found a way

260
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
to extract colors from nature.

261
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Our grass and wood dye

262
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
is the technology

263
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
of using natural plants

264
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
to color the textile.

265
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It comes from nature

266
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
and returns to nature.

267
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's the natural way

268
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
to make the textile

269
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
look more natural.

270
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's the natural way

271
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
to make the textile

272
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
look more natural.

273
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's the natural way

274
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
to make the textile

275
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
look more natural.

276
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
In the sky,

277
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
there are more than 20 ways

278
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
to dye plants.

279
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
For example,

280
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
what we're talking about now

281
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
is natural and environmental protection.

282
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Take a look.

283
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Green, white, yellow, black.

284
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
These are the original colors.

285
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The original color mix

286
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
can get the color of the shoulder.

287
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And through the technology

288
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
of dyeing, coloring, and coloring,

289
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
it can...

290
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Sorry, teacher. I'm late.

291
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's okay.

292
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Through these technologies,

293
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
we can get

294
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
endless colors.

295
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And

296
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
grass and wood dye

297
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
is not the only choice

298
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
for the fabric.

299
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It can be silk or linen.

300
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Do you know

301
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
which plants

302
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
we use to dye these colors?

303
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Grass and wood dye

304
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
is to change the colors

305
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
of all things

306
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
on the fabric.

307
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
For example, if you want to dye green,

308
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
you can use

309
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
fresh leaves

310
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
and rice.

311
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
If you want to dye yellow,

312
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
you can use

313
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
ginger yellow,

314
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
grass,

315
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
and paper.

316
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Actually, the things we usually eat,

317
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
such as

318
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
blueberry,

319
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
blueberry,

320
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
and dried purple blueberries,

321
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
these fruits and vegetables

322
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
can be used as dyeing.

323
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You're right.

324
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You've been teaching for several days.

325
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Today,

326
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
we'll try

327
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
the basic dyeing.

328
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Follow me.

329
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Here.

330
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
There are

331
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:24,880
some

332
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,880
colors.

333
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,880
Why do you call them

334
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,880
purple?

335
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,880
Mr. Qiu Ze,

336
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,880
when I was in college,

337
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,880
I read a book

338
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,880
about the ancient books of Eastern Jin.

339
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,880
It's written on it.

340
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,880
The king sits on the cloud-like platform

341
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:45,420
and makes an appointment with the

342
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,420
dragon.

343
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,420
I've always been curious

344
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,880
about which purple color is it.

345
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,880
So,

346
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,880
can I choose purple?

347
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,880
This book is

348
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,880
the 11th season of the Eastern Jin dynasty.

349
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,880
It's also the earliest

350
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,880
recorded text

351
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,880
of the planting of purple.

352
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,880
Okay.

353
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,880
Today,

354
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
let's dye

355
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,880
the dragon-like purple.

356
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,880
Because our venue is limited,

357
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,880
let's do it together

358
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,880
and match it.

359
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,880
Let's do it together.

360
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,880
Okay.

361
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,880
Thank you.

362
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,880
Why do I rely on the bad times?

363
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,880
Life is not as good as you.

364
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,880
I'm happy whether you're here or not.

365
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,880
Why is my soul empty?

366
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,880
When someone is desperate,

367
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,880
I know love.

368
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,880
You're my favorite.

369
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,880
I only realized it now.

370
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,880
The more I try to fulfill it,

371
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,880
the more regretful I was.

372
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,880
I'm willing to

373
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,880
take my own life.

374
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,880
If I'm to come back again,

375
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,880
I'm looking forward

376
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,880
to the life.

377
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,880
Okay.

378
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,880
Why do I rely on the bad times?

379
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,880
Life is not as good as you.

380
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,880
I'm happy whether you're here or not.

381
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,880
Why is my soul empty?

382
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,880
When someone is desperate,

383
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,880
I know love.

384
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,880
I only realized it now.

385
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,880
You can rub the fabric

386
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,880
Don't use too much force

387
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,880
Just let it be evenly colored

388
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,880
Today we choose Su Mu to color

389
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,880
Su Mu's color is stronger

390
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,880
But Su Mu's color is red

391
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,880
Want to have a purple effect

392
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,880
Need to add a little bit to color

393
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,880
This way, you can show off what you want

394
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,880
Also the only Long Gao rouge

395
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,880
The rest is up to time

396
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,880
Can you dye Long Gao rouge?

397
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,880
Everything is full of uncertainty

398
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,880
Jiang Prince

399
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,880
Now we repeat the process

400
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,080
Refill

401
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,880
Dry

402
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,880
If it's such a runaway mix

403
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,400
These purple reactions are nothing

404
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,720
than success

405
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,120
Anyway, I would like to ask you

406
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:25,300
If we could offer some kind of

407
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,560
acaktup live

408
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,960
to the child

409
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,980
what will you document?

410
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,200
Try

411
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,240
Then tomorrow,

412
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,540
we'll try on the blue one.

413
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,780
There won't be problems.

414
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,800
Very good!

415
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,640
What a city that is!

416
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,440
The club is really popular.

417
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,640
Let's go and have some fun

418
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,480
to celebrate!

419
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,400
What's up?

420
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,140
해서

421
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,920
Thank you, doctor Geng for helping me.

422
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,520
No need.

423
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,320
For your bath,

424
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,040
you can stay here as long as you like.

425
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,640
Don't hide it from me.

426
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,440
You can tell me directly.

427
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,800
After all these days,

428
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,600
you're my neighbor and classmate.

429
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,120
What do you want?

430
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,240
I've been living here for a few days.

431
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,880
Do I believe you?

432
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,320
I don't want to explain it to you.

433
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,000
But I really don't know

434
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,600
you've come to Gubei Town.

435
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:53,920
Whatever.

436
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,800
I don't care.

437
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,920
If you're unhappy, I can leave.

438
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,720
Okay.

439
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,800
Don't show up in front of me.

440
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,280
Hello? What's up?

441
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,040
You've come to Gubei Town?

442
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,880
How is it?

443
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,520
It's pretty good.

444
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,720
It's very beautiful here.

445
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,640
Shen Hao Ming lives next door to me.

446
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,120
What's going on?

447
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,160
He's gone to your place?

448
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,920
And he lives next door to you?

449
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,840
How would I know?

450
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,680
What else can he do?

451
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,480
It's obvious.

452
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,000
He's just going to you.

453
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,680
Oh my god.

454
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,680
He's so angry.

455
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,000
But I think

456
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,880
the one he likes

457
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,040
can be called

458
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,600
a man who doesn't give up

459
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,800
and a man who gets hurt.

460
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,560
If he's a man who gets angry,

461
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,600
he should be called

462
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,840
a man who's so angry and so annoying.

463
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,480
Wait.

464
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,720
It's not that bad, right?

465
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,960
I feel bad for him.

466
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,680
He's reluctant to admit it.

467
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,160
You're my sister.

468
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,080
Have you forgotten he's a bird of a feather?

469
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,920
I have to be fair

470
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,440
because I'm your sister.

471
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,480
Don't worry about that

472
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,000
bird of a feather.

473
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,760
He helped Yan Yifang

474
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,360
and himself.

475
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,280
As a CEO of a listed company,

476
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,120
he's a smart man.

477
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,320
He's a real love brain.

478
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,360
Can you stand that?

479
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,800
But every time

480
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,000
something happens to him,

481
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,000
he's always involved in interests.

482
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,120
So I can't figure out

483
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,880
what he wants.

484
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,920
You're reluctant to face your heart.

485
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,840
Do you still love him?

486
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:54,800
Don't talk.

487
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,840
Okay, I'll take it as

488
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,360
you're admitting it.

489
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,080
I'm cold.

490
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,440
Yan Yifang,

491
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,520
I think he's a good man.

492
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,200
You rejected him so many times.

493
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,480
He didn't give up on you.

494
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,360
He's so strong.

495
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,720
He can't win anyone over.

496
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,360
Shen Haoming won't win anyone over.

497
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,960
That's all. I'm hanging up.

498
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,840
You're still at work?

499
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,040
I still have some work to do.

500
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,440
It's so hard to do it alone.

501
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,360
You should go with Xu Yuan.

502
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,720
You can go to the mountains and the water.

503
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,080
You can go there to relax.

504
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:51,580
You can be the inspiration for the

505
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,560
job you're working on.

506
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,200
We've been

507
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,200
adding a limit to the factory.

508
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,800
We're in a hurry to finish the work.

509
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,080
So we moved some money

510
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,000
to the factory.

511
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,840
Okay, I'll handle it.

512
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,080
You're working alone.

513
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,360
You have to work with your aunt.

514
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,720
You haven't eaten, right?

515
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,680
I'll buy you some.

516
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,560
No need.

517
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,760
Your favorite, braised pork rice.

518
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,480
Really?

519
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,280
Lin Tang.

520
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,880
Dr. Yu.

521
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,640
Why are you here?

522
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,080
I know you're working overtime.

523
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:26,960
I'm free today.

524
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,840
I came to stay with you.

525
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,000
You have a lot of work to do.

526
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,280
Dr. Yu is here.

527
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,880
You two should go to have dinner.

528
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,240
Go home and rest.

529
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,000
I won't work overtime

530
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,120
if you're here.

531
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,080
Wait for me.

532
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,800
I'm leaving.

533
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,120
Please turn off the computer.

534
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:43,680
Thank you.

535
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,400
Okay.

536
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,480
What are you going to eat?

537
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,240
A hot pot.

538
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,840
Stop bounding yourself with pain.

539
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,040
If you can't stop thinking,

540
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,040
there's no reason for you to reignite it.

541
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,800
Why are you hitting Jia bodily?

542
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,000
What auel, auel.

543
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:04,800
Let's go.

544
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,360
Don't leave home.

545
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,040
Go see Dr. Yu on your own, okay?

546
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,880
You won't be able to do anything outdoor.

547
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,920
I'm not going anywhere.

548
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,240
Get me the makeup bag.

549
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,000
Do you need to clean your room?

550
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,000
Yes, thank you.

551
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,880
Excuse me, I have a question.

552
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,040
Where are the guests who lived here before?

553
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,160
They've already left.

554
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,880
They really left?

555
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,200
What we have on the table now

556
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,000
is the dyeing material.

557
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,720
Don't look at these things.

558
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,240
They look ordinary.

559
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,640
In fact,

560
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,720
each of them

561
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,920
has another face

562
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,920
that is not known to people.

563
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,480
Xu Yan.

564
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,040
Ms. Qiao San.

565
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,800
Do you know what this is?

566
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,440
I'm sorry.

567
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,720
I really don't know this.

568
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,160
This is called Ma Lan Grass.

569
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,880
The regular Dian Qing Lan

570
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,720
is extracted from Ma Lan Grass.

571
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,800
Blue?

572
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,480
This can dye blue?

573
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,160
Yes.

574
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,360
Let me show you.

575
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,440
This Ma Lan Grass

576
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,840
needs to be soaked for a few days

577
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,440
to absorb the color.

578
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,640
Then add the lime

579
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,320
to make it electric and dust electric.

580
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,880
Then you can get

581
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,160
the blue electric mud.

582
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,520
Today,

583
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,400
let's try to use this electric mud

584
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,640
to dye blue.

585
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,280
Follow me.

586
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,680
Hello, Boss.

587
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,640
Have a look.

588
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,800
These are all handmade.

589
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,200
See if you like them.

590
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,240
Choose a kite.

591
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,720
It looks good.

592
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,640
It's handmade.

593
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,320
Okay.

594
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,560
I want to ask

595
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,440
if you have

596
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,880
Long She Lan kite here.

597
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,640
That's a customized kite.

598
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,120
Do you know the person

599
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,680
who customized the kite?

600
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,080
Shen.

601
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,880
Shen Hao Ming from Jin Da Group, right?

602
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,920
I know him.

603
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,360
Let me tell you.

604
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,640
When we came here,

605
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,360
did you see him?

606
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,960
The tourist center,

607
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,720
vegetable market,

608
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,560
and our canteen

609
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,240
were all made by Jin Da Group.

610
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,120
They've been doing it for years.

611
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:35,880
Let me tell you.

612
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,440
So he didn't act.

613
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,200
He did.

614
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,560
He did?

615
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,000
He acted as a tourist.

616
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,720
At first,

617
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,560
we thought he was an ordinary tourist.

618
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,080
But then, he was told

619
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,440
that Jin Da Group is very interesting.

620
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,720
Last time, he came to my store

621
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,360
and said

622
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,720
the kite was handmade.

623
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,760
He wanted to teach me.

624
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,040
But he built a huge building.

625
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,960
It's really extraordinary.

626
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,320
He learned fast.

627
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,200
He sold all the kites

628
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,200
he made

629
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,680
and stole all my craftsmanship.

630
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,320
This time, he stopped learning.

631
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,000
Where did he go?

632
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,200
He went to the most famous

633
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,400
grass and wood dye in An City.

634
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,200
He went there.

635
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,800
You...

636
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,920
Do you know him?

637
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,560
Are you his friend?

638
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,440
My classmate.

639
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,360
You...

640
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,240
If you like kites,

641
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,320
you can pick one.

642
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,000
I like it.

643
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,120
I want this.

644
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,600
But I also want to

645
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,040
customize a

646
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,440
dragon snake blue kite.

647
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,640
Mr. Shen,

648
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,760
I really don't understand one thing.

649
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,320
You came to Gubei Town

650
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,960
for people

651
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,280
or for learning grass and wood dye?

652
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,160
He said

653
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,560
he wanted to open a grass and wood dye series.

654
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,560
So I came here in advance

655
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,560
to help him understand this.

656
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,760
He's still angry with me

657
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,640
because of Mr. Barajin.

658
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,400
I can only

659
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,240
do something for him.

660
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,520
You're so ungrateful.

661
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,840
But since you've already

662
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,360
met Sister Yan here,

663
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,840
it's a great fate.

664
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,480
You're the one

665
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,840
who helped him.

666
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,360
Why did you

667
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,280
move out of the homestay?

668
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,280
Why did you have to hide from him?

669
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,000
Do you think I want to?

670
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,520
If I were him,

671
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,280
I wouldn't believe

672
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,360
such a coincidence, okay?

673
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,880
He must have misunderstood

674
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,360
that I'm a kind of

675
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,520
scheming and

676
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,520
greedy.

677
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,440
He also told me

678
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,320
not to appear in front of him again.

679
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,360
I don't want to make him angry.

680
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,240
I can only hide from him.

681
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,720
Men are like Mr. Shen.

682
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,120
He's a real man.

683
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,640
He's been with me for two lifetimes.

684
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,760
I almost forgot.

685
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,040
I made an appointment with the owner.

686
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,880
We're going to rehearse.

687
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,440
Rehearsal?

688
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,120
Rehearsal? You can have a bite first.

689
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,960
The selection of the

690
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,080
fake beauty case

691
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,520
begins now!

692
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,600
Great!

693
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,400
Listen to the story.

694
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,320
Great!

695
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,560
Great!

696
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,600
The owner of the homestay said

697
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,720
there would be a drama rehearsal

698
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,000
at the theater tonight.

699
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,160
What drama?

700
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,960
It seems to be Chen Shimei.

701
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,400
She said she was playing the princess.

702
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,840
Really?

703
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,920
Let's go and have a look.

704
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,960
You can't become Chen Shimei.

705
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,040
Of course.

706
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,000
I'll be your

707
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,400
most handsome back.

708
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,440
You're so sweet.

709
00:28:48,880 --> 00:29:14,600
Chess Card

710
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,800
Chen Shimei!

711
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:16,720
Hello!

712
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,680
May I ask

713
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,760
500 taels of silver

714
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,680
You are a criminal

715
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,800
You don't know how to repent

716
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,920
You are too deceiving

717
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,760
Guards

718
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,640
Kill

719
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,520
Kill

720
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,120
Yes

721
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,080
Lord Pang, please forgive me

722
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,080
Don't kill my husband

723
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,000
Don't

724
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,360
Lord Pang

725
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,040
Kill

726
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:43,880
Wait

727
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,320
I mean

728
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,720
Can you change the script?

729
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,360
What do you mean?

730
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,120
OK, tell me

731
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,280
Since it's a new script

732
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,800
Should it have the meaning of the new era?

733
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,560
The main character of the crime in this era

734
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,040
Shouldn't be Chen Shimei

735
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,280
That is

736
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,400
But two women

737
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,520
Think about it

738
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,000
Chen Shimei is so ungrateful

739
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,480
People who are so ungrateful

740
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,680
How can two women go to fight for him?

741
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,360
Correct

742
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,400
One bottle can stop

743
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,680
Little Shen, it's a high sword

744
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,760
Do you really like acting?

745
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,360
I understand what you mean

746
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,080
Look, do you think so?

747
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,080
Qin Xianglian has been chasing her husband for more than a thousand years

748
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,080
Now he has been chasing us in Gubei town

749
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,680
That's a kind of contract

750
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,120
For this kind of fate

751
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,800
Should we let Qin Xianglian enjoy the happiness?

752
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,840
Comfortable

753
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,760
The opposite

754
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,920
The man chasing the woman

755
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,800
Let Chen Shimei chase his wife

756
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,720
That's what I mean

757
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,440
I said I can't get into the play

758
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,800
Yes, yes, yes, just like this

759
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,720
Chase the wife

760
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,000
High sword

761
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,800
Good, I'm going to watch the chase

762
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,400
Yes, yes, yes, right

763
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,000
OK, OK, OK

764
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,800
Then your suggestion

765
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,920
Then you make up

766
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,480
OK, OK, OK

767
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,200
Let's all go with your rhythm

768
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,120
Good idea

769
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,960
I still have urgent business

770
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,120
Little Shen

771
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,120
Little Shen

772
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,400
Your suggestion

773
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,120
You dare not, where are you going?

774
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,640
Sit

775
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,720
Little Shen

776
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,480
Don't, your suggestion

777
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,640
I just missed your suggestion

778
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,880
But I won't change

779
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,560
I'm not.

780
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,560
Will I be late?

781
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,520
I'm sleepy.

782
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,160
Are you sleepy or are you in a bad mood?

783
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,840
Didn't you say

784
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,560
you didn't want me to appear before you?

785
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,240
I was afraid I'd make you angry.

786
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,800
Then leave the Gubei Town.

787
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,720
I came to the Gubei Town

788
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,320
to learn how to make a tree.

789
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,120
What tree are you learning?

790
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,720
I hope one day I can meet you

791
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,000
and tell you

792
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,160
something in common.

793
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,800
What are you up to again?

794
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,480
I'm serious.

795
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,000
Didn't you say you wanted to learn how to make a tree?

796
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,280
I want to learn it in advance.

797
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,080
In case it becomes our topic in the future.

798
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,680
And the question you asked me before,

799
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,800
I hope I can find the answer here.

800
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,520
I hope I can find the answer here.

801
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,440
I hope you don't think I'm acting.

802
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,280
Then take your time.

803
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,040
You don't have to hide.

804
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,960
Can I still be your classmate?

805
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,320
Don't be late.

806
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,000
My classmate?

807
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,400
I'm meeting my third scapegoat.

808
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,440
You're still my classmate.

809
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,640
We only guerraped each other,

810
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,120
but was polished through years.

811
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,520
And my flower shop

812
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:07,160
belongs to you.

813
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,000
But not to my classmate.

814
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,160
Here, you can feel

815
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,560
the charm of the grass-melted dye.

816
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:14,920
Look.

817
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,600
This is the dyeing area.

818
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,840
It's commonly known as the dyeing area.

819
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,440
Grass-melted dyes

820
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,960
combine with the years.

821
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,000
It's very peaceful and comfortable.

822
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,840
The front is the shoe-fixing area.

823
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,040
The shoe-fixing area?

824
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,560
This

825
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,720
has a traditional ancient feel.

826
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,080
The blue is very powerful.

827
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,320
This is the shoe-fixing area.

828
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,920
It's the traditional hand-dyeing area.

829
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,920
You know,

830
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,200
this

831
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,520
needs to be painted with a brush

832
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,000
to dye.

833
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,640
But in modern industry,

834
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,440
machines can imitate

835
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,120
the effect of hand-dyeing.

836
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,480
And the price is low.

837
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,360
So there are fewer and fewer

838
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,680
hand-dyeing agents.

839
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,200
I'm sorry, Ms. Qiu Ze.

840
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,800
This is a picture, not a real one.

841
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,160
Why is it a picture?

842
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,880
This is a brush

843
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,160
of an old master in Beizhen.

844
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,680
But we can't borrow the original one.

845
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,360
So we can only show the picture.

846
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,480
The master in Beizhen?

847
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,160
Yes.

848
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,920
This painting has the characteristics

849
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,320
of a minority in the southwest.

850
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,280
It's the master in the local area.

851
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,480
This old master

852
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,960
used to live in the village of Miao.

853
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,000
So he brought back

854
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,120
the dyeing memory there.

855
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,480
Look.

856
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,880
His creative characteristics

857
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,080
are also more traditional.

858
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,680
The designer of our brand,

859
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,520
Yan Yifang,

860
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,640
is a member of the minority.

861
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,360
If he can see

862
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,520
such a hand-dyeing picture,

863
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,120
he will be very excited.

864
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,800
Ms. Qiu Ze.

865
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,000
Can you give me a contact?

866
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,480
I want to ask

867
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,840
for the permission of this pattern.

868
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,200
I'm afraid it will let you down.

869
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:01,840
He stopped making hand-dyeing

870
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,960
three years ago.

871
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,680
Why?

872
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,680
Maybe he can't create it anymore.

873
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,440
Anyway, he's quite

874
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,920
resistant to dyeing and dyeing.

875
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,920
Even the works on the workshop

876
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,640
have been taken back and gone.

877
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,000
If that's the case,

878
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,160
it's a pity.

879
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,840
You can try.

880
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,720
But I'm not sure

881
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,160
if he can agree.

882
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,680
This master in the first master

883
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,160
I know him.

884
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,800
You know him?

885
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,360
A few years ago,

886
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,160
Jin Da was in Gubei Town

887
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,080
and held a activity

888
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,600
of giving out benefits to the villagers.

889
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,160
I gave Master Chu some rice noodles.

890
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,080
I saw him last year

891
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:51,920
when I came to Gubei Town.

892
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,880
But he belongs to the kind of person

893
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,240
who is a master of the house

894
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,600
and doesn't get along with others.

895
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,240
I just found out

896
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,640
that he knows the craft of dyeing.

897
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,760
If you want to see him,

898
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,280
I can go with you.

899
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,320
Okay.

900
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,400
Who is it?

901
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,520
Shen, why are you here?

902
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,880
I brought you some rice noodles.

903
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,880
You're too kind.

904
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,280
Who is he?

905
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,480
My friend.

906
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,720
Come on.

907
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,040
Sorry for the intrusion.

908
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,040
Sit wherever you like.

909
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,520
I'll make you some tea.

910
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,040
Shen,

911
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,040
you haven't been here for a while.

912
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,000
Yes.

913
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,680
I've been busy with work.

914
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,760
Last time you came,

915
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,000
you taught me the original art.

916
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,840
That's great.

917
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,760
Look at your face.

918
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,560
I saw it.

919
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,920
Next time I come,

920
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,280
I must bring you

921
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,360
some very good original art.

922
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,240
Thank you.

923
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,880
Who is your friend?

924
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,800
Master Chu, hello.

925
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,640
I'm Xu Yan.

926
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,600
I have my own

927
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,960
clothing company in Jingzhou.

928
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,920
I'll be honest with you.

929
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,440
We're trying to add

930
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,720
some lung culture

931
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,120
into the design of the clothes.

932
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,560
We saw your

933
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,240
waxed works

934
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,880
in the exhibition hall of the dye shop.

935
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,480
It's a surprise.

936
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,640
If we can put your works

937
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,560
into the design of

938
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,160
our latest batch of waxed works,

939
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,680
I think it will be very meaningful.

940
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,160
So the pattern copyright

941
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,000
is on you.

942
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,240
Haven't you heard?

943
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,680
It's been canceled.

944
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,960
Then,

945
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,880
can you put the works...

946
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,640
Yao Zhan,

947
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,240
I'm asking you to come in

948
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,240
for your sake.

949
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,600
Master, don't be angry.

950
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,720
Your works

951
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,440
have moved him.

952
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,520
I'm sorry.

953
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,240
Please, please.

954
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,360
Don't fool me.

955
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,560
Who can I

956
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,840
be moved by my work?

957
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,280
I'll be honest with you.

958
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,720
I'd rather

959
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,760
have my waxed works

960
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,600
at home.

961
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,960
I'm happy.

962
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,080
If there's nothing else, you can leave.

963
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,360
Master,

964
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,800
can you give us some time

965
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,200
to introduce him?

966
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,960
I thought about it.

967
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,120
I think

968
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,800
I'm really too rude.

969
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,440
I...

970
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,160
I talk to people about work

971
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,240
as soon as I sit down.

972
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,640
That's why

973
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,840
everyone is so angry

974
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,760
and uncomfortable.

975
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,840
It's not your fault.

976
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,320
You can only prove that

977
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,360
he's still very resistant

978
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,120
to waxing.

979
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,240
But

980
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,880
he hasn't completely let go.

981
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,080
I was just about to tell you.

982
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,640
I saw a lot of blue dye

983
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,120
under a plastic cloth

984
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,640
in his backyard.

985
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,160
Did you see the kind of

986
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,520
blue dye in the water tank?

987
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,920
It's the plant material used to dye the blue.

988
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,120
For example,

989
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,240
you're a person who doesn't eat coriander.

990
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,280
How could you store

991
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,160
coriander in the refrigerator?

992
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,440
Then why did he...

993
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,360
I'll take you to meet someone

994
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,600
who's really in Baishitong.

995
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,440
Who?

996
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,400
Chu

997
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,120
divorced three years ago.

998
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,480
He was looking for an excuse.

999
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,520
He couldn't create his own work.

1000
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,680
He had no inspiration.

1001
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,080
He should find a way to do it.

1002
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,440
No inspiration?

1003
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,080
Why would he have no inspiration?

1004
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,640
No one would give him

1005
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,600
a cloth after he divorced.

1006
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,600
Although Chu also waxed,

1007
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,160
he did make a electric blanket

1008
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,960
with the help of his first wife.

1009
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,000
They painted and dyed each other.

1010
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,040
Not to mention

1011
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,680
the blue dye

1012
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,680
of the first wife was beautiful.

1013
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,000
Why did they

1014
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,040
divorce?

1015
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,480
The first wife

1016
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,120
is Miao, a girl from Guizhou.

1017
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,520
When she was 19,

1018
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,720
she met Chu, who came to Miao Village

1019
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,840
to learn how to dye.

1020
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,720
They fell in love at first sight.

1021
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,720
They insisted on marrying each other.

1022
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,680
So they left their hometown

1023
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,880
with Chu

1024
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:18,760
and came here.

1025
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,880
It sounds

1026
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,840
very romantic.

1027
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,680
How romantic it was before

1028
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,960
and how ugly it was after.

1029
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,680
The first wife thought Chu

1030
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,920
couldn't keep up with the times.

1031
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,040
Chu thought

1032
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,680
the first wife was useless.

1033
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,400
They couldn't make money.

1034
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,120
They were living together

1035
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,040
and they were angry.

1036
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,640
They couldn't live together.

1037
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,920
They divorced.

1038
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,440
They didn't want to be together.

1039
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,960
They painted and dyed each other.

1040
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,600
Now they look like they just painted

1041
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,560
and didn't have ink.

1042
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,680
What?

1043
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,800
I think it's just an excuse.

1044
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,680
You men are all the same.

1045
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,520
I'm not talking about you.

1046
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,200
I just heard

1047
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,520
there was no

1048
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,640
principle problem between them.

1049
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,040
And the conflict didn't get bigger.

1050
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:58,840
So,

1051
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,320
why didn't they make up?

1052
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,880
Master and Madam Chu

1053
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,600
met because of the dye.

1054
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,600
Now Master Chu

1055
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,280
doesn't want to be a dye anymore.

1056
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,240
He's obviously

1057
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,840
competing with this relationship.

1058
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,280
I just think

1059
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,240
it's a pity that it's not the dye.

1060
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,280
It's their relationship.

1061
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,800
What's wrong? Are you sick?

1062
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,320
Maybe.

1063
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,080
I'm a little cold.

1064
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:54,880
I'm fine.

1065
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,880
I'll just take a rest.

1066
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,880
You can't do that.

1067
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,400
Let Dr. Yu come and pick you up.

1068
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,720
He has a big surgery today.

1069
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,840
I just got a fever.

1070
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,080
Don't let him analyze it.

1071
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,120
And the company is so busy now.

1072
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,600
I can't leave.

1073
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,400
Is it because of the loan?

1074
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,200
I've been discussing

1075
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,840
with various public relations companies all day today

1076
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,120
to see if we can

1077
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,200
give them a little time off.

1078
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,080
I think it's better

1079
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,080
to give them a little time off.

1080
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,080
I think it's better

1081
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,080
to give them a little time off.

1082
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,080
I think it's better

1083
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,760
to give them a little time off.

1084
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,080
They won't let go of everything.

1085
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,240
I'm so anxious.

1086
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,160
What about Mr. Liang's investment?

1087
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,280
The bank wants us

1088
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,840
to open a offline market.

1089
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,720
The investment is set for that part.

1090
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,080
It's been calculated long ago.

1091
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,760
I also ran a few banks

1092
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,080
and asked about the loan.

1093
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,200
With the current size of Yan Yifang,

1094
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,480
it can be reduced to 2 million yuan.

1095
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,800
Really?

1096
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,800
Don't get excited.

1097
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,480
I'll run first.

1098
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,320
If there's anything wrong,

1099
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,480
let's prepare the information.

1100
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,400
Okay.

1101
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,160
I'll find you a thermometer.

1102
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,640
I forgot.

1103
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,720
39.8 degrees.

1104
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,160
Lingling,

1105
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:01,760
hurry up.

1106
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,560
Let's go to the hospital.

1107
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,240
Hurry up.

1108
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,360
Don't be so careless.

1109
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,080
Lingling,

1110
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,360
take a rest.

1111
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,120
I'll go boil water.

1112
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:19,800
Take your medicine.

1113
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,160
No, Lin Tou.

1114
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,320
I can do it myself.

1115
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,760
But I may need your help

1116
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,880
to get my phone back

1117
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,120
from the company.

1118
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:27,720
Okay.

1119
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,920
I'll get it for you.

1120
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,080
Take care of yourself.

1121
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,480
Thank you.

1122
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,080
You're welcome.

1123
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,240
Yu Yiming.

1124
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:47,960
Ling Tou.

1125
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,280
Why is Qiao Lin's phone with you?

1126
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,320
Where is she?

1127
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,360
She has a fever.

1128
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,120
I'm afraid I may affect your operation.

1129
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,360
I didn't dare to tell you.

1130
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,320
I was in a hurry to send her to the hospital.

1131
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,440
Her phone was left at the company.

1132
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,480
I helped her get it.

1133
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,680
Where is she now?

1134
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,800
She's resting at home.

1135
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,960
Come back quickly.

1136
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,120
I'll go back too.

1137
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,600
Let's meet at the door.

1138
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,160
Okay.

1139
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,000
I'll go back now.

1140
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,280
Boss Lin.

1141
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:11,800
You're here.

1142
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,760
Where is Lingling?

1143
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,800
She's in her room.

1144
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,800
Her fever has gone down.

1145
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,840
It's dangerous.

1146
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,080
She almost got pneumonia.

1147
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,560
Here's your phone.

1148
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,560
Thank you.

1149
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,320
It's nothing.

1150
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,000
Well.

1151
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,800
I sent her back.

1152
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,800
Don't worry.

1153
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,280
I'm just like her

1154
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,840
to my colleagues.

1155
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,040
I won't.

1156
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,400
That's good.

1157
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,080
I've put the medicine

1158
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,400
prescribed by the hospital on the table.

1159
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,440
I've written down

1160
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,720
how to take it.

1161
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,400
You're a doctor.

1162
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,360
You must know better than me.

1163
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,920
Go quickly.

1164
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,680
I'm leaving.

1165
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,240
Boss Lin.

1166
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,280
Thank you, mom.

1167
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,560
Take care of her.

1168
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:56,760
Go.

1169
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,040
Master Chu.

1170
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,080
Why are you here again?

1171
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,320
Welcome.

1172
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,040
Master Chu.

1173
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,120
Don't call me master.

1174
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,040
I'm begging you.

1175
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:16,960
I don't understand.

1176
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,080
There are many people who are in the dyeing department.

1177
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:20,720
Can't you find someone else?

1178
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,560
We...

1179
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,080
Master.

1180
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,480
Good works

1181
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,800
should be shared with others.

1182
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,360
You hide them

1183
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,960
and don't let others see them.

1184
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:32,960
Then you never know

1185
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,760
what others think of your works.

1186
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,160
Okay.

1187
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,400
You said you have no inspiration

1188
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,760
and can't create.

1189
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,360
Then why don't you open up yourself

1190
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,560
and communicate with others?

1191
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,440
Then your works

1192
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,160
will have a lasting life force.

1193
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,560
Good boy.

1194
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,080
I don't need you to teach me.

1195
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,320
I don't dare to teach you, master.

1196
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,200
I just want to help you

1197
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,680
break through your bottleneck

1198
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,480
and see if there is a possibility

1199
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,080
for you to continue to create.

1200
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,480
Let me tell you.

1201
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,680
New things

1202
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,160
are not scary at all.

1203
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:04,960
Modern technology

1204
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,320
can assist humans.

1205
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,480
For some confusions of creation,

1206
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,440
for example, some patterns

1207
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,520
you can't smell or draw,

1208
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,760
can you ask an AI for help?

1209
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,120
Technology

1210
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,760
is for serving humans

1211
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:17,840
and also for our creation.

1212
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,440
Nonsense.

1213
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,880
I don't believe in AI.

1214
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,760
If computers can replace human brains,

1215
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,520
why do you go to the computer?

1216
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,720
Why do you ask me?

1217
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,560
Do you think creation is that simple?

1218
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,480
Of course computers can't replace human brains.

1219
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,280
You are not against new things.

1220
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,880
You are afraid that you will be changed, right?

1221
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,160
You are right.

1222
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,360
I am not changed.

1223
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,000
The reason I am here today

1224
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,560
is because I have always insisted on being myself.

1225
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,040
I never cater to other people's taste.

1226
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,960
So you are not against being lazy

1227
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,800
but dare not face your heart.

1228
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,560
If, as you said,

1229
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,840
you are not lazy anymore,

1230
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:04,700
what is the use of the

1231
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:05,560
backboard basket?

1232
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:08,200
You and your wife are husband and wife

1233
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,600
and best partners.

1234
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,200
So without her to color you,

1235
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,280
you will never find

1236
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,520
the basket you want.

1237
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,280
Is that right?

1238
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,280
Yes.

1239
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,240
Enough.

1240
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,080
Enough.

1241
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,200
Don't think you are the only one.

1242
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,440
I am telling you the truth.

1243
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,720
I just don't have any inspiration.

1244
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,440
Master Chu.

1245
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,160
Master Chu.

1246
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,680
So it is not Master Chu

1247
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,240
who can dye the ink.

1248
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,080
But the ink

1249
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,600
is Master Chu.

1250
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,840
He always knows

1251
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,480
that he just doesn't want to admit it.

1252
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,960
Whether it is blue or not,

1253
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,560
or without inspiration,

1254
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,320
all of these are not the right thing to do.

1255
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,480
In fact, in his heart,

1256
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,480
he has always been thinking about Master Chu.

1257
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:20,840
So

1258
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:22,800
he will never wake up

1259
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,840
a person who is pretending to sleep.

1260
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,040
I do understand Master Chu.

1261
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,240
Do you think he is right to do this?

1262
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:32,960
I think he

1263
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,680
is a bit like me in the past.

1264
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,560
He is very

1265
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,720
self-confident

1266
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,160
and very self-controlled.

1267
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,560
He is very

1268
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,760
Do you remember

1269
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,320
how to cultivate Long Shilan?

1270
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,320
We can't let her grow up

1271
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,880
according to her own preferences.

1272
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,360
We must always

1273
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,960
control her.

1274
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,120
Just like Master Chu,

1275
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,600
he doesn't like to be changed.

1276
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,120
Once he changes,

1277
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,400
he will feel uneasy.

1278
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,960
So he wants his people

1279
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,480
to do as he wants.

1280
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,240
So the divorce he mentioned

1281
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,120
is not like

1282
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,800
Master Chu dislikes him for being useless.

1283
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,960
He is running away from it.

1284
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,440
He is running away from Master Chu

1285
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,240
to let him walk out of his own world

1286
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,880
and face the changes of this era.

1287
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,000
So what?

1288
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,320
Have you cured your control desire?

1289
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,360
I am still in treatment.

1290
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:48,760
Look.

1291
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:50,760
Do you see this bridge?

1292
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,320
We have walked through it many times.

1293
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,240
But we didn't expect

1294
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,040
it to be so beautiful from afar.

1295
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,160
Sometimes, when we are in a hurry to reach our destination,

1296
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,120
we will miss the original scenery.

1297
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,320
It's like

1298
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:09,120
a kind of getting along with myself and the environment.

1299
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,320
When you stand on this bridge,

1300
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,520
you feel like you are in your own world.

1301
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,400
You are not alone.

1302
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,120
You are not alone.

1303
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,120
You are not alone.

1304
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,120
When others see you standing on the bridge,

1305
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,800
you will feel different.

1306
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,880
So sometimes,

1307
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,920
it's not easy to recognize yourself.

1308
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,200
When was the first time you came to Gubei Town?

1309
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,360
The first time I came to Gubei Town

1310
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,520
was when Hao Chen was four years old.

1311
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,000
I just came back from abroad to study.

1312
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,920
I brought him here.

1313
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,480
Then Hao Chen must like this place a lot.

1314
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,720
At that time, he was curious and unfamiliar

1315
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,200
with this brother who just came back from abroad.

1316
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,240
One day, he said

1317
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,680
he didn't want to go to the kindergarten.

1318
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,200
So I told my mom

1319
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,360
that I took him to school.

1320
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,120
Actually, I drove him to travel.

1321
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,200
But I ended up here.

1322
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:05,840
So,

1323
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,040
Hao Chen is so naughty now.

1324
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:10,920
You have half the responsibility.

1325
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,360
Indeed.

1326
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,800
And I missed his growth.

1327
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,760
Actually, I can't say that.

1328
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,560
You have done a good job.

1329
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,120
The child's attitude and reaction

1330
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,320
have proved everything.

1331
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,240
Hao Chen likes you very much and relies on you.

1332
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,000
So you are very good.

1333
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,680
I remember the first time I came here,

1334
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,680
we had a good time here.

1335
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,520
Because everything here

1336
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,800
is full of freshness

1337
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,200
to me.

1338
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,960
There is a delicious ice cream shop here.

1339
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,440
At that time, he ate two ice creams in one breath.

1340
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:45,960
He asked me to keep the secret.

1341
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:47,960
I promised him.

1342
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,080
I told him

1343
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,920
that he gave me a big hug

1344
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,400
and kissed me.

1345
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,040
At that time,

1346
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,120
it was his first hug.

1347
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,240
I felt very warm.

1348
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,720
So at that time,

1349
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,640
I thought

1350
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,440
this Gubei Town

1351
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,200
could bring him

1352
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,880
as fast as ordinary children

1353
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,000
and let him find the natural nature of ordinary children.

1354
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,400
Later, I took this Gubei Town

1355
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,960
as his paradise.

1356
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,640
I hope he can be like ordinary children

1357
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,360
and be naughty and funny.

1358
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,320
This place is the same for me.

1359
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,000
It's simple and pure.

1360
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,120
No matter what happened to me,

1361
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,680
no matter I had a fight with my dad,

1362
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,440
or something happened to Jin Da,

1363
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,480
I would feel very calm

1364
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,840
when I came here.

1365
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,600
So these years,

1366
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,920
I have been building

1367
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,520
buildings and facilities

1368
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,160
for Jin Da.

1369
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,160
I'm not here for money.

1370
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,760
I hope this place

1371
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,200
can be better.

1372
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:11,640
Do you want to try?

1373
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:17,400
Like this?

1374
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,120
No.

1375
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,120
Your hand should be like this.

1376
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:20,800
Harder.

1377
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:22,240
Come on.

1378
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,200
Harder.

1379
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,120
Come on.

1380
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,160
Harder.

1381
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,720
Is it the same pose as you just did?

1382
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,800
One, two, three.

1383
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,800
You're talented.

1384
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:33,600
One more.

1385
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,760
I just want to take my time tonight

1386
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,800
And then I'll be with you

1387
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,200
I just want to take my time tonight

1388
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:31,200
And then I'll be with you

1389
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,520
I just want to take my time tonight

1390
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:37,040
And then I'll be with you

1391
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:40,000
I just want to take my time tonight

1392
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,000
And then I'll be with you

1393
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:45,040
I just want to take my time tonight

1394
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:50,120
And do all the things that I said I would try

1395
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,400
Like go surfing, go diving, go driving

1396
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,680
Go flying to a different place

1397
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,760
Like go drinking, go partying, go dancing

1398
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,280
Even if I'm the only one

1399
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,400
Cause I just have been hurt too many times

1400
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,960
I'm giving it all just getting nothing back

1401
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,960
I was lost in the dark and too hurt to even see

1402
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,400
See the world how it flows

1403
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,600
What is yours will never let go

1404
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:35,720
So I'll take my time to reunite

1405
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:41,440
The love that I should deserve

1406
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,120
When the time is right

1407
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:53,920
And you realize that it will be alright

1408
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:00,520
Cause I just have been hurt too many times

1409
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:05,920
I'm giving it all just getting nothing back

1410
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:13,320
I was lost in the dark and too hurt to even see

1411
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,520
See the world how it flows

1412
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,720
What is yours will never let go

1413
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:26,920
So I'll take my time to reunite

1414
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:32,320
The love that I should deserve

1415
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,320
When the time is right

1416
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:45,320
And you realize that it will be alright

1417
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:01,920
