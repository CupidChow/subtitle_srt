1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,780
Truly Love

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,440
Episode 13

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't get over it

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Even now, I'm still not used to it

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You're not surprised

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Happiness is hard to understand

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The magic of being followed

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The day we met again

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I want to remind myself

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
that I'm a scoundrel

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Who's lying? Who's not regretful?

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Look, everything I do is good

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The love you want to live

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let the world run away

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Listen to the noise of the night

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Living is not boring

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
How good it is to be fearless

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm better without you

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The perfect stubbornness

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
is so annoying

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We turn back

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I hope we're all good

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Thank you

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Today is a celebration

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Of course

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Lin Tao

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
When I received the bank notice

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
that the loan was put on the company's account

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I was so happy

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm so happy

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
How can I have such a great friend like you?

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I want to say

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Thank you

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Thank you for your help

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Thank you for helping Yan Yifang

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We still eat in such a good restaurant for the first time

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You talk to me so tenderly

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
For this moment

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I think it's worth it no matter what you do

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Why are you talking so weird today, Lin Tao

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Really?

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Don't think so much, okay?

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What do you think I want to say?

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I want to say that

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I want to say that

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Don't think so much, okay?

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What do you think I want to say?

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I think too much

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Anyway, we're good colleagues now

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We have nothing, right?

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Who said we have nothing?

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm so hard-working for you

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I made such a perfect financial report

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Increase the profit of Yan Yifang to 21%

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This is what moved the bank

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What do you mean?

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
According to the current operating situation of Yan Yifang

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It can't meet the bank's loan standards at all

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's because I saw my report

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So I went to the sea

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I passed the screening

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Lin Tao

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You are a fraud

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You are a fraud

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Not me

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's your sister

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The legal person of Yan Yifang, Xu Yan

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What do you mean?

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What do you want to do?

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I want to do it from the beginning to the end

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Divorce with a villager

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Marry me back to my hometown

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Lin Tao

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Lin Tao

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You have already put it down

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What do you mean? You lied to me

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You keep acting

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I can report you

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I can report you right now

80
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Go, go now

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm just a small property

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Without the benefit of the legal person

83
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I dare to do fake accounts

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Why should I do fake accounts?

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Every penny of the company is not in my pocket

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Besides

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You covered the work on the report, right?

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The company has a surveillance camera

89
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I went to see

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You covered it clearly

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You dare to report me

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I dare to pull Xu Yan into the water

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The legal person of the company is the first person in charge

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yan Yifang was affected by Shen Haoming

95
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You are already in a bad mood

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Can you afford to ask the bank?

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You are so terrible

98
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
We are kind to take you to work in the company

99
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You just hit it like this, right?

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Be realistic, Linlin

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Be realistic, Linlin

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Be realistic, Linlin

103
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You can say that I am a despicable person

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But I can say anything

105
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,680
ommay

106
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,320
Yes

107
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,000
a

108
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,000
I

109
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,400
plane

110
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,800
you

111
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,040
Lips

112
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,040
Good

113
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,720
Good

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,800
I promise.

115
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,840
Then...

116
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,280
when will you break up with Yiming?

117
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,960
Don't push me so hard.

118
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,200
Can't you give me some time?

119
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,320
Sure.

120
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,280
One week.

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,640
Okay.

122
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:55,920
Jincheng.

123
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,520
Jincheng.

124
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:56,920
Hurry.

125
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,800
Call the doctor.

126
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,600
Doctor.

127
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,240
Doctor.

128
00:06:59,400 --> 00:06:59,720
Jincheng.

129
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,320
Jincheng.

130
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:00,920
Are you okay?

131
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,760
Open your eyes.

132
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,880
Jincheng.

133
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:04,960
Xiaohui.

134
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,720
Xiaohui, calm down.

135
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,360
I'll go out first.

136
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:06,920
Be careful.

137
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,560
Jincheng.

138
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,920
Otherwise, the doctor will rescue you.

139
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,720
Jincheng.

140
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,360
Go out first.

141
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,560
Get ready to be released.

142
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,480
Jincheng.

143
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,120
Huaijin.

144
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,600
Take care of Chen Zheng for me.

145
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,800
I'm going to the emergency room.

146
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,640
Okay.

147
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,480
Okay.

148
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,080
Mom.

149
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,720
You're here.

150
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,360
How is it going?

151
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,320
The blood pressure and heart beat were gone.

152
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,000
The doctor saved me after rescuing me for a long time.

153
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,760
I just finished the check-up.

154
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
All the indicators were stable.

155
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,920
It's okay.

156
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,040
How is Chen Zheng?

157
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,240
He's the same as before.

158
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,040
Chen Zheng can't be in trouble again.

159
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,880
I'll leave him to you.

160
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,120
Mom.

161
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,880
If you keep doing this,

162
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,720
your body will be in danger.

163
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,360
How about this?

164
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,960
You go back and stay with Chen Zheng.

165
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,960
I'll stay.

166
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,880
Okay?

167
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,840
Okay.

168
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,120
I'll stay with him.

169
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,880
Where is Hami?

170
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,480
She was here just now.

171
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,240
Maybe she went to the nurse station.

172
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,240
I'll go find her.

173
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,520
Hence I stopped her.

174
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,080
I know.

175
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,360
I know you're sad.

176
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,520
Do you know

177
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,120
what happened in England

178
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,480
last winter?

179
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,560
If it weren't for my parents' help,

180
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,840
I wouldn't have been able to

181
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,040
cope with it.

182
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,680
But after so many years,

183
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,760
I didn't expect that

184
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,680
they would take the responsibility

185
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,160
for this.

186
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,240
I know

187
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,960
how much

188
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,920
Jin Da and Chen Chen

189
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,800
care about my father.

190
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,200
Both of them are his hands.

191
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
They've been taking care of him

192
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,040
little by little.

193
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,120
That's why my father

194
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,680
was so excited.

195
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,920
I know

196
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,320
your father has a big influence on you.

197
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,520
Do you know

198
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,880
that I've always thought

199
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,560
my father is like a mountain?

200
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,280
I know.

201
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,360
No matter what difficulties

202
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,160
or challenges,

203
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,640
he can solve them.

204
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,360
In recent years,

205
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,800
the Mingzheng case in the group

206
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,240
has never stopped.

207
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,160
He can balance

208
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,920
all interests

209
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,440
and stabilize people's hearts.

210
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,880
He can do it.

211
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,240
There's nothing

212
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,440
that he can't solve.

213
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,560
But I saw him

214
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,120
lying on the ice just now.

215
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,200
It was so sudden.

216
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,560
The moment he stopped breathing,

217
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,120
I was really scared.

218
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,400
I was afraid.

219
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,680
I was afraid that

220
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,840
this body would really fall.

221
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,720
It won't.

222
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,640
It won't.

223
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,680
Father is very strong.

224
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,240
He can get over it.

225
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,240
Can you?

226
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,960
Why should I know who your full head is?

227
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,560
Because your baby brought back

228
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,760
all my lines!

229
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,960
Normally when we have spare animals,

230
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:54,440
there will be favoring animals.

231
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,760
That's not right.

232
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,960
I know you have to take the concerns

233
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,800
I'm sorry.

234
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,800
Chenchen.

235
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,520
I apologize.

236
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,760
I said something wrong.

237
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,120
But no matter what,

238
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,120
you're still a little bit of a grown-up.

239
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm sorry.

240
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,520
I'm sorry.

241
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,040
I'm sorry.

242
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,600
I'm sorry.

243
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,360
I'm sorry.

244
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,160
I'm sorry.

245
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:31,920
I'm sorry.

246
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,640
I'm sorry.

247
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,480
I'm sorry.

248
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,320
I'm sorry.

249
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,000
You're happy.

250
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,720
We're happy.

251
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,440
You're sad.

252
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,400
We're sad, too.

253
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,280
Chenchen, you have to believe

254
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,680
that everyone in the family

255
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,200
loves you for real.

256
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,160
Chenchen.

257
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,360
You're not

258
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,080
going out to play, are you?

259
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,040
No matter what you play today,

260
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,600
you can play basketball.

261
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,160
I'll be with you

262
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,800
for the rest of my life.

263
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,560
Today,

264
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,760
after we play soccer and play soccer,

265
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,840
we can go to pizza.

266
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,440
We can also eat your favorite ice cream.

267
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,240
Okay?

268
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,680
We can eat one or two balls.

269
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,880
After that,

270
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,200
we can go to pizza.

271
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,400
Steak.

272
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,040
Fried chicken.

273
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,880
Whatever you like.

274
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,840
Don't touch me!

275
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,640
Put it away!

276
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,440
Dad!

277
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,800
Dad!

278
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,880
Dad, hurry up!

279
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,320
Get out!

280
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,280
Get out!

281
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,200
Hurry up!

282
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,680
Hurry up!

283
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,120
Hurry up!

284
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,880
Are you okay?

285
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
I'm fine.

286
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,040
Dad.

287
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,040
Hurry up!

288
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,600
Take him away!

289
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:57,960
Hurry up!

290
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,680
Don't touch me!

291
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,200
If you touch me again,

292
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,280
I'll shoot you again!

293
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,400
Shoot me again!

294
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,080
Are you okay?

295
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,280
I'm fine, honey!

296
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:05,960
Chenchen!

297
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,160
Get out of here!

298
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,840
Okay, I'm fine.

299
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,720
Chenchen!

300
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,000
Chenchen!

301
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,480
Chenchen, open the door.

302
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,520
Open the door!

303
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,120
What's wrong?

304
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,040
You're finally back.

305
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,880
I said I was going to take him out

306
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,160
for a walk today.

307
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,160
But he was taken away.

308
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,800
I don't know if he's a real reporter or not.

309
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,760
He was...

310
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,480
He was taking photos of us.

311
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,000
Then he was upset.

312
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,560
Then he ran in

313
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,040
and locked the door until now.

314
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,280
Chenchen!

315
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:30,960
Open the door!

316
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,480
Chenchen!

317
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,360
Dad was crying just now.

318
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,280
Why is he okay?

319
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:33,880
Chenchen!

320
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,560
Chenchen!

321
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,280
Chenchen!

322
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:37,840
Oh, my God!

323
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,600
Chenchen!

324
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,560
Chenchen!

325
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,360
Chenchen!

326
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,560
Chenchen, what's wrong with you?

327
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,760
Chenchen!

328
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,720
Call the doctor.

329
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,320
I...

330
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,040
I...

331
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,280
Chenchen!

332
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:53,840
Chenchen!

333
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,640
Hello?

334
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,800
Wang, Chenchen fainted.

335
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,880
Come to my house now!

336
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,640
Hurry up!

337
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,280
Chenchen!

338
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,600
Chenchen!

339
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,240
Dr. Wang,

340
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,760
what's going on

341
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,400
with Chenchen?

342
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,240
Nothing serious.

343
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,400
She fainted

344
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,040
because of

345
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,840
the low blood sugar

346
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,720
that she had taken.

347
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,120
You don't know

348
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,200
that she doesn't eat anything.

349
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,720
What should we do?

350
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,280
Chenchen was stimulated by emotions.

351
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,680
She has

352
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,480
a slight

353
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,840
autism now.

354
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,600
So,

355
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,560
she refused to eat and

356
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,520
refuse to communicate.

357
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,960
Slightly can be cured.

358
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,240
If it's serious,

359
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,640
she may have

360
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,280
self-harm

361
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,880
or attack.

362
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,800
Parents should intervene as soon as possible.

363
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,680
What should we do?

364
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,160
Chenchen is now

365
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,200
very reluctant to the injuries around her.

366
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,920
I suggest

367
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,240
to change her

368
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,040
life environment

369
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,040
completely in a short time.

370
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,480
I see.

371
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,080
Thank you.

372
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,600
Okay.

373
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,400
I'll go in and have a look.

374
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,360
Thank you.

375
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:02,960
Thank you.

376
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,640
Haoming,

377
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,240
Yanyan,

378
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,440
let's listen to the doctor.

379
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,360
Change Chenchen's life environment quickly.

380
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,320
She can go anywhere.

381
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:17,800
Mom,

382
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,160
dad is in the hospital now.

383
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,640
Dad is fine.

384
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,800
His condition is stable now.

385
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,440
I'm here.

386
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,040
Don't worry.

387
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,360
I'm here.

388
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,720
Chenchen is in a big trouble.

389
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,760
Go abroad.

390
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,400
Go to a faraway place.

391
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:29,920
Okay.

392
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,360
Don't go too far.

393
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,160
If something happens to dad,

394
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,200
we may not be able to come back.

395
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,960
Where should I go?

396
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,920
How about going to my grandma's house?

397
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,240
Is it okay?

398
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,240
Is it convenient?

399
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,040
Because now...

400
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,720
It's convenient.

401
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,680
My grandma lives in the countryside.

402
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,720
It's a cool place.

403
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,000
There are many small animals.

404
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,040
Children will like it.

405
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,080
Look.

406
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,320
Chenchen

407
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,760
is registered

408
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,240
as a pet.

409
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,080
I don't need you to be worried

410
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,880
about me anymore.

411
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,440
Only Yanyan can

412
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,480
forget about it.

413
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,320
There're Lord Master-in-law in the hospital.

414
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,680
I'll take over the family business.

415
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,600
Please be rest assured of me.

416
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,400
Chenchen's future

417
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,960
can't be delayed anymore.

418
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,680
Got it.

419
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,200
I'll call grandma later.

420
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,120
Please rest assured.

421
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,400
We'll set off tomorrow.

422
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,080
I said, don't come out to wait.

423
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,520
Grandpa,

424
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,560
I miss you so much.

425
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,600
Hello, grandma.

426
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,440
How are you recently?

427
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,360
I'm fine.

428
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,840
I was in good health.

429
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,880
It's better to see you.

430
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,720
I'm fine.

431
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,800
Is this Chen?

432
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,080
He's so handsome.

433
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,080
Chen,

434
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,080
you're too old.

435
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,880
Hao Chen.

436
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,720
Hao Chen.

437
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,720
Forget it.

438
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,200
He just came here.

439
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,160
He's a newbie.

440
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,800
He'll call you if he's familiar with you.

441
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,320
Chen.

442
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:12,960
Here.

443
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,320
This is for Grandma Tai.

444
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,880
Follow Grandma Tai.

445
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,200
Come on.

446
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,320
Watch the ground.

447
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:18,760
Don't...

448
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,000
Don't be so hopeful.

449
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,160
You'll see what happens in the future.

450
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,840
When you get to our house,

451
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,440
Grandma Tai will cook for you.

452
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,440
Come on.

453
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,120
Here.

454
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,360
Chen, have some more.

455
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,120
This is for Grandma Tai.

456
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,600
This is the sauce.

457
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,800
And this is the braised beef.

458
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,200
Grandma Tai cooked it for three or four hours.

459
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,480
It's very tender.

460
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,520
What's the ad for it?

461
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,080
It's very tasty.

462
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,360
You like this noodles?

463
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,480
It's very particular.

464
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,480
It's called

465
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,960
silver fish in the water.

466
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,600
It's cooked in the night.

467
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,320
If you don't eat this

468
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,720
bowl of noodles in Shanxi,

469
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,200
it's a waste of money.

470
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,520
Chen,

471
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,160
this is for Grandma Tai.

472
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,480
She cooked it for you.

473
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,960
Here. Eat more.

474
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,080
Chen.

475
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,920
I'm sorry, Luoluo.

476
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,680
She's usually polite.

477
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,280
It's okay.

478
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,920
She's just a kid.

479
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,280
She's too young to eat.

480
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,240
Don't force her.

481
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,360
She just got here.

482
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,320
Besides, before you came,

483
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,840
Niannian told me

484
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,640
that kids

485
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,520
don't understand

486
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,920
the feelings of adults.

487
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:46,920
Right?

488
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,280
Leave some for her.

489
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,360
Here.

490
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,000
Keep it.

491
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,800
No.

492
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,240
No, no.

493
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,560
I'll cook it

494
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,800
whenever she wants.

495
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,440
You guys eat.

496
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,720
Eat the fish.

497
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,320
Eat.

498
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,200
Eat more.

499
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:06,720
Okay.

500
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,240
Sit down.

501
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,200
Xiaobai.

502
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,760
Hello.

503
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,760
What is it?

504
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,200
Mom,

505
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,040
there's no need.

506
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,160
We've been looking for you

507
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,720
since we got to shampoo.

508
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,440
Where is she?

509
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,880
At the workshop in our hotel building.

510
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,520
I saw her in the bathroom last time.

511
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,360
That's too bad.

512
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,640
My mistake.

513
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,960
Mom,

514
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,180
…

515
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,180
I want to ask you.

516
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,420
Did you have a child

517
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,620
because of him?

518
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:09,980
Grandma.

519
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,500
I really like Chenchen.

520
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,620
Chenchen is a

521
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,540
very smart kid.

522
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,300
And he has a lot of feelings.

523
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,940
He used to chat with me

524
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:23,980
all afternoon.

525
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,220
But now he

526
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,460
doesn't say a word.

527
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,340
I feel bad.

528
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,700
I brought him here this time

529
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,460
because I want him to have

530
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,540
a child in the transition period.

531
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,140
He suddenly got so much information

532
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,820
that he needs time to digest.

533
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,100
I don't know what else to do.

534
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,700
I just want to take good care of him.

535
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,980
I want him to be like before.

536
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,780
Yanyan.

537
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,900
You're right.

538
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,300
In fact, the blood relationship

539
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,620
is different from one person to another.

540
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,180
In fact,

541
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,100
the most important thing is

542
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,980
to change the true love.

543
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,140
Grandma.

544
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,220
Don't worry about me and Haoming.

545
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:22,820
Now we are

546
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,460
very boldly facing each other.

547
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,780
Let's solve the difficulties together.

548
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,180
Let's face it together.

549
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,820
With you, Grandma,

550
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,500
we can overcome any problem.

551
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,300
気分熱咳喘口服液

552
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,260
青肺热致咳嗽

553
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,460
像葵花妖女精彩继续

554
00:24:59,460 --> 00:24:59,980
Mom.

555
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,700
How's mom?

556
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,980
All things are stable.

557
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,700
She's not clear about it now.

558
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,220
But the doctor said

559
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,460
the situation is optimistic.

560
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,660
Don't worry too much.

561
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:10,900
That's good.

562
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,060
You should make late shifts with your carers.

563
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,420
Don't stay up too late.

564
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:16,780
OK.

565
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:17,980
Don't worry.

566
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,940
How about Chenchen?

567
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,100
He's still the same.

568
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,540
He doesn't want to talk.

569
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,060
I hope he'll change

570
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,820
after a while.

571
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,940
All right.

572
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,540
Take care of yourself

573
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,940
over there.

574
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,100
All right.

575
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,780
Chenchen, breakfast is ready.

576
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,620
Chenchen.

577
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,060
Good morning.

578
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:51,940
Come out.

579
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,580
Did you sleep well?

580
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,100
Did you smell anything

581
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,020
in your room yesterday?

582
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:57,940
Come on.

583
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,140
Look.

584
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,020
Grandma Tai made you

585
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,940
sesame oil and eggs.

586
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,900
Smell it.

587
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,860
Let's have some buns.

588
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,420
Come on.

589
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,380
We didn't eat much last night.

590
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,180
Have some more.

591
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:26,780
Chenchen,

592
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,860
I'm telling you, it's delicious.

593
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:28,540
Chenchen.

594
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:29,860
Chenchen.

595
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,620
Since you've finished eating,

596
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,860
go to work.

597
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,660
Son-in-law,

598
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,220
you should eat too.

599
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,060
After you finish eating,

600
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,860
go to the yard and get a big basket

601
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:41,940
and take the kids

602
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,780
to the back hill to pick corn.

603
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:46,860
Okay.

604
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,780
I got it.

605
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,100
There's a rule

606
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,580
in my hometown.

607
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,740
Only the old people who can't work

608
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,580
and the young people who can't work

609
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,380
can work.

610
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,780
Others can't be idle

611
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,220
and have to work.

612
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,980
How can you say

613
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,300
you can't work

614
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,260
if you live in my house

615
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:07,460
and eat my food?

616
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,380
Grandma,

617
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,660
don't be like this.

618
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,380
Chenchen is just a kid.

619
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,100
He's not a good kid.

620
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,220
He's not a good kid.

621
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:15,980
He...

622
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,500
He can't do that.

623
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,820
He's really stubborn.

624
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,220
Good.

625
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,500
I'll go too.

626
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,700
You haven't finished breakfast.

627
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,540
Give him one.

628
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,900
Give him one too.

629
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:45,860
Here.

630
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:58,900
Let me teach you.

631
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,820
This is how to break the corn.

632
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,180
Press down.

633
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,580
Then turn it clockwise.

634
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,380
Press down.

635
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,500
Then turn it clockwise.

636
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,420
Come out.

637
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,180
It's very simple.

638
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,860
Press down.

639
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,620
Turn it clockwise.

640
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:21,700
Come out.

641
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,060
Press down.

642
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:29,860
Turn it clockwise.

643
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,060
Turn it clockwise.

644
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,620
Try that one.

645
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,380
Press down.

646
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,340
Turn it clockwise.

647
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,580
Come out.

648
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,660
Any more over there?

649
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,820
Throw them up.

650
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:12,940
No.

651
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,140
Throw it.

652
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:15,940
Grab her!

653
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,660
Use your hands!

654
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,940
Use your hands!

655
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,420
Hurry up!

656
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:24,620
Grab her!

657
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,940
Grab her!

658
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,820
Got her!

659
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,860
Hurry up!

660
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,260
Hurry up!

661
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,140
Hurry up!

662
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,940
My cutlery.

663
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,380
Prepared such a simple task!

664
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,540
No wonder it is such anfits me.

665
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,020
What are you waiting for?

666
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,980
Dad,

667
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,380
I suggest you

668
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,580
finish tasks

669
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,580
before the stars leave.

670
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:16,780
How about this?

671
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,940
You take care of that.

672
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,420
These two belong to me.

673
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:36,780
Okay.

674
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,140
Here you are.

675
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:16,740
Chunchan,

676
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,100
do you want to have another bowl?

677
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,860
Go to the kitchen

678
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,980
and make another bowl.

679
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,220
You're so good at work.

680
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,500
You've got a second bowl.

681
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,180
It's a good thing.

682
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,620
Tell me when you're done.

683
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,540
Of course.

684
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,940
You won't be hungry, will you?

685
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,460
Let me help you.

686
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,260
Let me help you.

687
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,340
You still want meat?

688
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,260
Eat more meat.

689
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:14,940
Here.

690
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,740
Eat more meat.

691
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,420
I'm full.

692
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,420
Eat more, my child.

693
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,580
Although

694
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,140
they've fired Shen Junsong

695
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,700
and Shen Haoming,

696
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,180
they're still

697
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,260
the company's shareholders.

698
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,660
Many people are

699
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,900
used to the board and the senior executives.

700
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,420
When will they come back?

701
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,500
What do you think?

702
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,940
Because of their personal behavior,

703
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,540
the company's stock fell

704
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,500
and caused a huge economic loss.

705
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,460
According to the law,

706
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,300
the company has the right

707
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,140
to pursue compensation.

708
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,100
We can find a few

709
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,300
shareholders who meet the conditions.

710
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,940
On behalf of the company,

711
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,660
we'll sue the Shen family

712
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,460
and ask them to compensate.

713
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,260
At the same time,

714
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,700
we'll sue them for insurance

715
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,300
and freeze their accounts.

716
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,820
A lawsuit?

717
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,300
The board will be in a mess.

718
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,180
The longer, the better.

719
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,220
Once the lawsuit is over,

720
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,820
their accounts will be frozen.

721
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,420
All their stocks

722
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,140
will become a pile of scrap paper.

723
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,580
We have no money.

724
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,140
Where can we start?

725
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,180
I'll only spend whatever we have

726
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,860
for our company's брат.

727
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,220
the third patient

728
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,780
was listed for surgery on Friday.

729
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:58,980
Lin Lie,

730
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,460
Hi.

731
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,220
You're back.

732
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,180
Are you going out?

733
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,260
Yeah, I have to

734
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,020
go back to his company.

735
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,900
Have you been avoiding me lately?

736
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,500
Why would I? I haven't been avoiding you.

737
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,900
Ling Ling.

738
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,700
I know you've been busy lately.

739
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,700
But your WeChat message is just two words.

740
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,600
You haven't even called for a minute.

741
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,300
I said I was going to the company to pick you up, but you didn't agree.

742
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,700
What's wrong with you?

743
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,700
You're thinking too much.

744
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,600
I've been busy with so many things lately.

745
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,800
I'm so busy that I'm dizzy.

746
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,000
Look at me. I finally got off work early today.

747
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,500
I can go home and rest.

748
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,600
You called me back again.

749
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,000
I'm too busy.

750
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,500
There are so many things going on. You go home and rest.

751
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,200
I'll tell you when I'm done.

752
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:55,600
Go home and rest.

753
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,000
Are you really okay?

754
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,600
I'm really okay.

755
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,200
It's not bad. Just a slight sprain.

756
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,000
After you go home, use a cold compress.

757
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,400
Then use the medicine I prescribed to push it in.

758
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,800
It'll be better in a few days.

759
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,600
Thank you, Doctor.

760
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,000
You still look quite swollen.

761
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,400
It's all my fault. I didn't help you.

762
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,400
No, no. It's because I didn't...

763
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,800
How about you not going to the company these few days?

764
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,400
You can stay at home.

765
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,000
No need. I'm not that badly injured.

766
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,500
The company is so busy. I still have to go.

767
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,600
Linlin, are you okay?

768
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,400
I just went to look for you. I heard the police on the street.

769
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,400
Why are you falling down?

770
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,600
It must be very painful. Let me see.

771
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,400
Hey, hey, hey.

772
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,000
I'm fine. I'm fine.

773
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
What are you doing?

774
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,200
Look at you. You're injured. Why are you carrying this bag?

775
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,200
Dr. Yu, thank you.

776
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,800
Leave the rest to me.

777
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,400
Are you sick?

778
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,000
You took the wrong medicine. What are you doing?

779
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
This is my girlfriend.

780
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,000
Linlin, you didn't tell her?

781
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,200
Tell me what?

782
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,200
Qiao Lin is my girlfriend now.

783
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,200
You don't believe me?

784
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,400
If you don't believe me, ask yourself.

785
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,800
Linlin, let me help you.

786
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,200
Thank you, Dr. Ah.

787
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,000
Linlin, let's go. I'll help you.

788
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,200
Help me.

789
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,800
Linlin, tell me the truth.

790
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,000
What are you doing? Linlin, this is your unit.

791
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,600
If you touch the box, you'll be in trouble.

792
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,600
Linlin, are you hiding something from me?

793
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,000
What are you saying?

794
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,200
We're in love.

795
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,700
We're in love.

796
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,000
We're in love. What's there to hide?

797
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,800
Get out of my way.

798
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,000
I want to talk to Qiao Lin.

799
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,200
Linlin, tell her once and for all

800
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,400
that she's dead.

801
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,800
I'm with Lin Tang.

802
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,800
We're together now.

803
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,400
You and my girlfriend.

804
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,700
You are still my girlfriend.

805
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,200
Impossible.

806
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,400
Pei R equaling training times.

807
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,600
With you, I gave her up before giving up.

808
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,000
I've thought about it a lot.

809
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,840
There's a huge gap between us.

810
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,240
It's a matter of reality.

811
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,120
And Lin Tao.

812
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,000
His unwavering love for me

813
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,120
has made me think about it for a long time.

814
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,760
I think

815
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,040
he's more suitable for me.

816
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,880
I'm sorry.

817
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,120
You said you'd let me go.

818
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,480
What happened?

819
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,600
If he's in danger, you...

820
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,480
Lin Yiming.

821
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,800
If you touch my girlfriend again,

822
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,040
I'll beat you to death.

823
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,560
Lin Tao, that's enough.

824
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,320
Lin Yiming.

825
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,680
Believe it or not,

826
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,400
I've made it clear.

827
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,160
Don't come to me again.

828
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,280
Lin Lin.

829
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,800
Since we've made it clear,

830
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,240
return the debt to him.

831
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,600
Or he'll come to harass you again.

832
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,760
You gave me the ring.

833
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,400
Here you are.

834
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,280
It's clear now.

835
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,560
Thank you.

836
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,240
Let me know.

837
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,680
What are you looking at?

838
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,680
You like little animals too?

839
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,680
Good.

840
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,680
From now on, I'll leave these little chickens to you.

841
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,680
Actually, taking care of them is very simple.

842
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,680
Just make sure to order them to feed them every day.

843
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,680
There's nothing else.

844
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,680
And just...

845
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,680
Clean up the place where they live.

846
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,680
Okay?

847
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,680
Is the task simple?

848
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,680
Here, take this.

849
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,680
You have three dishes, I'll leave them to you.

850
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,680
Or else, if he gets hungry, I'll have to look for you.

851
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,680
What?

852
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,680
Yan Yan.

853
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,680
I saw the payment information.

854
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,680
Yes, the money for the loan has arrived.

855
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,680
And the offline store is also in the process.

856
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,680
But the progress may not be that fast.

857
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,680
Don't worry.

858
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,680
I'll help you look after the company and the house.

859
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,680
Okay, I'll count on you then.

860
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,680
You've worked hard.

861
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,680
You too.

862
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,680
Bye.

863
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,680
Bye.

864
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,680
Bye.

865
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,680
Be careful with the mirror.

866
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,680
Lin Lie.

867
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,680
Thank you.

868
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,680
Lin Lie.

869
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,680
What is it?

870
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,680
You're moving out?

871
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,680
Where are you moving to?

872
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,680
My sister's.

873
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,680
No matter how I ask you,

874
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,680
you still don't want to tell me the truth, right?

875
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,680
There's nothing to tell you.

876
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,680
I just said it.

877
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,680
I just want to figure it out.

878
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,680
I don't care how many times you've said we broke up.

879
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,680
I don't care what I saw or heard.

880
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,680
Even if you and Lin Tao were together,

881
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,680
I would never believe you would change your mind.

882
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,680
If you've seen it,

883
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,680
if you look at me,

884
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,680
you'll know why I'm so serious about this.

885
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,680
Sister Xiao'ai, the table is ready.

886
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,680
Let's go.

887
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,680
Okay.

888
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,680
We're all adults. Be mature.

889
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,680
I'm not a child anymore.

890
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,680
We're all adults. Be mature.

891
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,680
Can you do it?

892
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,680
Yanyan.

893
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,680
Yanyan.

894
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,680
We know that you live here.

895
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,680
So we came to see you.

896
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,680
Where are Haoming and the child?

897
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,680
Haoming took Chenchen to do the farm work.

898
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,680
Farm work?

899
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,680
Can Haoming and the child do the farm work?

900
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,680
They came from afar. They're guests.

901
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,680
They came from afar. They're guests.

902
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,680
They can't work as guests, right?

903
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,680
I'll go tell your grandma.

904
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,680
Grandma arranged it very well.

905
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,680
They eat well and sleep well.

906
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,680
So you don't have to worry.

907
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,680
And the reason I brought the child here

908
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,680
is to let him

909
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,680
get closer.

910
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,680
If you want to see the child,

911
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,680
you should come after a while.

912
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,680
Wait until he gets better, okay?

913
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,680
Since that's the case,

914
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,680
then we'll...

915
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,680
Then we'll leave you alone.

916
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,680
This is something for grandma.

917
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,680
This is her favorite food,

918
00:44:46,680 --> 00:45:03,920
fish oil and

919
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,680
the money for the medical treatment.

920
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,680
I don't need it.

921
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,680
The doctor said the tumor is a good thing.

922
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,680
It'll be fine after the gastrointestinal tract.

923
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,680
We know about Shen's case.

924
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,680
Since you moved back here,

925
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,680
it's convenient for us to come from the county.

926
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,680
If you need anything,

927
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,680
you must call us.

928
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,680
We can't help much in Jingzhou.

929
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,680
But in our hometown,

930
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:31,680
there must be a place to help.

931
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,680
Right?

932
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,680
Take the money.

933
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,680
If you don't have enough,

934
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,680
you must call us.

935
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,680
We still have money.

936
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,680
Thank you.

937
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,680
We're a family.

938
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,680
Why do you thank me?

939
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,680
I'm leaving.

940
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,680
Bye.

941
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,680
I'll get you clothes.

942
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,680
Take a bath after the water is boiled.

943
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:41,680
Drink it slowly.

944
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,680
The world is full of love

945
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,680
Simple

946
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,680
But I can't see the future

947
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,680
You're my favorite

948
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,680
I only realized it once

949
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,680
I miss you at this time.

950
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,680
I miss you.

951
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,680
I miss you.

952
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,680
I want to take a photo with you.

953
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,680
Of course it's fine.

954
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,680
What for?

955
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,680
To commemorate.

956
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,680
Eleven years old.

957
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,720
I can't sleep at night

958
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:08,200
I'm laughing

959
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,280
Even if I love you the most

960
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,080
I only understand it for a moment

961
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,560
The more I want to fulfill it, the more I regret it

962
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:21,560
The more I miss you, the more I regret it

963
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:26,520
I'll eliminate myself myself

964
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,400
If I have to start over

965
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,520
The white of life

966
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:36,520
I start to look forward to it

967
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,120
I start to look forward to it

968
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,320
To have your future

969
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,320
Baby no no no

970
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,320
Like fireworks, I loved you

971
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:01,960
I'm not afraid of pain when I run to the stars

972
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:08,520
I'm not afraid of burning, even if the moment is shining

973
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:12,120
Just like the black fire, tears are more than love

974
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:17,960
Don't be afraid of death, live or die freely

975
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:23,960
If I was once remembered by you, that's enough

976
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:55,320
Like go surfing, go diving, go driving, go flying to a different place

977
00:49:55,320 --> 00:50:02,200
Like go drinking, go partying, go dancing, even if I'm the only one

978
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:08,600
Cause I just haven't heard too many times

979
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:14,600
I'm giving it all just getting nothing back

980
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:21,240
I was lost in the dark and too hurt to even see

981
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:27,720
See the world, how it flows, what is yours, we'll never let go

982
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:34,200
So I'll take my time to reunite

983
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:40,600
The love that I should deserve

984
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:52,600
While the time is right and you realize that it will be alright

985
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:58,600
Cause I just haven't heard too many times

986
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:04,600
I'm giving it all just getting nothing back

987
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:10,600
I was lost in the dark and too hurt to even see

988
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:16,600
See the world, how it flows, what is yours, we'll never let go

989
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:24,600
So I'll take my time to reunite

990
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:30,600
The love that I should deserve

991
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:42,600
While the time is right and you realize that it will be alright
