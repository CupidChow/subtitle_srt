00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:05,002
I see it.

33
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:07,842
Alright, talk later.

34
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:09,761
Thanks.

35
00:02:17,641 --> 00:02:19,201
This pattern is absolutely stunning.

36
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:20,362
See if you like any.

37
00:02:21,201 --> 00:02:23,002
This pouch is a linen-cotton blend.

38
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:24,682
It's hand-dyed.

39
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:25,562
Take one.

40
00:02:25,761 --> 00:02:26,362
Looks good?

41
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:27,362
Sure.

42
00:02:28,921 --> 00:02:29,641
I'll take this.

43
00:02:29,802 --> 00:02:30,242
Okay.

44
00:02:32,122 --> 00:02:33,041
Can I see this?

45
00:02:33,122 --> 00:02:34,362
You have great taste.

46
00:02:34,402 --> 00:02:35,082
What I sell

47
00:02:35,082 --> 00:02:36,321
is dyed myself.

48
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:37,201
Each one is unique.

49
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:37,682
This color

50
00:02:37,682 --> 00:02:38,761
really appeals to me.

51
00:02:41,282 --> 00:02:41,881
Take a look.

52
00:02:42,481 --> 00:02:43,282
Does this look nice?

53
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:44,122
Beautiful.

54
00:02:44,201 --> 00:02:45,122
Gorgeous.

55
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:46,921
Looks perfect on you.

56
00:02:47,282 --> 00:02:47,802
Thank you.

57
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,122
I'll take both then.

58
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:50,201
- Okay.
- How much?

59
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,562
I'll give you a discount.

60
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:52,282
300 yuan.

61
00:02:52,562 --> 00:02:53,161
(Batik Shop)
Okay.

62
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:57,481
Madam,

63
00:02:57,921 --> 00:02:58,881
you just mentioned

64
00:02:58,881 --> 00:03:00,921
that these are all your own creations.

65
00:03:01,562 --> 00:03:02,082
Sure.

66
00:03:02,562 --> 00:03:03,481
I dye fabrics for fun.

67
00:03:03,481 --> 00:03:04,041
I've paid.

68
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:05,201
Got it.

69
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:07,682
May I ask something?

70
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:08,562
Well,

71
00:03:08,802 --> 00:03:11,641
to have different blues,

72
00:03:11,682 --> 00:03:13,362
is there a special technique?

73
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,362
I came here

74
00:03:17,402 --> 00:03:18,802
to study botanical dyeing.

75
00:03:18,842 --> 00:03:20,441
Hope to learn from your expertise.

76
00:03:22,282 --> 00:03:23,562
Few young people nowadays

77
00:03:23,562 --> 00:03:24,761
appreciate botanical dyeing.

78
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:26,201
No need for formalities.

79
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:28,402
Let's exchange knowledge.

80
00:03:29,641 --> 00:03:30,441
You already

81
00:03:30,441 --> 00:03:31,682
know quite a lot.

82
00:03:31,888 --> 00:03:33,562
The secret of traditional indigo dyeing

83
00:03:33,562 --> 00:03:35,242
lies in making indigo paste.

84
00:03:36,441 --> 00:03:36,962
However,

85
00:03:36,962 --> 00:03:38,122
precise proportion and timing

86
00:03:38,122 --> 00:03:39,242
are crucial.

87
00:03:39,441 --> 00:03:40,242
For instance,

88
00:03:40,362 --> 00:03:41,201
plant ash proportions

89
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:42,282
being off

90
00:03:42,562 --> 00:03:44,122
or insufficient fermentation time

91
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:45,761
yields dull grayish blues.

92
00:03:47,522 --> 00:03:48,441
So,

93
00:03:48,481 --> 00:03:50,441
few achieve your level

94
00:03:50,601 --> 00:03:51,522
of mastery?

95
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:52,481
Not like that.

96
00:03:54,362 --> 00:03:55,842
I visited

97
00:03:55,881 --> 00:03:57,962
the textile exhibition.

98
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:00,362
I saw a piece made

99
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:01,362
by Chu Dongfeng,

100
00:04:01,362 --> 00:04:03,201
the famous batik artist.

101
00:04:04,282 --> 00:04:05,562
Very impressive.

102
00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:07,562
Sadly,

103
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,041
they say he lost inspiration

104
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,481
from the blues in his life.

105
00:04:10,761 --> 00:04:11,481
So,

106
00:04:11,761 --> 00:04:12,881
he has stopped creating.

107
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,921
He lives alone now,

108
00:04:16,321 --> 00:04:18,201
selling produce

109
00:04:18,201 --> 00:04:18,961
to get by.

110
00:04:19,401 --> 00:04:20,441
He cuts all social ties,

111
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:22,521
living alone.

112
00:04:23,602 --> 00:04:24,362
Seems pitiable.

113
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:26,602
Don't pity him.

114
00:04:27,362 --> 00:04:28,242
He deserves it.

115
00:04:31,162 --> 00:04:32,362
You know him?

116
00:04:33,002 --> 00:04:33,562
No.

117
00:04:33,602 --> 00:04:35,401
After all, Gubei Town is not big.

118
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:37,281
He's just creatively bankrupt.

119
00:04:37,362 --> 00:04:38,602
So he made an excuse.

120
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:40,441
For years,

121
00:04:40,482 --> 00:04:41,722
he's been merely

122
00:04:41,722 --> 00:04:42,722
recycling old ideas.

123
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:44,362
Can't keep up with trends.

124
00:04:44,841 --> 00:04:46,242
What a waste of talent.

125
00:04:46,802 --> 00:04:48,441
He is a batik genius.

126
00:04:50,922 --> 00:04:52,922
The batik pattern I saw

127
00:04:52,922 --> 00:04:54,242
at the exhibition

128
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:55,682
looks similar to the design

129
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:56,482
on the pouch

130
00:04:56,482 --> 00:04:57,922
you made.

131
00:04:58,961 --> 00:04:59,881
Did you two

132
00:04:59,961 --> 00:05:01,242
create it together?

133
00:05:07,362 --> 00:05:08,722
You know about our relationship?

134
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:15,722
The reason I came to see you today

135
00:05:15,722 --> 00:05:16,841
is to tell you

136
00:05:17,521 --> 00:05:18,281
that Master Chu

137
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:19,722
never gave up on batik techniques.

138
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,042
He failed

139
00:05:21,042 --> 00:05:22,722
to find the touch of blue in life.

140
00:05:23,922 --> 00:05:25,881
To put it bluntly, it's all about you...

141
00:05:25,881 --> 00:05:26,441
Enough.

142
00:05:28,002 --> 00:05:29,042
I knew it!

143
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:30,521
Young people like you

144
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:32,162
wouldn't love botanical dyeing.

145
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:34,722
Tell him from me.

146
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:36,722
Stop coveting
my indigo dyeing techniques.

147
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:37,802
Mrs. Chu.

148
00:05:38,482 --> 00:05:39,602
I know

149
00:05:39,602 --> 00:05:40,641
you're still angry

150
00:05:40,802 --> 00:05:41,922
with him now.

151
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:43,802
Why don't you two sit down

152
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:44,641
and talk?

153
00:05:44,961 --> 00:05:45,841
Let Master Chu himself

154
00:05:45,841 --> 00:05:46,881
explain everything to you.

155
00:05:47,002 --> 00:05:48,802
Or maybe you two collaborate
one more time?

156
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:49,362
I think...

157
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:49,881
Collaborate?

158
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:52,122
Why should I work with him?

159
00:05:52,682 --> 00:05:53,401
I have to go.

160
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:53,961
See you.

161
00:05:55,081 --> 00:05:55,521
Wait.

162
00:06:01,122 --> 00:06:01,562
Hello?

163
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:02,602
How's it going?

164
00:06:02,722 --> 00:06:03,362
Going well?

165
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:05,761
Not well.

166
00:06:06,641 --> 00:06:07,482
I've sent a video

167
00:06:07,482 --> 00:06:08,242
to your phone.

168
00:06:08,482 --> 00:06:09,042
Take a look.

169
00:06:20,761 --> 00:06:21,602
Master Chu?

170
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:33,802
Master Chu.

171
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:36,002
Master Chu.

172
00:06:36,641 --> 00:06:37,201
Master Chu.

173
00:06:37,602 --> 00:06:38,242
Master Chu.

174
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:43,441
Excuse me.

175
00:06:44,761 --> 00:06:46,602
Is that person Chu Dongfeng?

176
00:06:46,841 --> 00:06:47,841
I don't know him.

177
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:49,002
But he comes here often

178
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,682
with an annual membership.

179
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:51,682
Every time he visits,

180
00:06:51,722 --> 00:06:53,162
he acts mysteriously.

181
00:06:53,562 --> 00:06:54,162
Super weird.

182
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:55,562
Thanks.

183
00:06:59,521 --> 00:07:01,042
Our traditional Chinese

184
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:01,961
batik techniques

185
00:07:02,562 --> 00:07:03,482
can be applied

186
00:07:03,482 --> 00:07:04,641
not only in daily life

187
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:06,881
but also integrated
with various art forms.

188
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:07,562
Also...

189
00:07:07,841 --> 00:07:08,881
Master Chu?

190
00:07:13,841 --> 00:07:15,242
Why did he go learn this

191
00:07:15,281 --> 00:07:16,722
in such a secretive way?

192
00:07:17,081 --> 00:07:18,242
He bought an annual pass.

193
00:07:18,562 --> 00:07:19,401
Annual pass?

194
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:24,562
But Mrs. Chu told me

195
00:07:24,602 --> 00:07:26,281
that Master Chu is a stick in the mud.

196
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:28,881
He clearly already started to study

197
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,401
and has been changing.

198
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:31,881
Why keep this

199
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:32,602
from her?

200
00:07:34,602 --> 00:07:35,961
Changing oneself

201
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:37,201
isn't that easy.

202
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:39,362
I guess he's afraid

203
00:07:39,362 --> 00:07:40,802
Mrs. Chu won't believe him

204
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:42,448
and thinks he's pretending.

205
00:07:45,122 --> 00:07:45,961
Shen Haoming.

206
00:07:47,722 --> 00:07:49,122
Don't tell me it's a coincidence.

207
00:07:49,122 --> 00:07:50,042
It truly is.

208
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:53,602
Hello? Sophia.

209
00:07:54,961 --> 00:07:56,802
Why did you divorce Mr. Shen?

210
00:07:57,802 --> 00:07:58,682
He already confessed

211
00:07:58,682 --> 00:08:00,521
about you two being
in the cooling-off period.

212
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:02,362
But my husband

213
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:03,682
still decided to work with him.

214
00:08:04,201 --> 00:08:05,761
After all, Jinda Group is outstanding.

215
00:08:06,242 --> 00:08:07,362
Are you okay?

216
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:11,162
Hey.

217
00:08:11,162 --> 00:08:11,722
Chunling.

218
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:12,242
Here.

219
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:14,162
Soda.

220
00:08:15,841 --> 00:08:16,641
Thanks, Chunling.

221
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,482
This Chu's ex-wife's stuff?

222
00:08:21,722 --> 00:08:22,122
Sure.

223
00:08:22,441 --> 00:08:24,081
I just met Mrs. Chu.

224
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:25,201
She left it here.

225
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:26,401
I'll return it to her.

226
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:27,562
It's a gift

227
00:08:27,562 --> 00:08:28,401
from Chu.

228
00:08:28,562 --> 00:08:29,648
She's worn it for decades.

229
00:08:31,081 --> 00:08:32,041
So this means a lot

230
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:32,722
to her?

231
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:33,442
Absolutely.

232
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:34,842
You two chat.

233
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:38,561
Look,

234
00:08:39,161 --> 00:08:39,962
Mrs. Chu

235
00:08:39,962 --> 00:08:41,041
never gets over Master Chu.

236
00:08:41,761 --> 00:08:42,722
Yet she denies it.

237
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:45,322
Master Chu can recreate the color,

238
00:08:45,842 --> 00:08:47,401
but he insists he can't.

239
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:49,602
They're both just

240
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:50,921
hiding their true feelings.

241
00:08:51,122 --> 00:08:52,041
Why can't people

242
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,482
face their own hearts?

243
00:08:53,921 --> 00:08:54,482
It's not

244
00:08:54,482 --> 00:08:55,442
a difficult thing to do.

245
00:09:08,242 --> 00:09:09,962
Since this hairpin is so important,

246
00:09:10,281 --> 00:09:12,482
return it to Mrs. Chu.

247
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:16,002
Maybe this is fate.

248
00:09:30,761 --> 00:09:31,761
Why do you have it?

249
00:09:32,202 --> 00:09:32,801
Obviously,

250
00:09:32,801 --> 00:09:34,161
the owner gave it to me.

251
00:09:35,482 --> 00:09:36,362
She gave it to you?

252
00:09:37,442 --> 00:09:37,962
Why?

253
00:09:38,681 --> 00:09:40,242
She's waiting at the Mountaintop Cafe.

254
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,002
She wants to see you.

255
00:09:42,122 --> 00:09:42,801
She gave me this

256
00:09:42,801 --> 00:09:43,842
in case you doubt her.

257
00:09:45,722 --> 00:09:46,881
I don't believe it.

258
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,242
If she wanted to see me,

259
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:50,641
she would've come.

260
00:09:51,482 --> 00:09:51,962
Fine.

261
00:09:52,362 --> 00:09:53,842
If I can't convince you,

262
00:09:54,082 --> 00:09:55,401
I'll just tell Mrs. Chu

263
00:09:55,722 --> 00:09:56,521
you're not going.

264
00:09:58,482 --> 00:09:59,041
Wait.

265
00:10:03,242 --> 00:10:03,921
Mrs. Chu.

266
00:10:06,322 --> 00:10:07,122
It's you?

267
00:10:08,722 --> 00:10:10,002
Did you

268
00:10:10,002 --> 00:10:11,761
lose an important hairpin?

269
00:10:12,641 --> 00:10:13,521
How do you know?

270
00:10:13,761 --> 00:10:14,442
You found it?

271
00:10:14,482 --> 00:10:14,881
No.

272
00:10:15,602 --> 00:10:16,681
Master Chu found it.

273
00:10:16,881 --> 00:10:17,602
He said he would

274
00:10:17,602 --> 00:10:19,161
wait for you at the Mountaintop Cafe.

275
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,202
He has it?

276
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:24,002
I didn't see this coming.

277
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:27,082
Ms. Wang,

278
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:28,401
please watch the shop for me.

279
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:29,442
Okay.

280
00:10:30,401 --> 00:10:31,521
Thanks, Ms. Wang.

281
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:48,442
Come on.

282
00:10:48,722 --> 00:10:49,801
Why did you take my stuff?

283
00:10:52,602 --> 00:10:53,161
Wait,

284
00:10:55,641 --> 00:10:57,281
didn't you ask me to come here?

285
00:10:58,561 --> 00:10:59,561
Are you kidding?

286
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:02,202
You're talking nonsense!

287
00:11:02,602 --> 00:11:03,002
Please,

288
00:11:03,002 --> 00:11:04,242
stop playing dumb.

289
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:13,521
Are they arguing?

290
00:11:14,602 --> 00:11:15,561
Probably not.

291
00:11:16,722 --> 00:11:17,362
Why?

292
00:11:18,161 --> 00:11:19,442
Look!

293
00:11:19,921 --> 00:11:21,442
She's already wearing the hairpin.

294
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:22,561
Mrs...

295
00:11:23,322 --> 00:11:24,082
See?

296
00:11:25,002 --> 00:11:25,681
But she doesn't

297
00:11:25,722 --> 00:11:26,322
look happy.

298
00:11:26,322 --> 00:11:26,761
Liar.

299
00:11:29,602 --> 00:11:30,122
Weird.

300
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:32,002
Master Chu!

301
00:11:32,761 --> 00:11:33,202
Mrs. Chu.

302
00:11:33,202 --> 00:11:34,401
Master! Master!

303
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:34,602
Liar.

304
00:11:36,881 --> 00:11:37,242
Well...

305
00:11:37,242 --> 00:11:38,281
You liar!

306
00:11:39,002 --> 00:11:40,681
Yes, I tricked you.

307
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:42,722
But that was a perfect chance!

308
00:11:42,722 --> 00:11:43,842
Why didn't you take it?

309
00:11:45,281 --> 00:11:47,002
I don't

310
00:11:47,362 --> 00:11:49,761
need your so-called chance.

311
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:51,082
Master!

312
00:11:52,362 --> 00:11:53,722
Pride only brings suffering.

313
00:11:54,962 --> 00:11:56,242
If you regret the divorce,

314
00:11:56,322 --> 00:11:57,242
just admit it openly.

315
00:11:57,242 --> 00:11:58,242
Stop talking nonsense!

316
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:00,242
Who said I regret it?

317
00:12:01,482 --> 00:12:02,681
Because I've regretted it too.

318
00:12:04,521 --> 00:12:06,641
I was just as arrogant as you.

319
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:08,521
I lost

320
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,681
the most important person.

321
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,602
She gave me chances,

322
00:12:12,722 --> 00:12:14,202
but I couldn't swallow my pride.

323
00:12:14,962 --> 00:12:16,761
I refused to admit I still cared.

324
00:12:17,722 --> 00:12:19,002
She felt extremely disappointed.

325
00:12:19,482 --> 00:12:20,761
No matter what I did afterwards,

326
00:12:20,962 --> 00:12:22,082
she refused to believe me.

327
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:24,122
And now?

328
00:12:25,322 --> 00:12:25,921
Master.

329
00:12:27,362 --> 00:12:28,641
If you want the answer,

330
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:30,362
why not try it

331
00:12:30,362 --> 00:12:31,322
yourself?

332
00:12:33,362 --> 00:12:34,761
Confessing your love is nothing

333
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:35,801
to be ashamed of.

334
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,202
Don't fear her rejection.

335
00:12:38,202 --> 00:12:39,521
If once fails, try again.

336
00:12:40,602 --> 00:12:41,681
Let me be honest with you.

337
00:12:43,281 --> 00:12:45,322
All your talking won't change anything.

338
00:12:46,442 --> 00:12:48,242
She's no longer interested in me.

339
00:12:50,482 --> 00:12:51,161
Then why does she

340
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:52,761
still wear that wedding hairpin?

341
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:56,002
Isn't that clear enough?

342
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:59,056
After the divorce,
why hasn't she found someone new?

343
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:00,602
Stop making excuses

344
00:13:00,602 --> 00:13:02,161
for your own cowardice.

345
00:13:02,242 --> 00:13:03,824
Taking initiative is a man's thing.

346
00:13:04,322 --> 00:13:05,322
You've dyed many blues.

347
00:13:05,362 --> 00:13:06,681
Why miss the one you love?

348
00:13:07,801 --> 00:13:08,921
Because deep down you know

349
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:11,681
you're waiting for her.

350
00:13:12,322 --> 00:13:13,041
Mrs. Chu.

351
00:13:13,122 --> 00:13:14,161
Wait.

352
00:13:14,242 --> 00:13:14,921
Wait.

353
00:13:15,801 --> 00:13:16,401
My foot...

354
00:13:18,202 --> 00:13:18,681
Miss.

355
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,242
You've crossed the line.

356
00:13:20,362 --> 00:13:21,482
I know. I'm sorry.

357
00:13:21,681 --> 00:13:23,082
But I didn't mean to.

358
00:13:23,082 --> 00:13:23,921
I mean no harm.

359
00:13:24,122 --> 00:13:24,881
I just wanted

360
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:25,801
to help you

361
00:13:25,801 --> 00:13:26,761
and Master Chu

362
00:13:26,761 --> 00:13:27,921
sit down and talk properly.

363
00:13:28,002 --> 00:13:28,401
So...

364
00:13:28,401 --> 00:13:29,401
Who do you think you are?

365
00:13:29,881 --> 00:13:30,842
None of your business!

366
00:13:31,242 --> 00:13:32,082
I don't need you.

367
00:13:34,401 --> 00:13:35,122
Mrs. Chu,

368
00:13:35,322 --> 00:13:36,281
I don't know

369
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:37,842
what Master Chu told you earlier.

370
00:13:39,801 --> 00:13:41,521
But you mean everything to him.

371
00:13:41,842 --> 00:13:42,761
Stop kidding me.

372
00:13:43,002 --> 00:13:43,881
I mean everything?

373
00:13:44,561 --> 00:13:46,041
I know my place.

374
00:13:46,482 --> 00:13:48,002
He just covets my special blue.

375
00:13:49,801 --> 00:13:51,161
That's the misunderstanding!

376
00:13:52,962 --> 00:13:54,602
He could recreate the same blue.

377
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:55,722
The reason

378
00:13:55,722 --> 00:13:56,602
he can't create now

379
00:13:56,681 --> 00:13:57,921
is that you left him.

380
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,442
He's lost his inspiration.

381
00:14:02,681 --> 00:14:03,442
I understand.

382
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:07,962
That's because

383
00:14:07,962 --> 00:14:09,041
I've been through

384
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,921
the same doubts and confusion.

385
00:14:13,962 --> 00:14:14,561
I saw him

386
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:15,722
do so much for me,

387
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:20,041
yet still questioned

388
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:23,561
if his love was genuine.

389
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,202
Or does he

390
00:14:25,202 --> 00:14:26,401
have ulterior motives?

391
00:14:31,722 --> 00:14:33,002
I once wondered

392
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:35,602
whether he truly

393
00:14:35,602 --> 00:14:36,842
cared about me

394
00:14:38,641 --> 00:14:39,602
or just wanted

395
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:41,161
the benefits I could provide.

396
00:14:42,722 --> 00:14:45,281
Coming to Gubei Town

397
00:14:45,962 --> 00:14:47,761
and meeting you and Master Chu

398
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,002
made me rethink love.

399
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:51,761
That's why I decided

400
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:56,122
to give our relationship

401
00:14:58,362 --> 00:14:59,401
another chance.

402
00:15:02,322 --> 00:15:03,442
Two people who care

403
00:15:03,442 --> 00:15:04,122
for each other

404
00:15:05,641 --> 00:15:07,122
shouldn't spend years

405
00:15:07,322 --> 00:15:08,122
drowning in doubt.

406
00:15:09,602 --> 00:15:10,482
Instead, just believe

407
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:13,681
that every effort he makes

408
00:15:13,962 --> 00:15:14,722
is for you.

409
00:15:18,202 --> 00:15:18,602
Oh!

410
00:15:19,281 --> 00:15:20,362
Let me show you something.

411
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:25,122
Look at this.

412
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:28,561
Master Chu.

413
00:15:31,362 --> 00:15:32,801
He secretly visited the exhibition

414
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:34,962
with an annual pass.

415
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:38,281
See?

416
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,002
He's been changing,

417
00:15:40,602 --> 00:15:41,842
just bad at communicating.

418
00:15:42,881 --> 00:15:44,161
Misunderstandings grew

419
00:15:44,161 --> 00:15:45,041
deeper and deeper.

420
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:46,322
Things end up like this.

421
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:51,002
We saw his courtyard

422
00:15:53,681 --> 00:15:55,401
filled with different blues.

423
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:56,681
Well,

424
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,362
you should also know.

425
00:15:58,921 --> 00:16:00,041
With his skills,

426
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:01,322
he can

427
00:16:01,322 --> 00:16:02,801
recreate the same blue as yours.

428
00:16:04,442 --> 00:16:05,521
Yet he discarded

429
00:16:05,521 --> 00:16:06,362
the fabrics.

430
00:16:07,202 --> 00:16:08,881
What you really want to know is

431
00:16:10,881 --> 00:16:11,561
whether he

432
00:16:11,561 --> 00:16:13,002
desires the blue dye you created

433
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:16,482
or you as a person.

434
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:22,722
I don't believe.

435
00:16:23,561 --> 00:16:25,041
He is even afraid of admitting it.

436
00:16:25,602 --> 00:16:27,002
Nobody can speak for him.

437
00:16:27,442 --> 00:16:28,641
Who says I'm afraid?

438
00:16:37,681 --> 00:16:39,082
Help me dye it again.

439
00:16:46,362 --> 00:16:47,482
Can't you dye it yourself?

440
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:49,680
You don't need me.

441
00:16:50,482 --> 00:16:51,801
What I want is

442
00:16:53,322 --> 00:16:54,561
the person who dyes the fabric.

443
00:17:10,361 --> 00:17:11,601
We'll soon see the new creation

444
00:17:11,642 --> 00:17:12,922
by Master Chu

445
00:17:12,922 --> 00:17:13,722
and Mrs. Chu.

446
00:17:14,162 --> 00:17:15,761
Old partners work best together.

447
00:17:17,682 --> 00:17:18,121
Look,

448
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:19,521
there's a show tonight.

449
00:17:20,002 --> 00:17:20,642
Will you come?

450
00:17:21,361 --> 00:17:21,922
Of course.

451
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:24,041
Good luck!

452
00:18:13,642 --> 00:18:15,202
Chen Shimei.

453
00:18:15,882 --> 00:18:17,361
You're ungrateful,

454
00:18:17,882 --> 00:18:19,841
plotting against your wife!

455
00:18:19,962 --> 00:18:20,882
Guards!

456
00:18:22,361 --> 00:18:23,882
(The New Opera of The Case of Chen Shimei)
Execute him!

457
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:24,682
Yes!

458
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,162
Show mercy!

459
00:18:33,561 --> 00:18:35,521
I admit my guilt.

460
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:37,722
A guilt is a guilt.

461
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,121
Too late for regrets.

462
00:18:39,321 --> 00:18:40,281
Execute him!

463
00:18:42,081 --> 00:18:43,361
Show mercy!

464
00:18:46,121 --> 00:18:46,682
Your Honor,

465
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:49,402
I don't fear death.

466
00:18:50,202 --> 00:18:51,281
When I recall

467
00:18:51,561 --> 00:18:53,202
how I treated my wife,

468
00:18:53,722 --> 00:18:55,521
I feel deep remorse.

469
00:18:56,521 --> 00:18:57,682
My death matters little,

470
00:18:58,962 --> 00:19:00,121
and I don't

471
00:19:01,202 --> 00:19:02,442
deserve any forgiveness.

472
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:04,081
But considering

473
00:19:04,882 --> 00:19:06,361
my thousand-year reincarnation,

474
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,882
please grant me one chance

475
00:19:09,841 --> 00:19:11,402
to show her my reformation

476
00:19:13,242 --> 00:19:14,682
and accept my penance.

477
00:19:15,962 --> 00:19:16,962
If this is allowed,

478
00:19:17,242 --> 00:19:18,081
I'll die

479
00:19:18,801 --> 00:19:20,321
with no regrets.

480
00:19:20,722 --> 00:19:22,041
This

481
00:19:22,922 --> 00:19:24,882
sounds somewhat moving.

482
00:19:25,761 --> 00:19:26,402
Madam Qin,

483
00:19:27,002 --> 00:19:28,162
he wishes to change.

484
00:19:28,442 --> 00:19:29,841
What are your demands?

485
00:19:31,482 --> 00:19:32,361
Your Honor,

486
00:19:32,442 --> 00:19:34,402
a private word please.

487
00:19:37,722 --> 00:19:38,761
Very well.

488
00:19:40,642 --> 00:19:42,002
Madam Qin stated

489
00:19:42,561 --> 00:19:43,601
she wants no gold,

490
00:19:44,002 --> 00:19:45,162
no silver.

491
00:19:45,521 --> 00:19:47,882
She demands spiritual compensation.

492
00:19:48,402 --> 00:19:49,922
Three requirements

493
00:19:50,121 --> 00:19:52,002
must be met

494
00:19:52,922 --> 00:19:54,002
for your death sentence

495
00:19:54,442 --> 00:19:56,002
to be commuted.

496
00:19:56,882 --> 00:19:57,761
Material wealth

497
00:19:58,402 --> 00:19:59,882
can't compensate

498
00:20:01,002 --> 00:20:02,361
for Qin Xianglian's years

499
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,801
of suffering during her pursuit.

500
00:20:05,402 --> 00:20:07,162
Whatever the cost,

501
00:20:07,922 --> 00:20:09,202
I'll accept it.

502
00:20:10,281 --> 00:20:10,922
Good.

503
00:20:11,561 --> 00:20:13,482
Carry a thousand dan of rice

504
00:20:14,121 --> 00:20:17,442
to repay her devotion.

505
00:20:20,482 --> 00:20:21,962
Bring rice!

506
00:20:22,242 --> 00:20:22,962
Yes!

507
00:20:39,081 --> 00:20:40,081
Is this enough?

508
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:41,601
- No!
- No!

509
00:20:42,321 --> 00:20:43,841
More rice!

510
00:20:46,962 --> 00:20:47,442
Yes!

511
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:49,682
Is this enough?

512
00:20:50,081 --> 00:20:51,202
- No!
- No!

513
00:20:51,642 --> 00:20:52,882
Bring more!

514
00:20:52,922 --> 00:20:53,722
Yes!

515
00:20:58,081 --> 00:20:59,162
Now enough?

516
00:20:59,361 --> 00:21:00,761
- No!
- No!

517
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,002
More rice!

518
00:21:05,642 --> 00:21:07,081
Enough?

519
00:21:23,281 --> 00:21:24,202
Madam Qin,

520
00:21:24,922 --> 00:21:26,682
are you satisfied?

521
00:21:28,801 --> 00:21:30,321
Good.

522
00:21:33,002 --> 00:21:35,962
- Great!
- Great!

523
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:48,361
I once didn't

524
00:21:48,442 --> 00:21:49,242
understand love.

525
00:21:51,081 --> 00:21:51,962
So,

526
00:21:52,162 --> 00:21:53,962
when seeking instant benefits,

527
00:21:55,242 --> 00:21:56,361
I lost someone

528
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:58,682
who truly cared for me.

529
00:22:01,922 --> 00:22:03,121
I once swore

530
00:22:04,642 --> 00:22:05,722
to win her back.

531
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:08,521
Yet I was arrogant.

532
00:22:08,521 --> 00:22:09,761
My so-called sincerity

533
00:22:11,162 --> 00:22:12,041
was crushed

534
00:22:13,402 --> 00:22:14,521
by pragmatism

535
00:22:15,281 --> 00:22:16,841
and calculation.

536
00:22:18,321 --> 00:22:19,722
Time after time,

537
00:22:20,521 --> 00:22:21,162
I hurt her.

538
00:22:27,521 --> 00:22:28,442
Thank you

539
00:22:31,561 --> 00:22:33,081
for giving me this opportunity

540
00:22:33,402 --> 00:22:34,682
to speak my mind.

541
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:37,922
This made me

542
00:22:39,321 --> 00:22:40,801
realize my own shortcomings

543
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:44,202
and clarified

544
00:22:46,962 --> 00:22:49,402
whether I truly loved her

545
00:22:50,962 --> 00:22:52,761
or merely loved being loved by her.

546
00:22:56,281 --> 00:22:57,682
If you ask me again

547
00:22:57,722 --> 00:22:58,801
what kind of person I am,

548
00:23:00,281 --> 00:23:01,162
I'll tell you

549
00:23:03,162 --> 00:23:04,882
I'm the one who discovered

550
00:23:06,121 --> 00:23:07,521
I still love you.

551
00:23:34,202 --> 00:23:34,761
Good.

552
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:38,442

Ms. Qiao.

569
00:24:34,002 --> 00:24:35,561
The offline experience store

570
00:24:35,561 --> 00:24:37,162
is progressing smoother than expected.

571
00:24:37,402 --> 00:24:38,801
Lease contracts for three stores

572
00:24:38,801 --> 00:24:39,561
have been signed.

573
00:24:39,601 --> 00:24:41,162
Interior design plans are finalized.

574
00:24:41,162 --> 00:24:41,722
Next steps

575
00:24:41,722 --> 00:24:43,081
involve payments for rent,

576
00:24:43,162 --> 00:24:44,081
renovation,

577
00:24:44,202 --> 00:24:45,561
and materials.

578
00:24:46,121 --> 00:24:46,682
Good.

579
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,722
Hopefully, before Ms. Xu returns,

580
00:24:48,722 --> 00:24:50,601
we'll finalize
offline operations properly.

581
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:52,361
Then promptly report to Yuanhang Capital

582
00:24:52,642 --> 00:24:53,922
about our project status.

583
00:24:54,482 --> 00:24:55,041
Understood.

584
00:24:55,242 --> 00:24:57,041
The contract requires transferring

585
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:58,761
one year's rent within two weeks.

586
00:24:59,561 --> 00:25:00,601
Verify the amounts

587
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:01,922
and details with Mr. Lin first.

588
00:25:02,224 --> 00:25:04,041
After my confirmation,
proceed with payment.

589
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:05,081
Got it.

590
00:25:05,521 --> 00:25:06,202
Ms. Qiao.

591
00:25:06,722 --> 00:25:08,041
Can we slow down

592
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:09,482
the experience store progress?

593
00:25:10,361 --> 00:25:10,962
Why?

594
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:12,801
I suggest reallocating offline funds

595
00:25:12,841 --> 00:25:13,801
to production.

596
00:25:14,162 --> 00:25:16,402
If we delay supplier payments,

597
00:25:16,601 --> 00:25:18,162
we can't afford the penalty fees.

598
00:25:19,202 --> 00:25:20,561
Wasn't the bank loan

599
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,002
supposed to be approved this week?

600
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:23,361
Originally, yes,

601
00:25:23,561 --> 00:25:24,962
but the bank suddenly notified me

602
00:25:24,962 --> 00:25:26,121
of tightened policies.

603
00:25:26,281 --> 00:25:27,922
All non-compliant loans

604
00:25:27,922 --> 00:25:29,002
got rejected.

605
00:25:31,841 --> 00:25:33,321
Keep proceeding as planned.

606
00:25:33,482 --> 00:25:35,121
I'll discuss whether to slow down

607
00:25:35,521 --> 00:25:37,162
with Mr. Lin.

608
00:25:37,521 --> 00:25:38,642
Don't worry.

609
00:25:38,962 --> 00:25:40,202
Just focus on your work,

610
00:25:40,202 --> 00:25:40,882
okay?

611
00:25:41,722 --> 00:25:42,202
Okay.

612
00:25:43,682 --> 00:25:44,962
I think I should visit the bank.

613
00:25:44,962 --> 00:25:46,162
Wait, I've tried already.

614
00:25:46,361 --> 00:25:47,281
I've done my best,

615
00:25:47,281 --> 00:25:48,281
but failed.

616
00:25:48,402 --> 00:25:49,162
That's why I came

617
00:25:49,162 --> 00:25:50,162
to discuss alternatives.

618
00:25:51,162 --> 00:25:52,642
But I previously stated

619
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:54,081
the offline stores' funding

620
00:25:54,121 --> 00:25:55,722
comes from Yuanhang.

621
00:25:57,321 --> 00:25:58,521
The money is regulated.

622
00:25:58,521 --> 00:26:00,002
Redirecting it violates agreements.

623
00:26:01,922 --> 00:26:03,281
Then securing loans

624
00:26:03,321 --> 00:26:04,281
remains our only option.

625
00:26:05,002 --> 00:26:05,442
No worries.

626
00:26:05,561 --> 00:26:06,482
I'll try other banks

627
00:26:06,642 --> 00:26:08,081
one by one.

628
00:26:08,281 --> 00:26:08,962
Don't worry.

629
00:26:08,962 --> 00:26:10,521
Let's work separately. I'll make calls.

630
00:26:17,321 --> 00:26:17,841
Yan.

631
00:26:18,402 --> 00:26:19,962
Still at work?

632
00:26:20,321 --> 00:26:21,601
I'm handling something.

633
00:26:22,722 --> 00:26:23,642
Anything happened?

634
00:26:24,521 --> 00:26:25,281
Nothing serious.

635
00:26:25,402 --> 00:26:26,081
We'll handle it.

636
00:26:26,962 --> 00:26:28,281
How are things with Shen Haoming?

637
00:26:28,281 --> 00:26:30,162
It's been ages
since I heard you vent about him.

638
00:26:30,162 --> 00:26:32,561
I'll talk about it when I get back.

639
00:26:33,722 --> 00:26:34,841
Guess what?

640
00:26:34,841 --> 00:26:36,400
There is a hope for being authorized.

641
00:26:36,482 --> 00:26:37,761
I'll stay here a few more days.

642
00:26:37,882 --> 00:26:38,482
Good.

643
00:26:38,561 --> 00:26:39,801
Stay there without worries.

644
00:26:39,882 --> 00:26:41,002
It's all under control.

645
00:26:41,002 --> 00:26:42,482
You get along with Shen Haoming.

646
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,202
Don't worry.

647
00:26:43,962 --> 00:26:45,202
Alright, I'll hang up now.

648
00:26:45,682 --> 00:26:46,162
Bye.

649
00:26:51,722 --> 00:26:53,041
I'll keep working on it tomorrow.

650
00:26:54,162 --> 00:26:55,561
You should get back early.

651
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:29,761
Honestly,

652
00:27:31,521 --> 00:27:32,162
I've never seen

653
00:27:32,162 --> 00:27:33,442
an outstanding woman like you

654
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:34,841
obsessing

655
00:27:34,841 --> 00:27:35,922
over one man for years.

656
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,321
But he doesn't care.

657
00:27:46,962 --> 00:27:47,962
The more devoted I am,

658
00:27:48,242 --> 00:27:49,402
the more I look like a fool.

659
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:52,482
But strangely,

660
00:27:54,242 --> 00:27:55,882
despite all the rumors,

661
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,992
there's no official news
about Shen Haoming and Xu Yan

662
00:27:59,321 --> 00:28:00,402
finalizing their divorce.

663
00:28:02,601 --> 00:28:04,202
Are they still together?

664
00:28:06,402 --> 00:28:07,281
You often see him.

665
00:28:07,281 --> 00:28:08,002
Don't you know?

666
00:28:08,442 --> 00:28:09,402
How would I know?

667
00:28:13,601 --> 00:28:14,121
Fine.

668
00:28:15,242 --> 00:28:16,242
Let's not talk about it.

669
00:28:16,841 --> 00:28:17,682
Tell me about how you

670
00:28:18,601 --> 00:28:19,281
and Shen Haoming

671
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:20,002
first met.

672
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:22,242
Back then,

673
00:28:22,922 --> 00:28:23,642
he and my sister

674
00:28:23,642 --> 00:28:25,402
attended the same university in London.

675
00:28:26,642 --> 00:28:27,402
Well,

676
00:28:28,521 --> 00:28:29,281
I was

677
00:28:29,281 --> 00:28:31,561
at a boarding school
taking prep courses.

678
00:28:32,442 --> 00:28:33,361
Later,

679
00:28:34,281 --> 00:28:35,162
I watched them

680
00:28:35,202 --> 00:28:36,682
date for a while.

681
00:28:38,962 --> 00:28:39,922
Afterwards,

682
00:28:40,162 --> 00:28:41,962
my sister broke up with him.

683
00:28:43,482 --> 00:28:44,442
Then later,

684
00:28:45,162 --> 00:28:47,281
my sister discovered she was pregnant.

685
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:50,121
Pregnant?

686
00:28:51,281 --> 00:28:52,242
Whose child was it?

687
00:29:10,321 --> 00:29:12,121
What's wrong with Han Weiping?

688
00:29:13,361 --> 00:29:14,642
Can't even handle simple things.

689
00:29:17,002 --> 00:29:19,962
Baraikin chose to partner with Jinda.

690
00:29:23,242 --> 00:29:24,601
He couldn't find evidence

691
00:29:24,922 --> 00:29:26,321
of Shen Haoming and Xu Yan

692
00:29:26,321 --> 00:29:27,002
getting divorced.

693
00:29:28,081 --> 00:29:29,561
Shen Haoming performed too well

694
00:29:29,722 --> 00:29:30,722
in front of Baraikin.

695
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:35,561
Shen Haoming and Xu Yan

696
00:29:35,561 --> 00:29:36,761
are nearly reconciled,

697
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:39,002
yet he's still fixated on their divorce.

698
00:29:40,281 --> 00:29:41,121
I feel disappointed.

699
00:29:42,722 --> 00:29:43,601
What a fool he is!

700
00:29:45,882 --> 00:29:46,841
Where is Han Weiping?

701
00:29:48,962 --> 00:29:49,801
He will arrive soon.

702
00:29:59,761 --> 00:30:00,361
Dad.

703
00:30:01,402 --> 00:30:02,281
Nice shot.

704
00:30:04,482 --> 00:30:06,482
Any updates on Shen Haoming?

705
00:30:09,081 --> 00:30:09,601
Dad.

706
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:11,962
I'm still...

707
00:30:30,682 --> 00:30:31,242
Mr. Lin.

708
00:30:33,281 --> 00:30:33,882
It's settled.

709
00:30:34,321 --> 00:30:35,242
Finally sorted it out.

710
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:36,801
About the loan?

711
00:30:37,682 --> 00:30:39,202
(Feng Zhiyuan's business card)
This is my old colleague.

712
00:30:39,202 --> 00:30:40,361
Do you remember Feng?

713
00:30:40,482 --> 00:30:41,962
He's now at a bank

714
00:30:42,002 --> 00:30:43,561
as a senior credit specialist.

715
00:30:43,882 --> 00:30:45,081
I called him yesterday

716
00:30:45,162 --> 00:30:46,281
to inquire if his bank

717
00:30:46,281 --> 00:30:47,722
handles cross-regional loans.

718
00:30:47,922 --> 00:30:49,361
Turns out he's willing to help.

719
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:51,442
That's great.

720
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:52,841
So I'm checking with you.

721
00:30:53,642 --> 00:30:54,761
I'm fine with it.

722
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:56,081
If possible, make it quick.

723
00:30:56,361 --> 00:30:56,841
Alright.

724
00:30:57,162 --> 00:30:58,361
Now I have a clear plan.

725
00:30:58,642 --> 00:30:59,442
But he wants us

726
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:01,202
to prepare the financial statements,

727
00:31:01,202 --> 00:31:02,281
along with other documents.

728
00:31:02,601 --> 00:31:03,962
If approved smoothly, funds can

729
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,041
be released this month.

730
00:31:05,242 --> 00:31:06,281
But we need to act fast.

731
00:31:06,361 --> 00:31:07,922
The submission window is closing soon.

732
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:09,442
Alright, you get

733
00:31:09,442 --> 00:31:10,281
all the papers ready.

734
00:31:11,642 --> 00:31:12,361
All done.

735
00:31:12,482 --> 00:31:12,962
Take a look.

736
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:14,512
Stamp it if there are no issues.

737
00:31:15,521 --> 00:31:16,361
Well done.

738
00:31:16,922 --> 00:31:17,801
Impressive.

739
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,808
(Balance Sheet)

740
00:31:25,962 --> 00:31:26,761
Just stamp it here.

741
00:31:28,521 --> 00:31:29,361
Okay, got it.

742
00:31:29,882 --> 00:31:31,121
If there are no problems,

743
00:31:31,121 --> 00:31:31,882
after this,

744
00:31:31,922 --> 00:31:34,202
we'll go back home tomorrow
by high-speed rail.

745
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:36,432
We'll urge him
to settle this matter quickly.

746
00:31:36,841 --> 00:31:38,041
Since you're the deputy,

747
00:31:38,281 --> 00:31:40,321
you must be present in person to sign.

748
00:31:40,801 --> 00:31:41,922
Let's leave early then.

749
00:31:42,482 --> 00:31:43,408
Early in the morning.

750
00:31:43,482 --> 00:31:43,962
Okay.

751
00:31:44,081 --> 00:31:44,882
I'll buy tickets.

752
00:31:46,361 --> 00:31:47,841
If this gets done successfully,

753
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:48,601
I will

754
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:49,521
owe you big.

755
00:31:49,962 --> 00:31:50,402
You don't

756
00:31:50,402 --> 00:31:51,242
have to thank me.

757
00:31:51,361 --> 00:31:53,264
Helping the company
means helping myself too.

758
00:31:54,842 --> 00:31:56,816
(Income Statement)

759
00:32:07,361 --> 00:32:08,081
Morning, Mr. Shen.

760
00:32:08,642 --> 00:32:09,081
Morning.

761
00:32:09,402 --> 00:32:10,121
Morning, Mr. Shen.

762
00:32:11,482 --> 00:32:11,962
Morning.

763
00:32:13,841 --> 00:32:14,361
Morning.

764
00:32:14,361 --> 00:32:14,801
Mr. Shen.

765
00:32:14,801 --> 00:32:15,361
Morning.

766
00:32:15,962 --> 00:32:17,081
Nice hairstyle.

767
00:32:18,682 --> 00:32:19,402
Morning, Mr. Shen.

768
00:32:20,121 --> 00:32:20,801
Morning.

769
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,784
(Open Mindedness)

770
00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:30,801
Watch your step.

771
00:32:35,402 --> 00:32:36,081
Have a seat.

772
00:32:39,242 --> 00:32:39,761
Chairman,

773
00:32:39,761 --> 00:32:41,121
I'm here to report

774
00:32:41,442 --> 00:32:43,162
on our collaboration with Mr. Baraikin.

775
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:44,722
The agreement has been signed.

776
00:32:45,162 --> 00:32:46,002
Early next month,

777
00:32:46,121 --> 00:32:47,521
our core team

778
00:32:47,642 --> 00:32:48,601
will fly to Moscow

779
00:32:49,081 --> 00:32:49,682
to handle

780
00:32:49,922 --> 00:32:51,242
the design aspects

781
00:32:51,482 --> 00:32:52,761
and operational procedures.

782
00:32:54,402 --> 00:32:55,242
Sit down.

783
00:32:56,361 --> 00:32:57,442
Regarding this project,

784
00:32:57,801 --> 00:32:58,361
both parties

785
00:32:58,521 --> 00:32:59,922
have high expectations.

786
00:33:01,402 --> 00:33:01,841
We aim

787
00:33:01,841 --> 00:33:03,321
to develop it

788
00:33:03,642 --> 00:33:05,801
into a landmark Jinda builds overseas.

789
00:33:07,002 --> 00:33:08,081
That's my objective too.

790
00:33:09,002 --> 00:33:10,121
All workflows

791
00:33:10,361 --> 00:33:10,962
and key aspects

792
00:33:11,081 --> 00:33:12,002
will be supervised.

793
00:33:13,162 --> 00:33:13,642
Moreover,

794
00:33:19,202 --> 00:33:20,841
according to East China's report,

795
00:33:21,018 --> 00:33:22,121
(Jinda: North Waichuan
Development Proposal)

796
00:33:22,121 --> 00:33:25,081
the North Waichuan,
adjacent to the Huanghu River,

797
00:33:26,281 --> 00:33:28,482
marks the first residential land release
in three years

798
00:33:28,801 --> 00:33:30,202
by the local government.

799
00:33:31,521 --> 00:33:33,561
The starting land price per square meter

800
00:33:33,922 --> 00:33:35,561
sets a new record.

801
00:33:36,482 --> 00:33:37,162
This is

802
00:33:37,162 --> 00:33:38,242
the biggest land auction

803
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,682
in East China at present.

804
00:33:41,682 --> 00:33:42,722
You want this plot?

805
00:33:43,882 --> 00:33:44,321
Yes.

806
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:46,321
For this land,

807
00:33:46,361 --> 00:33:48,841
we don't need to hold 15 percent

808
00:33:48,882 --> 00:33:49,722
of rental housing.

809
00:33:50,722 --> 00:33:52,162
Under current regulations,

810
00:33:52,202 --> 00:33:52,841
this increases

811
00:33:53,202 --> 00:33:54,882
the saleable area percentage

812
00:33:55,281 --> 00:33:56,081
and reduces

813
00:33:56,121 --> 00:33:57,281
per-unit development costs.

814
00:33:58,162 --> 00:34:00,281
Market expectations

815
00:34:00,361 --> 00:34:00,922
predict

816
00:34:01,321 --> 00:34:01,922
at least

817
00:34:02,002 --> 00:34:03,321
a 20 percent premium.

818
00:34:04,402 --> 00:34:05,002
Therefore,

819
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:06,162
from all perspectives,

820
00:34:06,761 --> 00:34:07,722
this is undoubtedly

821
00:34:07,722 --> 00:34:09,242
the most sought-after plot

822
00:34:09,761 --> 00:34:10,242
and

823
00:34:10,442 --> 00:34:11,922
a prime development zone.

824
00:34:14,361 --> 00:34:15,801
I support your bid plan.

825
00:34:16,442 --> 00:34:17,081
You've secured

826
00:34:17,081 --> 00:34:18,002
a deal with Baraikin.

827
00:34:18,081 --> 00:34:18,642
If you also

828
00:34:19,162 --> 00:34:20,521
obtain the plot

829
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:21,482
in North Waichuan,

830
00:34:21,922 --> 00:34:23,242
it will show that you,

831
00:34:24,002 --> 00:34:24,601
in Jinda,

832
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:26,242
have sufficient credibility.

833
00:34:27,922 --> 00:34:28,682
Thank you.

834
00:34:29,922 --> 00:34:30,361
Good.

835
00:34:30,992 --> 00:34:32,841
There'll be a meeting
next Friday at 9:00 AM.

836
00:34:32,841 --> 00:34:33,482
Don't be late.

837
00:34:34,081 --> 00:34:35,442
The agenda is...

838
00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:39,361
I'll fulfill my promise to you

839
00:34:40,081 --> 00:34:41,361
by giving you a board seat

840
00:34:41,402 --> 00:34:43,041
because you made a deal with Baraikin.

841
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:47,002
I should thank Mr. Baraikin

842
00:34:47,482 --> 00:34:49,081
for overlooking my previous concealment.

843
00:34:49,442 --> 00:34:50,482
I feel sorry.

844
00:34:50,842 --> 00:34:51,402
Haoming.

845
00:34:52,241 --> 00:34:53,802
Your capabilities are

846
00:34:54,161 --> 00:34:55,482
unquestionable.

847
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:57,482
But your methods

848
00:34:59,201 --> 00:35:00,521
don't align with my principles.

849
00:35:03,121 --> 00:35:03,802
In business,

850
00:35:04,762 --> 00:35:06,241
integrity is fundamental.

851
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:08,762
The core principle should

852
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:11,322
be mutually beneficial cooperation.

853
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:14,442
I don't know

854
00:35:14,442 --> 00:35:15,241
what caused

855
00:35:16,002 --> 00:35:17,402
your drastic change.

856
00:35:17,442 --> 00:35:18,362
But I believe

857
00:35:18,601 --> 00:35:19,201
you

858
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:20,482
understand this deep down now.

859
00:35:21,282 --> 00:35:22,842
Just like the marriage

860
00:35:22,882 --> 00:35:23,882
between me and Yan.

861
00:35:25,442 --> 00:35:26,681
Our marriage

862
00:35:26,721 --> 00:35:27,882
was filled with arguments

863
00:35:28,121 --> 00:35:29,081
and deceptions.

864
00:35:30,442 --> 00:35:31,762
What kept us together was

865
00:35:32,681 --> 00:35:33,601
our sincerity.

866
00:35:35,561 --> 00:35:35,922
Dad.

867
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:37,922
Yan and I have reconciled.

868
00:35:38,882 --> 00:35:39,721
I'm glad

869
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:42,201
we're still married.

870
00:35:44,282 --> 00:35:45,601
Your mom and I

871
00:35:47,002 --> 00:35:48,842
are happy for you.

872
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:50,882
Most importantly,

873
00:35:50,922 --> 00:35:52,601
Haochen will be thrilled.

874
00:35:53,201 --> 00:35:53,802
Yes.

875
00:35:56,802 --> 00:35:57,721
If you'll excuse me,

876
00:35:57,762 --> 00:35:58,561
I have to go.

877
00:36:03,002 --> 00:36:03,561
Wait.

878
00:36:12,081 --> 00:36:13,322
What kind of flower is this?

879
00:36:15,962 --> 00:36:16,681
You know,

880
00:36:17,721 --> 00:36:18,882
it's quite interesting.

881
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:20,402
Ms. Xu,

882
00:36:21,282 --> 00:36:21,882
welcome back.

883
00:36:22,882 --> 00:36:23,561
Mr. Liang.

884
00:36:26,561 --> 00:36:27,482
Flowers for me?

885
00:36:28,201 --> 00:36:28,482
Sure.

886
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:28,922
Thank you.

887
00:36:28,962 --> 00:36:29,521
For you.

888
00:36:30,681 --> 00:36:31,376
I'll put it here.

889
00:36:32,362 --> 00:36:33,121
Beautiful.

890
00:36:38,922 --> 00:36:40,601
What did you learn

891
00:36:40,762 --> 00:36:41,641
in Gubei Town?

892
00:36:43,362 --> 00:36:45,121
From theory to practice,

893
00:36:46,721 --> 00:36:47,201
I studied

894
00:36:47,241 --> 00:36:48,802
the history of botanical dyeing

895
00:36:48,842 --> 00:36:50,882
and learned traditional craftsmanship.

896
00:36:50,882 --> 00:36:51,681
It was enriching.

897
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:53,041
I plan

898
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:54,081
to launch a collection

899
00:36:54,081 --> 00:36:55,882
about botanical dyeing this autumn,

900
00:36:56,362 --> 00:36:57,482
which will also promote

901
00:36:57,482 --> 00:36:58,641
Gubei Town's heritage.

902
00:37:04,882 --> 00:37:05,362
Excellent.

903
00:37:06,962 --> 00:37:08,482
You seem to be glowing today.

904
00:37:09,762 --> 00:37:11,161
The romantic aura is around you.

905
00:37:15,922 --> 00:37:17,282
Shen Haoming and I made up.

906
00:37:19,081 --> 00:37:19,762
I noticed.

907
00:37:20,521 --> 00:37:22,201
After wrapping up current projects,

908
00:37:23,521 --> 00:37:25,681
I'll move back home.

909
00:37:29,282 --> 00:37:29,842
I understand.

910
00:37:30,962 --> 00:37:32,041
After making decisions,

911
00:37:32,561 --> 00:37:33,681
you won't change your mind.

912
00:37:35,282 --> 00:37:36,322
You know exactly

913
00:37:36,322 --> 00:37:37,081
what you want.

914
00:37:38,002 --> 00:37:39,121
But I still wonder

915
00:37:40,241 --> 00:37:40,842
why.

916
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:45,601
What

917
00:37:45,601 --> 00:37:47,482
sustains a marriage?

918
00:37:47,721 --> 00:37:48,842
Either

919
00:37:49,641 --> 00:37:50,882
genuine mutual affection,

920
00:37:51,482 --> 00:37:52,442
or

921
00:37:53,601 --> 00:37:54,762
strategic interdependence

922
00:37:55,081 --> 00:37:56,002
and indivisibility.

923
00:37:57,264 --> 00:37:58,081
Where do you stand?

924
00:37:58,081 --> 00:37:58,561
Both.

925
00:38:02,922 --> 00:38:04,442
We used to hide things,

926
00:38:06,282 --> 00:38:07,561
but now we are

927
00:38:08,802 --> 00:38:09,641
open and honest.

928
00:38:12,762 --> 00:38:13,241
Thank you

929
00:38:13,241 --> 00:38:14,241
for telling me candidly.

930
00:38:17,121 --> 00:38:18,241
If your relationship status

931
00:38:18,241 --> 00:38:19,282
ever changes,

932
00:38:19,282 --> 00:38:20,041
please inform me.

933
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:21,200
I can be your backup option.

934
00:38:25,081 --> 00:38:26,241
Actually, Shen Haoming

935
00:38:26,241 --> 00:38:27,521
has always been my only choice.

936
00:38:31,002 --> 00:38:31,882
Looks like tonight

937
00:38:31,882 --> 00:38:33,081
I'll need to drown my sorrows.

938
00:38:35,362 --> 00:38:36,681
Though you never even gave me

939
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:37,601
a chance to start,

940
00:38:38,882 --> 00:38:40,362
I've invested so much emotionally.

941
00:38:43,002 --> 00:38:43,762
I need time

942
00:38:43,762 --> 00:38:44,482
to heal.

943
00:38:46,121 --> 00:38:47,322
If you can still joke around,

944
00:38:47,322 --> 00:38:48,282
it means you're okay.

945
00:38:48,922 --> 00:38:50,201
Plus, your act was convincing.

946
00:38:52,482 --> 00:38:53,081
Xu Yan.

947
00:38:54,601 --> 00:38:55,241
I'm serious.

948
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:57,002
Qiao Lin,

949
00:38:57,282 --> 00:38:58,121
Yao, Guan, and I

950
00:38:58,521 --> 00:38:59,161
are all the same

951
00:39:01,241 --> 00:39:02,482
as your strong backers

952
00:39:02,521 --> 00:39:03,121
and allies.

953
00:39:04,641 --> 00:39:05,681
You can rely on us.

954
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:10,362
I understand.

955
00:39:12,681 --> 00:39:13,442
Thank you.

956
00:39:14,882 --> 00:39:16,482
I wanted to try dating an older woman,

957
00:39:16,482 --> 00:39:17,641
but failed.

958
00:39:20,482 --> 00:39:21,802
So, we'll just be friends.

959
00:39:24,442 --> 00:39:25,201
May you be happy.

960
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:29,842
May you always stay carefree.

961
00:39:30,721 --> 00:39:31,842
Sure, I will.

962
00:40:10,402 --> 00:40:10,962
Your godfather

963
00:40:11,002 --> 00:40:12,121
told me to talk with you.

964
00:40:13,121 --> 00:40:13,681
What's up?

965
00:40:14,521 --> 00:40:15,362
Shen Jinsong decided

966
00:40:15,402 --> 00:40:16,944
to give Shen Haoming a board seat.

967
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:17,802
He's informed

968
00:40:17,802 --> 00:40:18,762
all shareholders.

969
00:40:19,641 --> 00:40:20,601
Your godfather wants us

970
00:40:20,601 --> 00:40:21,161
to stop this

971
00:40:21,161 --> 00:40:22,002
at all costs.

972
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:24,482
Is Shen Haoming that easy to handle?

973
00:40:25,681 --> 00:40:26,962
He is at a vital time

974
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:28,282
for sitting on the board.

975
00:40:28,721 --> 00:40:29,842
He'll be extra cautious.

976
00:40:31,121 --> 00:40:32,442
Plus, he's made up with Xu Yan.

977
00:40:32,762 --> 00:40:33,362
Now, he is

978
00:40:33,362 --> 00:40:34,561
riding high on success.

979
00:40:35,081 --> 00:40:35,842
They've reconciled?

980
00:40:36,402 --> 00:40:37,201
How did you know?

981
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:38,962
Chen Lin is making arrangements.

982
00:40:40,002 --> 00:40:41,201
Xu Yan might soon

983
00:40:41,201 --> 00:40:42,161
move back home.

984
00:40:43,882 --> 00:40:45,442
I didn't see this coming.

985
00:40:45,962 --> 00:40:47,521
Even his love life's going smoothly?

986
00:40:47,922 --> 00:40:49,041
But when Fang Lei was drunk,

987
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:50,002
she told me

988
00:40:50,641 --> 00:40:51,482
that her sister

989
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:52,641
dated Shen Haoming

990
00:40:53,241 --> 00:40:54,161
and even got pregnant.

991
00:40:54,962 --> 00:40:55,802
Pregnant?

992
00:40:58,362 --> 00:40:59,280
What about the child?

993
00:40:59,721 --> 00:41:00,521
Was it born?

994
00:41:00,922 --> 00:41:01,802
Was it Shen Haoming's?

995
00:41:02,002 --> 00:41:03,201
I don't know. She didn't say.

996
00:41:03,762 --> 00:41:05,121
You've been with Fang Lei.

997
00:41:05,641 --> 00:41:07,041
Couldn't you get more information?

998
00:41:08,641 --> 00:41:09,241
No.

999
00:41:09,402 --> 00:41:10,201
She's tight-lipped.

1000
00:41:10,521 --> 00:41:11,641
Then dig deeper.

1001
00:41:12,521 --> 00:41:13,962
There's definitely something there.

1002
00:41:22,081 --> 00:41:22,521
There is

1003
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:23,521
no surprise at all?

1004
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:25,442
What's wrong?

1005
00:41:26,201 --> 00:41:27,402
Have you stopped pretending?

1006
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:33,601
What?

1007
00:41:33,842 --> 00:41:34,842
How did you get hurt?

1008
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:36,922
At boxing class.

1009
00:41:36,922 --> 00:41:37,762
Overdid the strength.

1010
00:41:37,762 --> 00:41:38,282
Fracture.

1011
00:41:38,322 --> 00:41:38,842
It's fine.

1012
00:41:39,922 --> 00:41:41,201
How could you be so careless?

1013
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:46,681
Be more careful next time you box.

1014
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:47,882
If you're injured,

1015
00:41:48,962 --> 00:41:50,041
who will cook for me?

1016
00:41:53,442 --> 00:41:54,002
By the way,

1017
00:41:54,402 --> 00:41:55,641
I saw a nice custom tailor shop

1018
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:57,081
while shopping today.

1019
00:41:57,442 --> 00:41:58,241
It's pretty good.

1020
00:41:58,681 --> 00:41:59,721
Take you there tomorrow

1021
00:42:00,842 --> 00:42:01,962
and pick you some.

1022
00:42:02,962 --> 00:42:04,201
Tailored suits

1023
00:42:04,362 --> 00:42:05,842
are better than ready-to-wear.

1024
00:42:09,681 --> 00:42:10,864
Need to tell you something.

1025
00:42:11,721 --> 00:42:12,641
Get ready for this.

1026
00:42:13,802 --> 00:42:14,282
Go ahead.

1027
00:42:14,962 --> 00:42:16,282
I just received the news.

1028
00:42:17,241 --> 00:42:18,768
Shen Haoming and Xu Yan have made up.

1029
00:42:18,882 --> 00:42:19,882
They won't divorce.

1030
00:42:33,721 --> 00:42:34,521
Don't be afraid.

1031
00:42:35,322 --> 00:42:36,402
I'll always be with you.

1032
00:42:38,002 --> 00:42:39,282
If you want to deal with him,

1033
00:42:40,201 --> 00:42:41,002
I'll unconditionally

1034
00:42:41,002 --> 00:42:41,762
stand on your side.

1035
00:42:43,882 --> 00:42:44,601
I've said it.

1036
00:42:46,521 --> 00:42:47,641
I don't care.

1037
00:42:49,842 --> 00:42:51,081
He had a quarrel with Xu Yan,

1038
00:42:51,362 --> 00:42:52,681
yet he chose Xu Yan in the end.

1039
00:42:53,282 --> 00:42:54,601
He never cares about you at all.

1040
00:42:55,721 --> 00:42:56,322
Why should he

1041
00:42:56,322 --> 00:42:57,041
care about me?

1042
00:42:57,842 --> 00:42:59,601
He must have his reasons

1043
00:42:59,962 --> 00:43:00,922
to choose Xu Yan.

1044
00:43:01,521 --> 00:43:02,640
I don't want to dig deeper.

1045
00:43:03,282 --> 00:43:04,442
You've loved him for years.

1046
00:43:05,201 --> 00:43:06,041
You love him,

1047
00:43:06,681 --> 00:43:07,721
yet he hurt you.

1048
00:43:08,161 --> 00:43:09,041
Are you letting it go?

1049
00:43:18,442 --> 00:43:19,322
Since Shen Haoming

1050
00:43:19,322 --> 00:43:20,241
never likes me,

1051
00:43:22,081 --> 00:43:23,121
I should get over him.

1052
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:31,402
When we drank, you said

1053
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,482
your sister got pregnant

1054
00:43:33,201 --> 00:43:33,922
in the UK.

1055
00:43:36,282 --> 00:43:36,762
Is that

1056
00:43:36,762 --> 00:43:37,882
Shen Haoming's child?

1057
00:43:39,842 --> 00:43:40,802
Of course not.

1058
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:41,922
You misheard.

1059
00:43:43,762 --> 00:43:44,681
How could I mishear?

1060
00:43:44,681 --> 00:43:45,362
We were here...

1061
00:43:45,362 --> 00:43:46,802
You drank too, didn't you?

1062
00:43:47,482 --> 00:43:48,362
You got drunk.

1063
00:44:05,802 --> 00:44:06,681
You guys chat.

1064
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:08,080
The food's almost ready.

1065
00:44:09,241 --> 00:44:09,681
Yan.

1066
00:44:09,762 --> 00:44:10,721
You've forgiven Haoming?

1067
00:44:10,842 --> 00:44:11,802
You two made up?

1068
00:44:15,121 --> 00:44:16,601
We've always been good.

1069
00:44:18,521 --> 00:44:19,442
Come on.

1070
00:44:19,482 --> 00:44:20,322
I have

1071
00:44:20,322 --> 00:44:21,681
your gloomy-faced photos.

1072
00:44:22,002 --> 00:44:23,002
Enough, just eat.

1073
00:44:23,322 --> 00:44:23,842
Stop eating.

1074
00:44:23,962 --> 00:44:24,882
Dinner's almost ready.

1075
00:44:27,161 --> 00:44:27,641
Oh right,

1076
00:44:28,601 --> 00:44:29,601
I have a gift for you.

1077
00:44:29,681 --> 00:44:30,081
Look.

1078
00:44:33,041 --> 00:44:33,802
What kind of gift?

1079
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:34,601
Have a look.

1080
00:44:36,442 --> 00:44:37,121
More drawings.

1081
00:44:37,922 --> 00:44:38,442
Let me see.

1082
00:44:38,721 --> 00:44:39,282
Let me guess.

1083
00:44:39,282 --> 00:44:40,802
You drew...

1084
00:44:42,121 --> 00:44:43,322
These are two horns?

1085
00:44:43,922 --> 00:44:45,842
Horns? These are tornadoes!

1086
00:44:48,521 --> 00:44:49,002
Look,

1087
00:44:49,201 --> 00:44:49,962
after you left,

1088
00:44:49,962 --> 00:44:51,201
a tornado

1089
00:44:51,442 --> 00:44:52,681
swept through our home,

1090
00:44:52,681 --> 00:44:54,081
shattering everything.

1091
00:44:54,121 --> 00:44:54,962
It's not complete.

1092
00:44:59,282 --> 00:44:59,802
Look.

1093
00:45:01,681 --> 00:45:02,402
I think this one

1094
00:45:02,402 --> 00:45:03,362
is my best work.

1095
00:45:06,322 --> 00:45:07,002
Turning the page?

1096
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:11,402
Look,

1097
00:45:12,041 --> 00:45:12,521
this

1098
00:45:12,721 --> 00:45:14,521
big, chubby one is my brother,

1099
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:15,721
and this is me.

1100
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:17,721
After you left,

1101
00:45:18,201 --> 00:45:18,762
both of us

1102
00:45:18,762 --> 00:45:20,482
desperately wanted you back.

1103
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:22,002
We were sad every day.

1104
00:45:30,762 --> 00:45:31,721
And this is...

1105
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:32,362
You.

1106
00:45:33,282 --> 00:45:33,842
Me?

1107
00:45:34,561 --> 00:45:35,121
Why?

1108
00:45:35,842 --> 00:45:36,362
See,

1109
00:45:36,882 --> 00:45:38,601
you ventured out alone.

1110
00:45:38,681 --> 00:45:39,762
It must've been tough.

1111
00:45:40,322 --> 00:45:42,201
Look, you're surrounded by glaciers.

1112
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:47,842
Next page.

1113
00:45:49,882 --> 00:45:50,362
Look.

1114
00:45:51,561 --> 00:45:52,482
See,

1115
00:45:52,641 --> 00:45:53,442
I've always

1116
00:45:53,442 --> 00:45:54,482
kept a light on for you

1117
00:45:54,641 --> 00:45:56,081
to guide you home.

1118
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:00,402
See?

1119
00:46:00,442 --> 00:46:01,681
Now, you've returned.

1120
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:05,362
There are even stars here.

1121
00:46:17,561 --> 00:46:18,681
Finally, you came back.

1122
00:46:19,081 --> 00:46:20,201
(My Family)
We are

1123
00:46:20,241 --> 00:46:21,002
the happiest family

1124
00:46:21,002 --> 00:46:22,081
in the world.

1125
00:46:26,362 --> 00:46:27,121
More after this?

1126
00:46:27,561 --> 00:46:28,762
No. I'll draw more later.

1127
00:46:30,201 --> 00:46:31,161
Keep drawing.

1128
00:46:31,521 --> 00:46:32,681
Fill this entire sketchbook.

1129
00:46:33,641 --> 00:46:34,882
To find out what happens next,

1130
00:46:34,922 --> 00:46:36,121
stay tuned.

1131
00:46:37,762 --> 00:46:38,322
Haochen.

1132
00:46:38,601 --> 00:46:39,882
This is the best gift

1133
00:46:39,882 --> 00:46:41,241
I've ever received.

1134
00:46:41,561 --> 00:46:42,002
Really?

1135
00:46:42,161 --> 00:46:42,641
Sure.

1136
00:46:44,121 --> 00:46:45,648
Much better than your brother's gift.

1137
00:46:45,882 --> 00:46:46,762
Dinner's ready.

1138
00:46:47,201 --> 00:46:47,762
Come and eat.

1139
00:46:49,081 --> 00:46:49,561
Come here.

1140
00:46:51,322 --> 00:46:51,882
Haoming.

1141
00:46:52,201 --> 00:46:52,641
Can I sleep

1142
00:46:52,641 --> 00:46:54,201
with you two tonight?

1143
00:46:54,322 --> 00:46:55,121
It's been ages

1144
00:46:55,121 --> 00:46:56,482
since I slept with you two.

1145
00:46:56,762 --> 00:46:57,601
No problem.

1146
00:46:58,561 --> 00:46:59,121
Really?

1147
00:46:59,842 --> 00:47:00,681
Awesome!

1148
00:47:01,362 --> 00:47:02,681
Come and eat.

1149
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:04,041
What are you holding?

1150
00:47:04,842 --> 00:47:05,482
What's this?

1151
00:47:06,521 --> 00:47:07,402
Give it to me!

1152
00:47:09,282 --> 00:47:09,681
Haoming.

1153
00:47:09,681 --> 00:47:10,641
What did you cook?

1154
00:47:10,882 --> 00:47:12,121
(My Family)
Delicious.

1155
00:47:13,201 --> 00:47:14,096
Washed your hands?

1156
00:47:14,521 --> 00:47:15,081
Wash.

1157
00:47:18,521 --> 00:47:19,641
Hurry!

1158
00:47:24,521 --> 00:47:25,922
Alright, come eat now.

1159
00:47:26,641 --> 00:47:27,201
Yan.

1160
00:47:27,282 --> 00:47:28,002
Yan, come on!

1161
00:47:28,402 --> 00:47:28,922
Coming.

1162
00:47:30,882 --> 00:47:31,802
Do you want to see?

1163
00:47:32,362 --> 00:47:32,681
Sure.

1164
00:47:32,681 --> 00:47:33,041
Haochen.

1165
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:34,282
Can I show this to him?

1166
00:47:34,362 --> 00:47:35,482
Of course!

1167
00:47:35,842 --> 00:47:37,121
But I already showed him.

1168
00:47:39,842 --> 00:47:40,561
Give it to me.

1169
00:47:44,121 --> 00:47:44,962
Eat more.

Let's eat.

1171
00:47:49,681 --> 00:47:50,721
Have some more.

1172
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:52,081

You too.

1177
00:47:57,121 --> 00:47:58,002
Have more vegetables.

1178
00:48:06,201 --> 00:48:06,842
I made the bed.

1179
00:48:06,882 --> 00:48:07,962
I'm sleeping in the middle.

1180
00:48:10,201 --> 00:48:12,362
I want the middle spot tonight.

1186
00:50:14,041 --> 00:50:15,201
studying abroad together.

1187
00:50:16,201 --> 00:50:17,041
Key focus:

1188
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:18,402
the child.
