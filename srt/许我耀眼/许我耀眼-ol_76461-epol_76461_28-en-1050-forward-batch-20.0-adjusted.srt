00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:05,002
I see it.

33
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:07,842
Alright, talk later.

34
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:09,761
Thanks.

35
00:02:17,641 --> 00:02:19,201
This pattern is absolutely stunning.

36
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:20,362
See if you like any.

37
00:02:21,201 --> 00:02:23,002
This pouch is a linen-cotton blend.

38
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:24,682
It's hand-dyed.

39
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:25,562
Take one.

40
00:02:25,761 --> 00:02:26,362
Looks good?

41
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:27,362
Sure.

42
00:02:28,921 --> 00:02:29,641
I'll take this.

43
00:02:29,802 --> 00:02:30,242
Okay.

44
00:02:32,122 --> 00:02:33,041
Can I see this?

45
00:02:33,122 --> 00:02:34,362
You have great taste.

46
00:02:34,402 --> 00:02:35,082
What I sell

47
00:02:35,082 --> 00:02:36,321
is dyed myself.

48
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:37,201
Each one is unique.

49
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:37,682
This color

50
00:02:37,682 --> 00:02:38,761
really appeals to me.

51
00:02:41,282 --> 00:02:41,881
Take a look.

52
00:02:42,481 --> 00:02:43,282
Does this look nice?

53
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:44,122
Beautiful.

54
00:02:44,201 --> 00:02:45,122
Gorgeous.

55
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:46,921
Looks perfect on you.

56
00:02:47,282 --> 00:02:47,802
Thank you.

57
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,122
I'll take both then.

58
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:50,201
- Okay.
- How much?

59
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,562
I'll give you a discount.

60
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:52,282
300 yuan.

61
00:02:52,562 --> 00:02:53,161
(Batik Shop)
Okay.

62
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:57,481
Madam,

63
00:02:57,921 --> 00:02:58,881
you just mentioned

64
00:02:58,881 --> 00:03:00,921
that these are all your own creations.

65
00:03:01,562 --> 00:03:02,082
Sure.

66
00:03:02,562 --> 00:03:03,481
I dye fabrics for fun.

67
00:03:03,481 --> 00:03:04,041
I've paid.

68
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:05,201
Got it.

69
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:07,682
May I ask something?

70
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:08,562
Well,

71
00:03:08,802 --> 00:03:11,641
to have different blues,

72
00:03:11,682 --> 00:03:13,362
is there a special technique?

73
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,362
I came here

74
00:03:17,402 --> 00:03:18,802
to study botanical dyeing.

75
00:03:18,842 --> 00:03:20,441
Hope to learn from your expertise.

76
00:03:22,282 --> 00:03:23,562
Few young people nowadays

77
00:03:23,562 --> 00:03:24,761
appreciate botanical dyeing.

78
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:26,201
No need for formalities.

79
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:28,402
Let's exchange knowledge.

80
00:03:29,641 --> 00:03:30,441
You already

81
00:03:30,441 --> 00:03:31,682
know quite a lot.

82
00:03:31,888 --> 00:03:33,562
The secret of traditional indigo dyeing

83
00:03:33,562 --> 00:03:35,242
lies in making indigo paste.

84
00:03:36,441 --> 00:03:36,962
However,

85
00:03:36,962 --> 00:03:38,122
precise proportion and timing

86
00:03:38,122 --> 00:03:39,242
are crucial.

87
00:03:39,441 --> 00:03:40,242
For instance,

88
00:03:40,362 --> 00:03:41,201
plant ash proportions

89
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:42,282
being off

90
00:03:42,562 --> 00:03:44,122
or insufficient fermentation time

91
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:45,761
yields dull grayish blues.

92
00:03:47,522 --> 00:03:48,441
So,

93
00:03:48,481 --> 00:03:50,441
few achieve your level

94
00:03:50,601 --> 00:03:51,522
of mastery?

95
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:52,481
Not like that.

96
00:03:54,362 --> 00:03:55,842
I visited

97
00:03:55,881 --> 00:03:57,962
the textile exhibition.

98
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:00,362
I saw a piece made

99
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:01,362
by Chu Dongfeng,

100
00:04:01,362 --> 00:04:03,201
the famous batik artist.

101
00:04:04,282 --> 00:04:05,562
Very impressive.

102
00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:07,562
Sadly,

103
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,041
they say he lost inspiration

104
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,481
from the blues in his life.

105
00:04:10,761 --> 00:04:11,481
So,

106
00:04:11,761 --> 00:04:12,881
he has stopped creating.

107
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,921
He lives alone now,

108
00:04:16,321 --> 00:04:18,201
selling produce

109
00:04:18,201 --> 00:04:18,961
to get by.

110
00:04:19,401 --> 00:04:20,441
He cuts all social ties,

111
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:22,521
living alone.

112
00:04:23,602 --> 00:04:24,362
Seems pitiable.

113
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:26,602
Don't pity him.

114
00:04:27,362 --> 00:04:28,242
He deserves it.

115
00:04:31,162 --> 00:04:32,362
You know him?

116
00:04:33,002 --> 00:04:33,562
No.

117
00:04:33,602 --> 00:04:35,401
After all, Gubei Town is not big.

118
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:37,281
He's just creatively bankrupt.

119
00:04:37,362 --> 00:04:38,602
So he made an excuse.

120
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:40,441
For years,

121
00:04:40,482 --> 00:04:41,722
he's been merely

122
00:04:41,722 --> 00:04:42,722
recycling old ideas.

123
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:44,362
Can't keep up with trends.

124
00:04:44,841 --> 00:04:46,242
What a waste of talent.

125
00:04:46,802 --> 00:04:48,441
He is a batik genius.

126
00:04:50,922 --> 00:04:52,922
The batik pattern I saw

127
00:04:52,922 --> 00:04:54,242
at the exhibition

128
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:55,682
looks similar to the design

129
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:56,482
on the pouch

130
00:04:56,482 --> 00:04:57,922
you made.

131
00:04:58,961 --> 00:04:59,881
Did you two

132
00:04:59,961 --> 00:05:01,242
create it together?

133
00:05:07,362 --> 00:05:08,722
You know about our relationship?

134
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:15,722
The reason I came to see you today

135
00:05:15,722 --> 00:05:16,841
is to tell you

136
00:05:17,521 --> 00:05:18,281
that Master Chu

137
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:19,722
never gave up on batik techniques.

138
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,042
He failed

139
00:05:21,042 --> 00:05:22,722
to find the touch of blue in life.

140
00:05:23,922 --> 00:05:25,881
To put it bluntly, it's all about you...

141
00:05:25,881 --> 00:05:26,441
Enough.

142
00:05:28,002 --> 00:05:29,042
I knew it!

143
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:30,521
Young people like you

144
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:32,162
wouldn't love botanical dyeing.

145
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:34,722
Tell him from me.

146
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:36,722
Stop coveting
my indigo dyeing techniques.

147
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:37,802
Mrs. Chu.

148
00:05:38,482 --> 00:05:39,602
I know

149
00:05:39,602 --> 00:05:40,641
you're still angry

150
00:05:40,802 --> 00:05:41,922
with him now.

151
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:43,802
Why don't you two sit down

152
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:44,641
and talk?

153
00:05:44,961 --> 00:05:45,841
Let Master Chu himself

154
00:05:45,841 --> 00:05:46,881
explain everything to you.

155
00:05:47,002 --> 00:05:48,802
Or maybe you two collaborate
one more time?

156
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:49,362
I think...

157
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:49,881
Collaborate?

158
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:52,122
Why should I work with him?

159
00:05:52,682 --> 00:05:53,401
I have to go.

160
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:53,961
See you.

161
00:05:55,081 --> 00:05:55,521
Wait.

162
00:06:01,122 --> 00:06:01,562
Hello?

163
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:02,602
How's it going?

164
00:06:02,722 --> 00:06:03,362
Going well?

165
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:05,761
Not well.

166
00:06:06,641 --> 00:06:07,482
I've sent a video

167
00:06:07,482 --> 00:06:08,242
to your phone.

168
00:06:08,482 --> 00:06:09,042
Take a look.

169
00:06:20,761 --> 00:06:21,602
Master Chu?

170
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:33,802
Master Chu.

171
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:36,002
Master Chu.

172
00:06:36,641 --> 00:06:37,201
Master Chu.

173
00:06:37,602 --> 00:06:38,242
Master Chu.

174
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:43,441
Excuse me.

175
00:06:44,761 --> 00:06:46,602
Is that person Chu Dongfeng?

176
00:06:46,841 --> 00:06:47,841
I don't know him.

177
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:49,002
But he comes here often

178
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,682
with an annual membership.

179
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:51,682
Every time he visits,

180
00:06:51,722 --> 00:06:53,162
he acts mysteriously.

181
00:06:53,562 --> 00:06:54,162
Super weird.

182
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:55,562
Thanks.

183
00:06:59,521 --> 00:07:01,042
Our traditional Chinese

184
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:01,961
batik techniques

185
00:07:02,562 --> 00:07:03,482
can be applied

186
00:07:03,482 --> 00:07:04,641
not only in daily life

187
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:06,881
but also integrated
with various art forms.

188
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:07,562
Also...

189
00:07:07,841 --> 00:07:08,881
Master Chu?

190
00:07:13,841 --> 00:07:15,242
Why did he go learn this

191
00:07:15,281 --> 00:07:16,722
in such a secretive way?

192
00:07:17,081 --> 00:07:18,242
He bought an annual pass.

193
00:07:18,562 --> 00:07:19,401
Annual pass?

194
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:24,562
But Mrs. Chu told me

195
00:07:24,602 --> 00:07:26,281
that Master Chu is a stick in the mud.

196
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:28,881
He clearly already started to study

197
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,401
and has been changing.

198
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:31,881
Why keep this

199
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:32,602
from her?

200
00:07:34,602 --> 00:07:35,961
Changing oneself

201
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:37,201
isn't that easy.

202
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:39,362
I guess he's afraid

203
00:07:39,362 --> 00:07:40,802
Mrs. Chu won't believe him

204
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:42,448
and thinks he's pretending.

205
00:07:45,122 --> 00:07:45,961
Shen Haoming.

206
00:07:47,722 --> 00:07:49,122
Don't tell me it's a coincidence.

207
00:07:49,122 --> 00:07:50,042
It truly is.

208
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:53,602
Hello? Sophia.

209
00:07:54,961 --> 00:07:56,802
Why did you divorce Mr. Shen?

210
00:07:57,802 --> 00:07:58,682
He already confessed

211
00:07:58,682 --> 00:08:00,521
about you two being
in the cooling-off period.

212
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:02,362
But my husband

213
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:03,682
still decided to work with him.

214
00:08:04,201 --> 00:08:05,761
After all, Jinda Group is outstanding.

215
00:08:06,242 --> 00:08:07,362
Are you okay?

216
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:11,162
Hey.

217
00:08:11,162 --> 00:08:11,722
Chunling.

218
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:12,242
Here.

219
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:14,162
Soda.

220
00:08:15,841 --> 00:08:16,641
Thanks, Chunling.

221
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,482
This Chu's ex-wife's stuff?

222
00:08:21,722 --> 00:08:22,122
Sure.

223
00:08:22,441 --> 00:08:24,081
I just met Mrs. Chu.

224
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:25,201
She left it here.

225
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:26,401
I'll return it to her.

226
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:27,562
It's a gift

227
00:08:27,562 --> 00:08:28,401
from Chu.

228
00:08:28,562 --> 00:08:29,648
She's worn it for decades.

229
00:08:31,081 --> 00:08:32,041
So this means a lot

230
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:32,722
to her?

231
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:33,442
Absolutely.

232
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:34,842
You two chat.

233
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:38,561
Look,

234
00:08:39,161 --> 00:08:39,962
Mrs. Chu

235
00:08:39,962 --> 00:08:41,041
never gets over Master Chu.

236
00:08:41,761 --> 00:08:42,722
Yet she denies it.

237
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:45,322
Master Chu can recreate the color,

238
00:08:45,842 --> 00:08:47,401
but he insists he can't.

239
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:49,602
They're both just

240
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:50,921
hiding their true feelings.

241
00:08:51,122 --> 00:08:52,041
Why can't people

242
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,482
face their own hearts?

243
00:08:53,921 --> 00:08:54,482
It's not

244
00:08:54,482 --> 00:08:55,442
a difficult thing to do.

245
00:09:08,242 --> 00:09:09,962
Since this hairpin is so important,

246
00:09:10,281 --> 00:09:12,482
return it to Mrs. Chu.

247
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:16,002
Maybe this is fate.

248
00:09:30,761 --> 00:09:31,761
Why do you have it?

249
00:09:32,202 --> 00:09:32,801
Obviously,

250
00:09:32,801 --> 00:09:34,161
the owner gave it to me.

251
00:09:35,482 --> 00:09:36,362
She gave it to you?

252
00:09:37,442 --> 00:09:37,962
Why?

253
00:09:38,681 --> 00:09:40,242
She's waiting at the Mountaintop Cafe.

254
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,002
She wants to see you.

255
00:09:42,122 --> 00:09:42,801
She gave me this

256
00:09:42,801 --> 00:09:43,842
in case you doubt her.

257
00:09:45,722 --> 00:09:46,881
I don't believe it.

258
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,242
If she wanted to see me,

259
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:50,641
she would've come.

260
00:09:51,482 --> 00:09:51,962
Fine.

261
00:09:52,362 --> 00:09:53,842
If I can't convince you,

262
00:09:54,082 --> 00:09:55,401
I'll just tell Mrs. Chu

263
00:09:55,722 --> 00:09:56,521
you're not going.

264
00:09:58,482 --> 00:09:59,041
Wait.

265
00:10:03,242 --> 00:10:03,921
Mrs. Chu.

266
00:10:06,322 --> 00:10:07,122
It's you?

267
00:10:08,722 --> 00:10:10,002
Did you

268
00:10:10,002 --> 00:10:11,761
lose an important hairpin?

269
00:10:12,641 --> 00:10:13,521
How do you know?

270
00:10:13,761 --> 00:10:14,442
You found it?

271
00:10:14,482 --> 00:10:14,881
No.

272
00:10:15,602 --> 00:10:16,681
Master Chu found it.

273
00:10:16,881 --> 00:10:17,602
He said he would

274
00:10:17,602 --> 00:10:19,161
wait for you at the Mountaintop Cafe.

275
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,202
He has it?

276
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:24,002
I didn't see this coming.

277
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:27,082
Ms. Wang,

278
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:28,401
please watch the shop for me.

279
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:29,442
Okay.

280
00:10:30,401 --> 00:10:31,521
Thanks, Ms. Wang.

281
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:48,442
Come on.

282
00:10:48,722 --> 00:10:49,801
Why did you take my stuff?

283
00:10:52,602 --> 00:10:53,161
Wait,

284
00:10:55,641 --> 00:10:57,281
didn't you ask me to come here?

285
00:10:58,561 --> 00:10:59,561
Are you kidding?

286
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:02,202
You're talking nonsense!

287
00:11:02,602 --> 00:11:03,002
Please,

288
00:11:03,002 --> 00:11:04,242
stop playing dumb.

289
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:13,521
Are they arguing?

290
00:11:14,602 --> 00:11:15,561
Probably not.

291
00:11:16,722 --> 00:11:17,362
Why?

292
00:11:18,161 --> 00:11:19,442
Look!

293
00:11:19,921 --> 00:11:21,442
She's already wearing the hairpin.

294
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:22,561
Mrs...

295
00:11:23,322 --> 00:11:24,082
See?

296
00:11:25,002 --> 00:11:25,681
But she doesn't

297
00:11:25,722 --> 00:11:26,322
look happy.

298
00:11:26,322 --> 00:11:26,761
Liar.

299
00:11:29,602 --> 00:11:30,122
Weird.

300
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:32,002
Master Chu!

301
00:11:32,761 --> 00:11:33,202
Mrs. Chu.

302
00:11:33,202 --> 00:11:34,401
Master! Master!

303
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:34,602
Liar.

304
00:11:36,881 --> 00:11:37,242
Well...

305
00:11:37,242 --> 00:11:38,281
You liar!

306
00:11:39,002 --> 00:11:40,681
Yes, I tricked you.

307
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:42,722
But that was a perfect chance!

308
00:11:42,722 --> 00:11:43,842
Why didn't you take it?

309
00:11:45,281 --> 00:11:47,002
I don't

310
00:11:47,362 --> 00:11:49,761
need your so-called chance.

311
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:51,082
Master!

312
00:11:52,362 --> 00:11:53,722
Pride only brings suffering.

313
00:11:54,962 --> 00:11:56,242
If you regret the divorce,

314
00:11:56,322 --> 00:11:57,242
just admit it openly.

315
00:11:57,242 --> 00:11:58,242
Stop talking nonsense!

316
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:00,242
Who said I regret it?

317
00:12:01,482 --> 00:12:02,681
Because I've regretted it too.

318
00:12:04,521 --> 00:12:06,641
I was just as arrogant as you.

319
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:08,521
I lost

320
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,681
the most important person.

321
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,602
She gave me chances,

322
00:12:12,722 --> 00:12:14,202
but I couldn't swallow my pride.

323
00:12:14,962 --> 00:12:16,761
I refused to admit I still cared.

324
00:12:17,722 --> 00:12:19,002
She felt extremely disappointed.

325
00:12:19,482 --> 00:12:20,761
No matter what I did afterwards,

326
00:12:20,962 --> 00:12:22,082
she refused to believe me.

327
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:24,122
And now?

328
00:12:25,322 --> 00:12:25,921
Master.

329
00:12:27,362 --> 00:12:28,641
If you want the answer,

330
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:30,362
why not try it

331
00:12:30,362 --> 00:12:31,322
yourself?

332
00:12:33,362 --> 00:12:34,761
Confessing your love is nothing

333
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:35,801
to be ashamed of.

334
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,202
Don't fear her rejection.

335
00:12:38,202 --> 00:12:39,521
If once fails, try again.

336
00:12:40,602 --> 00:12:41,681
Let me be honest with you.

337
00:12:43,281 --> 00:12:45,322
All your talking won't change anything.

338
00:12:46,442 --> 00:12:48,242
She's no longer interested in me.

339
00:12:50,482 --> 00:12:51,161
Then why does she

340
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:52,761
still wear that wedding hairpin?

341
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:56,002
Isn't that clear enough?

342
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:59,056
After the divorce,
why hasn't she found someone new?

343
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:00,602
Stop making excuses

344
00:13:00,602 --> 00:13:02,161
for your own cowardice.

345
00:13:02,242 --> 00:13:03,824
Taking initiative is a man's thing.

346
00:13:04,322 --> 00:13:05,322
You've dyed many blues.

347
00:13:05,362 --> 00:13:06,681
Why miss the one you love?

348
00:13:07,801 --> 00:13:08,921
Because deep down you know

349
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:11,681
you're waiting for her.

350
00:13:12,322 --> 00:13:13,041
Mrs. Chu.

351
00:13:13,122 --> 00:13:14,161
Wait.

352
00:13:14,242 --> 00:13:14,921
Wait.

353
00:13:15,801 --> 00:13:16,401
My foot...

354
00:13:18,202 --> 00:13:18,681
Miss.

355
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,242
You've crossed the line.

356
00:13:20,362 --> 00:13:21,482
I know. I'm sorry.

357
00:13:21,681 --> 00:13:23,082
But I didn't mean to.

358
00:13:23,082 --> 00:13:23,921
I mean no harm.

359
00:13:24,122 --> 00:13:24,881
I just wanted

360
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:25,801
to help you

361
00:13:25,801 --> 00:13:26,761
and Master Chu

362
00:13:26,761 --> 00:13:27,921
sit down and talk properly.

363
00:13:28,002 --> 00:13:28,401
So...

364
00:13:28,401 --> 00:13:29,401
Who do you think you are?

365
00:13:29,881 --> 00:13:30,842
None of your business!

366
00:13:31,242 --> 00:13:32,082
I don't need you.

367
00:13:34,401 --> 00:13:35,122
Mrs. Chu,

368
00:13:35,322 --> 00:13:36,281
I don't know

369
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:37,842
what Master Chu told you earlier.

370
00:13:39,801 --> 00:13:41,521
But you mean everything to him.

371
00:13:41,842 --> 00:13:42,761
Stop kidding me.

372
00:13:43,002 --> 00:13:43,881
I mean everything?

373
00:13:44,561 --> 00:13:46,041
I know my place.

374
00:13:46,482 --> 00:13:48,002
He just covets my special blue.

375
00:13:49,801 --> 00:13:51,161
That's the misunderstanding!

376
00:13:52,962 --> 00:13:54,602
He could recreate the same blue.

377
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:55,722
The reason

378
00:13:55,722 --> 00:13:56,602
he can't create now

379
00:13:56,681 --> 00:13:57,921
is that you left him.

380
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,442
He's lost his inspiration.

381
00:14:02,681 --> 00:14:03,442
I understand.

382
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:07,962
That's because

383
00:14:07,962 --> 00:14:09,041
I've been through

384
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,921
the same doubts and confusion.

385
00:14:13,962 --> 00:14:14,561
I saw him

386
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:15,722
do so much for me,

387
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:20,041
yet still questioned

388
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:23,561
if his love was genuine.

389
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,202
Or does he

390
00:14:25,202 --> 00:14:26,401
have ulterior motives?

391
00:14:31,722 --> 00:14:33,002
I once wondered

392
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:35,602
whether he truly

393
00:14:35,602 --> 00:14:36,842
cared about me

394
00:14:38,641 --> 00:14:39,602
or just wanted

395
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:41,161
the benefits I could provide.

396
00:14:42,722 --> 00:14:45,281
Coming to Gubei Town

397
00:14:45,962 --> 00:14:47,761
and meeting you and Master Chu

398
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,002
made me rethink love.

399
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:51,761
That's why I decided

400
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:56,122
to give our relationship

401
00:14:58,362 --> 00:14:59,401
another chance.

402
00:15:02,322 --> 00:15:03,442
Two people who care

403
00:15:03,442 --> 00:15:04,122
for each other

404
00:15:05,641 --> 00:15:07,122
shouldn't spend years

405
00:15:07,322 --> 00:15:08,122
drowning in doubt.

406
00:15:09,602 --> 00:15:10,482
Instead, just believe

407
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:13,681
that every effort he makes

408
00:15:13,962 --> 00:15:14,722
is for you.

409
00:15:18,202 --> 00:15:18,602
Oh!

410
00:15:19,281 --> 00:15:20,362
Let me show you something.

411
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:25,122
Look at this.

412
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:28,561
Master Chu.

413
00:15:31,362 --> 00:15:32,801
He secretly visited the exhibition

414
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:34,962
with an annual pass.

415
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:38,281
See?

416
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,002
He's been changing,

417
00:15:40,602 --> 00:15:41,842
just bad at communicating.

418
00:15:42,881 --> 00:15:44,161
Misunderstandings grew

419
00:15:44,161 --> 00:15:45,041
deeper and deeper.

420
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:46,322
Things end up like this.

421
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:51,002
We saw his courtyard

422
00:15:53,681 --> 00:15:55,401
filled with different blues.

423
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:56,681
Well,

424
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,362
you should also know.

425
00:15:58,921 --> 00:16:00,041
With his skills,

426
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:01,322
he can

427
00:16:01,322 --> 00:16:02,801
recreate the same blue as yours.

428
00:16:04,442 --> 00:16:05,521
Yet he discarded

429
00:16:05,521 --> 00:16:06,362
the fabrics.

430
00:16:07,202 --> 00:16:08,881
What you really want to know is

431
00:16:10,881 --> 00:16:11,561
whether he

432
00:16:11,561 --> 00:16:13,002
desires the blue dye you created

433
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:16,482
or you as a person.

434
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:22,722
I don't believe.

435
00:16:23,561 --> 00:16:25,041
He is even afraid of admitting it.

436
00:16:25,602 --> 00:16:27,002
Nobody can speak for him.

437
00:16:27,442 --> 00:16:28,641
Who says I'm afraid?

438
00:16:37,681 --> 00:16:39,082
Help me dye it again.

439
00:16:46,362 --> 00:16:47,482
Can't you dye it yourself?

440
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:49,680
You don't need me.

441
00:16:50,482 --> 00:16:51,801
What I want is

442
00:16:53,322 --> 00:16:54,561
the person who dyes the fabric.

443
00:17:10,361 --> 00:17:11,601
We'll soon see the new creation

444
00:17:11,642 --> 00:17:12,922
by Master Chu

445
00:17:12,922 --> 00:17:13,722
and Mrs. Chu.

446
00:17:14,162 --> 00:17:15,761
Old partners work best together.

447
00:17:17,682 --> 00:17:18,121
Look,

448
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:19,521
there's a show tonight.

449
00:17:20,002 --> 00:17:20,642
Will you come?

450
00:17:21,361 --> 00:17:21,922
Of course.

451
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:24,041
Good luck!

452
00:17:53,642 --> 00:17:55,202
Chen Shimei.

453
00:17:55,882 --> 00:17:57,361
You're ungrateful,

454
00:17:57,882 --> 00:17:59,841
plotting against your wife!

455
00:17:59,962 --> 00:18:00,882
Guards!

456
00:18:02,361 --> 00:18:03,882
(The New Opera of The Case of Chen Shimei)
Execute him!

457
00:18:04,002 --> 00:18:04,682
Yes!

458
00:18:10,442 --> 00:18:12,162
Show mercy!

459
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:15,521
I admit my guilt.

460
00:18:16,202 --> 00:18:17,722
A guilt is a guilt.

461
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,121
Too late for regrets.

462
00:18:19,321 --> 00:18:20,281
Execute him!

463
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:23,361
Show mercy!

464
00:18:26,121 --> 00:18:26,682
Your Honor,

465
00:18:27,521 --> 00:18:29,402
I don't fear death.

466
00:18:30,202 --> 00:18:31,281
When I recall

467
00:18:31,561 --> 00:18:33,202
how I treated my wife,

468
00:18:33,722 --> 00:18:35,521
I feel deep remorse.

469
00:18:36,521 --> 00:18:37,682
My death matters little,

470
00:18:38,962 --> 00:18:40,121
and I don't

471
00:18:41,202 --> 00:18:42,442
deserve any forgiveness.

472
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:44,081
But considering

473
00:18:44,882 --> 00:18:46,361
my thousand-year reincarnation,

474
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:48,882
please grant me one chance

475
00:18:49,841 --> 00:18:51,402
to show her my reformation

476
00:18:53,242 --> 00:18:54,682
and accept my penance.

477
00:18:55,962 --> 00:18:56,962
If this is allowed,

478
00:18:57,242 --> 00:18:58,081
I'll die

479
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:00,321
with no regrets.

480
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,041
This

481
00:19:02,922 --> 00:19:04,882
sounds somewhat moving.

482
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:06,402
Madam Qin,

483
00:19:07,002 --> 00:19:08,162
he wishes to change.

484
00:19:08,442 --> 00:19:09,841
What are your demands?

485
00:19:11,482 --> 00:19:12,361
Your Honor,

486
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,402
a private word please.

487
00:19:17,722 --> 00:19:18,761
Very well.

488
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:22,002
Madam Qin stated

489
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,601
she wants no gold,

490
00:19:24,002 --> 00:19:25,162
no silver.

491
00:19:25,521 --> 00:19:27,882
She demands spiritual compensation.

492
00:19:28,402 --> 00:19:29,922
Three requirements

493
00:19:30,121 --> 00:19:32,002
must be met

494
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,002
for your death sentence

495
00:19:34,442 --> 00:19:36,002
to be commuted.

496
00:19:36,882 --> 00:19:37,761
Material wealth

497
00:19:38,402 --> 00:19:39,882
can't compensate

498
00:19:41,002 --> 00:19:42,361
for Qin Xianglian's years

499
00:19:42,601 --> 00:19:44,801
of suffering during her pursuit.

500
00:19:45,402 --> 00:19:47,162
Whatever the cost,

501
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:49,202
I'll accept it.

502
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:50,922
Good.

503
00:19:51,561 --> 00:19:53,482
Carry a thousand dan of rice

504
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:57,442
to repay her devotion.

505
00:20:00,482 --> 00:20:01,962
Bring rice!

506
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:02,962
Yes!

507
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:20,081
Is this enough?

508
00:20:20,321 --> 00:20:21,601
- No!
- No!

509
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:23,841
More rice!

510
00:20:26,962 --> 00:20:27,442
Yes!

511
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:29,682
Is this enough?

512
00:20:30,081 --> 00:20:31,202
- No!
- No!

513
00:20:31,642 --> 00:20:32,882
Bring more!

514
00:20:32,922 --> 00:20:33,722
Yes!

515
00:20:38,081 --> 00:20:39,162
Now enough?

516
00:20:39,361 --> 00:20:40,761
- No!
- No!

517
00:20:40,801 --> 00:20:43,002
More rice!

518
00:20:45,642 --> 00:20:47,081
Enough?

519
00:21:03,281 --> 00:21:04,202
Madam Qin,

520
00:21:04,922 --> 00:21:06,682
are you satisfied?

521
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,321
Good.

522
00:21:13,002 --> 00:21:15,962
- Great!
- Great!

523
00:21:27,321 --> 00:21:28,361
I once didn't

524
00:21:28,442 --> 00:21:29,242
understand love.

525
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:31,962
So,

526
00:21:32,162 --> 00:21:33,962
when seeking instant benefits,

527
00:21:35,242 --> 00:21:36,361
I lost someone

528
00:21:37,442 --> 00:21:38,682
who truly cared for me.

529
00:21:41,922 --> 00:21:43,121
I once swore

530
00:21:44,642 --> 00:21:45,722
to win her back.

531
00:21:47,202 --> 00:21:48,521
Yet I was arrogant.

532
00:21:48,521 --> 00:21:49,761
My so-called sincerity

533
00:21:51,162 --> 00:21:52,041
was crushed

534
00:21:53,402 --> 00:21:54,521
by pragmatism

535
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:56,841
and calculation.

536
00:21:58,321 --> 00:21:59,722
Time after time,

537
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:01,162
I hurt her.

538
00:22:07,521 --> 00:22:08,442
Thank you

539
00:22:11,561 --> 00:22:13,081
for giving me this opportunity

540
00:22:13,402 --> 00:22:14,682
to speak my mind.

541
00:22:16,922 --> 00:22:17,922
This made me

542
00:22:19,321 --> 00:22:20,801
realize my own shortcomings

543
00:22:23,121 --> 00:22:24,202
and clarified

544
00:22:26,962 --> 00:22:29,402
whether I truly loved her

545
00:22:30,962 --> 00:22:32,761
or merely loved being loved by her.

546
00:22:36,281 --> 00:22:37,682
If you ask me again

547
00:22:37,722 --> 00:22:38,801
what kind of person I am,

548
00:22:40,281 --> 00:22:41,162
I'll tell you

549
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:44,882
I'm the one who discovered

550
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:47,521
I still love you.

551
00:23:14,202 --> 00:23:14,761
Good.

552
00:23:15,682 --> 00:23:18,442

Ms. Qiao.

569
00:24:14,002 --> 00:24:15,561
The offline experience store

570
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:17,162
is progressing smoother than expected.

571
00:24:17,402 --> 00:24:18,801
Lease contracts for three stores

572
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:19,561
have been signed.

573
00:24:19,601 --> 00:24:21,162
Interior design plans are finalized.

574
00:24:21,162 --> 00:24:21,722
Next steps

575
00:24:21,722 --> 00:24:23,081
involve payments for rent,

576
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:24,081
renovation,

577
00:24:24,202 --> 00:24:25,561
and materials.

578
00:24:26,121 --> 00:24:26,682
Good.

579
00:24:27,402 --> 00:24:28,722
Hopefully, before Ms. Xu returns,

580
00:24:28,722 --> 00:24:30,601
we'll finalize
offline operations properly.

581
00:24:30,601 --> 00:24:32,361
Then promptly report to Yuanhang Capital

582
00:24:32,642 --> 00:24:33,922
about our project status.

583
00:24:34,482 --> 00:24:35,041
Understood.

584
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:37,041
The contract requires transferring

585
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:38,761
one year's rent within two weeks.

586
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,601
Verify the amounts

587
00:24:40,601 --> 00:24:41,922
and details with Mr. Lin first.

588
00:24:42,224 --> 00:24:44,041
After my confirmation,
proceed with payment.

589
00:24:44,402 --> 00:24:45,081
Got it.

590
00:24:45,521 --> 00:24:46,202
Ms. Qiao.

591
00:24:46,722 --> 00:24:48,041
Can we slow down

592
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:49,482
the experience store progress?

593
00:24:50,361 --> 00:24:50,962
Why?

594
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:52,801
I suggest reallocating offline funds

595
00:24:52,841 --> 00:24:53,801
to production.

596
00:24:54,162 --> 00:24:56,402
If we delay supplier payments,

597
00:24:56,601 --> 00:24:58,162
we can't afford the penalty fees.

598
00:24:59,202 --> 00:25:00,561
Wasn't the bank loan

599
00:25:00,561 --> 00:25:02,002
supposed to be approved this week?

600
00:25:02,121 --> 00:25:03,361
Originally, yes,

601
00:25:03,561 --> 00:25:04,962
but the bank suddenly notified me

602
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:06,121
of tightened policies.

603
00:25:06,281 --> 00:25:07,922
All non-compliant loans

604
00:25:07,922 --> 00:25:09,002
got rejected.

605
00:25:11,841 --> 00:25:13,321
Keep proceeding as planned.

606
00:25:13,482 --> 00:25:15,121
I'll discuss whether to slow down

607
00:25:15,521 --> 00:25:17,162
with Mr. Lin.

608
00:25:17,521 --> 00:25:18,642
Don't worry.

609
00:25:18,962 --> 00:25:20,202
Just focus on your work,

610
00:25:20,202 --> 00:25:20,882
okay?

611
00:25:21,722 --> 00:25:22,202
Okay.

612
00:25:23,682 --> 00:25:24,962
I think I should visit the bank.

613
00:25:24,962 --> 00:25:26,162
Wait, I've tried already.

614
00:25:26,361 --> 00:25:27,281
I've done my best,

615
00:25:27,281 --> 00:25:28,281
but failed.

616
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:29,162
That's why I came

617
00:25:29,162 --> 00:25:30,162
to discuss alternatives.

618
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:32,642
But I previously stated

619
00:25:32,761 --> 00:25:34,081
the offline stores' funding

620
00:25:34,121 --> 00:25:35,722
comes from Yuanhang.

621
00:25:37,321 --> 00:25:38,521
The money is regulated.

622
00:25:38,521 --> 00:25:40,002
Redirecting it violates agreements.

623
00:25:41,922 --> 00:25:43,281
Then securing loans

624
00:25:43,321 --> 00:25:44,281
remains our only option.

625
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:45,442
No worries.

626
00:25:45,561 --> 00:25:46,482
I'll try other banks

627
00:25:46,642 --> 00:25:48,081
one by one.

628
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:48,962
Don't worry.

629
00:25:48,962 --> 00:25:50,521
Let's work separately. I'll make calls.

630
00:25:57,321 --> 00:25:57,841
Yan.

631
00:25:58,402 --> 00:25:59,962
Still at work?

632
00:26:00,321 --> 00:26:01,601
I'm handling something.

633
00:26:02,722 --> 00:26:03,642
Anything happened?

634
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,281
Nothing serious.

635
00:26:05,402 --> 00:26:06,081
We'll handle it.

636
00:26:06,962 --> 00:26:08,281
How are things with Shen Haoming?

637
00:26:08,281 --> 00:26:10,162
It's been ages
since I heard you vent about him.

638
00:26:10,162 --> 00:26:12,561
I'll talk about it when I get back.

639
00:26:13,722 --> 00:26:14,841
Guess what?

640
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:16,400
There is a hope for being authorized.

641
00:26:16,482 --> 00:26:17,761
I'll stay here a few more days.

642
00:26:17,882 --> 00:26:18,482
Good.

643
00:26:18,561 --> 00:26:19,801
Stay there without worries.

644
00:26:19,882 --> 00:26:21,002
It's all under control.

645
00:26:21,002 --> 00:26:22,482
You get along with Shen Haoming.

646
00:26:22,601 --> 00:26:23,202
Don't worry.

647
00:26:23,962 --> 00:26:25,202
Alright, I'll hang up now.

648
00:26:25,682 --> 00:26:26,162
Bye.

649
00:26:31,722 --> 00:26:33,041
I'll keep working on it tomorrow.

650
00:26:34,162 --> 00:26:35,561
You should get back early.

651
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:09,761
Honestly,

652
00:27:11,521 --> 00:27:12,162
I've never seen

653
00:27:12,162 --> 00:27:13,442
an outstanding woman like you

654
00:27:14,321 --> 00:27:14,841
obsessing

655
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:15,922
over one man for years.

656
00:27:21,242 --> 00:27:22,321
But he doesn't care.

657
00:27:26,962 --> 00:27:27,962
The more devoted I am,

658
00:27:28,242 --> 00:27:29,402
the more I look like a fool.

659
00:27:31,202 --> 00:27:32,482
But strangely,

660
00:27:34,242 --> 00:27:35,882
despite all the rumors,

661
00:27:36,841 --> 00:27:38,992
there's no official news
about Shen Haoming and Xu Yan

662
00:27:39,321 --> 00:27:40,402
finalizing their divorce.

663
00:27:42,601 --> 00:27:44,202
Are they still together?

664
00:27:46,402 --> 00:27:47,281
You often see him.

665
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:48,002
Don't you know?

666
00:27:48,442 --> 00:27:49,402
How would I know?

667
00:27:53,601 --> 00:27:54,121
Fine.

668
00:27:55,242 --> 00:27:56,242
Let's not talk about it.

669
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:57,682
Tell me about how you

670
00:27:58,601 --> 00:27:59,281
and Shen Haoming

671
00:27:59,281 --> 00:28:00,002
first met.

672
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:02,242
Back then,

673
00:28:02,922 --> 00:28:03,642
he and my sister

674
00:28:03,642 --> 00:28:05,402
attended the same university in London.

675
00:28:06,642 --> 00:28:07,402
Well,

676
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:09,281
I was

677
00:28:09,281 --> 00:28:11,561
at a boarding school
taking prep courses.

678
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:13,361
Later,

679
00:28:14,281 --> 00:28:15,162
I watched them

680
00:28:15,202 --> 00:28:16,682
date for a while.

681
00:28:18,962 --> 00:28:19,922
Afterwards,

682
00:28:20,162 --> 00:28:21,962
my sister broke up with him.

683
00:28:23,482 --> 00:28:24,442
Then later,

684
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:27,281
my sister discovered she was pregnant.

685
00:28:29,361 --> 00:28:30,121
Pregnant?

686
00:28:31,281 --> 00:28:32,242
Whose child was it?

687
00:28:50,321 --> 00:28:52,121
What's wrong with Han Weiping?

688
00:28:53,361 --> 00:28:54,642
Can't even handle simple things.

689
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:59,962
Baraikin chose to partner with Jinda.

690
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:04,601
He couldn't find evidence

691
00:29:04,922 --> 00:29:06,321
of Shen Haoming and Xu Yan

692
00:29:06,321 --> 00:29:07,002
getting divorced.

693
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:09,561
Shen Haoming performed too well

694
00:29:09,722 --> 00:29:10,722
in front of Baraikin.

695
00:29:14,601 --> 00:29:15,561
Shen Haoming and Xu Yan

696
00:29:15,561 --> 00:29:16,761
are nearly reconciled,

697
00:29:17,402 --> 00:29:19,002
yet he's still fixated on their divorce.

698
00:29:20,281 --> 00:29:21,121
I feel disappointed.

699
00:29:22,722 --> 00:29:23,601
What a fool he is!

700
00:29:25,882 --> 00:29:26,841
Where is Han Weiping?

701
00:29:28,962 --> 00:29:29,801
He will arrive soon.

702
00:29:39,761 --> 00:29:40,361
Dad.

703
00:29:41,402 --> 00:29:42,281
Nice shot.

704
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:46,482
Any updates on Shen Haoming?

705
00:29:49,081 --> 00:29:49,601
Dad.

706
00:29:50,442 --> 00:29:51,962
I'm still...

707
00:30:10,682 --> 00:30:11,242
Mr. Lin.

708
00:30:13,281 --> 00:30:13,882
It's settled.

709
00:30:14,321 --> 00:30:15,242
Finally sorted it out.

710
00:30:16,002 --> 00:30:16,801
About the loan?

711
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:19,202
(Feng Zhiyuan's business card)
This is my old colleague.

712
00:30:19,202 --> 00:30:20,361
Do you remember Feng?

713
00:30:20,482 --> 00:30:21,962
He's now at a bank

714
00:30:22,002 --> 00:30:23,561
as a senior credit specialist.

715
00:30:23,882 --> 00:30:25,081
I called him yesterday

716
00:30:25,162 --> 00:30:26,281
to inquire if his bank

717
00:30:26,281 --> 00:30:27,722
handles cross-regional loans.

718
00:30:27,922 --> 00:30:29,361
Turns out he's willing to help.

719
00:30:30,601 --> 00:30:31,442
That's great.

720
00:30:31,482 --> 00:30:32,841
So I'm checking with you.

721
00:30:33,642 --> 00:30:34,761
I'm fine with it.

722
00:30:34,761 --> 00:30:36,081
If possible, make it quick.

723
00:30:36,361 --> 00:30:36,841
Alright.

724
00:30:37,162 --> 00:30:38,361
Now I have a clear plan.

725
00:30:38,642 --> 00:30:39,442
But he wants us

726
00:30:39,442 --> 00:30:41,202
to prepare the financial statements,

727
00:30:41,202 --> 00:30:42,281
along with other documents.

728
00:30:42,601 --> 00:30:43,962
If approved smoothly, funds can

729
00:30:43,962 --> 00:30:45,041
be released this month.

730
00:30:45,242 --> 00:30:46,281
But we need to act fast.

731
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:47,922
The submission window is closing soon.

732
00:30:48,242 --> 00:30:49,442
Alright, you get

733
00:30:49,442 --> 00:30:50,281
all the papers ready.

734
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:52,361
All done.

735
00:30:52,482 --> 00:30:52,962
Take a look.

736
00:30:53,081 --> 00:30:54,512
Stamp it if there are no issues.

737
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:56,361
Well done.

738
00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:57,801
Impressive.

739
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,808
(Balance Sheet)

740
00:31:05,962 --> 00:31:06,761
Just stamp it here.

741
00:31:08,521 --> 00:31:09,361
Okay, got it.

742
00:31:09,882 --> 00:31:11,121
If there are no problems,

743
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:11,882
after this,

744
00:31:11,922 --> 00:31:14,202
we'll go back home tomorrow
by high-speed rail.

745
00:31:14,561 --> 00:31:16,432
We'll urge him
to settle this matter quickly.

746
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:18,041
Since you're the deputy,

747
00:31:18,281 --> 00:31:20,321
you must be present in person to sign.

748
00:31:20,801 --> 00:31:21,922
Let's leave early then.

749
00:31:22,482 --> 00:31:23,408
Early in the morning.

750
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:23,962
Okay.

751
00:31:24,081 --> 00:31:24,882
I'll buy tickets.

752
00:31:26,361 --> 00:31:27,841
If this gets done successfully,

753
00:31:28,242 --> 00:31:28,601
I will

754
00:31:28,601 --> 00:31:29,521
owe you big.

755
00:31:29,962 --> 00:31:30,402
You don't

756
00:31:30,402 --> 00:31:31,242
have to thank me.

757
00:31:31,361 --> 00:31:33,264
Helping the company
means helping myself too.

758
00:31:34,842 --> 00:31:36,816
(Income Statement)

759
00:31:47,361 --> 00:31:48,081
Morning, Mr. Shen.

760
00:31:48,642 --> 00:31:49,081
Morning.

761
00:31:49,402 --> 00:31:50,121
Morning, Mr. Shen.

762
00:31:51,482 --> 00:31:51,962
Morning.

763
00:31:53,841 --> 00:31:54,361
Morning.

764
00:31:54,361 --> 00:31:54,801
Mr. Shen.

765
00:31:54,801 --> 00:31:55,361
Morning.

766
00:31:55,962 --> 00:31:57,081
Nice hairstyle.

767
00:31:58,682 --> 00:31:59,402
Morning, Mr. Shen.

768
00:32:00,121 --> 00:32:00,801
Morning.

769
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,784
(Open Mindedness)

770
00:32:09,882 --> 00:32:10,801
Watch your step.

771
00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:16,081
Have a seat.

772
00:32:19,242 --> 00:32:19,761
Chairman,

773
00:32:19,761 --> 00:32:21,121
I'm here to report

774
00:32:21,442 --> 00:32:23,162
on our collaboration with Mr. Baraikin.

775
00:32:23,162 --> 00:32:24,722
The agreement has been signed.

776
00:32:25,162 --> 00:32:26,002
Early next month,

777
00:32:26,121 --> 00:32:27,521
our core team

778
00:32:27,642 --> 00:32:28,601
will fly to Moscow

779
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:29,682
to handle

780
00:32:29,922 --> 00:32:31,242
the design aspects

781
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:32,761
and operational procedures.

782
00:32:34,402 --> 00:32:35,242
Sit down.

783
00:32:36,361 --> 00:32:37,442
Regarding this project,

784
00:32:37,801 --> 00:32:38,361
both parties

785
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:39,922
have high expectations.

786
00:32:41,402 --> 00:32:41,841
We aim

787
00:32:41,841 --> 00:32:43,321
to develop it

788
00:32:43,642 --> 00:32:45,801
into a landmark Jinda builds overseas.

789
00:32:47,002 --> 00:32:48,081
That's my objective too.

790
00:32:49,002 --> 00:32:50,121
All workflows

791
00:32:50,361 --> 00:32:50,962
and key aspects

792
00:32:51,081 --> 00:32:52,002
will be supervised.

793
00:32:53,162 --> 00:32:53,642
Moreover,

794
00:32:59,202 --> 00:33:00,841
according to East China's report,

795
00:33:01,018 --> 00:33:02,121
(Jinda: North Waichuan
Development Proposal)

796
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:05,081
the North Waichuan,
adjacent to the Huanghu River,

797
00:33:06,281 --> 00:33:08,482
marks the first residential land release
in three years

798
00:33:08,801 --> 00:33:10,202
by the local government.

799
00:33:11,521 --> 00:33:13,561
The starting land price per square meter

800
00:33:13,922 --> 00:33:15,561
sets a new record.

801
00:33:16,482 --> 00:33:17,162
This is

802
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,242
the biggest land auction

803
00:33:18,642 --> 00:33:20,682
in East China at present.

804
00:33:21,682 --> 00:33:22,722
You want this plot?

805
00:33:23,882 --> 00:33:24,321
Yes.

806
00:33:25,482 --> 00:33:26,321
For this land,

807
00:33:26,361 --> 00:33:28,841
we don't need to hold 15 percent

808
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:29,722
of rental housing.

809
00:33:30,722 --> 00:33:32,162
Under current regulations,

810
00:33:32,202 --> 00:33:32,841
this increases

811
00:33:33,202 --> 00:33:34,882
the saleable area percentage

812
00:33:35,281 --> 00:33:36,081
and reduces

813
00:33:36,121 --> 00:33:37,281
per-unit development costs.

814
00:33:38,162 --> 00:33:40,281
Market expectations

815
00:33:40,361 --> 00:33:40,922
predict

816
00:33:41,321 --> 00:33:41,922
at least

817
00:33:42,002 --> 00:33:43,321
a 20 percent premium.

818
00:33:44,402 --> 00:33:45,002
Therefore,

819
00:33:45,002 --> 00:33:46,162
from all perspectives,

820
00:33:46,761 --> 00:33:47,722
this is undoubtedly

821
00:33:47,722 --> 00:33:49,242
the most sought-after plot

822
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:50,242
and

823
00:33:50,442 --> 00:33:51,922
a prime development zone.

824
00:33:54,361 --> 00:33:55,801
I support your bid plan.

825
00:33:56,442 --> 00:33:57,081
You've secured

826
00:33:57,081 --> 00:33:58,002
a deal with Baraikin.

827
00:33:58,081 --> 00:33:58,642
If you also

828
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,521
obtain the plot

829
00:34:00,601 --> 00:34:01,482
in North Waichuan,

830
00:34:01,922 --> 00:34:03,242
it will show that you,

831
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:04,601
in Jinda,

832
00:34:04,801 --> 00:34:06,242
have sufficient credibility.

833
00:34:07,922 --> 00:34:08,682
Thank you.

834
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:10,361
Good.

835
00:34:10,992 --> 00:34:12,841
There'll be a meeting
next Friday at 9:00 AM.

836
00:34:12,841 --> 00:34:13,482
Don't be late.

837
00:34:14,081 --> 00:34:15,442
The agenda is...

838
00:34:17,521 --> 00:34:19,361
I'll fulfill my promise to you

839
00:34:20,081 --> 00:34:21,361
by giving you a board seat

840
00:34:21,402 --> 00:34:23,041
because you made a deal with Baraikin.

841
00:34:25,002 --> 00:34:27,002
I should thank Mr. Baraikin

842
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,081
for overlooking my previous concealment.

843
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,482
I feel sorry.

844
00:34:30,842 --> 00:34:31,402
Haoming.

845
00:34:32,241 --> 00:34:33,802
Your capabilities are

846
00:34:34,161 --> 00:34:35,482
unquestionable.

847
00:34:36,161 --> 00:34:37,482
But your methods

848
00:34:39,201 --> 00:34:40,521
don't align with my principles.

849
00:34:43,121 --> 00:34:43,802
In business,

850
00:34:44,762 --> 00:34:46,241
integrity is fundamental.

851
00:34:47,482 --> 00:34:48,762
The core principle should

852
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:51,322
be mutually beneficial cooperation.

853
00:34:53,241 --> 00:34:54,442
I don't know

854
00:34:54,442 --> 00:34:55,241
what caused

855
00:34:56,002 --> 00:34:57,402
your drastic change.

856
00:34:57,442 --> 00:34:58,362
But I believe

857
00:34:58,601 --> 00:34:59,201
you

858
00:34:59,201 --> 00:35:00,482
understand this deep down now.

859
00:35:01,282 --> 00:35:02,842
Just like the marriage

860
00:35:02,882 --> 00:35:03,882
between me and Yan.

861
00:35:05,442 --> 00:35:06,681
Our marriage

862
00:35:06,721 --> 00:35:07,882
was filled with arguments

863
00:35:08,121 --> 00:35:09,081
and deceptions.

864
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,762
What kept us together was

865
00:35:12,681 --> 00:35:13,601
our sincerity.

866
00:35:15,561 --> 00:35:15,922
Dad.

867
00:35:16,802 --> 00:35:17,922
Yan and I have reconciled.

868
00:35:18,882 --> 00:35:19,721
I'm glad

869
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:22,201
we're still married.

870
00:35:24,282 --> 00:35:25,601
Your mom and I

871
00:35:27,002 --> 00:35:28,842
are happy for you.

872
00:35:30,081 --> 00:35:30,882
Most importantly,

873
00:35:30,922 --> 00:35:32,601
Haochen will be thrilled.

874
00:35:33,201 --> 00:35:33,802
Yes.

875
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:37,721
If you'll excuse me,

876
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:38,561
I have to go.

877
00:35:43,002 --> 00:35:43,561
Wait.

878
00:35:52,081 --> 00:35:53,322
What kind of flower is this?

879
00:35:55,962 --> 00:35:56,681
You know,

880
00:35:57,721 --> 00:35:58,882
it's quite interesting.

881
00:35:59,561 --> 00:36:00,402
Ms. Xu,

882
00:36:01,282 --> 00:36:01,882
welcome back.

883
00:36:02,882 --> 00:36:03,561
Mr. Liang.

884
00:36:06,561 --> 00:36:07,482
Flowers for me?

885
00:36:08,201 --> 00:36:08,482
Sure.

886
00:36:08,521 --> 00:36:08,922
Thank you.

887
00:36:08,962 --> 00:36:09,521
For you.

888
00:36:10,681 --> 00:36:11,376
I'll put it here.

889
00:36:12,362 --> 00:36:13,121
Beautiful.

890
00:36:18,922 --> 00:36:20,601
What did you learn

891
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:21,641
in Gubei Town?

892
00:36:23,362 --> 00:36:25,121
From theory to practice,

893
00:36:26,721 --> 00:36:27,201
I studied

894
00:36:27,241 --> 00:36:28,802
the history of botanical dyeing

895
00:36:28,842 --> 00:36:30,882
and learned traditional craftsmanship.

896
00:36:30,882 --> 00:36:31,681
It was enriching.

897
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:33,041
I plan

898
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:34,081
to launch a collection

899
00:36:34,081 --> 00:36:35,882
about botanical dyeing this autumn,

900
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:37,482
which will also promote

901
00:36:37,482 --> 00:36:38,641
Gubei Town's heritage.

902
00:36:44,882 --> 00:36:45,362
Excellent.

903
00:36:46,962 --> 00:36:48,482
You seem to be glowing today.

904
00:36:49,762 --> 00:36:51,161
The romantic aura is around you.

905
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,282
Shen Haoming and I made up.

906
00:36:59,081 --> 00:36:59,762
I noticed.

907
00:37:00,521 --> 00:37:02,201
After wrapping up current projects,

908
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:05,681
I'll move back home.

909
00:37:09,282 --> 00:37:09,842
I understand.

910
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:12,041
After making decisions,

911
00:37:12,561 --> 00:37:13,681
you won't change your mind.

912
00:37:15,282 --> 00:37:16,322
You know exactly

913
00:37:16,322 --> 00:37:17,081
what you want.

914
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:19,121
But I still wonder

915
00:37:20,241 --> 00:37:20,842
why.

916
00:37:24,762 --> 00:37:25,601
What

917
00:37:25,601 --> 00:37:27,482
sustains a marriage?

918
00:37:27,721 --> 00:37:28,842
Either

919
00:37:29,641 --> 00:37:30,882
genuine mutual affection,

920
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:32,442
or

921
00:37:33,601 --> 00:37:34,762
strategic interdependence

922
00:37:35,081 --> 00:37:36,002
and indivisibility.

923
00:37:37,264 --> 00:37:38,081
Where do you stand?

924
00:37:38,081 --> 00:37:38,561
Both.

925
00:37:42,922 --> 00:37:44,442
We used to hide things,

926
00:37:46,282 --> 00:37:47,561
but now we are

927
00:37:48,802 --> 00:37:49,641
open and honest.

928
00:37:52,762 --> 00:37:53,241
Thank you

929
00:37:53,241 --> 00:37:54,241
for telling me candidly.

930
00:37:57,121 --> 00:37:58,241
If your relationship status

931
00:37:58,241 --> 00:37:59,282
ever changes,

932
00:37:59,282 --> 00:38:00,041
please inform me.

933
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:01,200
I can be your backup option.

934
00:38:05,081 --> 00:38:06,241
Actually, Shen Haoming

935
00:38:06,241 --> 00:38:07,521
has always been my only choice.

936
00:38:11,002 --> 00:38:11,882
Looks like tonight

937
00:38:11,882 --> 00:38:13,081
I'll need to drown my sorrows.

938
00:38:15,362 --> 00:38:16,681
Though you never even gave me

939
00:38:16,681 --> 00:38:17,601
a chance to start,

940
00:38:18,882 --> 00:38:20,362
I've invested so much emotionally.

941
00:38:23,002 --> 00:38:23,762
I need time

942
00:38:23,762 --> 00:38:24,482
to heal.

943
00:38:26,121 --> 00:38:27,322
If you can still joke around,

944
00:38:27,322 --> 00:38:28,282
it means you're okay.

945
00:38:28,922 --> 00:38:30,201
Plus, your act was convincing.

946
00:38:32,482 --> 00:38:33,081
Xu Yan.

947
00:38:34,601 --> 00:38:35,241
I'm serious.

948
00:38:36,201 --> 00:38:37,002
Qiao Lin,

949
00:38:37,282 --> 00:38:38,121
Yao, Guan, and I

950
00:38:38,521 --> 00:38:39,161
are all the same

951
00:38:41,241 --> 00:38:42,482
as your strong backers

952
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:43,121
and allies.

953
00:38:44,641 --> 00:38:45,681
You can rely on us.

954
00:38:49,641 --> 00:38:50,362
I understand.

955
00:38:52,681 --> 00:38:53,442
Thank you.

956
00:38:54,882 --> 00:38:56,482
I wanted to try dating an older woman,

957
00:38:56,482 --> 00:38:57,641
but failed.

958
00:39:00,482 --> 00:39:01,802
So, we'll just be friends.

959
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:05,201
May you be happy.

960
00:39:07,641 --> 00:39:09,842
May you always stay carefree.

961
00:39:10,721 --> 00:39:11,842
Sure, I will.

962
00:39:50,402 --> 00:39:50,962
Your godfather

963
00:39:51,002 --> 00:39:52,121
told me to talk with you.

964
00:39:53,121 --> 00:39:53,681
What's up?

965
00:39:54,521 --> 00:39:55,362
Shen Jinsong decided

966
00:39:55,402 --> 00:39:56,944
to give Shen Haoming a board seat.

967
00:39:57,081 --> 00:39:57,802
He's informed

968
00:39:57,802 --> 00:39:58,762
all shareholders.

969
00:39:59,641 --> 00:40:00,601
Your godfather wants us

970
00:40:00,601 --> 00:40:01,161
to stop this

971
00:40:01,161 --> 00:40:02,002
at all costs.

972
00:40:02,922 --> 00:40:04,482
Is Shen Haoming that easy to handle?

973
00:40:05,681 --> 00:40:06,962
He is at a vital time

974
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:08,282
for sitting on the board.

975
00:40:08,721 --> 00:40:09,842
He'll be extra cautious.

976
00:40:11,121 --> 00:40:12,442
Plus, he's made up with Xu Yan.

977
00:40:12,762 --> 00:40:13,362
Now, he is

978
00:40:13,362 --> 00:40:14,561
riding high on success.

979
00:40:15,081 --> 00:40:15,842
They've reconciled?

980
00:40:16,402 --> 00:40:17,201
How did you know?

981
00:40:17,521 --> 00:40:18,962
Chen Lin is making arrangements.

982
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:21,201
Xu Yan might soon

983
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:22,161
move back home.

984
00:40:23,882 --> 00:40:25,442
I didn't see this coming.

985
00:40:25,962 --> 00:40:27,521
Even his love life's going smoothly?

986
00:40:27,922 --> 00:40:29,041
But when Fang Lei was drunk,

987
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:30,002
she told me

988
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:31,482
that her sister

989
00:40:31,482 --> 00:40:32,641
dated Shen Haoming

990
00:40:33,241 --> 00:40:34,161
and even got pregnant.

991
00:40:34,962 --> 00:40:35,802
Pregnant?

992
00:40:38,362 --> 00:40:39,280
What about the child?

993
00:40:39,721 --> 00:40:40,521
Was it born?

994
00:40:40,922 --> 00:40:41,802
Was it Shen Haoming's?

995
00:40:42,002 --> 00:40:43,201
I don't know. She didn't say.

996
00:40:43,762 --> 00:40:45,121
You've been with Fang Lei.

997
00:40:45,641 --> 00:40:47,041
Couldn't you get more information?

998
00:40:48,641 --> 00:40:49,241
No.

999
00:40:49,402 --> 00:40:50,201
She's tight-lipped.

1000
00:40:50,521 --> 00:40:51,641
Then dig deeper.

1001
00:40:52,521 --> 00:40:53,962
There's definitely something there.

1002
00:41:02,081 --> 00:41:02,521
There is

1003
00:41:02,521 --> 00:41:03,521
no surprise at all?

1004
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:05,442
What's wrong?

1005
00:41:06,201 --> 00:41:07,402
Have you stopped pretending?

1006
00:41:13,241 --> 00:41:13,601
What?

1007
00:41:13,842 --> 00:41:14,842
How did you get hurt?

1008
00:41:16,161 --> 00:41:16,922
At boxing class.

1009
00:41:16,922 --> 00:41:17,762
Overdid the strength.

1010
00:41:17,762 --> 00:41:18,282
Fracture.

1011
00:41:18,322 --> 00:41:18,842
It's fine.

1012
00:41:19,922 --> 00:41:21,201
How could you be so careless?

1013
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:26,681
Be more careful next time you box.

1014
00:41:26,962 --> 00:41:27,882
If you're injured,

1015
00:41:28,962 --> 00:41:30,041
who will cook for me?

1016
00:41:33,442 --> 00:41:34,002
By the way,

1017
00:41:34,402 --> 00:41:35,641
I saw a nice custom tailor shop

1018
00:41:35,681 --> 00:41:37,081
while shopping today.

1019
00:41:37,442 --> 00:41:38,241
It's pretty good.

1020
00:41:38,681 --> 00:41:39,721
Take you there tomorrow

1021
00:41:40,842 --> 00:41:41,962
and pick you some.

1022
00:41:42,962 --> 00:41:44,201
Tailored suits

1023
00:41:44,362 --> 00:41:45,842
are better than ready-to-wear.

1024
00:41:49,681 --> 00:41:50,864
Need to tell you something.

1025
00:41:51,721 --> 00:41:52,641
Get ready for this.

1026
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:54,282
Go ahead.

1027
00:41:54,962 --> 00:41:56,282
I just received the news.

1028
00:41:57,241 --> 00:41:58,768
Shen Haoming and Xu Yan have made up.

1029
00:41:58,882 --> 00:41:59,882
They won't divorce.

1030
00:42:13,721 --> 00:42:14,521
Don't be afraid.

1031
00:42:15,322 --> 00:42:16,402
I'll always be with you.

1032
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:19,282
If you want to deal with him,

1033
00:42:20,201 --> 00:42:21,002
I'll unconditionally

1034
00:42:21,002 --> 00:42:21,762
stand on your side.

1035
00:42:23,882 --> 00:42:24,601
I've said it.

1036
00:42:26,521 --> 00:42:27,641
I don't care.

1037
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:31,081
He had a quarrel with Xu Yan,

1038
00:42:31,362 --> 00:42:32,681
yet he chose Xu Yan in the end.

1039
00:42:33,282 --> 00:42:34,601
He never cares about you at all.

1040
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:36,322
Why should he

1041
00:42:36,322 --> 00:42:37,041
care about me?

1042
00:42:37,842 --> 00:42:39,601
He must have his reasons

1043
00:42:39,962 --> 00:42:40,922
to choose Xu Yan.

1044
00:42:41,521 --> 00:42:42,640
I don't want to dig deeper.

1045
00:42:43,282 --> 00:42:44,442
You've loved him for years.

1046
00:42:45,201 --> 00:42:46,041
You love him,

1047
00:42:46,681 --> 00:42:47,721
yet he hurt you.

1048
00:42:48,161 --> 00:42:49,041
Are you letting it go?

1049
00:42:58,442 --> 00:42:59,322
Since Shen Haoming

1050
00:42:59,322 --> 00:43:00,241
never likes me,

1051
00:43:02,081 --> 00:43:03,121
I should get over him.

1052
00:43:10,482 --> 00:43:11,402
When we drank, you said

1053
00:43:11,442 --> 00:43:12,482
your sister got pregnant

1054
00:43:13,201 --> 00:43:13,922
in the UK.

1055
00:43:16,282 --> 00:43:16,762
Is that

1056
00:43:16,762 --> 00:43:17,882
Shen Haoming's child?

1057
00:43:19,842 --> 00:43:20,802
Of course not.

1058
00:43:21,201 --> 00:43:21,922
You misheard.

1059
00:43:23,762 --> 00:43:24,681
How could I mishear?

1060
00:43:24,681 --> 00:43:25,362
We were here...

1061
00:43:25,362 --> 00:43:26,802
You drank too, didn't you?

1062
00:43:27,482 --> 00:43:28,362
You got drunk.

1063
00:43:45,802 --> 00:43:46,681
You guys chat.

1064
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,080
The food's almost ready.

1065
00:43:49,241 --> 00:43:49,681
Yan.

1066
00:43:49,762 --> 00:43:50,721
You've forgiven Haoming?

1067
00:43:50,842 --> 00:43:51,802
You two made up?

1068
00:43:55,121 --> 00:43:56,601
We've always been good.

1069
00:43:58,521 --> 00:43:59,442
Come on.

1070
00:43:59,482 --> 00:44:00,322
I have

1071
00:44:00,322 --> 00:44:01,681
your gloomy-faced photos.

1072
00:44:02,002 --> 00:44:03,002
Enough, just eat.

1073
00:44:03,322 --> 00:44:03,842
Stop eating.

1074
00:44:03,962 --> 00:44:04,882
Dinner's almost ready.

1075
00:44:07,161 --> 00:44:07,641
Oh right,

1076
00:44:08,601 --> 00:44:09,601
I have a gift for you.

1077
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:10,081
Look.

1078
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:13,802
What kind of gift?

1079
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:14,601
Have a look.

1080
00:44:16,442 --> 00:44:17,121
More drawings.

1081
00:44:17,922 --> 00:44:18,442
Let me see.

1082
00:44:18,721 --> 00:44:19,282
Let me guess.

1083
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:20,802
You drew...

1084
00:44:22,121 --> 00:44:23,322
These are two horns?

1085
00:44:23,922 --> 00:44:25,842
Horns? These are tornadoes!

1086
00:44:28,521 --> 00:44:29,002
Look,

1087
00:44:29,201 --> 00:44:29,962
after you left,

1088
00:44:29,962 --> 00:44:31,201
a tornado

1089
00:44:31,442 --> 00:44:32,681
swept through our home,

1090
00:44:32,681 --> 00:44:34,081
shattering everything.

1091
00:44:34,121 --> 00:44:34,962
It's not complete.

1092
00:44:39,282 --> 00:44:39,802
Look.

1093
00:44:41,681 --> 00:44:42,402
I think this one

1094
00:44:42,402 --> 00:44:43,362
is my best work.

1095
00:44:46,322 --> 00:44:47,002
Turning the page?

1096
00:44:51,041 --> 00:44:51,402
Look,

1097
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:52,521
this

1098
00:44:52,721 --> 00:44:54,521
big, chubby one is my brother,

1099
00:44:54,962 --> 00:44:55,721
and this is me.

1100
00:44:56,681 --> 00:44:57,721
After you left,

1101
00:44:58,201 --> 00:44:58,762
both of us

1102
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:00,482
desperately wanted you back.

1103
00:45:00,802 --> 00:45:02,002
We were sad every day.

1104
00:45:10,762 --> 00:45:11,721
And this is...

1105
00:45:11,962 --> 00:45:12,362
You.

1106
00:45:13,282 --> 00:45:13,842
Me?

1107
00:45:14,561 --> 00:45:15,121
Why?

1108
00:45:15,842 --> 00:45:16,362
See,

1109
00:45:16,882 --> 00:45:18,601
you ventured out alone.

1110
00:45:18,681 --> 00:45:19,762
It must've been tough.

1111
00:45:20,322 --> 00:45:22,201
Look, you're surrounded by glaciers.

1112
00:45:27,161 --> 00:45:27,842
Next page.

1113
00:45:29,882 --> 00:45:30,362
Look.

1114
00:45:31,561 --> 00:45:32,482
See,

1115
00:45:32,641 --> 00:45:33,442
I've always

1116
00:45:33,442 --> 00:45:34,482
kept a light on for you

1117
00:45:34,641 --> 00:45:36,081
to guide you home.

1118
00:45:39,882 --> 00:45:40,402
See?

1119
00:45:40,442 --> 00:45:41,681
Now, you've returned.

1120
00:45:44,161 --> 00:45:45,362
There are even stars here.

1121
00:45:57,561 --> 00:45:58,681
Finally, you came back.

1122
00:45:59,081 --> 00:46:00,201
(My Family)
We are

1123
00:46:00,241 --> 00:46:01,002
the happiest family

1124
00:46:01,002 --> 00:46:02,081
in the world.

1125
00:46:06,362 --> 00:46:07,121
More after this?

1126
00:46:07,561 --> 00:46:08,762
No. I'll draw more later.

1127
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:11,161
Keep drawing.

1128
00:46:11,521 --> 00:46:12,681
Fill this entire sketchbook.

1129
00:46:13,641 --> 00:46:14,882
To find out what happens next,

1130
00:46:14,922 --> 00:46:16,121
stay tuned.

1131
00:46:17,762 --> 00:46:18,322
Haochen.

1132
00:46:18,601 --> 00:46:19,882
This is the best gift

1133
00:46:19,882 --> 00:46:21,241
I've ever received.

1134
00:46:21,561 --> 00:46:22,002
Really?

1135
00:46:22,161 --> 00:46:22,641
Sure.

1136
00:46:24,121 --> 00:46:25,648
Much better than your brother's gift.

1137
00:46:25,882 --> 00:46:26,762
Dinner's ready.

1138
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:27,762
Come and eat.

1139
00:46:29,081 --> 00:46:29,561
Come here.

1140
00:46:31,322 --> 00:46:31,882
Haoming.

1141
00:46:32,201 --> 00:46:32,641
Can I sleep

1142
00:46:32,641 --> 00:46:34,201
with you two tonight?

1143
00:46:34,322 --> 00:46:35,121
It's been ages

1144
00:46:35,121 --> 00:46:36,482
since I slept with you two.

1145
00:46:36,762 --> 00:46:37,601
No problem.

1146
00:46:38,561 --> 00:46:39,121
Really?

1147
00:46:39,842 --> 00:46:40,681
Awesome!

1148
00:46:41,362 --> 00:46:42,681
Come and eat.

1149
00:46:43,121 --> 00:46:44,041
What are you holding?

1150
00:46:44,842 --> 00:46:45,482
What's this?

1151
00:46:46,521 --> 00:46:47,402
Give it to me!

1152
00:46:49,282 --> 00:46:49,681
Haoming.

1153
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:50,641
What did you cook?

1154
00:46:50,882 --> 00:46:52,121
(My Family)
Delicious.

1155
00:46:53,201 --> 00:46:54,096
Washed your hands?

1156
00:46:54,521 --> 00:46:55,081
Wash.

1157
00:46:58,521 --> 00:46:59,641
Hurry!

1158
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:05,922
Alright, come eat now.

1159
00:47:06,641 --> 00:47:07,201
Yan.

1160
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:08,002
Yan, come on!

1161
00:47:08,402 --> 00:47:08,922
Coming.

1162
00:47:10,882 --> 00:47:11,802
Do you want to see?

1163
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:12,681
Sure.

1164
00:47:12,681 --> 00:47:13,041
Haochen.

1165
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:14,282
Can I show this to him?

1166
00:47:14,362 --> 00:47:15,482
Of course!

1167
00:47:15,842 --> 00:47:17,121
But I already showed him.

1168
00:47:19,842 --> 00:47:20,561
Give it to me.

1169

1171
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:30,721
Have some more.

1172
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:32,081

You too.

1177
00:47:37,121 --> 00:47:38,002
Have more vegetables.

1178
00:47:46,201 --> 00:47:46,842
I made the bed.

1179
00:47:46,882 --> 00:47:47,962
I'm sleeping in the middle.

1180
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:52,362

00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:55,201
studying abroad together.

1187
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,041
Key focus:

1188
00:49:57,681 --> 00:49:58,402
the child.
