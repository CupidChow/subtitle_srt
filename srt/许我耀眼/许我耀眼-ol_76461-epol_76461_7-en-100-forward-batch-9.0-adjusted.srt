I'll try the eyeshadow.

30
00:02:21,836 --> 00:02:22,357
Gone?

31
00:02:24,237 --> 00:02:24,876
I'm right here.

32
00:02:25,716 --> 00:02:26,396
What do you want?

33
00:02:27,116 --> 00:02:28,237
I'll try the eyeshadow.

34
00:02:29,757 --> 00:02:30,237
Go ahead.

35
00:02:34,156 --> 00:02:35,757
This color looks nice.

36
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,556
Could you get me a lipstick?

37
00:02:37,676 --> 00:02:38,357
Another color.

38
00:02:38,716 --> 00:02:39,917
I used No.103 yesterday.

39
00:02:39,996 --> 00:02:40,957
Get me No.105 today.

40
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:50,116
It looks good.

41
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:50,996
I'm leaving. Bye.

42
00:02:51,556 --> 00:02:52,996
Wait. It does look good.

43
00:02:53,436 --> 00:02:54,957
Why don't you buy one of the things

44
00:02:54,996 --> 00:02:55,957
you just tried?

45
00:02:56,197 --> 00:02:58,197
Why? I use the testers every time.

46
00:02:59,156 --> 00:03:00,357
It's been a week, Miss.

47
00:03:00,477 --> 00:03:02,797
Whether it's windy or pouring rain,

48
00:03:02,957 --> 00:03:04,556
you'd show up at 5 PM sharp

49
00:03:04,596 --> 00:03:05,957
to freeload makeup.

50
00:03:06,077 --> 00:03:07,396
People might think you're here

51
00:03:07,436 --> 00:03:08,357
clocking in for work.

52
00:03:08,957 --> 00:03:09,676
An eyebrow pencil

53
00:03:09,676 --> 00:03:11,077
only costs six yuan,

54
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:12,276
and you won't even buy one?

55
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,077
Wait.

56
00:03:13,396 --> 00:03:15,037
What do you mean "freeload makeup"?

57
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:16,317
I need to try them on

58
00:03:16,317 --> 00:03:17,477
before knowing what to buy.

59
00:03:17,876 --> 00:03:18,436
Besides,

60
00:03:18,637 --> 00:03:20,276
you don't limit the makeup trials.

61
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,064
(Trials up to 6 times a week.)

62
00:03:25,197 --> 00:03:26,757
I never saw this before.

63
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:29,116
This rule was made specifically for you.

64
00:03:30,197 --> 00:03:30,917
I just won't buy.

65
00:03:31,156 --> 00:03:31,876
So what?

66
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:33,596
Save it.

67
00:03:33,676 --> 00:03:35,116
This is consumer fraud!

68
00:03:35,637 --> 00:03:36,676
I'll report you!

69
00:03:37,156 --> 00:03:38,436
Focus on your job. Bye.

70
00:03:56,197 --> 00:03:56,757
Mom.

71
00:03:57,676 --> 00:03:58,757
I transferred the money.

72
00:03:58,797 --> 00:03:59,517
Did you see it?

73
00:04:01,596 --> 00:04:03,517
Don't be frugal with it,

74
00:04:04,317 --> 00:04:06,197
calculating every egg for breakfast.

75
00:04:06,237 --> 00:04:07,317
It's not expensive!

76
00:04:07,957 --> 00:04:09,996
I know you work hard for the money.

77
00:04:10,477 --> 00:04:11,716
Being alone in Jingzhou,

78
00:04:12,116 --> 00:04:14,077
your health matters most.

79
00:04:15,957 --> 00:04:17,676
I told you I can earn enough.

80
00:04:18,116 --> 00:04:19,836
You don't know how much I make daily.

81
00:04:20,037 --> 00:04:20,797
I have everything.

82
00:04:20,876 --> 00:04:21,757
Okay, okay, okay.

83
00:04:22,037 --> 00:04:23,436
I know you're capable.

84
00:04:24,276 --> 00:04:26,437
But take care of yourself.

85
00:04:40,317 --> 00:04:41,396
Wh-What are those?

86
00:04:43,557 --> 00:04:44,997
These are all the testers you tried.

87
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:48,836
I brought you some new ones.

88
00:04:48,877 --> 00:04:50,877
Do your makeup at home from now on.

89
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:51,957
Don't come to the counter.

90
00:04:56,437 --> 00:04:58,036
If you keep pestering me there,

91
00:04:58,077 --> 00:04:59,356
I'll only be serving you.

92
00:04:59,396 --> 00:05:00,276
How will I make money?

93
00:05:16,637 --> 00:05:17,557
It's almost expired.

94
00:05:25,677 --> 00:05:26,796
The warehouse is so hot.

95
00:05:27,836 --> 00:05:29,957
Qiao Lin, we're short-staffed now.

96
00:05:30,117 --> 00:05:31,036
Can you do dispatch?

97
00:05:31,236 --> 00:05:31,796
I can.

98
00:05:32,997 --> 00:05:33,432
These.

99
00:05:34,077 --> 00:05:34,584
Great.

100
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:36,077
Let me help you.

101
00:05:36,156 --> 00:05:36,757
Thank you.

102
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:39,596
Wait. Wait.

103
00:05:39,677 --> 00:05:40,197
Phone call.

104
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:40,957
Okay.

105
00:05:41,276 --> 00:05:41,916
I can do it.

106
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:44,036
- Wait for me.
- Okay.

107
00:05:45,396 --> 00:05:45,916
Mr. Zhang.

108
00:05:47,877 --> 00:05:48,637
An HQ meeting?

109
00:05:49,476 --> 00:05:50,437
Got it. Be right there.

110
00:05:54,677 --> 00:05:55,197
What's wrong?

111
00:05:56,476 --> 00:05:57,396
Sorry. It's nothing.

112
00:05:57,476 --> 00:05:57,916
I'm okay.

113
00:05:58,557 --> 00:05:59,396
I told you to wait.

114
00:05:59,437 --> 00:06:00,356
Be careful, will you?

115
00:06:00,437 --> 00:06:00,997
Sorry.

116
00:06:00,997 --> 00:06:01,396
My bad.

117
00:06:07,077 --> 00:06:08,437
Go to the hospital now.

118
00:06:09,276 --> 00:06:10,557
Just go. Leave it to me.

119
00:06:11,557 --> 00:06:12,437
Sorry, sir.

120
00:06:13,476 --> 00:06:14,757
Th-Then I'll go first.

121
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:15,796
- Just go.
- I'm so sorry.

122
00:06:18,437 --> 00:06:20,036
Works a little and demands payment.

123
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:28,236
I got it scheduled.

124
00:06:28,757 --> 00:06:30,236
A top specialist appointment.

125
00:06:30,716 --> 00:06:31,476
Your turn soon.

126
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:32,952
(No. 37 Qiao Lin)

127
00:06:33,757 --> 00:06:34,716
Thanks, Guan.

128
00:06:35,197 --> 00:06:35,677
Sure thing.

129
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:38,197
I'm okay. I'm okay.

130
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,077
We live together.

131
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:40,356
We help each other out.

132
00:06:40,957 --> 00:06:42,836
If you ever need any help,

133
00:06:42,877 --> 00:06:44,036
you must tell me.

134
00:06:47,437 --> 00:06:48,317
Alright, I'm leaving.

135
00:06:48,356 --> 00:06:48,957
Back to stream.

136
00:06:48,997 --> 00:06:49,916
Leaving so soon?

137
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:51,276
I need money

138
00:06:51,437 --> 00:06:52,757
to buy you bone broth.

139
00:06:53,877 --> 00:06:54,437
Love you!

140
00:06:54,637 --> 00:06:55,077
Going now.

141
00:06:55,197 --> 00:06:55,637
Good luck.

142
00:06:55,757 --> 00:06:56,197
Bye.

143
00:06:57,836 --> 00:06:58,317
Wait here.

144
00:06:59,356 --> 00:07:01,637
Now calling No. 37, Qiao Lin

145
00:07:01,836 --> 00:07:03,077
to Examination Room 4.

146
00:07:03,716 --> 00:07:04,156
Hold her.

147
00:07:05,517 --> 00:07:06,836
God, will it hurt?

148
00:07:07,877 --> 00:07:08,356
It's okay.

149
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:09,396
Relax your muscles.

150
00:07:10,317 --> 00:07:11,637
You'll feel it, but hold on.

151
00:07:17,796 --> 00:07:18,156
Well?

152
00:07:20,596 --> 00:07:21,156
That's it?

153
00:07:23,077 --> 00:07:23,637
Check it out.

154
00:07:24,197 --> 00:07:25,716
It seems... better now.

155
00:07:26,117 --> 00:07:26,757
Help her up.

156
00:07:27,557 --> 00:07:28,197
Move it around.

157
00:07:28,356 --> 00:07:28,957
Don't force it.

158
00:07:29,677 --> 00:07:30,637
Okay, thank you.

159
00:07:33,356 --> 00:07:33,957
I feel better.

160
00:07:34,836 --> 00:07:35,916
I've realigned it.

161
00:07:36,476 --> 00:07:38,117
No heavy lifting for three months,

162
00:07:39,236 --> 00:07:40,077
and don't overuse it.

163
00:07:41,276 --> 00:07:43,036
Otherwise, you might re-dislocate.

164
00:07:43,957 --> 00:07:45,117
So... it heals this fast?

165
00:07:45,156 --> 00:07:46,197
Will it hurt again?

166
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,036
If it hurts again later,

167
00:07:48,117 --> 00:07:49,317
I'll come straight to you.

168
00:07:49,557 --> 00:07:51,317
I won't pay the registration fee.

169
00:07:54,396 --> 00:07:55,557
You really haven't changed.

170
00:07:59,197 --> 00:07:59,757
Qiao Lin.

171
00:08:05,557 --> 00:08:06,356
Yu Yiming?

172
00:08:06,546 --> 00:08:09,176
(Yu Yiming)

173
00:08:09,176 --> 00:08:11,000
(City ranking: No. 1)

174
00:08:11,957 --> 00:08:14,557
Feels like we're growing apart.

175
00:08:15,276 --> 00:08:16,197
Don't be sad.

176
00:08:16,236 --> 00:08:17,236
We're all repeating.

177
00:08:17,276 --> 00:08:18,156
We can hang out.

178
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:19,317
Exactly.

179
00:08:19,437 --> 00:08:20,476
Think about it again.

180
00:08:20,517 --> 00:08:21,517
Feel any better?

181
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,596
I actually feel worse.

182
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,557
I'll give you drugs for the pain.

183
00:08:28,396 --> 00:08:29,796
You might not feel anything now,

184
00:08:30,117 --> 00:08:31,557
but in 2-3 hours,

185
00:08:31,796 --> 00:08:32,476
it might hurt.

186
00:08:33,156 --> 00:08:34,396
Take meds if it's mild.

187
00:08:34,877 --> 00:08:36,517
If severe, come for an X-ray

188
00:08:36,836 --> 00:08:38,276
to check for soft tissue effusion.

189
00:08:38,557 --> 00:08:38,997
Okay.

190
00:08:39,637 --> 00:08:40,356
Thank you.

191
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,157
Been here long?

192
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:47,636
I arrived about two months ago.

193
00:08:48,077 --> 00:08:48,476
You live?

194
00:08:48,917 --> 00:08:51,636
I share an apartment with two friends.

195
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:52,557
Girls.

196
00:08:54,557 --> 00:08:55,516
It's set back now.

197
00:08:55,917 --> 00:08:56,917
But if any issues arise,

198
00:08:57,077 --> 00:08:58,157
come see me immediately.

199
00:08:59,116 --> 00:08:59,917
No registration fee.

200
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:03,836
Daily life will be inconvenient.

201
00:09:04,636 --> 00:09:05,756
Contact your parents?

202
00:09:06,356 --> 00:09:07,596
They're back in our hometown.

203
00:09:08,557 --> 00:09:09,236
Qiao Yan?

204
00:09:13,157 --> 00:09:13,677
Qiao Yan.

205
00:09:14,876 --> 00:09:15,797
My letter.

206
00:09:16,397 --> 00:09:17,116
Did you read it?

207
00:09:19,037 --> 00:09:19,756
Take it back.

208
00:09:21,957 --> 00:09:22,476
Yu Yiming.

209
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:24,317
I came today to tell you

210
00:09:25,957 --> 00:09:26,957
I don't want to date.

211
00:09:27,397 --> 00:09:29,236
I just want to focus on studying.

212
00:09:29,557 --> 00:09:30,957
Other things aren't in my plans.

213
00:09:31,236 --> 00:09:32,397
I won't disturb your studies.

214
00:09:33,317 --> 00:09:34,756
I just wanted to say I like you.

215
00:09:34,797 --> 00:09:35,636
I don't like you.

216
00:09:50,077 --> 00:09:51,516
She goes by Xu Yan now.

217
00:09:52,437 --> 00:09:53,277
Ever been in touch?

218
00:09:53,957 --> 00:09:54,677
Have you?

219
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:57,596
No.

220
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,116
She came here for college, right?

221
00:10:00,636 --> 00:10:01,077
Yes.

222
00:10:01,876 --> 00:10:03,557
But she's too busy with work now.

223
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:04,756
My injury is fine.

224
00:10:04,756 --> 00:10:05,437
I'm alright.

225
00:10:05,756 --> 00:10:07,037
Bone injuries are serious.

226
00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:08,636
Trust your doctor's advice.

227
00:10:09,037 --> 00:10:10,116
If it's awkward for you,

228
00:10:10,836 --> 00:10:11,636
give me her number.

229
00:10:11,756 --> 00:10:12,356
I'll call her.

230
00:10:12,596 --> 00:10:13,636
No, that's unnecessary.

231
00:10:23,512 --> 00:10:25,944
(Jingzhou Yuekang Hospital)

232
00:10:27,876 --> 00:10:29,596
I don't think she'll come.

233
00:10:29,636 --> 00:10:30,756
Her work keeps her occupied.

234
00:10:31,476 --> 00:10:33,197
You don't need to stay with me.

235
00:10:33,236 --> 00:10:34,037
I'm fine on my own.

236
00:10:34,836 --> 00:10:36,397
It's fine. I'm off duty anyway.

237
00:10:38,716 --> 00:10:39,197
Xu Yan.

238
00:10:42,197 --> 00:10:43,116
Yu Yiming?

239
00:10:43,716 --> 00:10:44,516
Long time no see.

240
00:10:50,356 --> 00:10:51,236
What happened?

241
00:10:53,077 --> 00:10:54,677
Nothing serious. Just a minor injury.

242
00:10:54,836 --> 00:10:55,957
If you're busy,

243
00:10:55,957 --> 00:10:56,677
I'm fine.

244
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:57,596
You can go back.

245
00:10:59,596 --> 00:11:00,716
It's been a long time.

246
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:01,876
How have you been?

247
00:11:02,636 --> 00:11:03,317
Working at?

248
00:11:06,356 --> 00:11:07,317
After graduation,

249
00:11:07,437 --> 00:11:08,756
I stayed in Jingzhou.

250
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:10,437
That's good.

251
00:11:10,996 --> 00:11:11,876
I work here.

252
00:11:12,876 --> 00:11:13,797
An orthopedic doctor.

253
00:11:17,116 --> 00:11:18,116
Thank you for today.

254
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,197
Of course.

255
00:11:25,957 --> 00:11:26,596
You got married?

256
00:11:29,596 --> 00:11:30,236
Yes, last month.

257
00:11:31,677 --> 00:11:32,716
Though it's a bit late,

258
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:34,356
congratulations.

259
00:11:36,836 --> 00:11:38,037
Now that your sister's here,

260
00:11:38,077 --> 00:11:38,716
I'm relieved.

261
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,077
Take your drugs.

262
00:11:40,756 --> 00:11:42,677
If anything, let me know.

263
00:11:48,157 --> 00:11:48,636
Bye.

264
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:10,516
Let's go.

265
00:12:12,437 --> 00:12:13,557
Okay, let's go.

266
00:12:16,596 --> 00:12:17,437
Thanks for coming.

267
00:12:22,277 --> 00:12:23,636
My room is right across.

268
00:12:38,116 --> 00:12:39,116
Found a place,

269
00:12:40,756 --> 00:12:41,876
got a job too.

270
00:12:43,636 --> 00:12:45,437
Seems you're really staying in Jingzhou.

271
00:12:45,636 --> 00:12:46,996
Stop meddling in my affairs.

272
00:12:51,836 --> 00:12:53,917
Those two are my roommates' rooms.

273
00:13:00,797 --> 00:13:01,356
Move out.

274
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:04,636
What nonsense are you saying?

275
00:13:04,797 --> 00:13:05,756
Your bedroom's small,

276
00:13:05,957 --> 00:13:07,157
with no private bathroom

277
00:13:07,756 --> 00:13:08,797
and barely any furniture.

278
00:13:10,917 --> 00:13:12,088
I'll find you a new place.

279
00:13:13,116 --> 00:13:14,516
Who asked you to do that?

280
00:13:15,197 --> 00:13:16,277
I'm not helping you.

281
00:13:17,516 --> 00:13:19,197
Since you're staying in Jingzhou,

282
00:13:19,677 --> 00:13:21,437
I don't need any trouble from you.

283
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,596
If not for Yu Yiming,

284
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:25,797
I wouldn't have called you.

285
00:13:26,157 --> 00:13:27,797
Even if I got hurt like today

286
00:13:27,836 --> 00:13:29,077
or die somewhere someday,

287
00:13:29,157 --> 00:13:31,356
I'd never blame you for it.

288
00:13:31,397 --> 00:13:31,876
Okay?

289
00:13:35,756 --> 00:13:36,356
What?

290
00:13:42,116 --> 00:13:43,516
The room right across.

291
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:44,197
Empty it.

292
00:13:44,516 --> 00:13:45,037
Thanks.

293
00:13:46,356 --> 00:13:47,116
Why are you inside?

294
00:13:47,356 --> 00:13:47,756
No, no.

295
00:13:48,317 --> 00:13:48,876
What now?

296
00:13:52,437 --> 00:13:53,476
I said I'm not moving!

297
00:13:53,716 --> 00:13:54,957
Why dismantle my place?

298
00:13:56,197 --> 00:13:57,157
You have two options.

299
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:58,077
First,

300
00:13:58,596 --> 00:14:00,317
have your parents
take you home to recover.

301
00:14:00,557 --> 00:14:01,756
Second, obey me.

302
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,356
Who's the elder sister here?

303
00:14:04,516 --> 00:14:06,236
Don't think your success makes you king.

304
00:14:06,397 --> 00:14:07,476
Don't touch my things!

305
00:14:07,636 --> 00:14:08,476
Hands off my stuff!

306
00:14:09,236 --> 00:14:09,836
Keep this up,

307
00:14:09,876 --> 00:14:10,917
and I'll call the police.

308
00:14:10,957 --> 00:14:12,236
Trespassing! You know that?

309
00:14:13,077 --> 00:14:13,756
Make them leave.

310
00:14:18,037 --> 00:14:19,236
Don't be ungrateful.

311
00:14:20,516 --> 00:14:22,157
When we were kids,

312
00:14:23,077 --> 00:14:24,077
you helped me fight.

313
00:14:24,636 --> 00:14:25,636
I'm repaying the favor.

314
00:14:27,037 --> 00:14:29,077
You remembered such a small matter?

315
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:30,516
It's fine. Not needed.

316
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:31,596
I don't need that.

317
00:14:31,716 --> 00:14:32,797
But I must return it

318
00:14:33,236 --> 00:14:35,197
so that I can feel no debts between us.

319
00:14:35,797 --> 00:14:36,317
I won't move.

320
00:14:37,797 --> 00:14:38,636
You won't move?

321
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:39,277
No.

322
00:14:41,596 --> 00:14:42,157
Fine.

323
00:14:43,356 --> 00:14:44,317
I forgot to tell you.

324
00:14:44,677 --> 00:14:46,557
The new apartment's neighbor
is Yu Yiming.

325
00:14:47,116 --> 00:14:48,197
No need to move, guys.

326
00:14:48,476 --> 00:14:49,077
Move! Move!

327
00:14:49,116 --> 00:14:49,797
I must move!

328
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:51,197
Sorry about earlier.

329
00:14:51,356 --> 00:14:52,476
Let me help you with that.

330
00:14:52,636 --> 00:14:53,557
Here, I'll pack this.

331
00:14:55,917 --> 00:14:56,636
Who is it?

332
00:15:12,677 --> 00:15:13,236
Good morning.

333
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:14,356
Morning.

334
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:17,317
Qiao Lin.

335
00:15:18,596 --> 00:15:18,957
Qiao Lin?

336
00:15:21,116 --> 00:15:21,756
You're injured.

337
00:15:21,996 --> 00:15:22,596
Your breakfast.

338
00:15:24,516 --> 00:15:25,037
Thanks.

339
00:15:27,516 --> 00:15:29,077
Have... you eaten? Join me?

340
00:15:29,236 --> 00:15:29,797
I already ate.

341
00:15:30,317 --> 00:15:30,636
Oh.

342
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:32,356
I'll send you the cafeteria menu.

343
00:15:32,596 --> 00:15:33,836
You can give me a lunch order.

344
00:15:34,797 --> 00:15:35,836
- Leaving.
- Bye.

345
00:15:37,476 --> 00:15:37,996
Bye.

346
00:15:46,776 --> 00:15:49,689
(Jingzhou Yuekang Hospital
Staff Cafeteria Weekly Menu)

347
00:16:09,756 --> 00:16:10,797
Dad, Mom.

348
00:16:11,876 --> 00:16:12,557
What's wrong?

349
00:16:14,397 --> 00:16:15,957
It's so late. Why haven't you cooked?

350
00:16:16,756 --> 00:16:17,677
Do you know

351
00:16:18,596 --> 00:16:20,636
our whole family
got tricked by that Qiao?

352
00:16:23,037 --> 00:16:23,836
How?

353
00:16:24,277 --> 00:16:26,516
I ran into Ms. Chen today on the road.

354
00:16:26,996 --> 00:16:28,836
She used to work with Wang Yazhen.

355
00:16:28,876 --> 00:16:29,397
Remember her?

356
00:16:30,516 --> 00:16:32,157
Qiao Jianbin and Wang Yazhen

357
00:16:32,437 --> 00:16:34,317
bought a storefront on Commercial Street

358
00:16:34,397 --> 00:16:35,077
for a barbershop.

359
00:16:35,236 --> 00:16:36,516
Already paid the down payment.

360
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:37,677
Think about it.

361
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:38,957
Where is the money from?

362
00:16:39,197 --> 00:16:40,277
How would I know?

363
00:16:40,677 --> 00:16:42,157
Are you stupid?

364
00:16:43,157 --> 00:16:44,476
Their family is dirt poor.

365
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:45,917
How could they afford this?

366
00:16:46,596 --> 00:16:48,797
Must've used our bride price money!

367
00:16:49,037 --> 00:16:49,957
Never thought the girl

368
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:51,836
who acts so carelessly

369
00:16:52,317 --> 00:16:54,197
would be so shrewd with money.

370
00:16:54,516 --> 00:16:56,116
Good thing you didn't marry her!

371
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,596
Listen, son.

372
00:16:59,157 --> 00:17:01,077
We need to get that money back.

373
00:17:01,596 --> 00:17:04,077
We can't lose face and money!

374
00:17:08,472 --> 00:17:09,472
(Qiao Lin, my parents want
the bride price back.)

375
00:17:09,472 --> 00:17:10,332
(But don't worry, I don't agree.)

376
00:17:10,332 --> 00:17:11,042
(Because I still love you.)

377
00:17:11,042 --> 00:17:11,542
(I won't hold this against you.)

378
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:12,536
(I'll come to Jingzhou tomorrow.
Let's meet up.)

379
00:17:16,024 --> 00:17:17,240
(The message was sent
but rejected by the recipient.)

380
00:17:19,877 --> 00:17:20,917
She blocked me.

381
00:17:26,556 --> 00:17:28,877
Sorry, the number you dialed

382
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:30,316

Please try again later.

384
00:17:32,756 --> 00:17:34,437
Phone's blocked too.

385
00:17:35,036 --> 00:17:35,756
Qiao Lin.

386
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,516
This is too much.

387
00:17:52,597 --> 00:17:53,036
Hello.

388
00:17:53,157 --> 00:17:54,637
- Hello.
- I'm looking for

389
00:17:54,756 --> 00:17:56,476
the host of Family Feast,

390
00:17:56,597 --> 00:17:57,397
named Qiao Yan.

391
00:17:58,796 --> 00:18:00,076
She goes by Xu Yan now.

392
00:18:00,197 --> 00:18:01,637
Do you have an appointment, sir?

393
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:02,837
No.

394
00:18:03,597 --> 00:18:04,157
I'm sorry.

395
00:18:04,236 --> 00:18:05,837
No visitors without appointments.

396
00:18:08,197 --> 00:18:10,597
Could you call her to come meet me?

397
00:18:10,996 --> 00:18:12,716
Her brother-in-law Lin Tao is here.

398
00:18:13,756 --> 00:18:15,917
You can call her to come get you.

399
00:18:21,397 --> 00:18:22,076
Thanks then.

400
00:18:22,236 --> 00:18:23,197
You're welcome, sir.

401
00:18:30,516 --> 00:18:31,117
Sir.

402
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,076
Who are you looking for?

403
00:18:34,437 --> 00:18:34,756
Uh...

404
00:18:34,756 --> 00:18:36,877
I'm looking for Xu Yan,
the host of Family Feast.

405
00:18:37,397 --> 00:18:38,437
Do you have a pass?

406
00:18:41,677 --> 00:18:42,716
No entry without a pass.

407
00:18:43,236 --> 00:18:43,957
Please leave now.

408
00:18:43,996 --> 00:18:44,677
Get out of there.

409
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,476
No, I'll just be a moment.

410
00:18:46,556 --> 00:18:47,316
Sir, please.

411
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:48,117
Leave immediately.

412
00:18:56,276 --> 00:18:58,437
Thank you so much, Yiming.

413
00:19:00,877 --> 00:19:02,117
You're very welcome.

414
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:04,276
We're high school classmates

415
00:19:04,397 --> 00:19:05,157
and folks at home.

416
00:19:05,597 --> 00:19:06,357
In Jingzhou,

417
00:19:06,397 --> 00:19:07,677
we should help each other.

418
00:19:08,276 --> 00:19:08,996
Besides,

419
00:19:10,076 --> 00:19:11,236
Qiao Lin is my patient.

420
00:19:13,796 --> 00:19:14,397
From now on,

421
00:19:14,516 --> 00:19:15,957
if Qiao Lin needs anything

422
00:19:15,996 --> 00:19:17,197
or gets in trouble,

423
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:19,556
please contact me directly.

424
00:19:21,516 --> 00:19:21,996
No problem.

425
00:19:25,117 --> 00:19:26,036
You know,

426
00:19:26,996 --> 00:19:28,637
Qiao Lin's family and I

427
00:19:28,677 --> 00:19:29,716
are always like this.

428
00:19:31,476 --> 00:19:32,236
Thank you.

429
00:19:33,877 --> 00:19:34,917
Actually, I can tell

430
00:19:35,637 --> 00:19:37,316
you care deeply about your sister.

431
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,236
Why don't you just sit down and talk?

432
00:19:41,516 --> 00:19:42,556
I like it this way.

433
00:19:43,157 --> 00:19:44,796
We have our own lives,

434
00:19:45,516 --> 00:19:46,637
keeping a distance,

435
00:19:47,316 --> 00:19:48,157
and being at peace.

436
00:19:48,637 --> 00:19:49,236
It's great.

437
00:19:58,437 --> 00:19:59,756
Hey, Lin Tao.

438
00:20:00,276 --> 00:20:00,837
Mr. Qiao,

439
00:20:03,197 --> 00:20:06,117
do you have Qiao Yan's number?

440
00:20:06,637 --> 00:20:07,236
Yan?

441
00:20:08,236 --> 00:20:09,476
Do you need to contact her?

442
00:20:11,716 --> 00:20:12,397
Yeah.

443
00:20:13,677 --> 00:20:15,516
Alright, I'll look for it.

444
00:20:22,756 --> 00:20:23,236
Sir,

445
00:20:23,837 --> 00:20:24,597
don't bother.

446
00:20:25,276 --> 00:20:25,957
I got it.

447
00:20:26,996 --> 00:20:27,556
I know

448
00:20:28,397 --> 00:20:30,076
you want Qiao Lin and me to be close.

449
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:33,597
But it's been too long.

450
00:20:34,157 --> 00:20:35,036
There's no need.

451
00:20:35,796 --> 00:20:37,157
Qiao Lin just broke up

452
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,437
and lives alone now.

453
00:20:39,556 --> 00:20:40,476
With you next door,

454
00:20:40,516 --> 00:20:41,556
I feel more at ease.

455
00:20:42,756 --> 00:20:44,597
But please do look after her for me.

456
00:20:45,316 --> 00:20:46,157
Don't worry.

457
00:20:46,677 --> 00:20:47,476
It's appropriate

458
00:20:47,837 --> 00:20:49,117
for me to take care of her.

459
00:20:49,597 --> 00:20:50,036
Thank you.

460
00:20:50,756 --> 00:20:51,276
Qiao Yan.

461
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,076
Why ask him to do that?

462
00:20:56,917 --> 00:20:57,516
Who is he?

463
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:05,117
Who is he?

464
00:21:05,637 --> 00:21:06,837
Lin Tao, calm down.

465
00:21:07,197 --> 00:21:09,076
Qiao Lin and I
went to high school with him.

466
00:21:09,117 --> 00:21:09,677
That's all.

467
00:21:09,996 --> 00:21:10,476
Hello.

468
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:12,556
I'm Yu Yiming.

469
00:21:13,637 --> 00:21:14,597
High school classmates?

470
00:21:15,476 --> 00:21:17,756
Then why let Qiao Lin
move next door to him?

471
00:21:19,036 --> 00:21:21,076
I know why Qiao Lin
called off our engagement.

472
00:21:21,316 --> 00:21:22,837
You schemed it, didn't you?

473
00:21:22,837 --> 00:21:23,597
What did I do?

474
00:21:25,276 --> 00:21:25,837
Take this out.

475
00:21:25,877 --> 00:21:27,157
If you hadn't tricked Qiao Lin,

476
00:21:27,597 --> 00:21:28,516
why would she come here

477
00:21:28,756 --> 00:21:29,837
and get close to him?

478
00:21:30,117 --> 00:21:31,397
Qiao Yan, what's wrong with you?

479
00:21:31,437 --> 00:21:32,756
This is a public place.

480
00:21:35,157 --> 00:21:37,476
Go outside, and we'll talk.

481
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,197
No.

482
00:21:38,476 --> 00:21:38,877
Qiao Yan.

483
00:21:39,397 --> 00:21:40,437
What's wrong with you?

484
00:21:40,957 --> 00:21:42,157
Wait, hold on a second.

485
00:21:45,197 --> 00:21:45,677
Wait.

486
00:21:47,197 --> 00:21:48,157
You pushed me!

487
00:21:48,597 --> 00:21:50,716
You seduced my fiancée,
and now you're pushing me?

488
00:21:50,917 --> 00:21:51,437
Qiao Yan.

489
00:21:51,837 --> 00:21:53,316
You helped your sister cheat.

490
00:21:53,597 --> 00:21:55,117
You two are disgusting.

491
00:21:55,157 --> 00:21:56,236
Watch your mouth.

492
00:21:56,397 --> 00:21:56,996
Go outside.

493
00:21:57,197 --> 00:21:57,677
No.

494
00:21:57,996 --> 00:21:59,316
Say it here.

495
00:21:59,556 --> 00:22:00,756
Where is Qiao Lin really?

496
00:22:00,996 --> 00:22:01,957
Get her here

497
00:22:02,117 --> 00:22:03,437
and explain everything.

498
00:22:03,637 --> 00:22:05,397
I want every detail laid out clearly.

499
00:22:05,437 --> 00:22:06,316
I know where she is.

500
00:22:08,397 --> 00:22:09,197
I'll take you there.

501
00:22:14,276 --> 00:22:14,796
Go ahead.

502
00:22:25,556 --> 00:22:26,276
No lying, huh?

503
00:22:29,157 --> 00:22:29,877
What happened?

504
00:22:29,877 --> 00:22:30,316
Sorry.

505
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:31,276
I'm not sure.

506
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:32,476
Ask this gentleman.

507
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:34,236
Sorry, are your clothes alright?

508
00:22:34,597 --> 00:22:35,316
Yeah, thank you.

509
00:22:35,877 --> 00:22:36,516
Hey, handsome.

510
00:22:37,597 --> 00:22:38,837
What happened here earlier?

511
00:22:39,716 --> 00:22:40,316
You are...

512
00:22:40,796 --> 00:22:42,197
I'm Xu Yan's colleague.

513
00:22:42,357 --> 00:22:44,437
I saw a man leave with her just now.

514
00:22:44,476 --> 00:22:45,276
Are they...

515
00:22:46,236 --> 00:22:46,996
I don't know them.

516
00:22:47,236 --> 00:22:48,637
They bumped into me just now.

517
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:49,637
Sorry.

518
00:22:57,597 --> 00:22:58,917
You teamed up

519
00:22:58,957 --> 00:23:00,197
to help her cheat on me, huh?

520
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,597
This matter won't be
swept under the rug.

521
00:23:02,837 --> 00:23:04,637
What I just said simply

522
00:23:06,036 --> 00:23:08,076
went through one ear
and out the other, right?

523
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:09,556
Get her here

524
00:23:10,397 --> 00:23:11,357
to explain it to me.

525
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,276
She'll swear that she has

526
00:23:13,316 --> 00:23:14,716
no romance with that Yu.

527
00:23:14,796 --> 00:23:15,516
You're pathetic.

528
00:23:15,837 --> 00:23:16,556
Scared, huh?

529
00:23:17,837 --> 00:23:18,996
Afraid she'll slip up.

530
00:23:19,597 --> 00:23:21,036
Qiao Yan, you never speak the truth.

531
00:23:27,556 --> 00:23:28,157
I'm leaving.

532
00:23:28,837 --> 00:23:30,197
Two final things for you.

533
00:23:30,556 --> 00:23:31,036
First,

534
00:23:32,276 --> 00:23:33,796
you've broken up with Qiao Lin.

535
00:23:34,877 --> 00:23:36,197
You have no connection anymore.

536
00:23:36,276 --> 00:23:37,036
- I...
- Second,

537
00:23:37,597 --> 00:23:39,917
I forbid you from meddling in
her current life.

538
00:23:41,357 --> 00:23:42,556
I'm done. Understood?

539
00:23:45,796 --> 00:23:46,397
Firstly,

540
00:23:47,197 --> 00:23:48,957
the breakup was her unilateral decision.

541
00:23:49,197 --> 00:23:49,957
I never agreed.

542
00:23:50,316 --> 00:23:51,677
How can we have no connection?

543
00:23:52,076 --> 00:23:53,076
She's my fiancée!

544
00:23:53,236 --> 00:23:55,076
Your family accepted the bride price!

545
00:23:58,917 --> 00:23:59,516
How much?

546
00:24:00,076 --> 00:24:00,597
I'll pay.

547
00:24:04,556 --> 00:24:05,877
This isn't about money!

548
00:24:05,957 --> 00:24:07,276
I want her! Her!

549
00:24:08,276 --> 00:24:08,957
I don't know.

550
00:24:11,236 --> 00:24:11,756
Fine.

551
00:24:13,197 --> 00:24:13,877
Won't talk?

552
00:24:14,756 --> 00:24:15,837
Then I'll come every day.

553
00:24:16,076 --> 00:24:17,476
I'll demand her at your workplace.

554
00:24:17,597 --> 00:24:18,796
Hound your in-laws for her.

555
00:24:19,397 --> 00:24:20,476
Didn't you marry well?

556
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:21,957
I'll show them what kind

557
00:24:22,076 --> 00:24:22,996
of shameless things

558
00:24:23,036 --> 00:24:24,696
you've been doing behind their backs.

559
00:24:34,437 --> 00:24:35,076
Suit yourself.

560
00:24:45,437 --> 00:24:45,996
Coming.

561
00:24:54,437 --> 00:24:54,917
I'll get it.

562
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:07,197
Good grief!

563
00:25:08,996 --> 00:25:11,197
He's completely insane!

564
00:25:12,877 --> 00:25:14,357
Always looked down on me,

565
00:25:14,716 --> 00:25:17,076
saying I couldn't help his career,

566
00:25:17,476 --> 00:25:19,197
now falsely accusing me of cheating!

567
00:25:19,276 --> 00:25:19,716
Well,

568
00:25:19,957 --> 00:25:20,476
such madness!

569
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:21,516
I'm so pissed off!

570
00:25:24,236 --> 00:25:25,276
What will you do?

571
00:25:27,316 --> 00:25:28,957
He wants me to confront him directly?

572
00:25:29,157 --> 00:25:29,516
Fine.

573
00:25:29,756 --> 00:25:30,597
Talk to him directly.

574
00:25:30,716 --> 00:25:31,716
Watch me beat him hard!

575
00:25:36,197 --> 00:25:37,236
I won't recommend that.

576
00:25:38,357 --> 00:25:40,440
It's unnecessary for you
to drain yourself like this.

577
00:25:41,197 --> 00:25:42,516
Since you broke up,

578
00:25:42,877 --> 00:25:44,796
make a clean break from the past.

579
00:25:46,197 --> 00:25:47,117
I talked with Lin Tao.

580
00:25:47,917 --> 00:25:48,796
What he cares about

581
00:25:49,157 --> 00:25:51,076
is your emotional loyalty to him.

582
00:25:51,197 --> 00:25:54,316
But his parents only
care about the money.

583
00:25:56,076 --> 00:25:57,516
Don't worry about the money.

584
00:25:57,917 --> 00:25:58,996
I'll handle it for you.

585
00:25:59,437 --> 00:26:00,197
This way,

586
00:26:00,796 --> 00:26:02,197
even if he causes trouble here,

587
00:26:02,837 --> 00:26:04,036
his parents will stop him.

588
00:26:06,877 --> 00:26:08,437
I don't need your help with this.

589
00:26:08,556 --> 00:26:09,516
I'll handle it myself.

590
00:26:09,677 --> 00:26:10,276
How exactly?

591
00:26:12,316 --> 00:26:13,276
When will you handle it?

592
00:26:14,597 --> 00:26:15,476
With what?

593
00:26:16,236 --> 00:26:16,677
I...

594
00:26:26,917 --> 00:26:28,877
By the time you got the money,

595
00:26:29,677 --> 00:26:30,957
Lin Tao would have made this

596
00:26:30,996 --> 00:26:32,076
public knowledge by then.

597
00:26:32,996 --> 00:26:34,397
By then, my workplace,

598
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:35,316
the Shen family,

599
00:26:35,597 --> 00:26:36,796
and everyone else would know.

600
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:39,556
I...

601
00:26:40,236 --> 00:26:40,837
I thought

602
00:26:40,837 --> 00:26:42,476
you were considering my interests.

603
00:26:42,837 --> 00:26:45,080
Turns out you're just afraid
your lies will be exposed.

604
00:26:49,197 --> 00:26:49,716
Yes.

605
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:53,957
I did it for myself.

606
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,157
Because since childhood,

607
00:26:58,197 --> 00:26:59,877
I've had to learn to prioritize myself.

608
00:26:59,917 --> 00:27:01,036
I'm not you.

609
00:27:04,796 --> 00:27:06,556
I don't need you causing
more trouble for me.

610
00:27:07,516 --> 00:27:09,036
If money can solve it,

611
00:27:09,197 --> 00:27:10,076
I'll handle it.

612
00:27:10,877 --> 00:27:12,824
Fine. I won't cause you trouble.

613
00:27:14,157 --> 00:27:15,357
Consider this money a loan.

614
00:27:15,516 --> 00:27:17,197
The rent for the apartment
is also a loan.

615
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:18,796
I'll pay you back in installments.

616
00:27:19,236 --> 00:27:19,877
Qiao Lin.

617
00:27:20,276 --> 00:27:20,756
What?

618
00:27:20,888 --> 00:27:22,516
What do you ever do
besides acting tough?

619
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:23,036
I don't.

620
00:27:23,236 --> 00:27:24,397
- Look at your arm!
- I...

621
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,157
Who is this Lin Tao?

622
00:27:55,117 --> 00:27:56,117
Claims to be your wife's

623
00:27:56,157 --> 00:27:57,197
cousin's fiancé.

624
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:02,556
Investigate his employment status
and social connections.

625
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:03,996
Understood.

626
00:28:11,597 --> 00:28:13,197
Son, all the money's been transferred.

627
00:28:13,437 --> 00:28:15,637
If there's nothing in Jingzhou,
come home immediately.

628
00:28:16,076 --> 00:28:18,516
I'm not going back.
I need to stay here a few more days.

629
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:20,556
Quit while you're ahead.

630
00:28:21,316 --> 00:28:23,117
Her sister has quite the influence.

631
00:28:23,157 --> 00:28:24,076
Don't make enemies.

632
00:28:24,677 --> 00:28:25,157
Exactly.

633
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:25,716
Mom, Dad,

634
00:28:26,157 --> 00:28:27,117
if I don't find out

635
00:28:27,157 --> 00:28:28,917
whether Qiao Lin called off the wedding

636
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:29,957
because she has an affair,

637
00:28:29,957 --> 00:28:30,957
I'm never going back!

638
00:28:31,677 --> 00:28:32,280
I'll hang up.

639
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:34,397
Lin Tao,

640
00:28:35,096 --> 00:28:36,276
the reason I called you here

641
00:28:36,276 --> 00:28:38,397
is to inform you the leadership

642
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:39,957
values your development highly.

643
00:28:40,516 --> 00:28:41,397
Keep working hard.

644
00:28:41,677 --> 00:28:42,197
Understood?

645
00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:43,117
Sir,

646
00:28:44,516 --> 00:28:47,597
you dragged me back
from Jingzhou for this?

647
00:28:50,197 --> 00:28:51,796
Sir, when I asked for leave,

648
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,397
I explained in Jingzhou,

649
00:28:53,597 --> 00:28:54,877
I have urgent family matters.

650
00:28:54,996 --> 00:28:55,917
Why make me...?

651
00:28:55,957 --> 00:28:57,957
Isn't this about
the account reconciliation?

652
00:28:58,157 --> 00:28:59,276
We need you.

653
00:29:01,516 --> 00:29:01,957
Well,

654
00:29:03,157 --> 00:29:05,076
account reconciliation
isn't my responsibility.

655
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:07,157
It's the emphasis
on your career development.

656
00:29:07,637 --> 00:29:08,556
Enough. Stop arguing.

657
00:29:09,437 --> 00:29:10,837
Your leave request is denied.

658
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:12,197
You're staying here.

659
00:29:12,597 --> 00:29:13,756
Why?

660
00:29:16,476 --> 00:29:17,476
To be honest,

661
00:29:17,877 --> 00:29:20,197
this leave request wasn't denied by me.

662
00:29:21,236 --> 00:29:22,556
Mr. Zhou rejected it.

663
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:24,276
Mr. Zhou?

664
00:29:25,877 --> 00:29:26,837
How did my leave request

665
00:29:26,917 --> 00:29:27,996
reach the executive level?

666
00:29:28,036 --> 00:29:29,076
I don't know.

667
00:29:29,397 --> 00:29:30,877
Mr. Zhou called me this morning

668
00:29:30,957 --> 00:29:31,677
asking about you.

669
00:29:32,117 --> 00:29:33,357
I said you'd taken leave.

670
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:36,316
Leadership showed great concern,

671
00:29:36,637 --> 00:29:38,637
telling me to recall you immediately.

672
00:29:39,197 --> 00:29:40,197
They praised you

673
00:29:40,516 --> 00:29:42,516
and told me to assign you
more responsibilities.

674
00:29:49,117 --> 00:29:49,637
Lin Tao,

675
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:51,957
tell me the truth.

676
00:29:52,397 --> 00:29:54,756
What's your relationship with Mr. Zhou?

677
00:29:55,756 --> 00:29:56,796
Nothing's going on.

678
00:29:56,996 --> 00:29:57,877
Nothing?

679
00:29:58,197 --> 00:29:59,796
But he specifically inquired about you.

680
00:30:01,837 --> 00:30:02,397
Tao,

681
00:30:03,036 --> 00:30:04,197
stop pretending with me.

682
00:30:05,716 --> 00:30:06,957
The boss cares a lot about you.

683
00:30:07,276 --> 00:30:09,117
You'll have a bright future ahead.

684
00:30:10,437 --> 00:30:10,996
From now on,

685
00:30:10,996 --> 00:30:12,312
don't take unnecessary leaves.

686
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:13,677
It looks bad for your reputation.

687
00:30:14,677 --> 00:30:16,036
Alright. Get back to work.

688
00:30:16,637 --> 00:30:17,357
Go on.

689
00:30:27,036 --> 00:30:27,957
Honey, are you ready?

690
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,117
Almost there.

691
00:30:29,556 --> 00:30:30,837
I'll count down from five.

692
00:30:31,276 --> 00:30:31,796
Don't!

693
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:32,316
Five.

694
00:30:32,677 --> 00:30:33,157
No counting.

695
00:30:33,157 --> 00:30:33,677
Four.

696
00:30:33,677 --> 00:30:34,397
Stop counting.

697
00:30:34,397 --> 00:30:34,957
Three.

698
00:30:35,197 --> 00:30:35,637
Two.

699
00:30:35,957 --> 00:30:36,397
One.

700
00:30:38,397 --> 00:30:38,837
Done.

701
00:30:40,076 --> 00:30:41,516
You cheated!

702
00:30:43,476 --> 00:30:45,197
You didn't even finish the count.

703
00:30:46,076 --> 00:30:47,276
What kind of

704
00:30:48,996 --> 00:30:49,917
dish

705
00:30:51,677 --> 00:30:52,917
is this?

706
00:30:53,236 --> 00:30:54,076
Isn't it obvious?

707
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,608
Shrimp-stuffed potato chips.

708
00:30:57,036 --> 00:30:58,677
Why such a literal name?

709
00:30:59,637 --> 00:31:00,877
They're delicious, really.

710
00:31:00,996 --> 00:31:01,437
Try one.

711
00:31:03,157 --> 00:31:03,637
Well?

712
00:31:05,276 --> 00:31:05,756
Good?

713
00:31:06,437 --> 00:31:06,957
As expected,

714
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:09,556
the chips taste like chips.

715
00:31:10,597 --> 00:31:12,357
The shrimp tastes like shrimp.

716
00:31:13,716 --> 00:31:14,756
Say it seriously.

717
00:31:15,197 --> 00:31:17,236
This will be the featured dish
in my next episode.

718
00:31:17,637 --> 00:31:18,712
It's really that bad?

719
00:31:20,516 --> 00:31:21,397
That's my fault.

720
00:31:21,996 --> 00:31:23,036
Let me try another piece.

721
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:27,464
♪To reignite♪

722
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:28,197
Different now.

723
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:30,837
The chips carry shrimp flavor.

724
00:31:31,637 --> 00:31:33,316
The shrimp tastes potatoey.

725
00:31:34,397 --> 00:31:35,756
Just like you and me.

726
00:31:36,076 --> 00:31:37,996
You carry traces of me.
I carry traces of you.

727
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:38,917
Mixed together.

728
00:31:39,117 --> 00:31:39,556
Amazing.

729
00:31:40,117 --> 00:31:40,437
Okay.

730
00:31:40,597 --> 00:31:41,197
Alright.

731
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:42,397
Let me taste your dish.

732
00:31:44,357 --> 00:31:44,917
Codfish.

733
00:31:45,556 --> 00:31:46,117
Have a bite.

734
00:31:46,157 --> 00:31:46,756
Wait.

735
00:31:46,996 --> 00:31:48,236
This isn't ordinary cod.

736
00:31:48,316 --> 00:31:48,756
What is it?

737
00:31:49,357 --> 00:31:51,357
It's Shen-family secret recipe cod.

738
00:31:51,397 --> 00:31:52,316
Extraordinary cod.

739
00:31:52,516 --> 00:31:52,996
Taste it.

740
00:31:56,036 --> 00:31:57,556
Let me name this cod dish. Okay?

741
00:31:57,837 --> 00:31:58,157
Fine.

742
00:31:58,556 --> 00:31:59,117
We'll call it

743
00:32:00,197 --> 00:32:01,516
Charcoal in Snowstorm?

744
00:32:01,996 --> 00:32:02,957
It's completely charred.

745
00:32:05,036 --> 00:32:05,996
That's a terrible pun.

746
00:32:06,476 --> 00:32:07,316
Here, try it.

747
00:32:07,597 --> 00:32:07,917
Fine.

748
00:32:14,556 --> 00:32:17,316
Perfectly preserves
the cod's natural fishiness.

749
00:32:17,476 --> 00:32:18,076
Very good.

750
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:34,357
(Given Lin Tao's personality,)

751
00:32:35,157 --> 00:32:36,677
(I thought he'd keep pressing.)

752
00:32:37,877 --> 00:32:39,036
(But unexpectedly,)

753
00:32:39,796 --> 00:32:40,996
(he suddenly vanished.)

754
00:32:53,036 --> 00:32:54,996
I contacted Mr. Huang's office.

755
00:32:55,437 --> 00:32:58,236
They said he is going abroad
for inspection.

756
00:32:58,397 --> 00:32:59,437
His schedule's packed.

757
00:32:59,917 --> 00:33:01,076
Can't arrange a meeting now.

758
00:33:02,236 --> 00:33:03,316
I also heard...

759
00:33:03,837 --> 00:33:04,516
Heard what?

760
00:33:08,316 --> 00:33:09,157
Out with it.

761
00:33:09,437 --> 00:33:09,837
Speak.

762
00:33:10,996 --> 00:33:12,516
Mr. Huang calls you the heir apparent.

763
00:33:19,677 --> 00:33:21,197
He knows my funding's limited.

764
00:33:22,008 --> 00:33:23,256
I have insufficient influence.

765
00:33:23,357 --> 00:33:24,437
He is clearly avoiding me.

766
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:26,036
What's our next step?

767
00:33:26,677 --> 00:33:28,036
Keep pursuing him?

768
00:33:28,996 --> 00:33:30,877
Proceed as planned.

769
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,516
Thoroughly study
his company's structure.

770
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:34,157
Okay.

771
00:33:36,856 --> 00:33:39,110
(Plot Plan)

772
00:33:41,796 --> 00:33:42,556
In short,

773
00:33:42,756 --> 00:33:44,716
we shouldn't rush on this land deal.

774
00:33:44,917 --> 00:33:46,197
Listen to your father.

775
00:33:47,597 --> 00:33:48,716
If he doesn't approve,

776
00:33:48,996 --> 00:33:51,117
Mr. Huang from Shouke
won't risk partnering with you.

777
00:33:51,117 --> 00:33:51,556
Right?

778
00:33:53,917 --> 00:33:54,316
Alright.

779
00:33:54,637 --> 00:33:55,437
Don't overthink it.

780
00:33:55,796 --> 00:33:56,716
He's your father.

781
00:33:57,197 --> 00:33:58,397
Every decision he makes

782
00:33:58,476 --> 00:33:59,516
is for your benefit.

783
00:33:59,716 --> 00:34:01,917
Tonight he's hosting Shifeng people
for dinner at home.

784
00:34:02,597 --> 00:34:04,197
Don't let your emotions show.

785
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:07,512
Give us a smile.

786
00:34:08,316 --> 00:34:08,837
Got it.

787
00:34:12,877 --> 00:34:13,357
Mom.

788
00:34:13,476 --> 00:34:14,036
Haoming.

789
00:34:14,236 --> 00:34:15,036
Have some fruits.

790
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:16,516
You're back.

791
00:34:19,996 --> 00:34:22,116
You two chat first.
I'll call you when dinner's ready.

792
00:34:22,317 --> 00:34:22,757
Alright.

793
00:34:26,676 --> 00:34:27,076
Sit.

794
00:34:29,797 --> 00:34:31,036
What were you talking with Mom?

795
00:34:32,556 --> 00:34:33,336
Nothing important.

796
00:34:33,837 --> 00:34:34,996
Just some minor work stuff.

797
00:34:37,917 --> 00:34:38,277
Good boy.

798
00:34:38,596 --> 00:34:39,277
Have some water.

799
00:34:39,437 --> 00:34:40,036
Pass me Bu.

800
00:34:40,917 --> 00:34:41,516
Bu!

801
00:34:42,196 --> 00:34:42,957
Let's go, Bu!

802
00:34:46,437 --> 00:34:47,116
Can you sit?

803
00:34:47,917 --> 00:34:48,516
Can you sit?

804
00:34:49,156 --> 00:34:49,516
Sit.

805
00:34:50,277 --> 00:34:50,636
Sit.

806
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:52,312
Shake hands.

807
00:34:52,877 --> 00:34:53,797
Shake hands.

808
00:34:55,397 --> 00:34:55,797
Come on.

809
00:34:56,556 --> 00:34:57,556
Come on, shake hands.

810
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:00,277
Such a good boy.

811
00:35:18,196 --> 00:35:19,128
Where are we going?

812
00:35:20,116 --> 00:35:21,036
You'll see soon.

813
00:35:22,156 --> 00:35:22,516
Let's go.

814
00:35:28,996 --> 00:35:29,797
You found it.

815
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:32,317
I stumbled upon it accidentally.

816
00:35:33,196 --> 00:35:34,156
I asked Hui.

817
00:35:34,476 --> 00:35:36,156
She said you made this as a child.

818
00:35:37,476 --> 00:35:37,996
Yeah.

819
00:35:39,116 --> 00:35:40,516
This thing's pretty old.

820
00:35:40,996 --> 00:35:42,556
When I was in elementary school,

821
00:35:43,357 --> 00:35:45,277
my dad wanted to renovate this villa.

822
00:35:45,757 --> 00:35:47,996
They made this opening
and planned to fix it,

823
00:35:48,476 --> 00:35:49,277
but I stopped them.

824
00:35:49,957 --> 00:35:51,076
Then I made this instead.

825
00:35:57,717 --> 00:35:59,757
How did you have such
good craftsmanship as a child?

826
00:36:02,676 --> 00:36:03,636
A little bear,

827
00:36:06,516 --> 00:36:07,556
a small window.

828
00:36:09,717 --> 00:36:11,237
It's gazing outside,

829
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:12,877
hiding here,

830
00:36:14,397 --> 00:36:15,596
looking so lonely.

831
00:36:16,837 --> 00:36:18,277
Maybe it wants

832
00:36:18,397 --> 00:36:20,196
to hide all the disappointments
and sadness

833
00:36:20,237 --> 00:36:21,476
here inside.

834
00:36:22,317 --> 00:36:23,877
Stay hidden and slowly process them,

835
00:36:24,636 --> 00:36:26,957
only showing the happy side to others.

836
00:36:29,717 --> 00:36:30,797
That's why I...

837
00:36:34,636 --> 00:36:36,036
I added this little lamp,

838
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:40,237
hoping

839
00:36:41,957 --> 00:36:44,636
it could chase away
those gloomy feelings

840
00:36:46,277 --> 00:36:47,237
and end its loneliness.

841
00:36:55,556 --> 00:36:56,357
Haoming,

842
00:37:00,237 --> 00:37:01,476
I know you care about me,

843
00:37:03,516 --> 00:37:04,676
but I don't need you

844
00:37:05,996 --> 00:37:08,437
to shield me from all your troubles

845
00:37:08,556 --> 00:37:09,596
and worries.

846
00:37:11,516 --> 00:37:13,036
I want to share your burdens

847
00:37:13,076 --> 00:37:14,397
and anxieties with you.

848
00:37:17,516 --> 00:37:18,357
Your happiness

849
00:37:19,636 --> 00:37:20,797
makes me happier.

850
00:37:35,516 --> 00:37:36,196
Thank you.

851
00:37:57,944 --> 00:38:01,184
(Jingzhou Conrad Hotel)

852
00:38:02,596 --> 00:38:04,636
Mr. Huang from Shouke Real Estate

853
00:38:06,757 --> 00:38:08,196
is notoriously difficult.

854
00:38:08,476 --> 00:38:11,156
I'm quite social-savvy,

855
00:38:11,317 --> 00:38:12,437
but dealing with him

856
00:38:12,797 --> 00:38:14,156
is like hitting a brick wall.

857
00:38:14,797 --> 00:38:16,196
He's such an eccentric person.

858
00:38:18,277 --> 00:38:19,636
If he's eccentric,

859
00:38:21,556 --> 00:38:23,317
there must be some special backstory.

860
00:38:24,036 --> 00:38:25,917
That's why you're smart, Miss Xu.

861
00:38:26,717 --> 00:38:27,797
My husband mentioned

862
00:38:28,277 --> 00:38:30,808
that Mr. Huang has an extraordinary
relationship with his wife.

863
00:38:31,516 --> 00:38:32,676
In their circle,

864
00:38:32,996 --> 00:38:34,676
he's known for being a devoted husband.

865
00:38:35,036 --> 00:38:35,636
Later,

866
00:38:35,717 --> 00:38:37,156
his wife fell seriously ill.

867
00:38:37,556 --> 00:38:39,476
Mr. Huang abandoned
all business affairs.

868
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:40,917
He accompanied his wife,

869
00:38:40,917 --> 00:38:42,957
seeking medical help
both domestically and abroad.

870
00:38:43,556 --> 00:38:44,116
In the end,

871
00:38:44,357 --> 00:38:46,437
his wife still passed away.

872
00:38:47,317 --> 00:38:48,877
Mr. Huang was devastated.

873
00:38:49,196 --> 00:38:50,717
His temperament changed.

874
00:38:52,277 --> 00:38:53,397
He never remarried.

875
00:38:54,556 --> 00:38:56,237
From what you say,

876
00:38:57,437 --> 00:38:58,957
Mr. Huang seems decent.

877
00:38:59,357 --> 00:39:00,357
He has good character.

878
00:39:01,116 --> 00:39:01,837
Meiling,

879
00:39:02,877 --> 00:39:03,996
do you know

880
00:39:04,156 --> 00:39:05,516
if he has any living relatives?

881
00:39:06,156 --> 00:39:06,996
Even extended family?

882
00:39:07,196 --> 00:39:08,437
There's hardly anyone left.

883
00:39:09,076 --> 00:39:10,516
The couple never had children.

884
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,877
His mother-in-law is still alive.

885
00:39:13,277 --> 00:39:14,636
I've heard all these years

886
00:39:14,676 --> 00:39:16,996
he's been caring for her diligently.

887
00:39:17,196 --> 00:39:18,717
He wants to be her caretaker for life.

888
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:21,277
But the old lady is stubborn.

889
00:39:21,757 --> 00:39:23,076
She moved to a nursing home.

890
00:39:23,437 --> 00:39:25,476
Mr. Huang couldn't change her mind,

891
00:39:25,837 --> 00:39:27,156
so he relented.

892
00:39:31,437 --> 00:39:32,757
In these business circles,

893
00:39:33,757 --> 00:39:35,476
is there anything you don't know?

894
00:39:35,917 --> 00:39:36,596
Not much.

895
00:39:43,996 --> 00:39:44,717
Miss Xu,

896
00:39:45,076 --> 00:39:46,317
thank you so much

897
00:39:46,476 --> 00:39:48,476
for donating these supplies
to our nursing home.

898
00:39:48,996 --> 00:39:49,516
Ms. Han,

899
00:39:50,076 --> 00:39:52,556
they're just daily necessities.
No need for formalities.

900
00:39:53,596 --> 00:39:54,277
Actually,

901
00:39:54,397 --> 00:39:56,036
I should be thanking you

902
00:39:56,636 --> 00:39:59,116
for letting us contribute.

903
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,156
It's not easy.

904
00:40:05,357 --> 00:40:05,996
By the way,

905
00:40:06,676 --> 00:40:08,076
do you have a resident here

906
00:40:08,237 --> 00:40:09,717
named Yu Shufen?

907
00:40:10,156 --> 00:40:10,837
Yu Shufen?

908
00:40:11,317 --> 00:40:12,036
You know her?

909
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:14,392
She's someone
my husband respected deeply.

910
00:40:14,757 --> 00:40:16,156
I'd like to visit her.

911
00:40:18,317 --> 00:40:19,036
Well...

912
00:40:21,036 --> 00:40:21,757
Is there an issue?

913
00:40:22,676 --> 00:40:23,797
Not really.

914
00:40:24,237 --> 00:40:25,237
I just think

915
00:40:25,596 --> 00:40:26,877
your visit might be...

916
00:40:32,317 --> 00:40:32,957
Get out!

917
00:40:33,357 --> 00:40:34,156
Get away from me!

918
00:40:34,556 --> 00:40:35,996
Don't blame me!

919
00:40:36,636 --> 00:40:37,596
It's your own fault!

920
00:40:37,676 --> 00:40:38,476
You thief!

921
00:40:38,516 --> 00:40:39,196
Shameless!

922
00:40:39,317 --> 00:40:40,476
I told you to leave!

923
00:40:40,757 --> 00:40:41,237
You...

924
00:40:41,516 --> 00:40:42,516
I've said everything!

925
00:40:42,596 --> 00:40:43,277
Not leaving?

926
00:40:43,877 --> 00:40:44,917
Stop following me!

927
00:40:45,277 --> 00:40:46,277
Utterly shameless!

928
00:40:46,397 --> 00:40:47,476
So thick-skinned!

929
00:40:47,877 --> 00:40:49,397
How dare you steal from me!

930
00:40:49,717 --> 00:40:50,516
Back off!

931
00:40:51,036 --> 00:40:51,877
I'll beat you up!

932
00:40:52,156 --> 00:40:53,156
Utterly shameless!

933
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:54,797
What's left to steal?

934
00:40:55,476 --> 00:40:56,397
You're shameless!

935
00:40:56,437 --> 00:40:57,476
Stop dodging!

936
00:40:57,757 --> 00:40:59,237
Stop dodging!

937
00:40:59,556 --> 00:41:00,516
Miss Xu,

938
00:41:00,596 --> 00:41:01,877
this is Yu Shufen.

939
00:41:02,556 --> 00:41:03,596
Alzheimer's disease,

940
00:41:04,196 --> 00:41:05,476
mid-to-late stage.

941
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,596
As you know,

942
00:41:08,357 --> 00:41:09,596
for patients like this,

943
00:41:10,036 --> 00:41:12,917
we can only provide

944
00:41:12,917 --> 00:41:14,036
a comfortable environment.

945
00:41:14,596 --> 00:41:17,437
Caregivers guide them through

946
00:41:18,397 --> 00:41:20,036
Baduanjin exercises

947
00:41:20,397 --> 00:41:21,357
and finger exercises.

948
00:41:21,917 --> 00:41:25,076
This helps slow
the disease's progression.

949
00:41:26,237 --> 00:41:26,957
I said

950
00:41:28,357 --> 00:41:29,036
leave!

951
00:41:32,116 --> 00:41:32,917
Meatballs!

952
00:41:49,116 --> 00:41:53,596
One, two, three, four...

953
00:41:54,397 --> 00:41:56,556
What's Madam Yu holding?

954
00:41:57,596 --> 00:41:58,957
Counting vegetable balls.

955
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:00,837
Vegetable balls.

956
00:42:08,837 --> 00:42:09,917
Grandma!

957
00:42:09,957 --> 00:42:11,156
Are the vegetable balls ready?

958
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:12,837
I'll be late for school.

959
00:42:13,996 --> 00:42:15,437
Almost done.

960
00:42:16,156 --> 00:42:17,196
You insisted

961
00:42:17,277 --> 00:42:18,996
on having fried vegetable balls.

962
00:42:19,237 --> 00:42:22,476
This dish requires a lot of effort.

963
00:42:22,516 --> 00:42:23,556
We have to take it slow.

964
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:25,437
It's ready.

965
00:42:26,717 --> 00:42:27,717
One.

966
00:42:28,237 --> 00:42:29,357
Two.

967
00:42:29,877 --> 00:42:30,797
Three.

968
00:42:31,357 --> 00:42:32,357
Four.

969
00:42:32,437 --> 00:42:33,437
Five.

970
00:42:33,636 --> 00:42:35,076
Lately, we don't know why,

971
00:42:35,596 --> 00:42:37,837
but the old lady keeps using
soil from flowerpots

972
00:42:37,877 --> 00:42:38,877
to make mud balls.

973
00:42:39,357 --> 00:42:41,277
She claims they're her vegetable balls.

974
00:42:43,596 --> 00:42:44,556
Flowerpot soil.

975
00:42:45,277 --> 00:42:47,516
If accidentally eaten, isn't it unsafe?

976
00:42:47,596 --> 00:42:48,957
At first, we were worried too.

977
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:50,877
We tried taking the mud balls

978
00:42:51,076 --> 00:42:52,036
while she was asleep.

979
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:53,717
But after waking up

980
00:42:53,877 --> 00:42:55,156
and finding them missing,

981
00:42:55,277 --> 00:42:56,237
she threw a tantrum.

982
00:42:56,676 --> 00:42:57,996
Said they were for her daughter.

983
00:42:58,036 --> 00:42:58,676
In the end,

984
00:42:58,917 --> 00:43:01,116
his wife still passed away.

985
00:43:01,196 --> 00:43:02,076
We realized

986
00:43:02,196 --> 00:43:03,397
she never actually ate them.

987
00:43:03,877 --> 00:43:05,277
So we let her be.

988
00:43:09,196 --> 00:43:10,357
Making vegetable balls?

989
00:43:10,757 --> 00:43:12,837
Why this sudden craving?

990
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:13,957
Just felt like eating

991
00:43:14,556 --> 00:43:15,957
your homemade vegetable balls.

992
00:43:16,076 --> 00:43:17,317
Missing your cooking.

993
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:18,996
Alright.

994
00:43:19,757 --> 00:43:20,317
Take a look.

995
00:43:21,277 --> 00:43:21,717
Enough?

996
00:43:22,476 --> 00:43:23,797
With this big bowl of yours,

997
00:43:24,116 --> 00:43:25,437
you could make five platters!

998
00:43:25,877 --> 00:43:26,556
First step,

999
00:43:26,757 --> 00:43:27,837
add white sugar.

1000
00:43:28,437 --> 00:43:29,036
Adding sugar.

1001
00:43:29,076 --> 00:43:30,596
To draw out moisture.

1002
00:43:34,917 --> 00:43:35,797
Mix evenly, right?

1003
00:43:36,116 --> 00:43:37,036
Of course!

1004
00:43:37,116 --> 00:43:38,196
Need to repeat?

1005
00:43:38,237 --> 00:43:39,676
Mix it.

1006
00:43:40,357 --> 00:43:41,036
See?

1007
00:43:41,516 --> 00:43:43,437
Told you to come to Jingzhou.

1008
00:43:43,717 --> 00:43:45,156
I've said it many times.

1009
00:43:45,797 --> 00:43:46,516
If you're here,

1010
00:43:46,556 --> 00:43:47,996
you'd be sitting here with me,

1011
00:43:48,076 --> 00:43:49,156
teaching me directly.

1012
00:43:49,237 --> 00:43:50,317
I learn fast!

1013
00:43:52,476 --> 00:43:53,516
You stay put.

1014
00:43:53,556 --> 00:43:54,317
I'm not going.

1015
00:43:54,397 --> 00:43:55,757
I'm busy now.

1016
00:43:56,797 --> 00:43:57,957
These days,

1017
00:43:58,156 --> 00:43:59,237
I'm busy playing mahjong.

1018
00:44:00,156 --> 00:44:02,116
The neighborhood ladies say,

1019
00:44:02,437 --> 00:44:03,636
"Madam, at your age,

1020
00:44:03,757 --> 00:44:05,277
you should exercise your mind."

1021
00:44:05,996 --> 00:44:06,917
Alright.

1022
00:44:07,837 --> 00:44:08,957
I know

1023
00:44:09,757 --> 00:44:12,156
you have an exciting senior life.

1024
00:44:12,996 --> 00:44:14,996
I won't keep you

1025
00:44:15,076 --> 00:44:16,437
from your joyful golden years.

1026
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:18,357
After mixing,

1027
00:44:18,596 --> 00:44:19,676
drain the water.

1028
00:44:19,797 --> 00:44:20,476
Then chop.

1029
00:44:20,596 --> 00:44:22,116
After chopping, add seasoning.

1030
00:44:22,357 --> 00:44:23,957
Chinese five-spice, allspice.

1031
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,116
And some salt.

1032
00:44:25,237 --> 00:44:26,076
Also add eggs.

1033
00:44:26,357 --> 00:44:27,676
Don't over-salt!

1034
00:44:28,036 --> 00:44:28,676
Wait!

1035
00:44:28,676 --> 00:44:29,516
Slow down!

1036
00:44:29,596 --> 00:44:30,516
Speak slower.

1037
00:44:30,596 --> 00:44:32,556
Slow down.

1038
00:44:32,636 --> 00:44:34,237
My brain can't keep up with yours.

1039
00:44:34,317 --> 00:44:36,277
You play Go and chess daily.

1040
00:44:38,437 --> 00:44:40,717
So you forget things too?

1041
00:44:41,757 --> 00:44:43,397
You used to complain about me.

1042
00:44:43,757 --> 00:44:45,516
"You never remember what I tell you!"

1043
00:44:46,196 --> 00:44:47,556
Now it's your turn.

1044
00:44:48,837 --> 00:44:49,556
