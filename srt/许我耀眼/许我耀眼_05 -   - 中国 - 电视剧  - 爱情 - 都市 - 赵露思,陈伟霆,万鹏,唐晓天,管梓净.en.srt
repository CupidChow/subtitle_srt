(Leave me alone!)

33
00:01:58,909 --> 00:01:59,348
Right.

34
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:00,909
You've never

35
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:02,868
mentioned you had a cousin.

36
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:05,348
Should we invite her to our wedding?

37
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:08,468
She's a distant relative.

38
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,708
We weren't so close.

39
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:10,748
Never mind.

40
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,468
Alright.

41
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:16,669
Your call.

42
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:20,389
Here.

43
00:02:30,468 --> 00:02:32,188
I moved out.

44
00:02:33,468 --> 00:02:34,748
Here's...

45
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:37,748
(I moved out and canceled the hotel.)

46
00:02:38,148 --> 00:02:38,949
(Here's the money.)

47
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:46,109
What else do I need?

48
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,069
Can't you take a hint?

49
00:02:52,468 --> 00:02:53,989
Bad sister! Bad Xu Yan!

50
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:55,468
I'm done with you.

51
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:01,349
(Lin, I'm sorry.)

52
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:11,389
(I shouldn't have
let my parents scold you.)

53
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:12,588
(Come back, please?)

54
00:03:12,628 --> 00:03:13,069
Get lost.

55
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:15,868
(Get lost.)

56
00:03:24,588 --> 00:03:25,308
Tao.

57
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:28,868
You're here for Lin?

58
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:31,588
She's on a business trip to Jingzhou.

59
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:32,468
Jingzhou?

60
00:03:33,628 --> 00:03:34,628
Didn't she tell you?

61
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:36,349
Qiao.

62
00:03:36,868 --> 00:03:37,509
Qiao.

63
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:39,028
Come on, Tao's here.

64
00:03:39,148 --> 00:03:39,789
Look.

65
00:03:40,148 --> 00:03:41,308
Hello, Tao.

66
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:42,000
Mr. Qiao.

67
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:43,028
Perfect.

68
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:44,349
We don't have much work.

69
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:46,588
Let's go for a drink somewhere.

70
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:48,069
- Mr. Qiao...
- Drink with him.

71
00:03:50,628 --> 00:03:52,349
Didn't Qiao Lin tell you anything

72
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:54,628
before she left for Jingzhou?

73
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:56,669
Did she?

74
00:03:56,908 --> 00:03:58,269
Nothing at all.

75
00:03:58,628 --> 00:03:59,829
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

76
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:00,949
Well.

77
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:04,468
We've...

78
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:07,148
broken up.

79
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:08,868
What?

80
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:10,069
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:10,188 --> 00:04:12,588
The number you dialed is unavailable.

82
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:13,989
Please try again later.

83
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:15,708
Well?

84
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:16,752
Can't get through.

85
00:04:17,828 --> 00:04:18,789
She...

86
00:04:18,948 --> 00:04:19,989
She didn't even tell us

87
00:04:20,068 --> 00:04:21,268
about breaking up.

88
00:04:21,388 --> 00:04:22,669
Is she avoiding us?

89
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:24,068
No way.

90
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:26,188
Didn't she say she went to
Jingzhou for training?

91
00:04:27,188 --> 00:04:27,669
Jingzhou?

92
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,589
I'll call Qiao Yan right now.

93
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:30,188
Yeah.

94
00:04:32,828 --> 00:04:34,109
We'll try the clothes later.

95
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:35,628
I've visited this store.

96
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:37,508
Try these. Nothing else.

97
00:04:39,948 --> 00:04:41,469
Remember. Stay quiet.

98
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:42,828
Be polite.

99
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:44,748
After that,

100
00:04:44,948 --> 00:04:46,109
Haoming's parents

101
00:04:46,628 --> 00:04:47,989
might come home with us.

102
00:04:48,508 --> 00:04:49,268
Once we're back,

103
00:04:49,549 --> 00:04:51,989
tell them you have to meet some friends.

104
00:04:52,268 --> 00:04:52,948
Got it.

105
00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:56,268
So pretty.

106
00:04:58,493 --> 00:05:00,208
(Incoming call from Qiao Jianbin)

107
00:05:01,828 --> 00:05:02,709
Someone's calling.

108
00:05:15,068 --> 00:05:16,909
Sorry, the number you dialed...

109
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:18,589
- Well?
- She's not answering.

110
00:05:19,948 --> 00:05:20,349
This...

111
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:21,628
Forget it.

112
00:05:22,149 --> 00:05:24,068
I'll book tickets to Jingzhou now.

113
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:25,868
Ask your mom

114
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:27,349
where Qiao Yan lives.

115
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:28,388
Let's do it now.

116
00:05:28,868 --> 00:05:29,469
Okay.

117
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:35,589
Is this the place?

118
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:36,508
So many buildings.

119
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:37,589
Which one exactly?

120
00:05:37,748 --> 00:05:38,789
How would I know?

121
00:05:38,868 --> 00:05:40,669
This address is from two years ago.

122
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:41,868
How should I know?

123
00:05:41,989 --> 00:05:42,709
W-What a mess.

124
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,109
Let's try calling Yan again.

125
00:05:44,109 --> 00:05:45,229
She's not answering.

126
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:46,508
Try it one more time.

127
00:05:46,508 --> 00:05:47,469
Fine, I'll try again.

128
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:51,508
We just tried on so many dresses.

129
00:05:52,748 --> 00:05:54,029
They all look great.

130
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:56,989
In the end, it's about
the style you like.

131
00:05:58,229 --> 00:05:58,789
Ms. Yu,

132
00:05:59,268 --> 00:05:59,989
any advice?

133
00:06:01,424 --> 00:06:02,709
For traditional Chinese style,

134
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:04,508
the Zhou-style Hanfu
with phoenix coronet

135
00:06:04,508 --> 00:06:05,789
and embroidered cape

136
00:06:06,188 --> 00:06:07,308
has majestic patterns

137
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:08,469
and suits you well.

138
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:09,669
And it's said

139
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:11,669
to bring fortune to the bride.

140
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:13,229
For Western style,

141
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:14,748
take the last wedding dress

142
00:06:14,868 --> 00:06:16,589
you tried with a very long train.

143
00:06:17,188 --> 00:06:19,109
It looks elegant and graceful.

144
00:06:19,828 --> 00:06:20,909
Check over there.

145
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:22,508
Don't rush.

146
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:27,469
In the end, it's about what you prefer.

147
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:28,709
Qiao Yan.

148
00:06:30,388 --> 00:06:30,989
Yan.

149
00:06:32,508 --> 00:06:33,349
Yan, what's wrong?

150
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:35,748
- Qiao Yan.
- Yan.

151
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:47,549
Qiao Yan?

152
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:49,868
A-Aren't you Xu Yan?

153
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:53,109
Who are you?

154
00:06:53,428 --> 00:06:54,628
We're her parents.

155
00:06:58,789 --> 00:06:59,909
You're her parents?

156
00:06:59,989 --> 00:07:02,188
Then who are they?

157
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:03,828
Tell us.

158
00:07:04,109 --> 00:07:04,989
Who are they?

159
00:07:05,948 --> 00:07:06,508
Xu Yan.

160
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:09,428
Explain this right now.

161
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:10,428
Ms. Yu,

162
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:12,469
please let me explain.

163
00:07:12,948 --> 00:07:13,628
I see.

164
00:07:14,628 --> 00:07:15,709
Your name is fake.

165
00:07:16,109 --> 00:07:17,709
Your family background is fake.

166
00:07:17,868 --> 00:07:19,109
So are your parents, huh?

167
00:07:19,828 --> 00:07:20,428
Tell me.

168
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:21,748
How many more secrets

169
00:07:21,828 --> 00:07:22,948
are you hiding?

170
00:07:23,628 --> 00:07:25,029
We treated you with sincerity,

171
00:07:25,469 --> 00:07:27,469
yet you've fooled our entire family.

172
00:07:27,828 --> 00:07:28,948
Why are you so manipulative?

173
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:29,989
This is fraud.

174
00:07:30,109 --> 00:07:30,709
Marriage fraud.

175
00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:33,469
This is fraud. Marriage fraud.

176
00:07:33,948 --> 00:07:34,428
Qiao Yan.

177
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:35,748
What have you done?

178
00:07:36,828 --> 00:07:38,149
What's wrong with you?

179
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:39,149
Yan.

180
00:07:39,508 --> 00:07:40,789
I'm so disappointed in you.

181
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:42,589
Stop pestering my son.

182
00:07:43,989 --> 00:07:45,109
You've gone too far.

183
00:07:46,388 --> 00:07:47,120
Haoming, let's go.

184
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:50,709
We're done.

185
00:07:50,868 --> 00:07:51,428
Haoming.

186
00:07:51,868 --> 00:07:52,628
Don't pester me.

187
00:07:57,149 --> 00:07:58,029
Hurry up.

188
00:07:59,549 --> 00:08:00,229
Don't go.

189
00:08:03,748 --> 00:08:04,388
Haoming.

190
00:08:09,868 --> 00:08:10,428
Yan.

191
00:08:11,068 --> 00:08:11,669
Yan.

192
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:13,109
"Don't go?"

193
00:08:14,388 --> 00:08:15,868
What's wrong? You seem distracted.

194
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:18,628
I forgot.

195
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:20,709
Why are you so jumpy today?

196
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:23,589
Third Uncle's flight arrives today.

197
00:08:24,308 --> 00:08:25,149
What time?

198
00:08:25,428 --> 00:08:25,948
Five o'clock.

199
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:27,789
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

200
00:08:27,828 --> 00:08:28,388
Sorry.

201
00:08:28,388 --> 00:08:28,868
I forgot.

202
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:29,549
Sorry.

203
00:08:29,628 --> 00:08:31,109
We won't come up then.

204
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:31,508
Okay?

205
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:33,109
We need to pick up my brother.

206
00:08:34,189 --> 00:08:35,069
Qiao Yan.

207
00:08:36,508 --> 00:08:37,069
It's fine.

208
00:08:37,069 --> 00:08:38,148
I'm so sorry.

209
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:39,189
Let's hurry then.

210
00:08:39,189 --> 00:08:39,589
Hurry up.

211
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,989
Okay.

212
00:08:40,148 --> 00:08:40,748
I'm so sorry.

213
00:08:40,748 --> 00:08:41,268
No problem.

214
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:42,628
Yan, walk them out.

215
00:08:42,868 --> 00:08:43,388
Let's go.

216
00:08:44,309 --> 00:08:44,748
Okay.

217
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:46,189
Let's go.

218
00:08:47,229 --> 00:08:48,069
What's going on?

219
00:08:48,229 --> 00:08:49,628
Let's walk them out.

220
00:08:49,628 --> 00:08:50,788
What's going on here?

221
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:52,069
Ms. Yu.

222
00:08:52,628 --> 00:08:54,268
I'll pick you up for dinner tomorrow.

223
00:08:54,548 --> 00:08:55,989
I'll call you after work.

224
00:08:56,748 --> 00:08:57,189
Alright.

225
00:08:59,989 --> 00:09:00,709
Mr. Xu, Mrs. Xu.

226
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:01,268
I have to go.

227
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:01,709
Okay.

228
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:02,829
Bye.

229
00:09:07,148 --> 00:09:07,829
Bye.

230
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:11,829
Qiao Yan.

231
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:13,788
- Qiao Yan.
- Yan.

232
00:09:14,668 --> 00:09:16,868
That was Mr. Shen

233
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,268
from Jinda Group, right?

234
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:19,388
How do you know him?

235
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,148
Who was that young man?

236
00:09:26,229 --> 00:09:27,309
You two are...?

237
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:28,989
We're her parents.

238
00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:30,028
You are...?

239
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:35,628
We're from the wedding planning company.

240
00:09:37,349 --> 00:09:38,429
Congratulations.

241
00:09:38,668 --> 00:09:39,388
Congratulations.

242
00:09:39,508 --> 00:09:40,268
Those people

243
00:09:40,349 --> 00:09:42,788
are your future in-laws.

244
00:09:45,309 --> 00:09:45,868
Miss Xu.

245
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:47,028
If there's nothing else,

246
00:09:47,109 --> 00:09:48,709
Ms. Zhang and I will take our leave.

247
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:50,309
You can transfer

248
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:51,829
the remaining payment now.

249
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:53,709
Feel free to contact us anytime.

250
00:09:54,748 --> 00:09:55,268
Let's go.

251
00:09:55,309 --> 00:09:55,989
Okay, Mr. Gao.

252
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:57,589
Congratulations.

253
00:09:58,148 --> 00:09:58,829
Bye.

254
00:09:58,829 --> 00:09:59,388
Bye.

255
00:10:00,189 --> 00:10:00,668
Let's go.

256
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:05,989
Yan, what is going on here?

257
00:10:10,788 --> 00:10:11,628
I'm getting married.

258
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:12,589
What...?

259
00:10:14,268 --> 00:10:15,028
Getting married?

260
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:15,868
Wait.

261
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:17,868
Y-You're getting married?

262
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:19,469
But I don't even know

263
00:10:19,508 --> 00:10:21,229
who my future son-in-law is

264
00:10:21,309 --> 00:10:22,508
or what he looks like.

265
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:24,508
This is ridiculous.

266
00:10:25,229 --> 00:10:26,748
Aren't you going to tell us

267
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:28,628
before marrying someone?

268
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:31,229
Your sister broke off an engagement.

269
00:10:31,469 --> 00:10:32,548
You're getting married.

270
00:10:32,868 --> 00:10:34,349
Neither of you discussed with us.

271
00:10:34,469 --> 00:10:35,709
Are you ignoring us?

272
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:37,589
You don't need to overreact.

273
00:10:37,868 --> 00:10:39,589
It has nothing to do with you.

274
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:41,949
What?

275
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,309
I'm not inviting you to my wedding.

276
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:49,429
Grandma is my only family.

277
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,908
This is outrageous.

278
00:10:55,628 --> 00:10:56,628
Being in the big city

279
00:10:56,748 --> 00:10:59,148
doesn't mean you can look down on us.

280
00:11:00,229 --> 00:11:00,868
Yan.

281
00:11:01,868 --> 00:11:03,829
You've hurt our feelings.

282
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:05,989
After all, we're your parents.

283
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:07,189
So what?

284
00:11:12,989 --> 00:11:14,508
You'll never admit you're wrong.

285
00:11:15,469 --> 00:11:18,349
How can children judge their parents?

286
00:11:20,148 --> 00:11:20,829
Fine.

287
00:11:21,628 --> 00:11:23,109
That young man is from

288
00:11:23,469 --> 00:11:24,908
the wealthy Shen family, huh?

289
00:11:25,469 --> 00:11:28,069
He was born with a silver spoon, huh?

290
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:29,429
Alright.

291
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,788
We won't overreach.

292
00:11:32,469 --> 00:11:33,788
I won't go to your wedding

293
00:11:33,989 --> 00:11:35,668
even if you invite me.

294
00:11:36,109 --> 00:11:37,748
You're no longer my daughter.

295
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:39,949
Yazhen, let's go find Lin.

296
00:11:40,109 --> 00:11:40,949
Got her address?

297
00:11:47,548 --> 00:11:48,349
I'll send it to you.

298
00:11:54,109 --> 00:11:54,748
Jianbin.

299
00:11:58,469 --> 00:11:59,388
You finally picked up.

300
00:11:59,868 --> 00:12:01,668
I had to switch on my phone.

301
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:04,208
Where do you live?

302
00:12:04,388 --> 00:12:05,229
Here.

303
00:12:07,868 --> 00:12:08,628
How many bedrooms?

304
00:12:09,349 --> 00:12:10,229
Three.

305
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:13,109
You live alone in such a big apartment?

306
00:12:13,268 --> 00:12:13,748
No.

307
00:12:13,788 --> 00:12:14,229
Here.

308
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:16,748
I rented one of the rooms.

309
00:12:17,109 --> 00:12:18,388
The other two rooms

310
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:20,589
are rented by two other girls.

311
00:12:21,109 --> 00:12:22,388
A shared apartment?

312
00:12:22,788 --> 00:12:23,829
Who are your roommates?

313
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:25,268
Hello, my lovelies.

314
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:27,589
Today's another special discount.

315
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:29,429
Classic soy aroma.

316
00:12:30,989 --> 00:12:31,668
That's it.

317
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,520
Let me chug it down.

318
00:12:34,992 --> 00:12:35,868
Dive in.

319
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:37,949
No headaches.

320
00:12:38,349 --> 00:12:39,709
Who is that?

321
00:12:40,548 --> 00:12:41,668
She's my roommate.

322
00:12:41,788 --> 00:12:42,429
A livestreamer.

323
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:45,028
Your room?

324
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:45,908
Here, Dad.

325
00:12:46,148 --> 00:12:46,548
Not there.

326
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:47,189
Here.

327
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:53,469
I apologize.

328
00:12:53,469 --> 00:12:54,349
I'm sorry.

329
00:12:54,429 --> 00:12:56,229
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

330
00:12:57,028 --> 00:12:58,548
It's just that

331
00:12:58,589 --> 00:12:59,949
it happened so suddenly.

332
00:12:59,949 --> 00:13:01,989
I didn't want you to worry.

333
00:13:02,268 --> 00:13:04,589
So I thought I should
get settled here first

334
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:05,709
before telling you.

335
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:06,868
Get settled?

336
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:09,429
This is Jingzhou.

337
00:13:10,469 --> 00:13:12,148
Talented people flock here.

338
00:13:12,268 --> 00:13:14,388
Competition is heated here.

339
00:13:14,548 --> 00:13:15,349
You're here alone,

340
00:13:15,388 --> 00:13:16,268
away from home.

341
00:13:16,908 --> 00:13:19,589
No diplomas, connections, or background.

342
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:21,949
It's not so easy to live here.

343
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,109
Your dad's right.

344
00:13:24,268 --> 00:13:26,429
You have to let me try first.

345
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:27,829
Anyway, it's better than

346
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:29,189
suffering at Lin Tao's home.

347
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,069
Makes sense.

348
00:13:32,388 --> 00:13:34,668
We didn't know
Lin Tao's family was like that.

349
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:37,148
But Lin,

350
00:13:37,508 --> 00:13:37,949
well...

351
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:41,709
I still think you should
come home with us.

352
00:13:42,349 --> 00:13:43,349
It's just a town,

353
00:13:43,469 --> 00:13:44,908
but you'll live

354
00:13:46,388 --> 00:13:48,868
a peaceful life with us, right?

355
00:13:49,349 --> 00:13:50,508
Try harder

356
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:51,868
and be a civil servant.

357
00:13:52,028 --> 00:13:53,709
Make the Lins jealous. Okay?

358
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:56,548
Civil servant?

359
00:13:56,868 --> 00:13:57,788
You know very well

360
00:13:57,788 --> 00:13:59,229
I was never cut out for studying.

361
00:13:59,349 --> 00:14:00,628
Take the civil service exam?

362
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:01,388
No way.

363
00:14:01,388 --> 00:14:03,469
Now you admit you're not
cut out for studying?

364
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:05,668
Who begged us for money

365
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:07,668
to retake exams to come here?

366
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:10,949
We didn't even let
Qiao Yan take the exam.

367
00:14:11,508 --> 00:14:12,949
Now you're blaming it on me?

368
00:14:13,109 --> 00:14:14,388
You drove her away, okay?

369
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:23,548
Do you know that she has a boyfriend?

370
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:24,589
Forget about it.

371
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:27,908
We're not even invited to her wedding.

372
00:14:28,109 --> 00:14:28,628
Wedding?

373
00:14:30,989 --> 00:14:31,888
She didn't tell me.

374
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:32,868
Mom, Dad,

375
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:36,069
do you want to attend her wedding?

376
00:14:38,028 --> 00:14:38,949
All parents

377
00:14:39,668 --> 00:14:41,668
want to witness
their daughter's wedding.

378
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:42,628
No, I don't.

379
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,229
She's materialistic and ashamed of us.

380
00:14:45,349 --> 00:14:46,788
She's not my daughter.

381
00:14:47,109 --> 00:14:47,788
Dad.

382
00:14:48,268 --> 00:14:49,788
Yeah, I'm cursing you. So what?

383
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:51,788
Aren't you ignoring calls

384
00:14:51,908 --> 00:14:53,148
to get compensation?

385
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:54,949
Go ahead. File a complaint.

386
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:56,829
The other roommate.

387
00:14:57,268 --> 00:14:57,748
That's it.

388
00:15:02,908 --> 00:15:03,429
Yan.

389
00:15:03,668 --> 00:15:04,589
I'm magnanimous.

390
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:05,748
I can let it slide.

391
00:15:06,429 --> 00:15:08,508
But it's just angry talk
that Mom and Dad aren't

392
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:10,829
invited to your wedding, right?

393
00:15:11,748 --> 00:15:13,429
Since they are still here,

394
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:15,268
let's find a chance

395
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:17,548
to sit together and clear the air.

396
00:15:17,628 --> 00:15:18,349
What do you think?

397
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,148
Okay.

398
00:15:20,748 --> 00:15:21,388
Okay, right?

399
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:22,469
I'm coming in.

400
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:32,508
Who are you looking for?

401
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:35,229
Isn't this Xu Yan's home?

402
00:15:37,349 --> 00:15:38,469
This is my daughter's home.

403
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:40,109
Are you her colleague?

404
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:41,189
Your daughter?

405
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:43,028
You are...?

406
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,908
We're Yan's parents.

407
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:46,229
We've been working overseas.

408
00:15:46,628 --> 00:15:48,028
Since Yan's getting married soon,

409
00:15:48,229 --> 00:15:50,109
we came back for her wedding.

410
00:15:50,548 --> 00:15:51,548
She's getting groceries.

411
00:15:51,628 --> 00:15:52,548
She'll be right back.

412
00:15:54,628 --> 00:15:56,229
You're her parents?

413
00:15:56,469 --> 00:15:57,508
You live abroad?

414
00:15:58,028 --> 00:15:59,429
Yeah, w-we work

415
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:01,028
at a university overseas.

416
00:16:02,268 --> 00:16:02,709
Yan.

417
00:16:02,868 --> 00:16:03,589
Perfect timing.

418
00:16:04,109 --> 00:16:04,949
Your colleague.

419
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:14,868
Now I get it.

420
00:16:15,109 --> 00:16:16,748
You've been lying all along.

421
00:16:17,148 --> 00:16:18,469
You hired fake parents

422
00:16:18,548 --> 00:16:20,548
and told everyone

423
00:16:20,548 --> 00:16:22,469
that they live abroad.

424
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:23,668
Yan.

425
00:16:29,548 --> 00:16:30,868
I know exactly what I'm doing.

426
00:16:31,028 --> 00:16:32,069
Thanks for the reminder.

427
00:16:32,748 --> 00:16:34,709
You've got some nerve.

428
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:37,069
What if the Shen family finds out?

429
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:38,908
No one will know if you keep quiet.

430
00:16:39,309 --> 00:16:41,028
You'll keep lying to them?

431
00:16:41,628 --> 00:16:42,788
For someone so smart,

432
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:44,788
why would you do such stupid things?

433
00:16:47,069 --> 00:16:49,349
Once you marry Shen Haoming,

434
00:16:49,552 --> 00:16:50,608
what are you going to do?

435
00:16:50,748 --> 00:16:52,069
Keep lying to him forever?

436
00:16:54,508 --> 00:16:55,908
I'll figure something out.

437
00:16:56,388 --> 00:16:57,268
Not now.

438
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:02,349
Haoming's mom

439
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:03,868
looks down on my background.

440
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:06,108
How else could I marry him?

441
00:17:12,788 --> 00:17:15,189
I've seen the girls she picked for him.

442
00:17:16,229 --> 00:17:17,429
They're all exceptional.

443
00:17:18,828 --> 00:17:20,669
I know you find it despicable.

444
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:22,308
I admit I'm at fault.

445
00:17:23,508 --> 00:17:24,389
But you don't know

446
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:26,548
what I've been through,

447
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:28,348
and can't understand my choices.

448
00:17:29,828 --> 00:17:31,068
All I can say is that

449
00:17:31,588 --> 00:17:33,268
before meeting Shen Haoming,

450
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:35,149
my life was colorless.

451
00:17:35,949 --> 00:17:36,748
He's the only one

452
00:17:36,748 --> 00:17:38,028
willing to look after me.

453
00:17:38,588 --> 00:17:39,588
The only one.

454
00:17:47,748 --> 00:17:49,229
You may have a thousand excuses,

455
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:50,629
but lying is wrong.

456
00:17:54,229 --> 00:17:56,189
If I told the truth,

457
00:17:57,669 --> 00:17:59,709
they'd force me to break up with him.

458
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:02,869
Everything I've worked so hard for

459
00:18:04,469 --> 00:18:05,429
in Jingzhou

460
00:18:06,189 --> 00:18:07,909
would vanish instantly.

461
00:18:08,308 --> 00:18:09,189
Haven't I worked hard?

462
00:18:10,268 --> 00:18:12,068
Yes, I have. But what's the point?

463
00:18:16,548 --> 00:18:17,748
That's why I refuse

464
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:19,149
to go back to being

465
00:18:20,588 --> 00:18:22,268
that disposable young lady

466
00:18:23,788 --> 00:18:24,949
everyone looked down on.

467
00:18:31,949 --> 00:18:33,709
Life only has a few turning points.

468
00:18:34,308 --> 00:18:35,508
If we seize them,

469
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,909
everything falls into place.

470
00:18:38,629 --> 00:18:40,028
But if we miss those chances,

471
00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:42,229
we can't possibly turn the tide.

472
00:18:49,508 --> 00:18:50,629
Either I lose everything,

473
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:51,348
or

474
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:53,389
gain everything.

475
00:18:57,869 --> 00:18:58,629
Do you love him?

476
00:18:59,828 --> 00:19:01,709
Or are you just

477
00:19:01,748 --> 00:19:03,469
a complete fraud after his money?

478
00:19:06,348 --> 00:19:08,028
I want both career and love.

479
00:19:09,989 --> 00:19:12,669
Why do we have to be poor

480
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:13,748
to prove our love?

481
00:19:17,828 --> 00:19:19,629
If you insist on exposing me...

482
00:19:23,248 --> 00:19:23,918

(Video Call, Audio Call)

484
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,788
I can't change your mind.

485
00:19:34,949 --> 00:19:37,189
But I can't watch you go down that path.

486
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:38,828
I won't come again.

go down that path.)

490
00:20:42,229 --> 00:20:43,149
Hello? What's up?

491
00:20:44,028 --> 00:20:44,508
Yan.

492
00:20:45,348 --> 00:20:47,429
We've confirmed our guest list.

493
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:49,709
But I took a look at your list.

494
00:20:50,508 --> 00:20:51,989
Your dad, your mom,

495
00:20:52,308 --> 00:20:53,508
Huanhuan, and Mr. Zhou.

496
00:20:53,709 --> 00:20:55,229
Four people. Isn't that too few?

497
00:20:57,268 --> 00:20:59,189
My parents live abroad and rarely

498
00:20:59,788 --> 00:21:01,028
visit any relatives.

499
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:05,028
If we suddenly reach out
for the wedding,

500
00:21:06,068 --> 00:21:08,348
it'll look like
we're just after gift money.

501
00:21:08,629 --> 00:21:09,149
Right?

502
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:10,669
Got it.

503
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:14,308
When are we bringing Grandma over?

504
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:16,869
Let's bring her here soon.

505
00:21:17,189 --> 00:21:18,869
Let her enjoy her time in Jingzhou.

506
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:24,308
I'll ask her about it when I go back.

507
00:21:25,828 --> 00:21:27,949
You know she has aged.

508
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:30,709
I'll go with you.

509
00:21:32,548 --> 00:21:34,348
You have so much work.

510
00:21:34,788 --> 00:21:35,189
Next time,

511
00:21:35,508 --> 00:21:36,788
we'll go together, okay?

512
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:40,028
I really want to see her.

513
00:21:40,748 --> 00:21:42,588
But I already promised to spend

514
00:21:42,588 --> 00:21:44,108
some days with her this time.

515
00:21:44,588 --> 00:21:46,068
If you come along,

516
00:21:46,189 --> 00:21:47,709
it'll disrupt our plans.

517
00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:48,429
Right?

518
00:21:49,588 --> 00:21:50,149
Got it.

519
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,068

Mr. Gao.

Grandma said

544
00:24:14,108 --> 00:24:15,869
you went to work
as a tailor in the city.

545
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:17,548
Why did you come back?

546
00:24:18,068 --> 00:24:19,469
That was years ago.

Our village is better than the city now.

548
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:23,788
I started a small orchard,

549
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:25,189
opened a tavern,

550
00:24:25,469 --> 00:24:26,629
and leased a fishing pond.

551
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:29,268
I sometimes host fruit-picking groups

552
00:24:29,828 --> 00:24:30,832
and fishing enthusiasts.

553
00:24:31,108 --> 00:24:32,828

I...

558
00:24:41,348 --> 00:24:43,229
I'm not a chef.

559
00:24:43,629 --> 00:24:45,268
I run a food show.

560
00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:47,508

561
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:49,308
- Like those on TV?
- Yeah.

00:25:46,068 --> 00:25:47,709
It looks so dangerous.

575
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:50,548
What's so dangerous about it?

576
00:25:51,189 --> 00:25:52,348
Alright.

577
00:25:53,869 --> 00:25:55,068
Let me do it. Sit down.

578
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:56,588
There's been more rain

579
00:25:56,629 --> 00:25:58,149
and it's been colder this year.

580
00:25:58,588 --> 00:25:59,949
I'm worried

581
00:25:59,949 --> 00:26:01,429
these osmanthus flowers

582
00:26:02,028 --> 00:26:03,149
won't get picked in time.

583
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:04,629
Then we won't get to make

584
00:26:04,669 --> 00:26:06,028
nice osmanthus jam.

585
00:26:06,508 --> 00:26:07,949
I'll pick them. Don't worry.

586
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:08,949
Just sit tight.

587
00:26:09,709 --> 00:26:11,108
Didn't I tell you?

588
00:26:11,748 --> 00:26:12,869
When no one's home,

589
00:26:12,949 --> 00:26:14,068
don't stand so high up.

590
00:26:14,068 --> 00:26:15,028
It's dangerous.

591
00:26:15,268 --> 00:26:16,869
But I'm using the stool.

592
00:26:17,548 --> 00:26:18,828
That's even worse.

593
00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:23,989
You're still good at this.

594
00:26:25,949 --> 00:26:26,588
You remember.

595
00:26:26,788 --> 00:26:27,828
Of course.

596
00:26:28,229 --> 00:26:29,389
How could I forget the skills

597
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,268
you taught me?

598
00:26:34,828 --> 00:26:35,709
Is everything okay?

599
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:36,588
Yeah.

600
00:26:36,788 --> 00:26:37,389
Really?

601
00:26:37,508 --> 00:26:39,268
It's even better now that you're back.

602
00:26:42,588 --> 00:26:43,348
Yan.

603
00:26:43,348 --> 00:26:46,308
I learned how to make pan-seared cod.

604
00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:48,548
I'll cook it for you next time.

605
00:26:50,189 --> 00:26:51,508
Why don't you try

606
00:26:51,508 --> 00:26:55,028
the mixed fruit platter
I made for you first?

607
00:26:55,709 --> 00:26:56,028
Here.

608
00:26:56,989 --> 00:26:57,548
My child.

609
00:26:58,028 --> 00:26:58,869
It's a huge plate.

610
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:00,669
Can we finish all this?

611
00:27:01,028 --> 00:27:01,669
No worries.

612
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:03,229
We can put them in the fridge.

613
00:27:05,788 --> 00:27:06,268
Sweet, huh?

614
00:27:12,709 --> 00:27:15,669
This apple must be homegrown.

615
00:27:16,028 --> 00:27:17,548
Homegrown apples are the best.

616
00:27:19,548 --> 00:27:20,028
So tasty.

617
00:27:23,229 --> 00:27:23,748
Grandma.

618
00:27:24,548 --> 00:27:26,028
Remember that boyfriend

619
00:27:26,028 --> 00:27:27,508
I told you about?

620
00:27:28,788 --> 00:27:29,469
Of course.

621
00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:30,989
You mention him

622
00:27:31,028 --> 00:27:31,909
every time you call.

623
00:27:32,469 --> 00:27:33,748
Things are going well.

624
00:27:35,189 --> 00:27:36,949
I've met his family.

625
00:27:37,588 --> 00:27:38,869
So we're planning

626
00:27:39,588 --> 00:27:41,429
to get married next month.

627
00:27:45,788 --> 00:27:47,068
How could you keep

628
00:27:47,068 --> 00:27:48,949
such happy news from me until now?

629
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:53,229
Yan,

630
00:27:55,989 --> 00:27:57,709
I've finally lived to see you

631
00:27:58,108 --> 00:27:59,709
getting married.

632
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:03,548
I've been waiting for this moment.

633
00:28:05,348 --> 00:28:06,548
I'm so happy.

634
00:28:14,189 --> 00:28:14,909
What's wrong?

635
00:28:18,189 --> 00:28:19,389
Is something bothering you?

636
00:28:27,348 --> 00:28:27,869
I knew it.

637
00:28:28,508 --> 00:28:29,949
Nothing escapes you.

638
00:28:34,229 --> 00:28:35,389
Mom and Dad went to Jingzhou.

639
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:41,949
You know that

640
00:28:43,828 --> 00:28:45,828
I've never been close to them.

641
00:28:47,389 --> 00:28:49,268
So I don't want them at my wedding.

642
00:28:49,909 --> 00:28:51,909
I won't invite them.

643
00:28:52,989 --> 00:28:54,469
But if I tell them that,

644
00:28:55,028 --> 00:28:56,389
given Dad's temper,

645
00:28:57,828 --> 00:28:58,989
he'll make trouble.

646
00:29:01,189 --> 00:29:03,028
But my wedding's next month...

647
00:29:05,748 --> 00:29:06,389
Grandma.

648
00:29:07,348 --> 00:29:08,828
I know what to do.

649
00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:12,108
I'll ask them to come back.

650
00:29:13,709 --> 00:29:15,828
They won't go there again.

651
00:29:19,028 --> 00:29:19,629
Yan,

652
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:23,949
you've been struggling
in the city alone.

653
00:29:24,709 --> 00:29:26,748
I know better than anyone

654
00:29:28,229 --> 00:29:29,669
how much you've suffered.

655
00:29:31,348 --> 00:29:31,989
So

656
00:29:32,629 --> 00:29:34,069
your wedding

657
00:29:35,248 --> 00:29:36,949
will be

658
00:29:37,989 --> 00:29:39,068
proper,

659
00:29:39,308 --> 00:29:40,348
splendid,

660
00:29:41,709 --> 00:29:42,989
and beautiful.

661
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:01,108
Grandma,

662
00:30:05,629 --> 00:30:06,989
Jingzhou's too far.

663
00:30:11,869 --> 00:30:13,068
It's a huge trip for you.

664
00:30:20,508 --> 00:30:21,469
Exactly.

665
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:23,788
You know I've aged.

666
00:30:24,068 --> 00:30:25,949
With these old legs,

667
00:30:26,068 --> 00:30:28,108
traveling all the way

668
00:30:28,389 --> 00:30:29,389
back and forth...

669
00:30:29,989 --> 00:30:30,909
I can't do it.

670
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,469
My bones would rattle apart.

671
00:30:34,108 --> 00:30:34,909
Yan.

672
00:30:35,308 --> 00:30:35,828
Really.

673
00:30:36,389 --> 00:30:38,629
I won't go to Jingzhou.

674
00:30:38,709 --> 00:30:40,268
After the wedding,

675
00:30:40,629 --> 00:30:42,189
keep a copy of your wedding photo.

676
00:30:42,348 --> 00:30:45,748
Bring it when you visit again.

677
00:30:46,068 --> 00:30:46,508
Okay?

678
00:30:46,629 --> 00:30:47,709
I'll hang it in my room

679
00:30:47,788 --> 00:30:49,028
and see you kids every day.

680
00:30:50,068 --> 00:30:52,108
That'll make me happy.

681
00:30:54,189 --> 00:30:57,709
I can't travel with these old legs.

682
00:30:57,828 --> 00:30:58,508
At night,

683
00:30:58,629 --> 00:30:59,748
they swell up.

684
00:31:00,028 --> 00:31:00,828
Imagine me

685
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:02,548
in a strange city,

686
00:31:03,308 --> 00:31:05,389
while you're celebrating...

687
00:31:05,828 --> 00:31:07,108
If I fall ill there,

688
00:31:07,268 --> 00:31:09,108
I'd cause you so much trouble.

689
00:31:09,469 --> 00:31:10,429
No, I won't go there.

690
00:31:10,629 --> 00:31:11,508
I'm not going.

691
00:31:11,588 --> 00:31:12,588
I'll stay

692
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,709
and wait for your good news.

693
00:31:15,508 --> 00:31:17,629
What if I end up...

694
00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:21,788
You'll be overwhelmed.

695
00:31:21,788 --> 00:31:22,949
Sit tight.

696
00:31:23,788 --> 00:31:25,828
Really. I...

697
00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:27,268
Look.

698
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:28,788
Every night,

699
00:31:28,869 --> 00:31:30,268
my legs swell up.

700
00:31:30,308 --> 00:31:30,949
Press here.

701
00:31:31,229 --> 00:31:32,189
It sinks right in.

702
00:31:32,788 --> 00:31:34,028
Stop massaging me.

703
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:35,469
Just a bit more.

704
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:36,469
Come on.

705
00:31:37,989 --> 00:31:38,748
That's enough.

706
00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:41,469
Should I prepare a foot bath for you?

707
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:42,828
Alright.

708
00:32:43,869 --> 00:32:46,588
Aren't you putting fruit in the fridge?

709
00:32:46,629 --> 00:32:47,308
Why...

710
00:32:51,189 --> 00:32:52,949
Why are you crying?

711
00:32:54,548 --> 00:32:55,508
What's wrong?

712
00:32:58,909 --> 00:32:59,588
What happened?

713
00:33:03,389 --> 00:33:05,348
I haven't been home for so long.

714
00:33:07,469 --> 00:33:09,828
I can't finish all this osmanthus jam.

715
00:33:11,108 --> 00:33:12,909
Do you know why I've been making

716
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,508
so much sweet osmanthus jam for you

717
00:33:14,508 --> 00:33:15,989
since you were a kid?

718
00:33:16,229 --> 00:33:17,508

00:43:32,628 --> 00:43:34,148
(Only by becoming strong)

958
00:43:34,309 --> 00:43:35,829
(can I achieve permanent success.)

959
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:38,349
(Only by achieving all goals)

960
00:43:39,188 --> 00:43:41,068
(can I make up for all my mistakes)

961
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:42,508
(and make up)

962
00:43:43,269 --> 00:43:44,548
(to those I've let down.)

963
00:44:08,309 --> 00:44:09,789
Is the risk analysis

964
00:44:10,389 --> 00:44:11,708
on Plot 178 ready?

965
00:44:12,068 --> 00:44:12,668
Mr. Shen.

966
00:44:13,949 --> 00:44:14,749
I'm Fang Lei.

967
00:44:15,269 --> 00:44:16,429
I'll present

968
00:44:16,469 --> 00:44:17,508
the risk assessment report

969
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:18,548
on Plot 178.

970
00:44:20,188 --> 00:44:20,588
Mr. Shen,

971
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:23,148
she's new to the investment
strategy department.

972
00:44:29,989 --> 00:44:30,588
Let's start.

973
00:44:32,148 --> 00:44:34,389
There are four major
risks for this plot.

974
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:35,108
First,

975
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:36,389
the auctioned land

976
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:37,989
has existing encumbrances.

977
00:44:38,508 --> 00:44:39,909
There are two bank mortgages

978
00:44:40,188 --> 00:44:41,309
and objection registrations.

979
00:44:41,668 --> 00:44:42,588
If we don't clarify

980
00:44:42,749 --> 00:44:44,668
property rights before bidding,

981
00:44:45,028 --> 00:44:47,269
they might eventually become our debts.

982
00:44:48,028 --> 00:44:48,508
Second,

983
00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:51,028
according to the government's
new planning policy,

984
00:44:51,508 --> 00:44:52,749
the land's lease term

985
00:44:53,068 --> 00:44:54,309
may be adjusted.

986
00:45:01,389 --> 00:45:01,989
Lisa.

987
00:45:02,108 --> 00:45:02,469
Bye.

988
00:45:02,588 --> 00:45:02,989
Let's go.

989
00:45:05,309 --> 00:45:06,269
Fang Lei, see you.

990
00:45:06,628 --> 00:45:07,668
- Bye.
- Bye.

991
00:45:08,588 --> 00:45:09,269
Bye, Mr. Shen.

992
00:45:09,389 --> 00:45:09,909
Bye.

993
00:45:10,389 --> 00:45:10,989
Mr. Shen.

994
00:45:16,389 --> 00:45:18,869
Why did you suddenly come back

995
00:45:19,269 --> 00:45:20,188
and join our company?

996
00:45:20,628 --> 00:45:21,989
Isn't it a pleasant surprise

997
00:45:22,668 --> 00:45:23,829
for you?

998
00:45:25,548 --> 00:45:27,188
Or perhaps you are not happy

999
00:45:28,188 --> 00:45:29,108
to see me?

1000
00:45:30,668 --> 00:45:32,989
You have to readjust to many things.

1001
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:35,749
If I have any problems at work,

1002
00:45:36,228 --> 00:45:37,429
can I consult you?

1003
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:40,148
The HR policies require you

1004
00:45:40,469 --> 00:45:42,028
to report to your direct supervisor.

1005
00:45:43,628 --> 00:45:44,749
I was just kidding.

1006
00:45:46,429 --> 00:45:46,989
Haoming.

1007
00:45:48,309 --> 00:45:49,548
Do you remember this jacket?

1008
00:45:55,749 --> 00:45:56,789
You won this as a prize

1009
00:45:57,148 --> 00:45:58,749
at the collegiate kayak championship

1010
00:45:58,789 --> 00:45:59,869
during your sophomore year.

1011
00:46:00,668 --> 00:46:01,668
I said I liked it,

1012
00:46:01,749 --> 00:46:03,508
and you gave it to me
without hesitation.

1013
00:46:03,909 --> 00:46:04,749
I was so happy.

1014
00:46:05,068 --> 00:46:06,869
So I took this photo as a memento.

1015
00:46:08,389 --> 00:46:09,389
I didn't give it to you.

1016
00:46:09,869 --> 00:46:10,789
You snatched it.

1017
00:46:12,588 --> 00:46:13,588
So you remember.

1018
00:46:16,749 --> 00:46:18,789
I remember everything you said, too.

1019
00:46:20,309 --> 00:46:22,469
When you left London, you told me

1020
00:46:23,628 --> 00:46:25,028
to focus on my studies there

1021
00:46:25,588 --> 00:46:27,508
and return after graduation.

1022
00:46:28,749 --> 00:46:29,349
Now,

1023
00:46:30,909 --> 00:46:31,668
