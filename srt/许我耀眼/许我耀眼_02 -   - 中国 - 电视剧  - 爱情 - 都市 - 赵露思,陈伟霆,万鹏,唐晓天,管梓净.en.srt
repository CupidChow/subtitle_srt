our entire project

108
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,888

I feared you'd keep bleeding,

00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,100

Bu is truly clever.

148
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,100

dog show.

150
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,660
I'm terribly sorry

151
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:20,859
for being late.

Do you like dogs?

I love dogs very much.

170
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,420
Do you have a dog now?

171
00:09:03,739 --> 00:09:05,019
My work keeps me too busy,

172
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,499
so I haven't had time to keep one.

173
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:08,656
I'm afraid I can't take care of them.

174
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,580
It barked.

175
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:13,180

Our Pudding here

178
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:19,779
is just a silly dog.

179
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:21,100
It's nothing,

180
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,220
but looks good.

181
00:09:25,744 --> 00:09:26,340
It's fine.

182
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,259
Nonsense. It's quite clever.

183
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:29,100
Pudding's great.

184
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:29,739
Come on.

185
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,139
Do you want to go play too?

186
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,259
Hui,

187
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,220

00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:53,460
Okay.

193
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,859
Let me make you a braid.

194
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,379
Miss Xu.

195
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,259
I think

196
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,180
you're different

197
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,019
from the ladies coming

198
00:10:21,859 --> 00:10:22,499
to this place.

199
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:27,300
What's different?

200
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,379
Your hair looks dry and frizzy.

201
00:10:42,672 --> 00:10:43,420
Ms. Yu and others

202
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,100
really prioritize hair care.

203
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,300
My work keeps me too occupied

204
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,539
to tend to it properly.

205
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:57,940
They

206
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,379
regularly get this

207
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:00,420
special hair treatment.

208
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:01,659
Afterward,

209
00:11:01,739 --> 00:11:03,300
their hair shines like satin.

210
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:04,220
It's very popular.

211
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:06,460
Even Ms. Ma and Ms. Sun

212
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,460
go regularly.

213
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,980
You should try it too.

214
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:09,940
Hui.

215
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,420
Ms. Yu.

216
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:13,820
Is the tea ready?

217
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,580
It's ready.

218
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:25,420
Let the staff handle it.

219
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:28,259
Thanks.

220
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:29,552
You're welcome.

221
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:33,180
Miss Xu,

222
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,379
stay for dinner?

223
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,060
Okay.

224
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,779
I've ordered dishes from the club.

225
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:42,300
When they're ready,

226
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,100
go collect them.

227
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,304
Exit and turn right.

228
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,259
You'll find it.

229
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,259
If it's a club,

230
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,659
maybe we can have them deliver it?

231
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:53,340
I don't like

232
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,576
strangers coming to my house.

233
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:00,820
Okay.

234
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:05,139
Then I'll go get them now.

235
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:12,940
Miss Xu.

236
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,220
It's crowded today.

237
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,019
We can't really chat properly.

238
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,180
Later,

239
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,180
after you bring the food,

240
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,300
just give them to the nanny.

241
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,100
You can go now.

242
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:25,060
I'll let Haoming know.

243
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:36,379
Okay.

244
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,739
Are you free Saturday morning?

245
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:41,899
Yes.

246
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:42,779
Good.

247
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,019
I'll pick the place.

248
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:45,700
Let's talk?

249
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:19,139
Come in.

250
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:21,739
Sir,

251
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,340
the proposal for the next episode

252
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:24,100
is here for you.

253
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:26,859
Xu,

254
00:13:27,619 --> 00:13:28,300
have a seat.

255
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:35,340
Sit.

256
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:36,820
Xu,

257
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,180
during your interview,

258
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,139
I spotted your potential at once.

259
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,779
Since you joined us,

260
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:44,779
I've invested much effort
in mentoring you.

261
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:47,499
I have high expectations for you.

262
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,400
Come on.

263
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,859
I know that, sir.

264
00:13:50,859 --> 00:13:51,460
So I've always

265
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:52,420
been grateful to you.

266
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:54,420
No need for thanks.

267
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,300
Xu.

268
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,499
Over these years,

269
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,580
food shows have been popular.

270
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,779
I assigned you to develop

271
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:03,980
the Family Feast,

272
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:06,259
so you could polish your resume,

273
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,019
move up,

274
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,180
and become a host later.

275
00:14:11,859 --> 00:14:12,340
Look.

276
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,019
You have great presence,

277
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:15,539
intelligence,

278
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,460
and diligence.

279
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:21,100
But sometimes,

280
00:14:22,619 --> 00:14:23,739
things don't go as planned.

281
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:26,864
Your application to become a host

282
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,779
was rejected.

283
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,100
Why?

284
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:33,060
Why what?

285
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,139
Because I remember

286
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:36,259
you previously told me...

287
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:36,659
Xu,

288
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,619
sit down.

289
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:39,820
S-Sit down first.

290
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,539
Mr. Zhou,

291
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,779
when I first came here,

292
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,940
I applied to be a host.

293
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:50,580
Yes, yes.

294
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,139
Is that right?

295
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:51,580
Yes, yes.

296
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,739
You said I lacked experience

297
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,739
and needed more.

298
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,420
So I took on planning

299
00:14:57,619 --> 00:14:58,259
for three years.

300
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,460
Yes, yes.

301
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,499
When I first started Family Feast,

302
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:06,259
there were only

303
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:07,539
these two words on the proposal.

304
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,220
Launching the project,

305
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:10,980
inviting guests,

306
00:15:11,659 --> 00:15:12,539
conducting interviews,

307
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:14,220
filming, post-production,
and subtitles...

308
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:14,779
One by one,

309
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:15,940
I checked them all.

310
00:15:17,539 --> 00:15:18,100
I understand

311
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,700
shows aren't made through theory.

312
00:15:19,739 --> 00:15:21,259
So I paid to learn cooking myself.

313
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,019
I wanted to upgrade

314
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,499
the show's ingredients.

315
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,259
I even used my own salary.

316
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:28,460
Family Feast has run
for three years now.

317
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,800
I earn it with countless overtime hours

318
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:32,100
and late nights.

319
00:15:33,859 --> 00:15:34,779
So I want to know

320
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:37,499
why?

321
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:39,980
Xu,

322
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,259
you can't accept it.

323
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:43,739
I understand.

324
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,340
I also know you've worked hard

325
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:47,619
and sacrificed a lot.

326
00:15:48,499 --> 00:15:50,499
But the leadership
has their own considerations.

327
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,259
Stop obsessing over this.

328
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,420
I'm not obsessing.

329
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,300
What am I lacking?

330
00:15:56,899 --> 00:15:57,700
I can learn.

331
00:15:59,220 --> 00:15:59,940
Let me be direct.

332
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:01,700
Our program department

333
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,139
is committed to media integration
and transformation.

334
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:06,700
Staff allocations
for subordinate departments

335
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:07,820
and production budgets

336
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,899
have been largely reduced.

337
00:16:09,619 --> 00:16:10,640
At this critical moment,

338
00:16:10,739 --> 00:16:12,019
adjustments to host positions

339
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:14,420
require comprehensive evaluation
of all factors.

340
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:16,739
I advocated for you.

341
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,379
If Sun Siwei

342
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,580
is unavailable,

343
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:20,779
you'll step in.

344
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:26,739
Three years, sir.

345
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,060
Now I only get

346
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,899
a disposable temp position?

347
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,060
Don't say that.

348
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,499
Xu,

349
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,340
I know you're upset.

350
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:42,100
But Sun Siwei's performance
has been excellent.

351
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:43,859
The leadership has decided

352
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,899
to keep Sun Siwei as the host.

353
00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:48,139
This wasn't solely my decision.

354
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,460
When the time is right,

355
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,739
you can get back on the starting line.

356
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,072
Isn't that enough?

357
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:56,539
Only by staying on the starting line

358
00:16:58,659 --> 00:16:59,859
will I get the chance to run.

359
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:03,460
Xu...

360
00:17:16,131 --> 00:17:21,904
(Ms. Yu calling)

361
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:26,339
Hello, Ms. Yu?

362
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:28,420
The restaurant location and time

363
00:17:28,739 --> 00:17:29,819
were sent to your phone.

364
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:30,620
Okay.

365
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:40,900
Madam,

366
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:41,900
the hair treatment

367
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,620
you requested.

368
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,940
But there's no discount.

369
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:44,779
Is that okay?

370
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:49,499
Okay.

371
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,420
Please wait.

372
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,184
I'll prepare it.

373
00:17:52,579 --> 00:17:53,299
That lady

374
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,499
wants the full treatment.

375
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:56,144
We need to prepare accordingly.

376
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,059
Gather the supplies.

377
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:14,739
Good afternoon.

378
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:28,860
Ms. Yu.

379
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:29,980
Please sit.

380
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,180
Feel free.

381
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:32,700
Would you like

382
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,499
something to drink?

383
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:36,460
Not yet.

384
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:37,819
I'm waiting for a friend.

385
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:39,380
Okay.

386
00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:41,620
We'll order together

387
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,768
when your friend arrives.

388
00:18:48,739 --> 00:18:49,339
Ms. Yu.

389
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,099
Jiaqi, over here.

390
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:53,099
Ms. Yu,

391
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,620
it's been so long.

392
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:55,420
Indeed.

393
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,620
You look radiant as ever.

394
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,059
Let me introduce you.

395
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:02,420
This is Lin Jiaqi,

396
00:19:02,499 --> 00:19:03,539
from investment banking.

397
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:04,620
And this is Xu Yan,

398
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,779
Haoming's friend.

399
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:07,259
Hello.

400
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,299
Hi.

401
00:19:08,499 --> 00:19:09,424
Pleasure to meet you.

402
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,460
Jiaqi,

403
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,860
I heard you were thriving

404
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,180
on Wall Street.

405
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,992
What brought you back suddenly?

406
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,339
It was my father's wish.

407
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,420
After so many years,

408
00:19:22,499 --> 00:19:23,728
he should be satisfied now.

409
00:19:23,792 --> 00:19:25,900
Recently, I received
an offer from Hong Kong, China.

410
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,779
The terms were good.

411
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:27,460
So I returned.

412
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:30,940
Domestic opportunities
are promising now.

413
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,259
By the way,

414
00:19:32,259 --> 00:19:33,620
about Dewei's project,

415
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,420
thank you for helping select partners.

416
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,620
My pleasure.

417
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,180
You and Mr. Shen

418
00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:39,700
watched me grow up.

419
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,779
What've you been up to?

420
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:43,620
I just got back recently,

421
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,460
still settling in.

422
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,380
Xu Yan,

423
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,339
Yutong's a rising star in law,

424
00:19:56,819 --> 00:19:58,819
specializing in cross-border M&A
and financing.

425
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:00,299
Now she's working

426
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,739
at her family law firm,

427
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:03,184
handling international cases.

428
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:07,259
Hello.

429
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,180
Yutong,

430
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,779
I met your mother recently

431
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:12,339
and heard you just resolved

432
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,579
a cross-border M&A case.

433
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,420
Impressive work.

434
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:16,339
Let me campaign for myself then.

435
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:17,140
Ms. Yu,

436
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,259
keep me in mind for your

437
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,408
cross-border business.

438
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,380
Absolutely.

439
00:20:20,739 --> 00:20:22,259
I wouldn't trust anyone else.

440
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,660
Miss Xu,

441
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,660
what do you think of these girls?

442
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:37,019
They're good.

443
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:38,980
Lovely and exceptionally talented.

444
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:43,339
Yes.

445
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:45,259
Girls like these

446
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:46,539
suit Haoming best.

447
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,259
I dislike beating around the bush

448
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:50,460
and wasting time.

449
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,940
Your appearance

450
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,259
and education are impressive,

451
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,664
and your job is decent,

452
00:20:58,019 --> 00:20:58,900
but

453
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:01,264
your family isn't that well-off, is it?

454
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,819
Last time, we spent

455
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:15,980
so much time together.

456
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:18,180
You never truly fit in.

457
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:20,099
Yet you didn't complain at all.

458
00:21:21,499 --> 00:21:23,059
Even when I made you fetch takeout,

459
00:21:23,739 --> 00:21:24,819
you stayed composed.

460
00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:26,259
You were slighted

461
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:27,259
and forced to smile.

462
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,660
Just like how,

463
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:32,700
you're still not angry now.

464
00:21:36,499 --> 00:21:37,180
Miss Xu,

465
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:39,460
your flaw

466
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,819
is being too submissive.

467
00:21:42,499 --> 00:21:43,499
You saw it yourself.

468
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,779
Those girls just now all had a kind

469
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,180
of ease, as if nothing really matters

470
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:48,860
to them.

471
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,819
That's what Haoming needs

472
00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:53,220
and what you lack.

473
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,019
You should find someone

474
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:58,779
who truly matches your pace.

475
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,140
(Qiao Yan,)

476
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,059
(an orphan with no parents.)

477
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,499
- An orphan with no parents!
- An orphan with no parents!

478
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,299
- An orphan with no parents!
- An orphan with no parents!

479
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,779
- An orphan with no parents!
- An orphan with no parents!

480
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,779
I'm not!

481
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,499
- The orphan hit someone!
- The orphan hit someone!

482
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,980
- The orphan hit someone!
- The orphan hit someone!

483
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:23,539
I'm not an orphan!

484
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,499
I have parents!

485
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,420
They're abroad

486
00:22:28,499 --> 00:22:30,660
in a faraway land.

487
00:22:30,739 --> 00:22:32,019
- Qiao Yan, the liar!
- Qiao Yan, the liar!

488
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:34,140
- Qiao Yan, the liar!
- Qiao Yan, the liar!

489
00:22:39,579 --> 00:22:40,900
Break up with Haoming now

490
00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:43,180
to avoid humiliation.

491
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:47,900
Syracuse University.

492
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,140
It is where my parents

493
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,900
work overseas.

494
00:22:56,099 --> 00:22:57,339
They taught me since childhood

495
00:22:58,259 --> 00:22:59,860
that composure and good manners

496
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,299
are the basics of courtesy

497
00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:03,819
in any situation.

498
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:07,940
But I never expected

499
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,059
you'd perceive it

500
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:12,739
as timidity or weakness.

501
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,380
My career here

502
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,299
is earned by myself.

503
00:23:16,739 --> 00:23:18,059
I rarely mention my parents.

504
00:23:18,739 --> 00:23:19,940
But in your eyes,

505
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:23,600
it means a poor family background.

506
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,900
All I can say is, you're wrong.

507
00:23:29,499 --> 00:23:30,140
I know

508
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:32,019
you don't like me.

509
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:33,980
That's understandable.

510
00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:36,339
But I love Haoming

511
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,339
and won't leave him.

512
00:24:50,403 --> 00:24:54,096
(Six months later)

513
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:11,728
What's on your mind?

514
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:13,860
Nothing special.

515
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:16,220
Just feel this family

516
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,739
is just odd.

517
00:25:19,339 --> 00:25:20,059
Odd how?

518
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,739
I can't name it.

519
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:25,940
They seem fine to me.

520
00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:26,420
Look,

521
00:25:26,499 --> 00:25:28,299
they're an intellectual family.

522
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,819
Marrying into them

523
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,019
would boost our company's image

524
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:34,620
and other aspects.

525
00:25:35,888 --> 00:25:36,700
Don't overthink it.

526
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,180
I think

527
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,579
our son has a good taste.

528
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,660
Stop overthinking.

529
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,420
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

530
00:25:51,747 --> 00:25:54,083
(New District Development Plan)

531
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,620
Morning.

532
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,420
Morning, Mr. Shen.

533
00:26:03,499 --> 00:26:04,380
Qu hasn't arrived yet?

534
00:26:04,739 --> 00:26:05,739
I haven't told you yet,

535
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:07,700
Mr. Qu isn't feeling well today.

536
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,496
He can't make it.

537
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:09,739
Alright then.

538
00:26:09,739 --> 00:26:11,184
Let's start the meeting without him.

539
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:13,539
Regarding the New District

540
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,059
commercial complex project,

541
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,220
I plan

542
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:18,499
to work with our upstream partner,
Shifeng Group.

543
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,460
They've

544
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,819
expressed

545
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,460
preliminary interest in cooperation.

546
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:24,579
Shifeng

547
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,088
is currently the largest
and best-capitalized

548
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,660
company in the industry.

549
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,700
If we secure partnership

550
00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:31,660
with them,

551
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,819
this project is settled.

552
00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:34,980
We've got a good chance.

553
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,380
Exactly.

554
00:26:48,259 --> 00:26:48,860
Haoming.

555
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:51,180
Dad.

556
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:55,299
You stayed silent during the meeting.

557
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:56,420
Why?

558
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,460
I don't have confidence in Mr. Zheng,

559
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,099
the new Chairman of Shifeng Group.

560
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:01,980
Your reasons?

561
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,140
First,

562
00:27:05,739 --> 00:27:06,700
after the accident

563
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,528
at Shifeng's resettlement housing site,

564
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,579
his response was

565
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:12,460
to conceal it,

566
00:27:12,752 --> 00:27:14,019
suppress public opinion,

567
00:27:14,019 --> 00:27:15,120
and shirk accountability.

568
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:16,579
Second,

569
00:27:16,779 --> 00:27:17,968
he's a parachuted executive,

570
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,339
meaning he lacks

571
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,180
reliable loyalists within Shifeng.

572
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,499
Third,

573
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,339
he brought three confidants.

574
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,059
One has strong networking skills

575
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,779
but is self-righteous,

576
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,259
offending everyone.

577
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:33,220
Another one

578
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:34,779
is senior and experienced,

579
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:37,499
but was playing mahjong

580
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,019
when the accident happened.

581
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:40,980
The third

582
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,579
and lowest-ranked one

583
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,019
is the most competent.

584
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,840
He handles heavy workloads,

585
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:47,900
but suffers unfair profit distribution.

586
00:27:49,819 --> 00:27:50,420
Impressive.

587
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,420
You've dug deep

588
00:27:52,499 --> 00:27:53,460
into their foundation.

589
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:54,539
Dad,

590
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,299
I believe internal turmoil

591
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,980
is inevitable.

592
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:01,499
If you think

593
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:02,539
Zheng

594
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:03,940
has so many flaws,

595
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:05,299
how did he become

596
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:06,299
the Chairman then?

597
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:08,220
That's an even bigger red flag.

598
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,620
Dear Haoming.

599
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,940
In construction,

600
00:28:12,752 --> 00:28:13,620
unless you've worked

601
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,420
from the ground up

602
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:17,420
and fought your way up

603
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,620
through decades

604
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,339
in this industry,

605
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:22,739
you'll never grasp its workings.

606
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:25,819
Understand?

607
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,336
Understood.

608
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,460
Besides,

609
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,900
I want to bid for the New District's

610
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,900
Plot 178 development.

611
00:28:40,579 --> 00:28:41,980
This large company

612
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:43,579
will

613
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,140
be handed to you.

614
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,980
For now,

615
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,339
maintain stability and avoid mistakes.

616
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,339
That's your main task.

617
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:53,940
Clear?

618
00:28:56,539 --> 00:28:57,019
Yes.

619
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,499
A dish to savor, a moment to cherish.

620
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,019
This episode of Family Feast

621
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:01,819
concludes here.

622
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,539
Thank you for watching, everyone.

623
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:03,900
Got it.

624
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,779
See you

625
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:05,539
- next time.
- Next time.

626
00:29:05,819 --> 00:29:06,380
Cut.

627
00:29:07,075 --> 00:29:08,752
(Family Feast)

628
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:12,339
You've worked hard, Siwei.

629
00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:13,299
What process is this?

630
00:29:13,339 --> 00:29:14,220
Recording for so long.

631
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:18,900
Thank you, Mr. Sanmu.

632
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,620
It's way too late.

633
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,620
You've worked hard too.

634
00:29:21,739 --> 00:29:22,220
Xu Yan.

635
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,180
To be honest,

636
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,860
the reason I came here

637
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:26,980
isn't just because of Haoming,

638
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:28,059
but mainly

639
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,460
I was moved by your sincerity.

640
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,579
I was on business in America for a week.

641
00:29:31,579 --> 00:29:32,940
Your messages kept coming nonstop.

642
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,499
And whenever I texted you,

643
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:35,620
you replied right away.

644
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,819
I'm curious.

645
00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:39,579
Do you never sleep?

646
00:29:40,099 --> 00:29:41,460
Sorry for disturbing you.

647
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:43,460
That's how our job works.

648
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:44,739
We're on call 24/7.

649
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,420
So feel free to contact me

650
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,339
for any future issues.

651
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,259
Good.

652
00:29:48,499 --> 00:29:49,019
Good for you.

653
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,779
Next time,
le t's have dinner with Haoming.

654
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,579
No problem.

655
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,380
Must be exhausted.

656
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,299
Get some rest early.

657
00:29:55,539 --> 00:29:55,739
Come.

658
00:29:55,779 --> 00:29:56,099
Okay.

659
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,096
Take Mr. Sanmu
to the guest room to change.

660
00:29:59,380 --> 00:29:59,819
Yan,

661
00:29:59,819 --> 00:30:01,776
the backstage director said
we need close-up shots

662
00:30:01,776 --> 00:30:02,660
of those dishes.

663
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,420
No problem.

664
00:30:05,411 --> 00:30:07,824
(Ms. Yu calling)

665
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,660
Hello, Ms. Yu?

666
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:12,739
Now?

667
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:14,660
But I've got...

668
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:16,940
No problem.

669
00:30:17,739 --> 00:30:19,140
Please send me the address.

670
00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:20,739
Okay.

671
00:30:23,747 --> 00:30:25,584
(Cuijin Royal Garden Sales Office)

672
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:35,700
Thank you.

673
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,220
I'm coming in now, Ms. Yu.

674
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,019
Okay.

675
00:30:45,099 --> 00:30:45,420
This

676
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,140
is the Tongzhou Canal.

677
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:47,860
And

678
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,259
there's a CBD nearby.

679
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:51,019
Sorry I'm late, Ms. Yu.

680
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,940
There was traffic on the way.

681
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,700
We've been waiting.

682
00:30:56,259 --> 00:30:57,140
It wasn't easy

683
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:57,900
to get Ms. Meng

684
00:30:58,059 --> 00:30:59,299
to see the house with us today,

685
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:00,700
yet you kept her waiting.

686
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:01,940
Ms. Meng,

687
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:02,860
my apologies.

688
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:03,539
It's fine.

689
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,779
Let's go take a look then.

690
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,472
- I'm occupied this afternoon.
- Okay.

691
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,339
This entire property

692
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,180
covers an area

693
00:31:16,259 --> 00:31:18,140
of 35,000 square meters.

694
00:31:18,499 --> 00:31:20,460
There are eight buildings in total.

695
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,539
Six garden villas

696
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,860
and two high-rises.

697
00:31:24,499 --> 00:31:26,180
The unit sizes range

698
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:26,940
from 199

699
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:28,380
to 143 square meters.

700
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,499
Ms. Yu,

701
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,860
may I ask

702
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,059
who this house is for?

703
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:32,860
My son.

704
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,032
He's getting married.

705
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,259
Really?

706
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,460
Congratulations, Ms. Yu.

707
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,460
Mr. Shen is marrying so soon?

708
00:31:38,739 --> 00:31:39,779
I wonder which lucky girl

709
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:40,900
gets to be his bride.

710
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,539
How careless of me!

711
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:48,499
Hello, Madam.

712
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,579
I'm Lisa.

713
00:31:49,819 --> 00:31:50,779
If you need anything,

714
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,620
just let me know.

715
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,539
You'll be satisfied.

716
00:31:52,539 --> 00:31:53,460
Thank you.

717
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:53,980
It's okay.

718
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,259
Lisa,

719
00:31:55,259 --> 00:31:57,099
which units did you prepare for me?

720
00:31:57,339 --> 00:31:58,460
I've reserved for you

721
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,140
the prime unit of the entire complex.

722
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,019
Unit 606,

723
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,380
706,

724
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,700
and 808 in Building 6.

725
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,339
These three units

726
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,420
are undoubtedly

727
00:32:07,499 --> 00:32:07,980
the finest

728
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:09,059
and the most spacious.

729
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:10,259
I reserve them all for you.

730
00:32:10,819 --> 00:32:11,380
Madam?

731
00:32:11,819 --> 00:32:12,940
What do you think, Madam?

732
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,299
They're all good.

733
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:19,739
Ms. Yu,

734
00:32:21,499 --> 00:32:22,980
should we ask Haoming's opinion?

735
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:28,980
Miss Xu,

736
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,059
when it comes to buying a marital home,

737
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:33,259
Ms. Yu will make the decision.

738
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,180
You young people

739
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,700
don't have a sense of real estate.

740
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,980
Forget everything else.

741
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,579
Just concerning the orientation

742
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,620
and the floor level,

743
00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:42,220
you surely don't understand, right?

744
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,984
You'll have children
in a few years, right?

745
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,140
Shouldn't you decide

746
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,579
how to lay out the rooms

747
00:32:46,739 --> 00:32:48,059
or what interior style to choose?

748
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,420
This isn't a joke.

749
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,380
If you pick the wrong property,

750
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:53,099
it could severely impact

751
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,420
your married life.

752
00:32:56,539 --> 00:32:57,620
Thank you, Ms. Meng.

753
00:32:58,739 --> 00:33:01,072
When buying the house,
we'll surely follow Ms. Yu's advice.

754
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:03,860
I was just thinking, maybe we should

755
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,499
have Haoming

756
00:33:04,499 --> 00:33:05,460
come take a look too.

757
00:33:05,779 --> 00:33:06,299
No need.

758
00:33:07,739 --> 00:33:08,499
He's too busy.

759
00:33:09,019 --> 00:33:10,220
We'll decide for him.

760
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,339
Okay.

761
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,700
I got it.

762
00:33:16,499 --> 00:33:18,499
Miss Xu, you probably
don't house-hunt often

763
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,499
and lack experience.

764
00:33:20,579 --> 00:33:21,460
But don't worry.

765
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,739
With me here,

766
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:24,339
I'll help you two lovebirds

767
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,380
pick the perfect unit.

768
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:26,220
Thank you.

769
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,180
Don't say that.

770
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,420
We're older now.

771
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,739
We truly don't know
young people's minds.

772
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,339
Xu Yan's father

773
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,539
was an architecture major.

774
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,700
