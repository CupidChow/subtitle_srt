108
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,888

Bu is truly clever.

148
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,100

150
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,660
I'm terribly sorry

151
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:40,859
for being late.

Do you like dogs?

I love dogs very much.

170
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,420
Do you have a dog now?

171
00:09:23,739 --> 00:09:25,019
My work keeps me too busy,

172
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,499
so I haven't had time to keep one.

173
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:28,656
I'm afraid I can't take care of them.

174
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,580
It barked.

175
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:33,180

Our Pudding here

178
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:39,779
is just a silly dog.

179
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:41,100
It's nothing,

180
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,220
but looks good.

181
00:09:45,744 --> 00:09:46,340
It's fine.

182
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,259
Nonsense. It's quite clever.

183
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,100
Pudding's great.

184
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:49,739
Come on.

185
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,139
Do you want to go play too?

186
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,259
Hui,

187
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,220

00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:13,460
Okay.

193
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,859
Let me make you a braid.

194
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,379
Miss Xu.

195
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,259
I think

196
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,180
you're different

197
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,019
from the ladies coming

198
00:10:41,859 --> 00:10:42,499
to this place.

199
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,300
What's different?

200
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,379
Your hair looks dry and frizzy.

201
00:11:02,672 --> 00:11:03,420
Ms. Yu and others

202
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,100
really prioritize hair care.

203
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,300
My work keeps me too occupied

204
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,539
to tend to it properly.

205
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:17,940
They

206
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,379
regularly get this

207
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,420
special hair treatment.

208
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:21,659
Afterward,

209
00:11:21,739 --> 00:11:23,300
their hair shines like satin.

210
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:24,220
It's very popular.

211
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:26,460
Even Ms. Ma and Ms. Sun

212
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:27,460
go regularly.

213
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,980
You should try it too.

214
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:29,940
Hui.

215
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,420
Ms. Yu.

216
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:33,820
Is the tea ready?

217
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,580
It's ready.

218
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:45,420
Let the staff handle it.

219
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:48,259
Thanks.

220
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:49,552
You're welcome.

221
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:53,180
Miss Xu,

222
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,379
stay for dinner?

223
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,060
Okay.

224
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,779
I've ordered dishes from the club.

225
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:02,300
When they're ready,

226
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,100
go collect them.

227
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,304
Exit and turn right.

228
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,259
You'll find it.

229
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,259
If it's a club,

230
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,659
maybe we can have them deliver it?

231
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:13,340
I don't like

232
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,576
strangers coming to my house.

233
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:20,820
Okay.

234
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:25,139
Then I'll go get them now.

235
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:32,940
Miss Xu.

236
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,220
It's crowded today.

237
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,019
We can't really chat properly.

238
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,180
Later,

239
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,180
after you bring the food,

240
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,300
just give them to the nanny.

241
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,100
You can go now.

242
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,060
I'll let Haoming know.

243
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:56,379
Okay.

244
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,739
Are you free Saturday morning?

245
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:01,899
Yes.

246
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:02,779
Good.

247
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,019
I'll pick the place.

248
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:05,700
Let's talk?

249
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:39,139
Come in.

250
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:41,739
Sir,

251
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,340
the proposal for the next episode

252
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:44,100
is here for you.

253
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:46,859
Xu,

254
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:48,300
have a seat.

255
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,340
Sit.

256
00:13:56,259 --> 00:13:56,820
Xu,

257
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,180
during your interview,

258
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,139
I spotted your potential at once.

259
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,779
Since you joined us,

260
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:04,779
I've invested much effort
in mentoring you.

261
00:14:05,859 --> 00:14:07,499
I have high expectations for you.

262
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,400
Come on.

263
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,859
I know that, sir.

264
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:11,460
So I've always

265
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:12,420
been grateful to you.

266
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:14,420
No need for thanks.

267
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,300
Xu.

268
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,499
Over these years,

269
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,580
food shows have been popular.

270
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,779
I assigned you to develop

271
00:14:22,859 --> 00:14:23,980
the Family Feast,

272
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:26,259
so you could polish your resume,

273
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,019
move up,

274
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,180
and become a host later.

275
00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:32,340
Look.

276
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,019
You have great presence,

277
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:35,539
intelligence,

278
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,460
and diligence.

279
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:41,100
But sometimes,

280
00:14:42,619 --> 00:14:43,739
things don't go as planned.

281
00:14:45,499 --> 00:14:46,864
Your application to become a host

282
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,779
was rejected.

283
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,100
Why?

284
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:53,060
Why what?

285
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,139
Because I remember

286
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:56,259
you previously told me...

287
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:56,659
Xu,

288
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,619
sit down.

289
00:14:58,739 --> 00:14:59,820
S-Sit down first.

290
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,539
Mr. Zhou,

291
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,779
when I first came here,

292
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,940
I applied to be a host.

293
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:10,580
Yes, yes.

294
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,139
Is that right?

295
00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:11,580
Yes, yes.

296
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,739
You said I lacked experience

297
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,739
and needed more.

298
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,420
So I took on planning

299
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:18,259
for three years.

300
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,460
Yes, yes.

301
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,499
When I first started Family Feast,

302
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:26,259
there were only

303
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,539
these two words on the proposal.

304
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,220
Launching the project,

305
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:30,980
inviting guests,

306
00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:32,539
conducting interviews,

307
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:34,220
filming, post-production,
and subtitles...

308
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:34,779
One by one,

309
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:35,940
I checked them all.

310
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:38,100
I understand

311
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,700
shows aren't made through theory.

312
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:41,259
So I paid to learn cooking myself.

313
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,019
I wanted to upgrade

314
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,499
the show's ingredients.

315
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,259
I even used my own salary.

316
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,460
Family Feast has run
for three years now.

317
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,800
I earn it with countless overtime hours

318
00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:52,100
and late nights.

319
00:15:53,859 --> 00:15:54,779
So I want to know

320
00:15:57,019 --> 00:15:57,499
why?

321
00:15:59,420 --> 00:15:59,980
Xu,

322
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,259
you can't accept it.

323
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:03,739
I understand.

324
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,340
I also know you've worked hard

325
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:07,619
and sacrificed a lot.

326
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:10,499
But the leadership
has their own considerations.

327
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,259
Stop obsessing over this.

328
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,420
I'm not obsessing.

329
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,300
What am I lacking?

330
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:17,700
I can learn.

331
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:19,940
Let me be direct.

332
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:21,700
Our program department

333
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,139
is committed to media integration
and transformation.

334
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:26,700
Staff allocations
for subordinate departments

335
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:27,820
and production budgets

336
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,899
have been largely reduced.

337
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:30,640
At this critical moment,

338
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,019
adjustments to host positions

339
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,420
require comprehensive evaluation
of all factors.

340
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:36,739
I advocated for you.

341
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,379
If Sun Siwei

342
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,580
is unavailable,

343
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:40,779
you'll step in.

344
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:46,739
Three years, sir.

345
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,060
Now I only get

346
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,899
a disposable temp position?

347
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,060
Don't say that.

348
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,499
Xu,

349
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,340
I know you're upset.

350
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:02,100
But Sun Siwei's performance
has been excellent.

351
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:03,859
The leadership has decided

352
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,899
to keep Sun Siwei as the host.

353
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,139
This wasn't solely my decision.

354
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,460
When the time is right,

355
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,739
you can get back on the starting line.

356
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,072
Isn't that enough?

357
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:16,539
Only by staying on the starting line

358
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:19,859
will I get the chance to run.

359
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,460
Xu...

360
00:17:36,131 --> 00:17:41,904
(Ms. Yu calling)

361
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:46,339
Hello, Ms. Yu?

362
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:48,420
The restaurant location and time

363
00:17:48,739 --> 00:17:49,819
were sent to your phone.

364
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:50,620
Okay.

365
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:00,900
Madam,

366
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:01,900
the hair treatment

367
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,620
you requested.

368
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,940
But there's no discount.

369
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:04,779
Is that okay?

370
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:09,499
Okay.

371
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,420
Please wait.

372
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,184
I'll prepare it.

373
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:13,299
That lady

374
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,499
wants the full treatment.

375
00:18:14,739 --> 00:18:16,144
We need to prepare accordingly.

376
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,059
Gather the supplies.

377
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:34,739
Good afternoon.

378
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:48,860
Ms. Yu.

379
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:49,980
Please sit.

380
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,180
Feel free.

381
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:52,700
Would you like

382
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,499
something to drink?

383
00:18:55,739 --> 00:18:56,460
Not yet.

384
00:18:56,779 --> 00:18:57,819
I'm waiting for a friend.

385
00:18:59,140 --> 00:18:59,380
Okay.

386
00:19:00,499 --> 00:19:01,620
We'll order together

387
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,768
when your friend arrives.

388
00:19:08,739 --> 00:19:09,339
Ms. Yu.

389
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,099
Jiaqi, over here.

390
00:19:12,499 --> 00:19:13,099
Ms. Yu,

391
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,620
it's been so long.

392
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:15,420
Indeed.

393
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,620
You look radiant as ever.

394
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,059
Let me introduce you.

395
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:22,420
This is Lin Jiaqi,

396
00:19:22,499 --> 00:19:23,539
from investment banking.

397
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:24,620
And this is Xu Yan,

398
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,779
Haoming's friend.

399
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:27,259
Hello.

400
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,299
Hi.

401
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:29,424
Pleasure to meet you.

402
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,460
Jiaqi,

403
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,860
I heard you were thriving

404
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,180
on Wall Street.

405
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,992
What brought you back suddenly?

406
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,339
It was my father's wish.

407
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,420
After so many years,

408
00:19:42,499 --> 00:19:43,728
he should be satisfied now.

409
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:45,900
Recently, I received
an offer from Hong Kong, China.

410
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,779
The terms were good.

411
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:47,460
So I returned.

412
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:50,940
Domestic opportunities
are promising now.

413
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,259
By the way,

414
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:53,620
about Dewei's project,

415
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,420
thank you for helping select partners.

416
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,620
My pleasure.

417
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,180
You and Mr. Shen

418
00:19:58,499 --> 00:19:59,700
watched me grow up.

419
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,779
What've you been up to?

420
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:03,620
I just got back recently,

421
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,460
still settling in.

422
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,380
Xu Yan,

423
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,339
Yutong's a rising star in law,

424
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:18,819
specializing in cross-border M&A
and financing.

425
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:20,299
Now she's working

426
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:21,739
at her family law firm,

427
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:23,184
handling international cases.

428
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:27,259
Hello.

429
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,180
Yutong,

430
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,779
I met your mother recently

431
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:32,339
and heard you just resolved

432
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,579
a cross-border M&A case.

433
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,420
Impressive work.

434
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:36,339
Let me campaign for myself then.

435
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:37,140
Ms. Yu,

436
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,259
keep me in mind for your

437
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,408
cross-border business.

438
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,380
Absolutely.

439
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,259
I wouldn't trust anyone else.

440
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,660
Miss Xu,

441
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,660
what do you think of these girls?

442
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:57,019
They're good.

443
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:58,980
Lovely and exceptionally talented.

444
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:03,339
Yes.

445
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:05,259
Girls like these

446
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:06,539
suit Haoming best.

447
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,259
I dislike beating around the bush

448
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:10,460
and wasting time.

449
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,940
Your appearance

450
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,259
and education are impressive,

451
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,664
and your job is decent,

452
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:18,900
but

453
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:21,264
your family isn't that well-off, is it?

454
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,819
Last time, we spent

455
00:21:34,819 --> 00:21:35,980
so much time together.

456
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:38,180
You never truly fit in.

457
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:40,099
Yet you didn't complain at all.

458
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:43,059
Even when I made you fetch takeout,

459
00:21:43,739 --> 00:21:44,819
you stayed composed.

460
00:21:45,499 --> 00:21:46,259
You were slighted

461
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:47,259
and forced to smile.

462
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,660
Just like how,

463
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:52,700
you're still not angry now.

464
00:21:56,499 --> 00:21:57,180
Miss Xu,

465
00:21:58,259 --> 00:21:59,460
your flaw

466
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,819
is being too submissive.

467
00:22:02,499 --> 00:22:03,499
You saw it yourself.

468
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,779
Those girls just now all had a kind

469
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,180
of ease, as if nothing really matters

470
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:08,860
to them.

471
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,819
That's what Haoming needs

472
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:13,220
and what you lack.

473
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,019
You should find someone

474
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:18,779
who truly matches your pace.

475
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,140
(Qiao Yan,)

476
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,059
(an orphan with no parents.)

477
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,499
- An orphan with no parents!
- An orphan with no parents!

478
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,299
- An orphan with no parents!
- An orphan with no parents!

479
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,779
- An orphan with no parents!
- An orphan with no parents!

480
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,779
I'm not!

481
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,499
- The orphan hit someone!
- The orphan hit someone!

482
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,980
- The orphan hit someone!
- The orphan hit someone!

483
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:43,539
I'm not an orphan!

484
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,499
I have parents!

485
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:48,420
They're abroad

486
00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:50,660
in a faraway land.

487
00:22:50,739 --> 00:22:52,019
- Qiao Yan, the liar!
- Qiao Yan, the liar!

488
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:54,140
- Qiao Yan, the liar!
- Qiao Yan, the liar!

489
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:00,900
Break up with Haoming now

490
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:03,180
to avoid humiliation.

491
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:07,900
Syracuse University.

492
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,140
It is where my parents

493
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,900
work overseas.

494
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:17,339
They taught me since childhood

495
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:19,860
that composure and good manners

496
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,299
are the basics of courtesy

497
00:23:22,739 --> 00:23:23,819
in any situation.

498
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:27,940
But I never expected

499
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,059
you'd perceive it

500
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:32,739
as timidity or weakness.

501
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,380
My career here

502
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,299
is earned by myself.

503
00:23:36,739 --> 00:23:38,059
I rarely mention my parents.

504
00:23:38,739 --> 00:23:39,940
But in your eyes,

505
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:43,600
it means a poor family background.

506
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,900
All I can say is, you're wrong.

507
00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:50,140
I know

508
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:52,019
you don't like me.

509
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:53,980
That's understandable.

510
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:56,339
But I love Haoming

511
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,339
and won't leave him.

512
00:25:10,403 --> 00:25:14,096
(Six months later)

513
00:25:30,819 --> 00:25:31,728
What's on your mind?

514
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:33,860
Nothing special.

515
00:25:35,259 --> 00:25:36,220
Just feel this family

516
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,739
is just odd.

517
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:40,059
Odd how?

518
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,739
I can't name it.

519
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:45,940
They seem fine to me.

520
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:46,420
Look,

521
00:25:46,499 --> 00:25:48,299
they're an intellectual family.

522
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,819
Marrying into them

523
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,019
would boost our company's image

524
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:54,620
and other aspects.

525
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:56,700
Don't overthink it.

526
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,180
I think

527
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,579
our son has a good taste.

528
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:01,660
Stop overthinking.

529
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,420
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

530
00:26:11,747 --> 00:26:14,083
(New District Development Plan)

531
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,620
Morning.

532
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,420
Morning, Mr. Shen.

533
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:24,380
Qu hasn't arrived yet?

534
00:26:24,739 --> 00:26:25,739
I haven't told you yet,

535
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:27,700
Mr. Qu isn't feeling well today.

536
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,496
He can't make it.

537
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:29,739
Alright then.

538
00:26:29,739 --> 00:26:31,184
Let's start the meeting without him.

539
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:33,539
Regarding the New District

540
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:35,059
commercial complex project,

541
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,220
I plan

542
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:38,499
to work with our upstream partner,
Shifeng Group.

543
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,460
They've

544
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,819
expressed

545
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,460
preliminary interest in cooperation.

546
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:44,579
Shifeng

547
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,088
is currently the largest
and best-capitalized

548
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,660
company in the industry.

549
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,700
If we secure partnership

550
00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:51,660
with them,

551
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,819
this project is settled.

552
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:54,980
We've got a good chance.

553
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,380
Exactly.

554
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:08,860
Haoming.

555
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:11,180
Dad.

556
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:15,299
You stayed silent during the meeting.

557
00:27:15,819 --> 00:27:16,420
Why?

558
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,460
I don't have confidence in Mr. Zheng,

559
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,099
the new Chairman of Shifeng Group.

560
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:21,980
Your reasons?

561
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:25,140
First,

562
00:27:25,739 --> 00:27:26,700
after the accident

563
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,528
at Shifeng's resettlement housing site,

564
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,579
his response was

565
00:27:31,579 --> 00:27:32,460
to conceal it,

566
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:34,019
suppress public opinion,

567
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,120
and shirk accountability.

568
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:36,579
Second,

569
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:37,968
he's a parachuted executive,

570
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,339
meaning he lacks

571
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,180
reliable loyalists within Shifeng.

572
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,499
Third,

573
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,339
he brought three confidants.

574
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,059
One has strong networking skills

575
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,779
but is self-righteous,

576
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,259
offending everyone.

577
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:53,220
Another one

578
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:54,779
is senior and experienced,

579
00:27:55,739 --> 00:27:57,499
but was playing mahjong

580
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,019
when the accident happened.

581
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:00,980
The third

582
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,579
and lowest-ranked one

583
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,019
is the most competent.

584
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,840
He handles heavy workloads,

585
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:07,900
but suffers unfair profit distribution.

586
00:28:09,819 --> 00:28:10,420
Impressive.

587
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,420
You've dug deep

588
00:28:12,499 --> 00:28:13,460
into their foundation.

589
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:14,539
Dad,

590
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,299
I believe internal turmoil

591
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,980
is inevitable.

592
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:21,499
If you think

593
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:22,539
Zheng

594
00:28:22,819 --> 00:28:23,940
has so many flaws,

595
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:25,299
how did he become

596
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:26,299
the Chairman then?

597
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:28,220
That's an even bigger red flag.

598
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:30,620
Dear Haoming.

599
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,940
In construction,

600
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:33,620
unless you've worked

601
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,420
from the ground up

602
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:37,420
and fought your way up

603
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,620
through decades

604
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,339
in this industry,

605
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:42,739
you'll never grasp its workings.

606
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:45,819
Understand?

607
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,336
Understood.

608
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,460
Besides,

609
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,900
I want to bid for the New District's

610
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,900
Plot 178 development.

611
00:29:00,579 --> 00:29:01,980
This large company

612
00:29:03,099 --> 00:29:03,579
will

613
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,140
be handed to you.

614
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,980
For now,

615
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,339
maintain stability and avoid mistakes.

616
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,339
That's your main task.

617
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:13,940
Clear?

618
00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:17,019
Yes.

619
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,499
A dish to savor, a moment to cherish.

620
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,019
This episode of Family Feast

621
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:21,819
concludes here.

622
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,539
Thank you for watching, everyone.

623
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:23,900
Got it.

624
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,779
See you

625
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:25,539
- next time.
- Next time.

626
00:29:25,819 --> 00:29:26,380
Cut.

627
00:29:27,075 --> 00:29:28,752
(Family Feast)

628
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:32,339
You've worked hard, Siwei.

629
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:33,299
What process is this?

630
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:34,220
Recording for so long.

631
00:29:37,539 --> 00:29:38,900
Thank you, Mr. Sanmu.

632
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,620
It's way too late.

633
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,620
You've worked hard too.

634
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:42,220
Xu Yan.

635
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,180
To be honest,

636
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,860
the reason I came here

637
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:46,980
isn't just because of Haoming,

638
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:48,059
but mainly

639
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:49,460
I was moved by your sincerity.

640
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,579
I was on business in America for a week.

641
00:29:51,579 --> 00:29:52,940
Your messages kept coming nonstop.

642
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,499
And whenever I texted you,

643
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:55,620
you replied right away.

644
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,819
I'm curious.

645
00:29:58,299 --> 00:29:59,579
Do you never sleep?

646
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:01,460
Sorry for disturbing you.

647
00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:03,460
That's how our job works.

648
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:04,739
We're on call 24/7.

649
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,420
So feel free to contact me

650
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,339
for any future issues.

651
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,259
Good.

652
00:30:08,499 --> 00:30:09,019
Good for you.

653
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,779
Next time,
le t's have dinner with Haoming.

654
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,579
No problem.

655
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,380
Must be exhausted.

656
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,299
Get some rest early.

657
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:15,739
Come.

658
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:16,099
Okay.

659
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,096
Take Mr. Sanmu
to the guest room to change.

660
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:19,819
Yan,

661
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:21,776
the backstage director said
we need close-up shots

662
00:30:21,776 --> 00:30:22,660
of those dishes.

663
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,420
No problem.

664
00:30:25,411 --> 00:30:27,824
(Ms. Yu calling)

665
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,660
Hello, Ms. Yu?

666
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:32,739
Now?

667
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:34,660
But I've got...

668
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:36,940
No problem.

669
00:30:37,739 --> 00:30:39,140
Please send me the address.

670
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:40,739
Okay.

671
00:30:43,747 --> 00:30:45,584
(Cuijin Royal Garden Sales Office)

672
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:55,700
Thank you.

673
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,220
I'm coming in now, Ms. Yu.

674
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,019
Okay.

675
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:05,420
This

676
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,140
is the Tongzhou Canal.

677
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:07,860
And

678
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,259
there's a CBD nearby.

679
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:11,019
Sorry I'm late, Ms. Yu.

680
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,940
There was traffic on the way.

681
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,700
We've been waiting.

682
00:31:16,259 --> 00:31:17,140
It wasn't easy

683
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,900
to get Ms. Meng

684
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:19,299
to see the house with us today,

685
00:31:19,539 --> 00:31:20,700
yet you kept her waiting.

686
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:21,940
Ms. Meng,

687
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:22,860
my apologies.

688
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:23,539
It's fine.

689
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,779
Let's go take a look then.

690
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,472
- I'm occupied this afternoon.
- Okay.

691
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,339
This entire property

692
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,180
covers an area

693
00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:38,140
of 35,000 square meters.

694
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:40,460
There are eight buildings in total.

695
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,539
Six garden villas

696
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,860
and two high-rises.

697
00:31:44,499 --> 00:31:46,180
The unit sizes range

698
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:46,940
from 199

699
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:48,380
to 143 square meters.

700
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,499
Ms. Yu,

701
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,860
may I ask

702
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,059
who this house is for?

703
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:52,860
My son.

704
00:31:53,099 --> 00:31:54,032
He's getting married.

705
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,259
Really?

706
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,460
Congratulations, Ms. Yu.

707
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,460
Mr. Shen is marrying so soon?

708
00:31:58,739 --> 00:31:59,779
I wonder which lucky girl

709
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:00,900
gets to be his bride.

710
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,539
How careless of me!

711
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:08,499
Hello, Madam.

712
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,579
I'm Lisa.

713
00:32:09,819 --> 00:32:10,779
If you need anything,

714
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,620
just let me know.

715
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,539
You'll be satisfied.

716
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:13,460
Thank you.

717
00:32:13,579 --> 00:32:13,980
It's okay.

718
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,259
Lisa,

719
00:32:15,259 --> 00:32:17,099
which units did you prepare for me?

720
00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:18,460
I've reserved for you

721
00:32:18,499 --> 00:32:20,140
the prime unit of the entire complex.

722
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,019
Unit 606,

723
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,380
706,

724
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,700
and 808 in Building 6.

725
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,339
These three units

726
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,420
are undoubtedly

727
00:32:27,499 --> 00:32:27,980
the finest

728
00:32:28,099 --> 00:32:29,059
and the most spacious.

729
00:32:29,099 --> 00:32:30,259
I reserve them all for you.

730
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:31,380
Madam?

731
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:32,940
What do you think, Madam?

732
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,299
They're all good.

733
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,739
Ms. Yu,

734
00:32:41,499 --> 00:32:42,980
should we ask Haoming's opinion?

735
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:48,980
Miss Xu,

736
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,059
when it comes to buying a marital home,

737
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:53,259
Ms. Yu will make the decision.

738
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,180
You young people

739
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,700
don't have a sense of real estate.

740
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,980
Forget everything else.

741
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,579
Just concerning the orientation

742
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,620
and the floor level,

743
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,220
you surely don't understand, right?

744
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,984
You'll have children
in a few years, right?

745
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,140
Shouldn't you decide

746
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,579
how to lay out the rooms

747
00:33:06,739 --> 00:33:08,059
or what interior style to choose?

748
00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:09,420
This isn't a joke.

749
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,380
If you pick the wrong property,

750
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:13,099
it could severely impact

751
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,420
your married life.

752
00:33:16,539 --> 00:33:17,620
Thank you, Ms. Meng.

753
00:33:18,739 --> 00:33:21,072
When buying the house,
we'll surely follow Ms. Yu's advice.

754
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:23,860
I was just thinking, maybe we should

755
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,499
have Haoming

756
00:33:24,499 --> 00:33:25,460
come take a look too.

757
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:26,299
No need.

758
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:28,499
He's too busy.

759
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:30,220
We'll decide for him.

760
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,339
Okay.

761
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,700
I got it.

762
00:33:36,499 --> 00:33:38,499
Miss Xu, you probably
don't house-hunt often

763
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,499
and lack experience.

764
00:33:40,579 --> 00:33:41,460
But don't worry.

765
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,739
With me here,

766
00:33:43,059 --> 00:33:44,339
I'll help you two lovebirds

767
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,380
pick the perfect unit.

768
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:46,220
Thank you.

769
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,180
Don't say that.

770
00:33:48,339 --> 00:33:49,420
We're older now.

771
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,739
We truly don't know
young people's minds.

772
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,339
Xu Yan's father

773
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,539
was an architecture major.

774
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,700
