00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,898
I brought a cake for you.

35
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:10,299
Who are you?

36
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:12,619
My name is Xu Yan.

37
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:21,858
I brought you
a delicious osmanthus cake.

38
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:23,619
Madam Yu.

39
00:02:24,698 --> 00:02:27,059
The cake I made is an osmanthus cake.

40
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:30,299
It includes the osmanthus jam
my grandma made.

41
00:02:30,698 --> 00:02:31,858
And my grandma said

42
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:33,739
that having sweets occasionally

43
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,299
makes people happy.

44
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:38,019
But don't worry. It's not too sweet.

45
00:02:46,698 --> 00:02:47,538
Wipe your hands?

46
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:52,019
Madam Yu, guess what?

47
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:53,578
You and my grandma

48
00:02:54,098 --> 00:02:56,779
were born in the same year,
the Year of the Ox.

49
00:03:02,378 --> 00:03:04,219
Coincidentally,
your experiences are similar.

50
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:08,019
You both contributed
to the borderland construction

51
00:03:08,378 --> 00:03:12,418
and were among the first people
to support Xinjiang. What a coincidence!

52
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:16,378
We were

53
00:03:17,619 --> 00:03:21,098
born in new China
and grew up under the national flag.

54
00:03:22,098 --> 00:03:24,499
We devoted our lives
to the country's modernization.

55
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:25,378
Right,

56
00:03:27,258 --> 00:03:29,138
the country's modernization.

57
00:03:29,578 --> 00:03:30,418
That's impressive.

58
00:03:31,138 --> 00:03:31,899
Alright.

59
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:36,658
Madam Yu, try the osmanthus cake.

60
00:03:47,698 --> 00:03:48,418
Want to taste it?

61
00:03:52,258 --> 00:03:54,858
Who are you?
How did you get into my room?

62
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:58,939
My name is Xu Yan.

63
00:03:59,418 --> 00:04:00,658
I'm here to see you.

64
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:02,378
I brought an osmanthus cake.

65
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,098
- You're a thief.
- I'm not a thief.

66
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:04,899
You're stealing.

67
00:04:04,899 --> 00:04:05,939
Madam Yu, I'm not a thief.

68
00:04:05,978 --> 00:04:07,019
Listen to me, Madam Yu.

69
00:04:07,098 --> 00:04:09,698
- You want to steal vegetable balls.
- I got you vegetable balls.

70
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:11,899
Madam Yu, I brought vegetable balls.

71
00:04:12,538 --> 00:04:14,098
Your daughter's favorite food.

72
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:19,458
Vegetable balls? My vegetable balls.

73
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:30,539
One, two, three, four,

74
00:04:30,739 --> 00:04:35,778
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

75
00:04:38,299 --> 00:04:39,659
Right amount.

76
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:41,619
All here.

77
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,258
Vegetable balls.

78
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,179
It's warm.

79
00:05:03,698 --> 00:05:04,378
Want to try it?

80
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:14,179
See if it tastes
like those you make. Taste it.

81
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:19,859
Vegetable balls.

82
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:24,338
My daughter's favorite vegetable balls.

83
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:29,539
My daughter loves vegetable balls.

84
00:05:45,059 --> 00:05:46,499
You...

85
00:05:47,698 --> 00:05:50,739
What happened

86
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:51,659
to you?

87
00:05:55,258 --> 00:05:56,939
I did it by accident.

88
00:05:59,179 --> 00:06:00,179
It's because

89
00:06:00,739 --> 00:06:02,778
the osmanthus cake is very delicious.

90
00:06:03,258 --> 00:06:03,778
Really.

91
00:06:04,499 --> 00:06:06,378
It smells so good.

92
00:06:07,338 --> 00:06:08,059
Have a taste.

93
00:06:15,619 --> 00:06:17,338
Try a bite.

94
00:06:24,778 --> 00:06:25,578
Is it tasty?

95
00:06:28,499 --> 00:06:30,099
- It's tasty.
- Tasty.

96
00:06:36,378 --> 00:06:37,299
Who are you?

97
00:06:40,338 --> 00:06:41,179
Xu Yan.

98
00:06:46,378 --> 00:06:47,539
If you like,

99
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:51,218
I can often bring you vegetable balls.

100
00:06:57,258 --> 00:06:57,778
Okay.

101
00:06:58,378 --> 00:07:01,218
Have another bite.
It contains osmanthus jam.

102
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:06,458
It's tasty.

103
00:07:08,018 --> 00:07:09,258

Madam Yu.

107
00:07:27,138 --> 00:07:29,619
Do you want to see what
I'll look like when I turn 70?

108
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:32,619
Turn 70? I can't believe it.

when you're old.)

112
00:07:41,619 --> 00:07:42,939

you two are the same,

165
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:12,539

00:12:07,698 --> 00:12:08,259
Wait a moment.

178
00:12:17,698 --> 00:12:19,218

It took a while.

183
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:32,379
I'll be quicker next time.
Let me wash your hair.

184
00:12:33,698 --> 00:12:34,978
You lost weight.

185
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:39,218

186
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:40,779
No.

187
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:43,179
It's all my fault.

188
00:12:43,578 --> 00:12:45,338

00:13:08,498 --> 00:13:09,818
I made this for you.

191
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:12,299
Your favorite vegetable balls.

192
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:17,978
Remember to take them with you later.

193
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:27,698
Remember to heat them up before eating.

194
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:31,098
It's not good for your stomach
to eat cold food.

195
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:38,618
Take good care of yourself.

196
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:41,578
Then I'll be at ease.

197
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:51,539
I know.

198
00:13:53,698 --> 00:13:54,779
I know.

199
00:13:55,738 --> 00:13:57,539
I'll heat them up before I eat.

200
00:13:58,659 --> 00:13:59,498
Don't worry.

201
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:01,338
Mom.

202
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,899
Six, seven, open your arms.

203
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:31,899
Eight, good.

204
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:33,218
Two.

205
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:35,779
Two.

206
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:40,299
Miss Xu has been here for over a week.
She keeps Madam Yu company every day.

207
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:41,299
Seven.

208
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:43,259
Eight.

209
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:45,419
Relax.

210
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:48,899
Feels good, right?

211
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:50,458
That's it for today.

212
00:14:50,618 --> 00:14:51,939
Let's have breakfast.

213
00:14:51,939 --> 00:14:53,139
Okay, Xu Yan.

214
00:14:57,899 --> 00:14:59,019
What did you just call me?

215
00:15:00,578 --> 00:15:01,698
I called you Xu Yan.

216
00:15:03,338 --> 00:15:04,818
You remember my name?

217
00:15:05,618 --> 00:15:07,539
I've always remembered your name.

218
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,779
You've always remembered my name?

219
00:15:09,978 --> 00:15:11,659
What else do you remember?

220
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:14,299
I also remember

221
00:15:14,338 --> 00:15:15,498
the delicious osmanthus cake.

222
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:16,139
Cake.

223
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,858
You helped me catch the thief.

224
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:18,578
Catch the thief.

225
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:20,659
And you took photos with me.

226
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,458
You're so great! Let me hug you.

227
00:15:25,179 --> 00:15:25,738
Come on.

228
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:26,779
You can't.

229
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:27,379
One more hug.

230
00:15:27,698 --> 00:15:28,738
Be careful. Don't move.

231
00:15:48,858 --> 00:15:51,539
Mr. Shen, you're a winner in life.

232
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:55,259
You're great at golf
and have a successful career.

233
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,738
And you married a good wife,

234
00:15:58,098 --> 00:15:59,659
who's been helping you all along.

235
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:00,578
Helping me?

236
00:16:01,698 --> 00:16:03,698
Mr. Huang, I don't quite understand.

237
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,698
Wasn't it you who asked your wife
to take care of my mother-in-law?

238
00:16:08,978 --> 00:16:09,899
Recently,

239
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:12,578
Xu Yan has been
taking care of my mother-in-law.

240
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,498
My mother-in-law's condition
has improved.

241
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,779
Her state is much better than before.

242
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:20,858
Didn't you know?

243
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:23,299
She never told me.

244
00:16:26,858 --> 00:16:28,738
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

245
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:29,818
Anyway,

246
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:32,738
please be sure to convey my gratitude
to your wife.

247
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:33,978
Sure, no problem.

248
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:36,578
But I invited you today

249
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:39,059
just to thank your wife.

250
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:42,698
So today we're just playing golf,
without talking about the work.

251
00:16:44,818 --> 00:16:47,818
Actually, you take the time
to play golf with me,

252
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:49,098
which is already my honor.

253
00:16:50,098 --> 00:16:51,098
After all, you must be

254
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:53,059
stressed about your group's issues.

255
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,978
It's good to come out
and play golf to relax.

256
00:16:57,539 --> 00:16:58,779
I'm not stressed at all.

257
00:17:00,098 --> 00:17:01,458
Shouke is well-funded,

258
00:17:02,578 --> 00:17:04,899
but its structure isn't mature enough.

259
00:17:06,139 --> 00:17:09,018
It is lacking professional talent
and human resources.

260
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:11,819
Even if you acquire Plot 178,

261
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:13,498
you can't develop it.

262
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:15,659
Isn't that something
you should worry about?

263
00:17:16,538 --> 00:17:17,819
Young man,

264
00:17:18,139 --> 00:17:19,379
you're quite bold.

265
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:21,579
Understaffing and staying

266
00:17:22,018 --> 00:17:23,099
outside the core circle

267
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,698
of the real estate industry.

268
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,498
These two have been Shouke's concerns

269
00:17:27,698 --> 00:17:29,018
and stumbling blocks.

270
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,458
You want to tackle these issues, right?

271
00:17:33,939 --> 00:17:35,139
So, Mr. Shen,

272
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:38,379
do you have any suggestions?

273
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:42,018
Shifeng and Mingyuan Group

274
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:45,058
are currently

275
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:47,218
in a fierce contention.

276
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:50,139
If Shouke now

277
00:17:50,659 --> 00:17:52,018
works with Shifeng,

278
00:17:53,058 --> 00:17:54,859
it will be a win-win cooperation.

279
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,258
Mingyuan is bound to lose.

280
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:00,218
Shouke has the land

281
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:02,298
and can use Shifeng

282
00:18:03,018 --> 00:18:04,778
to upgrade its entire structure.

283
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:08,458
In the future,
your company is sure to stand out.

284
00:18:09,139 --> 00:18:11,139
It will secure entry to the core circle.

285
00:18:14,939 --> 00:18:16,899
Let's have a meal together
after the game,

286
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:17,939
and we'll discuss it.

287
00:18:27,379 --> 00:18:29,778
That's ridiculous.
Isn't she afraid of being found out?

288
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:30,379
Yeah.

289
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:33,899
- What are you looking at?
- Siwei.

290
00:18:34,339 --> 00:18:36,339
Look at this news. We're all shocked.

291
00:18:36,778 --> 00:18:39,939
There's an incredible woman
hiding her true family background.

292
00:18:39,939 --> 00:18:42,018
(A Wedding Scam behind Large Dowries)
She held weddings with three men

293
00:18:42,218 --> 00:18:44,659
and obtained huge dowries
and properties from them.

294
00:18:44,738 --> 00:18:47,379
Moreover, more than 100 guests
attending the wedding invited by her

295
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:48,819
were all hired actors.

296
00:18:49,058 --> 00:18:50,458
Luckily, the truth came out,

297
00:18:50,698 --> 00:18:52,099
and the groom called the police.

298
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:54,778
That's outrageous. Let me see.

299
00:18:56,058 --> 00:18:57,099
That's ridiculous.

300
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,099
She isn't afraid of being found out.

301
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,579
Yeah.

302
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:02,139
It's so dramatic.

303
00:19:02,379 --> 00:19:03,218
Right.

304
00:19:04,298 --> 00:19:04,738
Stop.

305
00:19:06,218 --> 00:19:07,099
What's wrong?

306
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:10,498
Nothing.

307
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:12,619
This person

308
00:19:14,498 --> 00:19:16,258
looks so familiar.

309
00:19:16,538 --> 00:19:17,978
- Familiar? Who is it?
- Who is it?

310
00:19:18,379 --> 00:19:19,978
When she first came here,

311
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:23,899
I clearly remember
that she said she only had a grandma.

312
00:19:24,939 --> 00:19:28,419
When does she have intellectual parents
who live abroad?

313
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,258
- Send me this link.
- Okay.

314
00:19:35,058 --> 00:19:36,179
- Sir.
- Come in.

315
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:38,579
Sir.

316
00:19:39,258 --> 00:19:41,819
An interview guest gave me a box of tea.

317
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,139
It looked pretty nice.

318
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:45,218
I haven't had it yet.
I brought it for you.

319
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:46,179
What's up?

320
00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:50,139
Look how observant you are!

321
00:19:50,538 --> 00:19:50,978
Go ahead.

322
00:19:52,218 --> 00:19:53,058
Earlier,

323
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:56,099
- you went to Xu Yan's wedding, right?
- Yes, I did.

324
00:19:56,379 --> 00:19:58,859
Did you take photos then?
Could you show them to me?

325
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:01,978
Why?

326
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:05,258
A friend of mine is getting married
next month.

327
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:07,659
I'd like to watch a high-society wedding

328
00:20:07,738 --> 00:20:09,298
to see how they set it up.

329
00:20:09,619 --> 00:20:10,179
Well,

330
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:13,339
I did take some photos,

331
00:20:13,698 --> 00:20:16,099
but they were very strict
about this matter.

332
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:19,018
Taking photos and sharing
on social media weren't allowed.

333
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,458
I just snuck a few shots.

334
00:20:22,498 --> 00:20:24,579
Why don't you ask Xu Yan for them?

335
00:20:24,778 --> 00:20:26,698
Sir, you know very well

336
00:20:26,738 --> 00:20:28,339
I'm not on good terms with Xu Yan.

337
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:35,258
Alright then.

338
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:37,018
You watch photos here.

339
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:39,698
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

340
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:42,579
- Thanks.
- You watch right here.

341
00:20:42,899 --> 00:20:43,458
Okay.

342
00:20:43,498 --> 00:20:44,899
I'll taste your tea leaves.

343
00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:56,058
The high-society wedding
is indeed different.

344
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:57,619
That cost a lot of money.

345
00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:00,698
But a wealthy family can afford it.

346
00:21:00,978 --> 00:21:02,538
It's really nice.

347
00:21:03,579 --> 00:21:05,018
Speaking of their wedding,

348
00:21:05,538 --> 00:21:07,018
it's truly enviable.

349
00:21:07,738 --> 00:21:09,058
It's high-end and impressive.

350
00:21:09,939 --> 00:21:12,698
I have to take a good look
for reference.

351
00:21:13,018 --> 00:21:15,759
I'm telling you, learn a thing or two.

352
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:17,859
When you get married,
you hold a better wedding.

353
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:18,498
Sure.

354
00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:21,778
Sir, you got the beauty filter on!

355
00:21:22,939 --> 00:21:24,458
To reduce wrinkles on my face.

356
00:21:25,538 --> 00:21:26,778
Alright, I'm done.

357
00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:27,899
Well, I have to go.

358
00:21:27,939 --> 00:21:31,018
- Okay.
- When you run out, I'll get you more.

359
00:21:31,058 --> 00:21:32,619
Alright, this smells nice.

360
00:22:07,819 --> 00:22:09,258
Look, it's right here.

361
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:10,859
No. 16 Yunshui Street.

362
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:13,698
Are you sure?
We've gone around several times.

363
00:22:14,058 --> 00:22:14,778
I'm sure.

364
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:18,698
I've been a paparazzo for three years.
Finding people is my specialty.

365
00:22:21,738 --> 00:22:22,978
Look, isn't that him?

366
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,179
Look, it's him, right?

367
00:22:27,778 --> 00:22:28,619
Xu Yan's father.

368
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:34,218
Hello.

369
00:22:40,218 --> 00:22:41,058
Miss,

370
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:43,819
I really don't understand
what you're saying.

371
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:46,379
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

372
00:22:47,058 --> 00:22:48,498
Don't believe me? Check my ID.

373
00:22:50,379 --> 00:22:50,859
Here.

374
00:22:52,258 --> 00:22:54,298
My surname isn't Xu. It's Gao.

375
00:22:55,018 --> 00:22:56,058
Gao Liangjie,

376
00:22:56,179 --> 00:22:57,538
meaning unwavering integrity.

377
00:22:57,698 --> 00:22:58,819
Don't panic.

378
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:00,899
You don't need to admit anything now.

379
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:02,778
Since we could find you,

380
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:04,498
it definitely wasn't without reason.

381
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:06,058
Let's cooperate.

382
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:20,939
Xu Yan.

383
00:23:25,899 --> 00:23:27,819
The finance department needs a host.

384
00:23:28,379 --> 00:23:31,379
The leadership plans
to select from young hosts.

385
00:23:31,698 --> 00:23:32,659
I heard you signed up.

386
00:23:35,139 --> 00:23:36,139
Are you also interested?

387
00:23:37,859 --> 00:23:38,619
Of course.

388
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:41,339
Who would miss
such a good opportunity to pivot?

389
00:23:45,978 --> 00:23:48,819
But I don't plan to read the script
they've prepared for me.

390
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:52,978
I want to use the news
I've personally gathered and edited

391
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:54,018
to make a demo.

392
00:23:58,099 --> 00:24:00,058
We're drowning in information.

393
00:24:00,738 --> 00:24:02,538
Separating fact from fiction

394
00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:04,498
and giving the public truth,
genuine insight,

395
00:24:04,538 --> 00:24:05,899
and sincere affection

396
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:07,579
is what truly matters.

397
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:10,899
I can see you've been working hard.

398
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:13,538
Your thinking seems beyond you.

399
00:24:16,978 --> 00:24:17,899
Rest assured.

400
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:21,179
My demo is absolutely genuine

401
00:24:21,698 --> 00:24:23,058
and impactful enough.

402
00:24:24,139 --> 00:24:26,619
It will definitely be unforgettable.

403
00:24:30,018 --> 00:24:30,778
Good luck.

404
00:24:31,058 --> 00:24:31,579
Thank you.

405
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:52,419
Please begin
reading the assigned script.

406
00:24:52,733 --> 00:24:56,016
(News Program Host Selection Contest)

407
00:24:58,778 --> 00:25:01,498
Recently, a cold wave
named Niuniu Niuniu Six

408
00:25:01,538 --> 00:25:03,379
came from the Scandinavian Peninsula.

409
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:06,819
It will pass
through Norin-Sebestei-Bvlag,

410
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:08,899
Barunbagabayanner,

411
00:25:09,018 --> 00:25:11,579
Tuiraomuyin, and Ulantaolegai,
and so on.

412
00:25:11,738 --> 00:25:14,099
Please use simple terms
to tell the audience

413
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,258
about the meanings
of physical settlement,

414
00:25:16,298 --> 00:25:18,899
cash settlement, and leverage
in futures.

415
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:21,738
You book a bag.

416
00:25:22,498 --> 00:25:23,978
The sales tells you it's arrived.

417
00:25:24,099 --> 00:25:25,978
You buy it and then resell it.

418
00:25:26,139 --> 00:25:30,058
That's called physical settlement.

419
00:25:30,058 --> 00:25:33,458
You find that the spot price
is way higher than the price you booked.

420
00:25:33,859 --> 00:25:36,978
So you plan to sell the booked bag
directly to your peers.

421
00:25:37,139 --> 00:25:40,419
That's called cash settlement.

422
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:43,339
You decided to use 100 yuan
to buy the bag

423
00:25:43,538 --> 00:25:45,939
and resell it to your peers
to earn a 10 yuan spread.

424
00:25:46,139 --> 00:25:48,419
But in the end,
you only spent 10 yuan on a deposit

425
00:25:48,498 --> 00:25:51,179
and directly sold the bag to your peers,
earning a 10 yuan spread.

426
00:25:51,498 --> 00:25:54,258
That's called leverage.

427
00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:55,538
As a host,

428
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:58,218
do you think it's more important
to speak logically

429
00:25:58,298 --> 00:25:59,298
or to speak with facts?

430
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:11,218
News has been defined
as the first draft of history.

431
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,538
So in this draft,

432
00:26:14,018 --> 00:26:14,978
the factual part

433
00:26:15,018 --> 00:26:17,379
can be handled by reporters and others.

434
00:26:17,698 --> 00:26:18,698
But the logical part

435
00:26:19,379 --> 00:26:20,859
is to be elevated by the host.

436
00:26:21,139 --> 00:26:22,419
Everyone saw it, right?

437
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:23,939
Yan was overwhelming.

438
00:26:24,058 --> 00:26:25,978
She amazed the judges in three rounds.

439
00:26:26,258 --> 00:26:27,339
When Yan hosts,

440
00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:28,778
she's always confident,

441
00:26:28,819 --> 00:26:30,218
poised, and natural.

442
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:31,579
What's most important?

443
00:26:31,978 --> 00:26:33,419
The audience likes her.

444
00:26:34,139 --> 00:26:36,579
The results aren't out yet.
Let's not say anything.

445
00:26:36,939 --> 00:26:39,698
If you go on, I'll be so embarrassed.

446
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:42,179
Yan, you'll definitely make it.

447
00:26:42,538 --> 00:26:46,698
- Treat us!
- Treat us!

448
00:26:46,778 --> 00:26:49,659
Alright, tonight's dinner is on me.

449
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,099
Order whatever you like, okay?

450
00:26:53,139 --> 00:26:55,179
- Go back to work.
- Work.

451
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:55,659
Hurry up.

452
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:56,379
Back to work.

453
00:26:58,339 --> 00:27:00,899
By the way, Yu, fix the thing
we discussed earlier.

454
00:27:02,218 --> 00:27:02,738
Xu Yan.

455
00:27:04,179 --> 00:27:04,698
Xu Yan.

456
00:27:06,218 --> 00:27:07,099
Here you are.

457
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:10,698
What's up?

458
00:27:13,379 --> 00:27:14,819
Didn't I tell you

459
00:27:15,339 --> 00:27:16,978
that I want to make a news demo?

460
00:27:17,498 --> 00:27:18,538
It's really unfortunate.

461
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:20,018
My guest is stuck in traffic.

462
00:27:20,058 --> 00:27:21,258
He needs another hour.

463
00:27:21,579 --> 00:27:22,939
Can you be my guest?

464
00:27:23,258 --> 00:27:24,379
Please, help me out.

465
00:27:27,298 --> 00:27:30,018
Yan, the editing room is waiting
for you to review the footage.

466
00:27:35,498 --> 00:27:38,498
I didn't know about your interview
or have background research.

467
00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:40,778
How can I be your guest?

468
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:43,899
It's just some simple Q&A.

469
00:27:44,058 --> 00:27:45,099
Plus, it's pre-recorded.

470
00:27:45,139 --> 00:27:46,659
We can stop when there's a mistake.

471
00:27:46,738 --> 00:27:47,419
Right, sir?

472
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:50,058
Miss Xu.

473
00:27:50,698 --> 00:27:52,579
Miss Sun asked everyone,
and no one is available.

474
00:27:53,018 --> 00:27:53,498
Sir...

475
00:27:53,659 --> 00:27:54,778
I'll go to the editing room.

476
00:27:55,659 --> 00:27:56,339
You help her.

477
00:28:02,698 --> 00:28:03,179
Okay.

478
00:28:03,698 --> 00:28:05,579
Xu Yan, thank you so much.

479
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:06,778
I'm counting on you fully.

480
00:28:14,698 --> 00:28:16,939
(Talk to Weiwei)
I'm honored to have my great partner,

481
00:28:16,978 --> 00:28:19,899
Ms. Xu Yan, the main planner
of Family Feast,

482
00:28:20,058 --> 00:28:22,419
to discuss
hot social issues with us here.

483
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:30,018
Recently, I came across a news report.

484
00:28:30,218 --> 00:28:32,698
(A Wedding Scam behind Large Dowries)
A married woman hid her marital history

485
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:35,619
and hired people to impersonate
family and friends to hold a wedding,

486
00:28:35,659 --> 00:28:38,859
aiming at swindling the man
out of a huge dowry.

487
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:53,379
Mr. Gao, the extra in this news story,

488
00:28:53,379 --> 00:28:54,419
is also here with us.

489
00:28:54,538 --> 00:28:55,339
Let's welcome him.

490
00:28:57,419 --> 00:28:59,179
(The worst-case scenario just happened.)

491
00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:02,859
(I know I'm standing
on the edge of a cliff right now.)

492
00:29:09,058 --> 00:29:10,738
- Hello, Mr. Gao.
- Hello, Miss Sun.

493
00:29:11,698 --> 00:29:14,258
Miss Xu, what a coincidence
to see you here.

494
00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:17,738
Mr. Gao, do you know Xu Yan?

495
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,419
We know each other well.

496
00:29:20,698 --> 00:29:21,978
Where did you two meet?

497
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:24,538
I... I don't really remember.

498
00:29:25,738 --> 00:29:26,939
I don't know where.

499
00:29:28,218 --> 00:29:28,778
You...

500
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:30,339
Look at her.

501
00:29:30,738 --> 00:29:31,339
It's okay.

502
00:29:31,538 --> 00:29:32,538
Let's sit down and talk.

503
00:29:32,698 --> 00:29:33,419
Alright.

504
00:29:42,339 --> 00:29:42,939
Mr. Gao,

505
00:29:43,258 --> 00:29:44,859
may I ask what the reason was

506
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:47,339
that made you impersonate
a wedding guest?

507
00:29:49,778 --> 00:29:52,619
Actually, many people
sought me out before.

508
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:56,218
Some did so
because their families lack members.

509
00:29:56,659 --> 00:29:58,379
They wanted me to liven things up.

510
00:29:58,698 --> 00:30:00,899
Others did it purely for appearances.

511
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:04,379
They were afraid
the event wouldn't measure up

512
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:05,339
to the in-laws.

513
00:30:06,298 --> 00:30:08,258
Were there any cases
of marriage fraud among them?

514
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:15,298
Yes, there were.

515
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:22,419
Mr. Gao, this could be seen as fraud.

516
00:30:22,538 --> 00:30:25,018
Once exposed,
you might face criminal charges.

517
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,099
It was always the bride
committing fraud.

518
00:30:28,698 --> 00:30:30,899
I only found out afterwards.

519
00:30:31,139 --> 00:30:33,258
I really regretted it.

520
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:34,619
I really did.

521
00:30:34,659 --> 00:30:36,859
I shouldn't have gone along with them.

522
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:40,579
We can see that Mr. Gao
has reflected deeply.

523
00:30:40,659 --> 00:30:42,538
It's alright.
We learn from our mistakes.

524
00:30:43,298 --> 00:30:45,139
As law-abiding citizens,

525
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:47,018
- we must follow the law.
- Yes.

526
00:30:47,058 --> 00:30:49,450
- We must not go down the wrong path.
- Yes.

527
00:30:54,288 --> 00:30:56,976
Mr. Gao, the person
in the photo is you, right?

528
00:30:57,468 --> 00:30:58,738
Yes, that's me.

529
00:30:59,978 --> 00:31:02,619
What role did you play at the wedding?

530
00:31:03,579 --> 00:31:04,339
The bride's father.

531
00:31:05,018 --> 00:31:06,458
It's a double fate.

532
00:31:06,538 --> 00:31:07,419
Double fate.

533
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:21,659
Isn't this Ms. Xu's wedding?

534
00:31:21,978 --> 00:31:23,179
What's going on?

535
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,819
Was he at her wedding ceremony?

536
00:31:25,099 --> 00:31:27,058
I must say, they do look alike.

537
00:31:33,619 --> 00:31:34,298
Mr. Gao,

538
00:31:36,058 --> 00:31:37,018
what about this photo?

539
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:47,458
Well...

540
00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:48,458
What do you mean?

541
00:31:51,018 --> 00:31:55,819
I discovered by chance
while investigating this news story

542
00:31:55,899 --> 00:32:00,258
that Mr. Gao and Xu Yan's father
might be the same person.

543
00:32:00,778 --> 00:32:03,538
As journalists,
we need to get to the bottom of things

544
00:32:03,579 --> 00:32:04,939
and pursue the truth.

545
00:32:05,379 --> 00:32:06,218
Mr. Gao,

546
00:32:06,698 --> 00:32:09,538
you seem to have known Miss Xu
for a long time.

547
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:11,738
What's your relationship?

548
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:14,339
Is the person in the photo actually you?

549
00:32:14,379 --> 00:32:16,859
Are you Xu Yan's fake father?

550
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:18,099
Please answer directly.

551
00:32:18,579 --> 00:32:19,379
Sun Siwei,

552
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:22,458
you've gone too far.

553
00:32:24,298 --> 00:32:26,899
I didn't expect you
to be this unreasonable.

554
00:32:27,298 --> 00:32:30,099
Does anyone here not know
that we have a bad relationship?

555
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:31,819
You've always belittled me.

556
00:32:32,458 --> 00:32:33,458
You coveted my guests,

557
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:34,498
broadcast slots,

558
00:32:34,939 --> 00:32:35,978
and makeup artists.

559
00:32:36,139 --> 00:32:37,419
I can put up with all of that.

560
00:32:38,018 --> 00:32:38,819
But what's this?

561
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:40,458
What do you want to do?

562
00:32:40,538 --> 00:32:41,698
You're being ridiculous.

563
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:43,498
Xu Yan, you're stopping Mr. Gao

564
00:32:43,498 --> 00:32:44,218
from talking.

565
00:32:44,218 --> 00:32:45,498
Are you hiding something?

566
00:32:45,819 --> 00:32:46,419
Mr. Gao,

567
00:32:46,978 --> 00:32:48,698
there are many people
in the studio today.

568
00:32:48,738 --> 00:32:50,819
Everyone present can witness this.

569
00:32:50,859 --> 00:32:53,579
You don't need to be afraid.
No one can do anything to you.

570
00:32:54,258 --> 00:32:56,579
You just need to tell me clearly.

571
00:32:56,819 --> 00:32:59,458
Is the person in the photo you?

572
00:32:59,458 --> 00:33:02,139
Did you pretend to be Xu Yan's father?

573
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:24,859
No, that person is not me.

574
00:33:27,058 --> 00:33:28,258
He looks a lot like him.

575
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:31,058
Aren't they the same?

576
00:33:31,058 --> 00:33:32,139
Is he serious?

577
00:33:37,339 --> 00:33:38,978
Look carefully before you speak.

578
00:33:39,819 --> 00:33:40,859
I have looked carefully.

579
00:33:41,538 --> 00:33:43,738
I can't possibly not recognize myself.

580
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:50,579
This photo is quite clear.

581
00:33:50,579 --> 00:33:52,899
The facial features
are from the same person.

582
00:33:53,258 --> 00:33:55,379
If you say it's not you, tell me,

583
00:33:55,379 --> 00:33:57,258
what were you doing
on September 20th this year?

584
00:33:57,258 --> 00:33:59,018
Did you go to Xu Yan's wedding?

585
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:01,218
Miss Sun.

586
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:04,939
I admit that I'm in that photo.

587
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:07,218
But I'm not in this photo.

588
00:34:07,538 --> 00:34:09,339
If I had such an aura and demeanor,

589
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:11,018
would I still be doing this job?

590
00:34:11,859 --> 00:34:14,498
Yes, this gentleman
may look a bit like me.

591
00:34:14,779 --> 00:34:17,178
But in this world,
let alone just looking alike,

592
00:34:17,299 --> 00:34:19,299
there are even people
who look exactly the same.

593
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:21,978
Even their own parents
might not recognize them, right?

594
00:34:23,178 --> 00:34:24,939
How do you explain
knowing each other before?

595
00:34:25,018 --> 00:34:26,178
How did you know each other?

596
00:34:27,138 --> 00:34:29,138
Well, that's a long story.

597
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:33,819
Once, the Family Feast show
recruited off-site guests.

598
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:35,178
And I signed up.

599
00:34:35,498 --> 00:34:38,578
It happened to be Miss Xu
who received us.

600
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:41,219
Let me tell you,
Miss Xu was very enthusiastic.

601
00:34:41,458 --> 00:34:43,058
She looked after our meals every day.

602
00:34:43,178 --> 00:34:45,098
In the evening,
she even helped us go over...

603
00:34:45,138 --> 00:34:45,819
What's it again?

604
00:34:45,939 --> 00:34:47,018
You're talking nonsense!

605
00:34:48,138 --> 00:34:49,658
Stop the machines. Stop the recording.

606
00:34:49,978 --> 00:34:51,379
Has Ms. Sun gone crazy?

607
00:34:51,819 --> 00:34:53,058
This is clearly framing.

608
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:54,739
Sun Siwei,

609
00:34:55,538 --> 00:34:56,899
I'll show you more evidence.

610
00:34:58,058 --> 00:34:59,299
Huanhuan, give me the phone.

611
00:35:02,299 --> 00:35:05,618
Mr. Gao, you have
a birthmark here, right?

612
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:06,259
Yes.

613
00:35:06,739 --> 00:35:07,699
I have a birthmark here.

614
00:35:07,978 --> 00:35:09,299
Look, here it is.

615
00:35:09,779 --> 00:35:11,219
Look here.

616
00:35:16,178 --> 00:35:17,379
Put it onto the big screen.

617
00:35:17,578 --> 00:35:18,018
Okay.

618
00:35:19,699 --> 00:35:20,739
I'm sorry about today.

619
00:35:20,779 --> 00:35:21,978
It's alright.

620
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:24,419
I told the truth.

621
00:35:29,578 --> 00:35:30,538
Is this by script?

622
00:35:31,018 --> 00:35:32,058
I think so.

623
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:33,498
Is it real or not?

624
00:35:36,498 --> 00:35:38,739
All these materials given need to be...

625
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:41,538
I'm sorry.

626
00:35:42,578 --> 00:35:44,538
What's this here?

627
00:35:46,618 --> 00:35:48,259
A birthmark.
I've had it since childhood.

628
00:35:49,098 --> 00:35:51,339
It must be covered starting tomorrow.

629
00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:52,458
No problem.

630
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:53,859
My father has no birthmarks.

631
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:56,899
Do you believe it now?

632
00:36:09,939 --> 00:36:11,259
You colluded, right?

633
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:13,739
Setting me up, huh?

634
00:36:20,498 --> 00:36:21,739
I advise you to calm down.

635
00:36:39,419 --> 00:36:40,259
Don't worry.

636
00:36:40,379 --> 00:36:43,138
My demo is absolutely genuine

637
00:36:43,259 --> 00:36:44,458
and impactful enough.

638
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:47,018
It will definitely be unforgettable.

639
00:36:47,859 --> 00:36:48,578
Good luck.

640
00:36:48,859 --> 00:36:49,458
Thank you.

641
00:37:03,339 --> 00:37:04,018
Where are you?

642
00:37:05,498 --> 00:37:06,098
Let's meet.

643
00:37:07,018 --> 00:37:07,859
I understand.

644
00:37:08,178 --> 00:37:09,739
Miss Xu, please rest assured.

645
00:37:10,018 --> 00:37:11,739
I will never betray you.

646
00:37:21,058 --> 00:37:22,458
What do you mean, Sir?

647
00:37:22,498 --> 00:37:24,498
Why must I take a break for a while?

648
00:37:25,339 --> 00:37:26,578
Pause your work.

649
00:37:27,259 --> 00:37:28,419
Is it clear enough now?

650
00:37:29,018 --> 00:37:31,259
Your demo from last time's evaluation

651
00:37:31,899 --> 00:37:33,058
made such a big fuss.

652
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:36,578
The most infuriating thing
is that you lied to me.

653
00:37:37,178 --> 00:37:38,138
You stole my photo.

654
00:37:39,498 --> 00:37:40,939
It's lucky you haven't been fired.

655
00:37:41,658 --> 00:37:42,739
Don't push it.

656
00:37:43,339 --> 00:37:45,058
I was tricked too.

657
00:37:55,219 --> 00:37:57,098
Mom, Xu Yan is bullying me a lot.

658
00:37:57,219 --> 00:37:58,219
What happened this time?

659
00:37:58,899 --> 00:37:59,939
She's picking on me.

660
00:37:59,939 --> 00:38:00,859
You have to help me.

661
00:38:00,939 --> 00:38:02,458
How can I help with your work issues?

662
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:03,578
Handle it yourself.

663
00:38:04,138 --> 00:38:04,899
I don't care.

664
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:17,379
Sun Siwei,

665
00:38:19,379 --> 00:38:21,138
you're trying too hard to take me down.

666
00:38:22,178 --> 00:38:23,578
When you try too hard,

667
00:38:24,699 --> 00:38:25,899
it becomes ugly.

668
00:38:29,178 --> 00:38:30,739
Don't think because you married well,

669
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:32,978
you're actually someone important.

670
00:38:33,259 --> 00:38:35,219
You're not fit to shine my shoes.

671
00:38:36,739 --> 00:38:39,058
Your little tricks
that can't be presented

672
00:38:39,259 --> 00:38:41,098
can fool others but not me.

673
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:43,018
You're just a liar.

674
00:39:01,419 --> 00:39:02,458
Yes, I'm a liar.

675
00:39:05,618 --> 00:39:06,739
Even if I'm a liar,

676
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,219
I still have the ability

677
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:10,458
to turn you into a dog
begging me for food.

678
00:39:20,299 --> 00:39:20,899
Yan!

679
00:39:23,058 --> 00:39:23,658
Are you okay?

680
00:39:29,538 --> 00:39:30,618
What's with that acting?

681
00:39:34,219 --> 00:39:35,339
Are you Sun Siwei?

682
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:36,496
I am.

683
00:39:44,779 --> 00:39:46,658
Chen Lin, inform the Legal Department

684
00:39:47,339 --> 00:39:48,779
to drop everything they're doing

685
00:39:48,939 --> 00:39:50,178
and gather in the meeting room.

686
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:54,458
My wife is bullied at work. Let them
have a plan to hold her accountable.

687
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:55,498
She's Sun Siwei.

688
00:39:59,018 --> 00:39:59,498
Let's go.

689
00:40:13,058 --> 00:40:14,299
All departments, get ready.

690
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:15,098
Host, get ready.

691
00:40:15,419 --> 00:40:16,138
Counting down.

692
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:16,978
Five.

693
00:40:17,379 --> 00:40:17,978
Four.

694
00:40:18,339 --> 00:40:18,899
Three.

695
00:40:19,339 --> 00:40:19,899
Two.

696
00:40:20,498 --> 00:40:21,098
One.

697
00:40:21,379 --> 00:40:23,058
Hello, audience.

698
00:40:23,299 --> 00:40:24,899
(The NASDAQ hits a record high)
Welcome to Financial News.

699
