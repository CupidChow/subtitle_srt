1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The day we never parted, I was the most romantic

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Who doesn't know that I've failed again, and I cry from then on

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Even now, I'm still not satisfied

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You're not surprised, happiness is so hard to solve

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's strange, the magic of being followed

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,380
The most exciting part of the

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,000
I want to try it out

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Who's not sorry for who

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Everything is good

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The love you want

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
When the world is laughing

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Only love can make me happy

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Living is not boring

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
How good it is to be ignorant

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm better without you

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
How perfect the trick is

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
How annoying the trick is

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I can't turn back

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I hope we're both good

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It should be that the work afterwards was smooth

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The work was smooth

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Okay

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's my honor to meet you

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Isu nana guna fie

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Isu

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Isu nana guna fie

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Isu nana

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Your tongue can't roll up, right?

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Your tongue can't roll up

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's too much

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I can't control it, calm down, don't be impulsive

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'll think of a way

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Isu nana guna fie

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Isu nana guna fie

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Okay, I'll get it

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Please send me their names and stuff

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Isu nana guna fie

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Mr. Liang, Mr. Liang

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Come on, let me give you a toast

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Thank you, thank you for cooperating with us

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You've done so much for us, thank you

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's okay, I'll be one of our cast

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
If you need anything, just tell me

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
No problem, no problem

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Cheers

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Mr. Qin, cheers

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Cheers

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's a free meal

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You're still thin

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Forget it

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Thank you, Mr. Chen

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We can eat anytime

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The plan is pretty good

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We've been waiting for you and Lingling

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Don't worry, thank you

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Cheers

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The drink is pretty good

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's the character of Qiao Lin

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
She can talk to anyone

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's okay

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's good

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Qiao Liang is really something

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I have to control her

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I have to get her

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Hello, Mr. Jiang

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Please come in

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm her assistant

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Hello, sister

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Thank you for your hard work

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Cheers

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Let's have a toast

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Thank you, Mr. Liang

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Sister Yan

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Thank you

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Thank you for your hard work

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Thank you for taking us to this point

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You've worked so hard

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Your work proves everything

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It will get better and better

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Cheers

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Sister Yan

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I have so much to tell you

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
From the beginning, I felt like...

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I felt like...

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Let's play a game

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Have you played the social security watch?

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
If you hit the red heart, I'll transfer 10,000

88
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Mr. Xu

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You have to be the first one

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Come on

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Hurry up

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
No, you guys go first

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Come on

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Hurry up

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Let's play together

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You guys play

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
If Mr. Shen doesn't want to play

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Let's play by ourselves, Mr. Xu

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Let's play together

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Come on

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Let's play

102
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'll play with them first

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'll go first

104
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I got it

105
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
If you have an emergency, you can go first

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I want to say thank you

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Thank you for coming

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'll drink it

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Have fun

110
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'll drink it

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm good at playing the watch

112
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'll do it

113
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'll go and have a look

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'll play with them

115
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Come on

116
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Let's drink

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Come on

118
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Let's drink

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Drink less

120
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You're in a bad mood

121
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You're easily drunk

122
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Who says I'm in a bad mood?

123
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm in a good mood

124
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Why are you pretending to me?

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm watching you here

126
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Xu Yan didn't leave you tonight

127
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
There are only two words on your face

128
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Eat

129
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You're drunk

130
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm not drunk

131
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Brother-in-law

132
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm telling you

133
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I've had enough of it

134
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Enough

135
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I've tried everything I can

136
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I've tried everything I can to chase him

137
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
He won't come back

138
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Brother-in-law

139
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I won't talk to him anymore

140
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I won't talk to him anymore

141
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
No, I won't

142
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I won't call him again

143
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
If I call him again

144
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It won't work

145
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Don't drink

146
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Sister

147
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Meng Zhao has sent the prize back

148
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Let's go

149
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Wait

150
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
There is one last high note

151
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You sing so well

152
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Let's go

153
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Why are you leaving?

154
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Sit down

155
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Drink more

156
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You're drunk

157
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm not drunk

158
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm not happy if you say so

159
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm so happy

160
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm happy

161
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I think everything is great now

162
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Drink with me

163
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
This is to quench your thirst

164
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Okay

165
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You said you were unhappy to let him go

166
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You should have kept him for a while

167
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You're not happy when he's gone

168
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm not unhappy

169
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm very happy

170
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You're acting

171
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I can't see it

172
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I have you

173
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You will love me

174
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I still have Yan Yifan

175
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So many things that make me happy

176
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
He can leave if he wants to

177
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Don't turn around

178
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Go boldly

179
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Don't turn around

180
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I won't turn around

181
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I won't turn around either

182
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It doesn't matter

183
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Who cares?

184
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Who cares if he loves me or not?

185
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Drink

186
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Don't drink

187
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's not my mouth

188
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yan Yan

189
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yan Yan, answer the phone

190
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's time

191
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yan Yan, answer the phone

192
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Come down

193
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You said you wouldn't call me again

194
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I tell you

195
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's more annoying for you to call someone when you're drunk

196
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yan Yan won't call me

197
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
He loves me, right?

198
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yan Yan

199
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yan Yan

200
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Hao Miao

201
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I tell you

202
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You're going to lose your shoes

203
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I don't want to lose Yan Yan

204
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I love you

205
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Answer the phone

206
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Why did you open the window?

207
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I heard someone calling me

208
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Who?

209
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I didn't hear you

210
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Let me go

211
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Who called me?

212
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
No one

213
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Okay

214
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Hurry

215
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm so sad

216
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm going home

217
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Okay, go home

218
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
We'll be there soon

219
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
No

220
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
This is not my home

221
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's not your home

222
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
No, it's my home

223
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
My home is not this way

224
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
My home is located in the east of the city, No. 33

225
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Where is this?

226
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
This is the way to your home

227
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
No

228
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Master called me

229
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
No, where are you going?

230
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Xiaodong

231
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Don't go to someone else's home

232
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's not someone else's home

233
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That's my home

234
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Where is this? I don't know

235
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
My home

236
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Isn't your home in the port?

237
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm sorry

238
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's not your home

239
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Wait, wait

240
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
No

241
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Think about it

242
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Where is this?

243
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Don't go to someone else's home

244
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm telling you

245
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Okay, okay, okay

246
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm back

247
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Come back

248
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'll be back soon

249
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Grandma

250
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'll be back soon

251
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Gao Huo

252
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm done

253
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Don't look

254
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm back

255
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Well

256
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I drank too much last night

257
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's okay

258
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
No one will know I'm here

259
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Anyway

260
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Who is it?

261
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Sister, you're awake

262
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's almost noon

263
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Get up

264
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Why is she here?

265
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Why are you here?

266
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm here too

267
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Sister

268
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You broke the day yesterday

269
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Do you want to know what happened yesterday?

270
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Get dressed

271
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Watch the replay downstairs

272
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You, you, you wear it

273
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's okay

274
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You wear it first

275
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I don't look

276
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I don't look

277
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You got it

278
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You got it

279
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm sorry

280
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Don't move

281
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Slow down

282
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Slow down

283
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Brother-in-law, you're so nice

284
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You're so nice

285
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You're so nice to drink with me

286
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Okay, okay

287
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You're home

288
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Okay

289
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
This is a bar

290
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's not a bar

291
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You're home

292
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's a bar

293
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's a beautiful bar

294
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Sit down

295
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Sit down

296
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's a bar

297
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm here

298
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Grandma

299
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Grandma

300
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Grandma

301
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Grandma

302
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Grandma

303
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Why are you here?

304
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Isn't it so safe?

305
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm home

306
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm a little bit jealous

307
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm home

308
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Why did you drink so much?

309
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I don't know

310
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Why did you drink so much?

311
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't know why

312
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I have a strange man in my life

313
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's late

314
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You should go home now

315
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
What?

316
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Who are you?

317
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Who are you?

318
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Sister

319
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
This is my bar

320
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
This is my bar

321
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Why are you here?

322
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
This is my home

323
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
This is my bar

324
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
My home

325
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
My bar

326
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Mine

327
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Why did you bring her here?

328
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
She's so noisy

329
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I thought

330
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
She had to come here

331
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and let the driver hang herself

332
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I thought

333
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Stop talking nonsense

334
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's not that exaggerated

335
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm just talking

336
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm not exaggerating

337
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
If I exaggerate, I'll be mad at you

338
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Forget it

339
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You're not mad at me

340
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Well

341
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Brother

342
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You two

343
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You two stayed here for a night yesterday, right?

344
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You're always

345
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
the same

346
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The last second was like a fire

347
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
The next second was like a pepper

348
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I want to go

349
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Brother, put me down

350
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'll tell you

351
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'll count to three

352
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Put me down now

353
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Count

354
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Three

355
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Three

356
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Three

357
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Four

358
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Don't say

359
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Two

360
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Honey

361
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You're so beautiful

362
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
My husband thinks you're so beautiful

363
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You're finally home

364
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You just heard me

365
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I was calling your name

366
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I knew you were calling me

367
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's good to hear

368
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Let's go

369
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Wait

370
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Put me down

371
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Put me down now

372
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Who is this person?

373
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Where's my wedding photo?

374
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Who is this back?

375
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Don't worry, wait for me

376
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
This is my back

377
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
No

378
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Don't lie to me

379
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
This is thinner

380
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
See

381
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
This is much thinner than you

382
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Right?

383
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
This is my past

384
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
This

385
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I face my wife alone

386
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Here

387
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
My wife is beautiful

388
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Here

389
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Honey

390
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Honey

391
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Fry the fish first

392
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Ok?

393
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Two sides of the golden

394
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm hungry

395
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I should be fine

396
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Which one do you want to eat?

397
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
This one

398
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
This one

399
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
This one

400
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Here

401
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
None of them are quiet

402
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What if something happens?

403
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
We'd better not go

404
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Right

405
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
As long as we can get rid of the fire

406
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Don't do this

407
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Don't do this

408
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's cold

409
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's cold

410
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Let's go to the bedroom

411
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
The bedroom is here

412
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I hope you can continue to be wonderful

413
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You don't know

414
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You two are too crazy

415
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Stay there

416
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Don't let her take it

417
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm afraid you two will catch a cold

418
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You know?

419
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So I sent you up

420
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's not too old

421
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Ok

422
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Stop talking

423
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Let's go

424
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's hard to let go

425
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'll take her to the cinema

426
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Go

427
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Go

428
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I want to go to the cinema with you

429
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You want to go with her

430
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I have to go to the cinema

431
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm leaving

432
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Go

433
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
How about we...

434
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I have to go to work today

435
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I have to go to work too

436
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I came with my bag yesterday

437
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'll help you find it

438
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Thank you

439
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Let me see

440
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I'll find it too

441
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Let me see

442
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
No

443
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
No?

444
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
No?

445
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Let me see

446
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Where is it?

447
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Over there

448
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Yes

449
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I found it

450
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I'll go now

451
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Let's have a meal first

452
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Okay

453
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
What do you want to eat?

454
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Anything

455
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
What?

456
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I want to eat

457
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'll go to the cinema

458
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'll go to the cinema

459
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'll go to the cinema

460
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Haoming

461
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I bought you food

462
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Are you home?

463
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I think she left

464
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
She left

465
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I haven't left yet

466
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Good morning, mom

467
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Look at this

468
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It's very beautiful and very practical

469
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I can make this

470
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I can make this

471
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Taoist

472
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's very good

473
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Very good

474
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Not bad

475
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You did a good job

476
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Go to work

477
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You go to work

478
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Okay, I'll go too

479
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Let me walk

480
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I want to go to the cinema

481
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You're so cute

482
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Mom, do you want to have a meal?

483
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Three chickens and six girls

484
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Yes

485
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'll buy some breakfast

486
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
How about

487
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'll help you

488
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Let me help

489
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Mom

490
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You eat this first

491
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You like to eat this at home

492
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'll have some

493
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'll have some

494
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Yanyan

495
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Mom, congratulations on winning the competition

496
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Haoming is very happy for Zhen's club

497
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Right, Haoming?

498
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Yes

499
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Haoming has helped me a lot recently

500
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
So I want to thank him

501
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I want to ask you a favor

502
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I want to invite my girlfriend to have a party at home

503
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You know her favorite

504
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
You can come back to help me plan

505
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
No problem

506
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I'll go back and choose some plans for you

507
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Mom, you can ask Chenchen in advance

508
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
If she has any ideas

509
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Okay?

510
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Thank you for coming with me

511
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Chenchen will be very happy to see you back

512
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Haoming will be happy too

513
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Right?

514
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Okay

515
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'll check the time

516
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It's settled

517
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
You like to eat this too?

518
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Mom

519
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm really going back to the company to work today

520
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I haven't gone back to pack up

521
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Take a document

522
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Well

523
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
You eat slowly

524
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I'll go first

525
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Well

526
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Haoming, please have a look

527
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
No need

528
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You stay here and enjoy your meal

529
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
What do you mean by that?

530
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I'm going to have a look

531
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Hot?

532
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
No

533
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Do you want to turn on the air conditioner?

534
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
No

535
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
How about listening to some music?

536
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Okay

537
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I'll go first

538
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Let's turn it off

539
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Turn it off

540
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
My mom is like this

541
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
She says whatever she wants

542
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
She doesn't care about others' feelings

543
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
No

544
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I think it's good

545
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
She's straightforward

546
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
She doesn't hide it

547
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
By the way

548
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
By the way

549
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You go first

550
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
How's Yan Yifang recently?

551
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Very good

552
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
After the competition ended

553
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Sales returned to normal

554
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
So our third batch

555
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Has been in the factory

556
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
That's good

557
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I see online

558
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Now everyone is talking about hand-made products

559
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I think it's good

560
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I think it's good

561
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I think it's good

562
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I see online

563
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Now everyone is very much

564
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:45,360
Acknowledged about hand-made

565
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I think it should be very special

566
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
But this craft

567
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Is to learn in advance

568
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
That's good

569
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
What did you want to ask me?

570
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I want to ask you

571
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
How's your cooperation with Mr. Barlai?

572
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Very good

573
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
And

574
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Mrs. Barlai

575
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Very concerned about your situation

576
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
correct

577
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I want to thank him

578
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I've been too busy lately

579
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Are you free tomorrow night?

580
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Let's have dinner together

581
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Okay

582
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I'll treat you

583
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
No, I'll do it

584
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Tomorrow at six o'clock

585
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I'll send you the address

586
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Okay

587
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I don't know Mr. Barlai

588
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Do you like fruit wine or foreign wine?

589
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Okay, I'll drink more

590
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Are you going to drink tomorrow?

591
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Of course

592
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I drank with him

593
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I'm not happy

594
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I tell you

595
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Wine is a good thing

596
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
After drinking too much

597
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Can pull everyone closer

598
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Increase feeling

599
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
You don't drink tomorrow

600
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I can drink

601
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I'll drink more

602
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
You want to cheer up

603
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I will cheer up

604
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
You should cheer up

605
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I'm going to cheer up

606
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
The board and fabric

607
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Have been matched with the factory

608
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
They will do our clothes first

609
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
The third batch of new time

610
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Should be ready in advance

611
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Don't be so serious

612
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
The factory manager

613
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I don't know how fast the change is

614
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I can't wait to put it on

615
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Who let us win the award?

616
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So

617
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Only the truth is the truth

618
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Strong yourself

619
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
The whole world will smile at you

620
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
You keep an eye on the factory

621
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
No problem

622
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Let's open it here today

623
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Go back early

624
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Go to bed early

625
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I'll give you a little rest

626
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Are you busy tonight?

627
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Yes

628
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Come

629
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Hello

630
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Who is the person in charge of Yan Yifang?

631
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Hello, I am Xu Yan

632
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Let me introduce myself

633
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I am Gu Beizhen

634
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:03,840
Head of the

635
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I will tell you my purpose this time

636
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
This is our publicity book in Gu Beizhen

637
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Please have a look

638
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
This is our Nian Sujie

639
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Cao Muran publicity page

640
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Please have a look

641
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
We have a feature in Gu Beizhen

642
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Not Cao Muran

643
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Know you help other places

644
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
The handmade paper is promoted

645
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I was thinking

646
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Can you come to us

647
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Help Cao Muran promote

648
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
We happen to have a plan

649
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
To do this series

650
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I'm right

651
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Great great

652
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
To be honest, two

653
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
We are for the publicity of Gu Beizhen

654
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
There are plans and invitations

655
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
A batch of bloggers come to our place to investigate

656
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
We have to dig out different publicity points

657
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
But Cao Muran

658
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
It's not your company's fault

659
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Thank you

660
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Thank you, Director Zhang

661
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Trust Yan Yifang

662
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
We are very interested in the craft of Cao Muran

663
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I will contact you again for specific cooperation

664
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I have to learn in advance

665
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Related to Cao Muran

666
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Xu Dong

667
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
We have Cao Muran workshop in town

668
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
You can come

669
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I have arranged the experience for you

670
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Correct

671
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
This is our Gu Beizhen

672
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
The invitation letter to you

673
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
it is good

674
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Thank you so much

675
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Thank you very much

676
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
That's it

677
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I'll send you

678
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
No need no need

679
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
You help you

680
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
See you in town

681
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Goodbye

682
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Take care

683
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
What do you want to do?

684
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
The new idea is not successful

685
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
By the way

686
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
We collected the related information about Cao Muran

687
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Let's have a meeting

688
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
it is good

689
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Director Xu

690
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
go

691
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Where to go

692
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
He found a very delicious Yunnan dish

693
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Go

694
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Together

695
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I have something to do today

696
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I'm leaving

697
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
gone

698
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Let's go

699
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I have something to do too

700
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
No, it's just the two of us

701
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Just the two of us

702
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
No

703
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It's so beautiful here

704
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Super beautiful

705
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
coming

706
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Long time no see

707
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Long time no see

708
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Welcome welcome

709
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Mr. Shen, see you again

710
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Hello

711
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It's ready inside

712
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
OK, thank you

713
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Thank you

714
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Thank you

715
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Hello

716
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
So anxious to be back

717
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Miss Xu

718
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
What's the matter with you, Steve?

719
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I just want to give you

720
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
A kind reminder

721
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I don't need your reminder

722
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Thank you

723
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
You don't want to know

724
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Shen Haoming

725
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
What is the purpose of calling you this time?

726
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Income

727
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Still with him

728
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It seems that Shen Haoming

729
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
It's hard to trick Miss Xu

730
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Maybe you don't know yet

731
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Barlai team is very good

732
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I think

733
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Shen Haoming

734
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I think it's a good idea

735
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
But you don't know yet

736
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Barlai team is for Jinta Group

737
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
There are three months of assessment period

738
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
When Yan Yifang is in trouble

739
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
He will help you solve the problem

740
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Have you ever thought about it?

741
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
The purpose of what he did

742
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Just to stabilize you

743
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Don't let you get divorced

744
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
All of it

745
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
It's just a business consideration

746
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Not love you

747
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
How long are you going to stay in Jingzhou this time?

748
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I came with my husband this time

749
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
He is talking about this time

750
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
It's about a cross-country cooperation examination

751
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
By the way

752
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Your husband's company is in our cooperation

753
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Candidate list

754
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
But it will be for all the candidate companies

755
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
There are three months of examination period

756
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Then wait for the good news three months later

757
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
When Shen Haoming was interviewed

758
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Love wife

759
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Love is more than gold

760
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
It's really moving

761
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
If the business world has Oscar

762
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Must be his magic

763
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
By the way

764
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Shen Haoming was interviewed for two days

765
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
The stock of Jingda

766
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Pulled two up

767
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It seems that the vast shareholder

768
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I really want to see

769
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Love is more than gold

770
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
The magic couple who support each other

771
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
The trick of the little god

772
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Not only helped you

773
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Let the couple of Balajing see it

774
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
And also made a big fortune on the stock

775
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
It's just a three birds with one stone

776
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
This is admirable

777
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
As far as I know

778
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Today's dinner

779
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Just to make the couple of Balajing believe

780
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
You are a magic couple

781
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Stable relationship

782
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
He also bought a marketing account

783
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Ready to take a picture of you two near the restaurant

784
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Send some romance short stories

785
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Do a show

786
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
If Shen Haoming

787
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Got the cooperation of Balajing

788
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
He entered the board of directors

789
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
It's probably not a matter of time

790
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Maybe it's still a matter of time

791
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Are you done

792
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Almost

793
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I just want to remind you

794
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
In the business world

795
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
But still have to think about it

796
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I'm sorry

797
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I'm sorry

798
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I'm sorry

799
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I'm sorry

800
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I'm sorry

801
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I'm sorry

802
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I'm sorry

803
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I'm sorry

804
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I'm sorry

805
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I'm sorry

806
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I'm sorry

807
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I'm sorry

808
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I'm sorry

809
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I'm sorry

810
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I'm sorry

811
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I'm sorry

812
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I'm sorry

813
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I'm sorry

814
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I'm sorry

815
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I'm sorry

816
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I'm sorry

817
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I'm sorry

818
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I'm sorry

819
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I'm sorry

820
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I'm sorry

821
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I'm sorry

822
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I'm sorry

823
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I'm sorry

824
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I'm sorry

825
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I'm sorry

826
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I'm sorry

827
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I'm sorry

828
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I'm sorry

829
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I'm sorry

830
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I'm sorry

831
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Mr. Shen

832
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
In the three-month investigation

833
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
It's about to start

834
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I'm sorry I'm late.

835
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,920
Mr. Balajin.

836
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,680
Yan, I was just talking to you.

837
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,680
I haven't seen you for a long time.

838
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,440
My dear.

839
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,360
I'm so happy to see you.

840
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,520
Yan Yifang has been busy lately.

841
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,600
I can't help it.

842
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,960
I should have come to visit you earlier.

843
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,920
You deserve it.

844
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,200
I brought you tea and tea for Mr. Balajin.

845
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,280
Thank you. You're too kind.

846
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,280
I'm sorry.

847
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,240
I'm sorry.

848
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,240
I'm sorry.

849
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,320
I'm sorry.

850
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,400
I'm sorry.

851
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,480
I'm sorry.

852
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,560
I'm sorry.

853
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,640
I'm sorry.

854
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,360
You're too kind.

855
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,120
Let's sit down and talk.

856
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,120
Let me sit with Sister Sophia.

857
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,760
You remember my real name?

858
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,000
Why can't I remember it?

859
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,080
I feel like you've lost a lot of weight.

860
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,160
Really?

861
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,600
Miss Xu.

862
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,440
I've heard about the company.

863
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,120
Fortunately, there's no danger.

864
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,720
Yes.

865
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,600
Thanks to your wife.

866
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,520
She wore Yan Yifang's wedding dress.

867
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,840
She made us such a tough endorsement.

868
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,400
That's why we have the good results now.

869
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,800
And Yan Yifang's dress is excellent.

870
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,200
I saw Xiaosheng's interview.

871
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,360
I really admire her.

872
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,880
We men are

873
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,880
very honest and honest.

874
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,200
We don't like to be jealous.

875
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,760
But to be like Mr. Xiaosheng

876
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,000
and admit that his wife is better than him,

877
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,400
it's very rare.

878
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,520
Thank you.

879
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,840
Yes.

880
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,360
When Mr. Xiaosheng

881
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,560
asked me to pick a wedding dress for Yan Yifang,

882
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,440
I knew

883
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,720
he wanted to help you.

884
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,800
When I went back, I told my husband

885
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,200
how could they have a conflict?

886
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,320
If it wasn't for the love of someone,

887
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,480
he wouldn't have done it so well.

888
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,200
You're welcome.

889
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,560
It's my duty.

890
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,760
Yan Yan.

891
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,480
Let's have a drink with them.

892
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,920
I really want to thank my husband.

893
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,160
He has done a lot for me

894
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,720
behind my back.

895
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,560
I don't even know

896
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,520
what he has done.

897
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,480
Haoming.

898
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,440
This is for you.

899
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:45,880
Thank you.

900
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,560
Thank you.

901
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,320
Thank you.

902
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,120
Thank you.

903
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:48,920
Thank you.

904
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,680
Thank you.

905
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,440
Thank you.

906
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,080
Thank you.

907
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:51,920
Thank you.

908
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,680
Thank you.

909
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,520
Thank you.

910
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,320
You're welcome.

911
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,320
Thank you.

912
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,680
Baby,

913
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,920
if youま situations go well,

914
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,760
please invite them

915
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,240
to Russia for our dinner,

916
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,000
all right?

917
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,880
Okay.

918
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,400
Hua Sustainable Development Fund

919
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,120
Say,】 welcome!

920
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,000
Thank you.

921
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,120
Eat more.

922
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,920
Oh, don't forget to book a dress for me.

923
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,040
Don't worry. I will make it for you.

924
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,320
But it might take a while.

925
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,640
Then we will meet at the meeting room.

926
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,640
Looking forward to meeting you.

927
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,320
Goodbye.

928
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,040
Goodbye.

929
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,320
Goodbye, Mr. Bai Laijing.

930
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:37,920
Goodbye.

931
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,520
Let's go.

932
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,600
Miss Sui.

933
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,320
Goodbye.

934
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,400
Goodbye.

935
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,600
The wine is good today.

936
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,240
Yes.

937
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,120
I'm going back.

938
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,720
Yanyan.

939
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,920
I have finished the show for you.

940
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,320
Let me explain.

941
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,720
Did Mr. Bai Laijing give you

942
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,720
the three-month inspection period for Jinta?

943
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,120
You don't need to explain it to me.

944
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,120
You did help me.

945
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,520
But you also achieved

946
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,720
your dream.

947
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,120
You are not a good person.

948
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,320
You are not a good person.

949
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,520
But you also achieved

950
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,520
your own goal.

951
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,520
In order to get the cooperation,

952
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,920
you just used the people around you.

953
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,720
Is it your style

954
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,520
or the original you?

955
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,520
But now you can be a good husband.

956
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:43,720
OK.

957
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,520
I admit it.

958
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,120
I asked Mrs. Bai Laijing

959
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,520
to wear the dress of Yan Yufang

960
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,920
and the interview I received

961
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,320
to let Mr. Bai Laijing see it.

962
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,520
But I invited you here tonight

963
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,920
not to let you act.

964
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,320
But Mr. Bai Laijing still saw it.

965
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,720
You want him to see the fake image, right?

966
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,520
What fake image?

967
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,520
Are all the things

968
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,520
that happened

969
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,320
that we two have been together are fake?

970
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:13,920
It doesn't matter.

971
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,920
Mr. Bai Laijing.

972
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,320
The important thing is

973
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,120
if we continue to argue like this,

974
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,920
the marketing account you hired

975
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,520
may take unsatisfied photos.

976
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,520
Chunlin, come here.

977
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,520
Mr. Shen, Sister Yan.

978
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,120
The things she took

979
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,320
have been deleted.

980
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,120
I'm really just a police officer

981
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,520
who took photos of people.

982
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,120
Let's go.

983
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:56,920
Go.

984
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,320
That person is sneaky.

985
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,720
I want to know what he is doing.

986
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,320
Am I that stupid?

987
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,520
To hire a person like him to take photos?

988
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,120
To hire a person like him to take photos?

989
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,320
Isn't Chunlin better than him?

990
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,320
I understand.

991
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,720
The cooperation with Mr. Bai Laijing

992
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,520
is important to Jin Da.

993
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,120
But it's obvious that someone

994
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,720
wants to use our relationship

995
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,120
to make you lose the overseas market.

996
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,520
You also think someone wants to deal with me?

997
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,120
That Steve

998
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,720
can't look for me just once.

999
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,320
I know.

1000
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,920
The company behind him is called Situo.

1001
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,720
The whole background is mysterious.

1002
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,920
He is just a clown in front of the stage.

1003
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,520
But I really don't know

1004
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,720
what kind of person is behind him.

1005
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,720
This is not something I should worry about.

1006
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,520
It's you.

1007
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,720
I have paid off my debt.

1008
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,520
I wish you a smooth cooperation.

1009
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,320
I'm sorry.

1010
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,120
When did I ask you to pay me back?

1011
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,120
Am I that kind of person?

1012
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:11,920
I also want to know

1013
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,120
what kind of person you are.

1014
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,520
It's a pity that I can't see you clearly.

1015
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,320
But now I understand.

1016
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,520
If you want to help me in the future,

1017
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,720
I will accept it.

1018
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,120
After all, we are all adults.

1019
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,320
It's normal to pay attention to interests.

1020
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,320
The relationship between you and me

1021
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,120
is just to keep what we need.

1022
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,920
If you can't be a couple, just be friends.

1023
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,320
Take care.

1024
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:41,120
I was afraid of the stars and not afraid of the wind

1025
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:47,920
I'm not afraid of burning even if the moment is shining

1026
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,720
Just cry

1027
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:57,120
Who is more afraid of fire and freedom than love

1028
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:03,520
If I have been with you, it's enough

1029
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,520
I just want to take my time tonight

1030
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,520
Do all the things

1031
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,520
I just want to take my time tonight

1032
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,520
Do all the things

1033
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,520
I just want to take my time tonight

1034
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,520
Do all the things

1035
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,520
I just want to take my time tonight

1036
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,520
Do all the things

1037
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,520
I just want to take my time tonight

1038
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,520
Do all the things

1039
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,520
I just want to take my time tonight

1040
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,520
Do all the things

1041
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,520
I just want to take my time tonight

1042
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,520
Do all the things

1043
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,520
I just want to take my time tonight

1044
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,520
Do all the things

1045
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,520
I just want to take my time tonight
