1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
The Legend of repair

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,360
I'm not surprised.

3
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,000
Happiness is hard to know.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,840
The magic of being cursed.

5
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,000
The day we met again,

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
how have you been?

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I want to remind you that I'm miserable.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Who is not regretful?

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Everything about me is good.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm not sad.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm not sad.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm not sad.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Everything about me is good.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The love you want to live.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let the world run away.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Listen to the laughter of love.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Or it's not boring.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
How good it is to be ignorant.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm better without you.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
How hard it is to be perfect.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Let's look back.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I hope we are all good.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm at the bridge we met for the first time.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I saw the small and bright cloth.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Okay, I'm hanging up.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Thank you, boss.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This pattern is so beautiful.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
See if you like it.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This small bag is cotton.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This is hand-sewn.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I like to wear it.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Is it beautiful?

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I want this.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Can I see this?

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You have a good taste.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Because I dyed it myself.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Each one is different.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I really like this color.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Look.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Is it beautiful?

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yes.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So beautiful.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You look beautiful.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Thank you.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I want both.

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Okay.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
How much?

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll give you a little cheaper. 300.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay.

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Boss.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You said you made it yourself.

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yes.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm fine.

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I've done it.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Okay.

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I want to ask.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Is there any secret in this different blue?

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I came to Gubei to learn how to dye grass.

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So I want to ask you.

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Now there are few young people who like grass dye.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I can't talk about it.

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
How about we communicate?

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Actually, I've learned a lot.

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The key to the blue dye of ancient methods is to make electric blue.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But the proportion and time must be well controlled.

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
For example, grass ash is not the right proportion.

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Or the fermentation time is not enough.

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The blue will turn gray.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So this is not everyone can do it as well as you.

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
No.

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I went to the exhibition hall of the dye workshop.

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I saw a work of a master of the first winter wind.

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's really good.

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But it's a pity.

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It seems that I can't find the blue in life.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So I won't make any more works.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Now I'm alone.

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I can only live by selling some fruits and vegetables.

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I don't have any contact with others.

83
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm alone.

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's a pity.

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's not a pity.

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's a life.

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You know it?

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
No.

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Gu Beizhen is so big.

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
He's a talented man.

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Find an excuse.

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
For so many years,

93
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
his works are repeating themselves.

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He can't keep up with the trend of art.

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's a pity.

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You're so talented.

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The dye pattern I saw in the exhibition hall

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
is very similar to the one I bought just now.

99
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Did you create it together?

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You know my relationship with him?

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm here to tell you

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
that Master Chu didn't give up on the dye technique.

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
He can't find the blue in life.

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
To be honest,

105
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm here to...

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Enough.

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I told you.

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You're so young.

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Why do you like the grass and wood dye?

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Please go back and tell him

111
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
not to think about my blue dye.

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Mrs. Chu,

113
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I think you should go back and tell him

114
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
that you don't like the grass and wood dye.

115
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Mrs. Chu,

116
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I think you're in a period of anger.

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You can sit down and have a good talk.

118
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Let Master Chu explain it to you.

119
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Or you can cooperate with him.

120
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I believe...

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Cooperate?

122
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Why should I cooperate with him?

123
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I have something to do.

124
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll go first.

125
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Well...

126
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Hello?

127
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
How's it going over there?

128
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Is it going well?

129
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Not so good.

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I posted a video on your phone.

131
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Take a look.

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Master Chu?

133
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Master Chu.

134
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Master Chu.

135
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Master Chu.

136
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Master Chu.

137
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Hello.

138
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Is that Chu Dongfeng?

139
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I don't know him.

140
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But he's always here.

141
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
He's like a New Year card.

142
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
He's always dressed up.

143
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He's mysterious.

144
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Thank you.

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The traditional Chinese traditional Chinese magic

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
can be applied in the practical life

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
and can cross the line with many art styles.

148
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Master Chu?

149
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Why did he go to study

150
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and do it so secretly?

151
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And he's dressed up as a New Year card.

152
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
New Year card?

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But Mrs. Chu told me

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
that Master Chu didn't go in.

155
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He's already studied.

156
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
He's changing.

157
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Why did he hide it and not tell her?

158
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's not easy to change yourself.

159
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I guess he's afraid that Mrs. Chu

160
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
won't believe him

161
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
because he's pretending.

162
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Shen Haoming?

163
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Don't tell me it's a coincidence.

164
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It really is.

165
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Hello, Suofei?

166
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Why did you divorce Mr. Shen?

167
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
He has already

168
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
confessed about you two

169
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
in the冷靜期.

170
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But my husband decided to sign with him.

171
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
After all, he's good enough.

172
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Are you okay?

173
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Sister Chunlin.

174
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Come.

175
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Drink some soda.

176
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Thank you, Sister Chunlin.

177
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Isn't this what Mr. Chu borrowed from?

178
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yes.

179
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I just saw Mrs. Chu.

180
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
She left it by accident.

181
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm about to return it to her.

182
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Mr. Chu gave it to her when she got married.

183
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's been a few decades.

184
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
This is very important to her.

185
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Of course.

186
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You two talk.

187
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So, look.

188
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Mrs. Chu is obviously very worried.

189
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
She's also stubborn.

190
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
She can be sensitive.

191
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But she can't tell the truth.

192
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I think they're just talking.

193
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Why can't they face their own heart?

194
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's not a difficult thing.

195
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Let me tell you.

196
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Since then,

197
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I've never met anyone like you.

198
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Since then,

199
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I've never met anyone like you.

200
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Since this hairpin is so important,

201
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
quickly return it to Mrs. Chu.

202
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Maybe this is fate.

203
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,440
I'm just an office worker

204
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,080
for two months

205
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,300
You should go back

206
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,680
Where is it?

207
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,540
Why are you here?

208
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,700
A maid gave it to me

209
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,960
done for you?

210
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,940
Why?

211
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,880
She was at the cafe on the mountain

212
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,500
and wants to see you

213
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,540
She gives it to me

214
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,700
in case you won't believe me

215
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,440
It's not true

216
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,640
Tell her you're not interested.

217
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,280
Mr. Huang.

218
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,080
Mrs. Chu.

219
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,320
It's you.

220
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,080
Well, do you have

221
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,880
an important hairpin?

222
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,600
How do you know?

223
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,600
Did you pick it up?

224
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,160
No.

225
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,880
Master Chu picked it up.

226
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,080
He said he was waiting for you

227
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,280
at the cafe on the mountain.

228
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,400
In his hands?

229
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,000
What a bad luck!

230
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,520
By the way, Wang Jian.

231
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,000
Help me to fix it.

232
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,040
Okay.

233
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,080
Thank you, Wang Jian.

234
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,000
You!

235
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,480
Why did you take my stuff?

236
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,680
Well...

237
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,200
You asked me to come here.

238
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,480
The sun is still shining.

239
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,120
What are you talking about?

240
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,120
It's not the time for you to be late.

241
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,440
They won't quarrel, right?

242
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,480
I don't think so.

243
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,120
Why?

244
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,320
Well, they...

245
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,240
Look.

246
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,280
We're all good now.

247
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,400
Well...

248
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,000
Really?

249
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,280
But he doesn't seem to be happy.

250
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,800
Liar!

251
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,200
Something's wrong.

252
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,040
Master Chu.

253
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,520
Master Chu.

254
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,400
Master.

255
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:34,920
Liar.

256
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,280
I admit...

257
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,320
You're a liar!

258
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,680
I admit I lied to you.

259
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,640
But it was a good opportunity.

260
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,880
Why didn't you help me?

261
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,000
With your bad opportunity,

262
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,720
I don't want you to give it to anyone you like.

263
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,040
Master. Master.

264
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,720
It's hard to be a man.

265
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,280
If you regret to divorce,

266
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,280
you should be generous.

267
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,320
Stop talking nonsense.

268
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,400
I regret to tell you.

269
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,800
Because I regretted it too.

270
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,560
I was like you.

271
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,680
I thought I was right.

272
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,600
I lost the most important person in my life.

273
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,720
He gave me a chance.

274
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,240
I couldn't let go of my pride.

275
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,840
I didn't dare to admit that he was still in my heart.

276
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,040
When he was disappointed,

277
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,800
he didn't want to believe

278
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,120
whatever I did.

279
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,200
What happened?

280
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:25,880
Master.

281
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,680
If you want to know the answer,

282
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,440
why don't you try it yourself?

283
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,720
It's not embarrassing

284
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,920
to admit that you still love him.

285
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,120
Don't be afraid that he won't accept it.

286
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,480
Say it twice.

287
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,680
Let me tell you.

288
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,280
You said so much to me.

289
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,160
He's not interested in me anymore.

290
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,320
Then why did he

291
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,720
wear that wedding jewelry?

292
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,000
Isn't it obvious enough?

293
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,360
He divorced.

294
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,840
Why didn't he find another one?

295
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,520
Don't make excuses

296
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,280
because of your own courage.

297
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,640
It's a man's business to take the initiative.

298
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,320
You dyed so much blue.

299
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,680
Why is it different from that?

300
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,000
Because you know very well

301
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,680
that he's the one you're waiting for.

302
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,120
Madam.

303
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,160
Wait.

304
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,920
Wait for me.

305
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,440
My feet.

306
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,800
Miss.

307
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,360
You're too much.

308
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,680
I know. I'm sorry.

309
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,040
But I didn't mean to.

310
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,080
I have no bad intentions.

311
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,960
I just want to

312
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,800
give you and Master Chu

313
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,680
a chance

314
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,040
to sit down and have a good chat.

315
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,400
Who are you?

316
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,200
It's none of your business.

317
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,120
I don't need it.

318
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,360
Madam.

319
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,680
I don't know what Master Chu

320
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,920
told you just now.

321
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,880
But you're really important to him.

322
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,000
Just say it.

323
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,920
I'm important.

324
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,560
I know my place.

325
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,040
He just wanted to make me blue.

326
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,120
This is the misunderstanding itself.

327
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,880
He can dye that ink blue.

328
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,880
The reason why he can't make a work now

329
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,360
is because he can't find inspiration

330
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,680
without you.

331
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,760
I understand.

332
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,120
I can understand your feelings

333
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,280
because I've also experienced

334
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,200
the same confusion and uncertainty as you.

335
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,960
I saw that the other party did a lot for me.

336
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,280
But I'm also suspecting

337
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,560
if he's pure enough for me

338
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,160
or if he wants something else

339
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,360
for me.

340
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,120
I was thinking

341
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,760
if he really cares about me

342
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,600
or if he cares about

343
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,280
the convenience I can bring him.

344
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,040
This time, I came to

345
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,280
Gubei Town

346
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,720
and met Master Ning and Master Chu.

347
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,920
I heard your love stories.

348
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,760
So I decided

349
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,280
to give our love

350
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,400
another chance.

351
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,000
I was only concerned about

352
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,160
the other party.

353
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,960
Instead of being suspicious

354
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,280
like now,

355
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,600
I'd rather believe

356
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,720
that all the efforts he made

357
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
were for you.

358
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,720
By the way,

359
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,560
let me show you something.

360
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,160
Look at this.

361
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,560
Master Chu.

362
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,880
You sneaked into the workshop to see the exhibition.

363
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,040
It's still a year's ticket.

364
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,280
So,

365
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,040
he did make some changes.

366
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,840
But he didn't say it.

367
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,280
It led to the deeper misunderstanding

368
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,080
between you two.

369
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,400
That's why he's like this now.

370
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,080
We went to his house.

371
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,520
There are many blues in his yard.

372
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,760
I know

373
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,440
you should believe that

374
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,120
with his skills,

375
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,280
he won't be able to paint

376
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,040
the same color as you.

377
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,520
But he left all the paint on one side.

378
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,080
You want to figure it out now.

379
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,080
Does he want the same color as you

380
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,640
or you?

381
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,560
I don't believe it.

382
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,880
He doesn't even dare to admit it in person.

383
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,800
It's nothing to rely on others.

384
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,400
Who says I don't dare?

385
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,880
Help me dye it again.

386
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,320
You can't dye it yourself.

387
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,720
I can.

388
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,640
You don't need me.

389
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,920
I want the person

390
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,640
who can dye it.

391
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,560
We'll see

392
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,760
the new works of Master Chu and Madam Chu soon.

393
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,760
The old partners are in sync.

394
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,200
By the way,

395
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,560
there's a performance tonight.

396
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,720
Will you watch it?

397
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,040
Of course.

398
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,080
I wish you a smooth performance.

399
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,560
Please continue.

400
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,240
Chen Shimei,

401
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,440
you've done a great favor

402
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,960
and killed your wife.

403
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,000
Come on.

404
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,960
Kill him.

405
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,800
Yes.

406
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,200
Thank you, Liu Qing.

407
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,600
I know my mistake.

408
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:15,800
You're wrong.

409
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,880
You're wrong.

410
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,120
I'll kill him tonight.

411
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,200
Thank you, Liu Qing.

412
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,480
My lord,

413
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,160
I'm not afraid of death.

414
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,080
But when I think about

415
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,080
what I did to my wife,

416
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,400
I feel very regretful.

417
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,560
I'm not willing to die

418
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,080
and I don't want

419
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,320
to be forgiven.

420
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,960
But I've

421
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,200
passed away for a thousand years.

422
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,680
Please give me a chance

423
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,160
to see my reformation

424
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,480
and accept my repentance.

425
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,880
If I die like this,

426
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,120
I'll have no regrets.

427
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,800
It sounds

428
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,680
very touching.

429
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,120
Qin Shi,

430
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,880
he wants to change.

431
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,640
What do you want?

432
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,000
Mr. Bao,

433
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,920
please come here.

434
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,400
Great.

435
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,480
Qin Shi just said

436
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,560
he doesn't want gold or silver.

437
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,440
He wants you to pay him back.

438
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,520
He wants three things.

439
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,480
If you can satisfy him,

440
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,320
you'll be forgiven.

441
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,240
Gold and silver

442
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,440
are hard to make up.

443
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,800
Qin Xianglian

444
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,200
has been suffering from the pain of chasing after his husband.

445
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,880
I'll accept

446
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,980
everything.

447
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,760
Fine.

448
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,080
A thousand pieces of rice

449
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,280
are worth a thousand Performance Push Cups.

450
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,840
Hooray!

451
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,680
Yes.

452
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,840
Yes.

453
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,440
Is it high enough?

454
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,760
Yes.

455
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,160
Raw rice.

456
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,120
Is it high enough?

457
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,560
Yes.

458
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,200
Rice again.

459
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,080
Yes.

460
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,600
Is it high enough?

461
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,040
Yes.

462
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,320
Rice again.

463
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,960
Is it high enough?

464
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,040
Qin Shi.

465
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,560
Are you satisfied?

466
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,240
Yes.

467
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,040
Good.

468
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,960
Good.

469
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,760
Good.

470
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,200
Good.

471
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,280
I used to be a person who didn't know love.

472
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,880
So,

473
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,840
I lost one of my best

474
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,280
in my own power.

475
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,640
The one I thought of the most.

476
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,040
I once swore

477
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,680
to get her back.

478
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,120
But I thought

479
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,600
the so-called true heart

480
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,000
was taken away by power,

481
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,400
calculation,

482
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,680
and separation.

483
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,680
I hurt her

484
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,200
over and over again.

485
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,200
Thank you.

486
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,920
Thank you for giving me the chance

487
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,640
to say it out.

488
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,880
Let me know

489
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,680
where my problem is.

490
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,040
And let me know

491
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,280
whether I love her

492
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,680
or her feeling.

493
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,480
If you ask me again

494
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,760
what kind of person I am,

495
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,080
I will tell you.

496
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,760
I am the one who finds me

497
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,600
and loves you.

498
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,760
Good.

499
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,600
Good.

500
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,600
Good.

501
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,280
Good.

502
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,280
Good.

503
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:12,960
Mr. Lin,

504
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,480
our offline experience building

505
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,360
is going well than expected.

506
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,760
The rental contract for three houses

507
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,560
has been signed.

508
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,120
The renovation plan has been set.

509
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,680
Next,

510
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,080
we will pay the rent

511
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,120
and the renovation fee

512
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,480
and the material fee.

513
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,760
Okay.

514
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,680
I hope before Mr. Yan comes back,

515
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,520
we can arrange the offline business properly

516
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,600
and report our project

517
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,800
to the foreign banks as soon as possible.

518
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,200
Okay.

519
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,040
The contract requires

520
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,200
to pay the rent for a year

521
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,640
in two weeks.

522
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,560
You and Mr. Lin

523
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,240
should make it clear about the balance and the details.

524
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,200
I will confirm the signing

525
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,200
and you can pay the rent.

526
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,320
Okay. No problem.

527
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,120
Mr. Qiao,

528
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,880
can we slow down

529
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,400
the progress of offline experience building?

530
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:49,880
Why?

531
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,640
I suggest we put the funds

532
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,000
in the production section.

533
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,040
If the money from the suppliers

534
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,480
are not paid on time,

535
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,040
we can't pay the rent.

536
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,400
Didn't you say that the bank's loan

537
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,920
can be paid off this week?

538
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,440
It was originally like this.

539
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,760
But the bank suddenly called

540
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,160
and said that it tightened the policy.

541
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,760
Everything that was not in line with the stipulated loan

542
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,880
was taken back.

543
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,960
You can proceed with the progress

544
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,960
without any hesitation.

545
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,960
As for whether to slow down,

546
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,040
I will talk to Mr. Lin first.

547
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,360
Don't be affected.

548
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,520
Finish your work

549
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,680
first.

550
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,800
Okay.

551
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,200
I think I should go to the bank

552
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,720
and ask them.

553
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,840
I have been there.

554
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,880
I have said all the good things

555
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,040
but I haven't made any progress.

556
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,880
I just came here

557
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,880
to discuss with you.

558
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,200
But I have said before

559
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,560
that the offline business line

560
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,440
uses the funds of the foreign banks.

561
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,120
They have a fixed supervisor.

562
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,400
What is the use of this?

563
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,600
They have a fixed supervisor.

564
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,080
It is not appropriate to use this.

565
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,400
It seems that there is only one way

566
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,400
to get the loan now.

567
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,720
It's okay. I will go for a run.

568
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,480
This one is not good.

569
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,400
I will change to another one.

570
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,080
Don't worry.

571
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,880
Let's split up.

572
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,720
I will call them.

573
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,040
Yan Yan.

574
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,200
Sister, are you still working?

575
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,760
I am handling something else.

576
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,920
Nothing serious, right?

577
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,480
Nothing serious.

578
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,240
It's easy to solve.

579
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,320
How are you and Shen Hao Ming?

580
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,040
I haven't heard you

581
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,120
complaining about him for a long time.

582
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,200
Well,

583
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,640
I will tell your wife when I get back.

584
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,880
I have told you

585
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,480
that I hope to get the loan.

586
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,960
I may stay here for two more days.

587
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,600
Okay.

588
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,920
You can stay there.

589
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,040
I will take care of the company.

590
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,640
You can get along with Shen Hao Ming.

591
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,320
Don't worry.

592
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,400
Okay. I will hang up.

593
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,320
Bye.

594
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,160
I will continue to run tomorrow.

595
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,800
You should go back and rest early.

596
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:06,880
Okay.

597
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,240
Shen Hao Ming,

598
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,400
I am here today

599
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:34,780
to give you this heart

600
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,240
Shen Haoming and Xu Yan didn't tell anyone about their divorce.

601
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,240
Are they a couple or what?

602
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,240
You don't know about it every day.

603
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,240
How would I know?

604
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,240
Okay.

605
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,240
Let's not talk about this.

606
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,240
Tell me.

607
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,240
How did you know Shen Haoming?

608
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,240
At that time, my sister and he were in the same university in London.

609
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:10,240
I was in the English class in London.

610
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,240
Later, I saw them in love for a while.

611
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,240
Later, my sister told him that they broke up.

612
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,240
Then, my sister found out that she was pregnant.

613
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,240
Pregnant?

614
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,240
Whose child is it?

615
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,240
I don't know.

616
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,240
What happened to Han Weiping?

617
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,240
This is a big deal.

618
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,240
Han Weiping got married with Jin Daxing.

619
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,240
She's already got a divorce.

620
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,760
She couldn't find

621
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,360
the evidence of Shen Haoming and Xu Yan's divorce.

622
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,680
Shen Haoming was too good

623
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,920
in front of Ba Lan Jin.

624
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,680
Shen Haoming and his wife

625
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,000
are almost reconciled.

626
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,200
She's still looking at the divorce.

627
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,400
She's useless.

628
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,880
She's just a useless woman.

629
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,120
Han Weiping.

630
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,200
She should be here soon.

631
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:38,680
Gan Di.

632
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,520
Good shot.

633
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,760
How's Shen Haoming's situation?

634
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,000
Gan Di.

635
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,440
I'm still...

636
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:56,760
Mr. Lin.

637
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,640
Mr. Lin.

638
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,280
It's done.

639
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,640
It's finally done.

640
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,160
About the loan?

641
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,840
This is my old colleague, Xiao Feng.

642
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,680
Do you remember?

643
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,200
She's working as a senior professional

644
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,920
in a new bank in another country.

645
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,280
I called her yesterday

646
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,640
to ask if they can

647
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,720
lend you a loan.

648
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,280
She's willing to help.

649
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,400
That's great.

650
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,800
So I'm asking you.

651
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560
I can.

652
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,040
I'll do it as soon as possible.

653
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,840
Okay.

654
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,320
I'm glad to hear that.

655
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,400
But she asked us to prepare

656
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,160
the financial report and other information.

657
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,800
If the review goes well,

658
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,040
we can pay the loan in the month.

659
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,240
But we have to do it as soon as possible.

660
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,840
There's not much time left.

661
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:47,520
Okay.

662
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,120
Then prepare the materials.

663
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,280
I'm ready.

664
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:51,920
Look.

665
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,360
Just cover it up.

666
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,400
You're so good at this.

667
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,720
So fast.

668
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,800
Just cover it up here.

669
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,400
Okay.

670
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,960
If there's no problem,

671
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,840
we'll go back to our hometown

672
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,400
by high-speed train tomorrow

673
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,160
after we finish it.

674
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,320
Keep an eye on her

675
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,160
and get it done.

676
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,960
You're her agent.

677
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,240
You have to sign it in person.

678
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,840
Let's do it earlier.

679
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,200
I'll go in the morning.

680
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:22,960
Okay.

681
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,800
I'll book the ticket.

682
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,560
If this can be done,

683
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,280
I don't know how to thank you.

684
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,960
There's no need to thank me.

685
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,640
I'm helping the company.

686
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,840
Morning, Mr. Shan.

687
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:47,760
Morning.

688
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,840
Morning, Mr. Shan.

689
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,640
Morning.

690
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,000
Morning, Mr. Shan.

691
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,720
Morning, Mr. Shan.

692
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,520
Morning, Mr. Shan.

693
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,240
You have good hair today.

694
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,560
Morning, Mr. Shan.

695
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,880
Morning, Mr. Shan.

696
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,000
Be careful not to get a bump.

697
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,200
Sit down.

698
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:18,840
Mr. Shan.

699
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,240
I'm here to report to you.

700
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,120
Mr. Barajin and I

701
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:22,880
have signed the contract

702
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,840
for the company.

703
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,080
At the beginning of next month,

704
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,560
our core team

705
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,640
will fly to Moscow.

706
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,720
By then,

707
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,400
we'll design

708
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,880
and process all the work.

709
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,280
Sit down.

710
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,560
Both sides

711
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,080
really value this project.

712
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,400
We also hope to make it

713
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,960
a benchmark for

714
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,800
overseas projects.

715
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,200
That's also my goal.

716
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,240
I'll strictly observe

717
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,000
all the key points and processes.

718
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,680
By the way,

719
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,960
can you tell us

720
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,600
how the barbecue will go?

721
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,120
According to reports in East China,

722
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,460
Most of the areas along Friends Inside and Outside

723
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,840
will be completely covered.

724
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,920
According to the local government,

725
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,440
this is the first time

726
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,840
the village life has been Street-layered.

727
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,660
upholding the appearance

728
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,780
has created the most loosest

729
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,300
cockroach stamp in the village

730
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:21,980
to the land?

731
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,460
Yes.

732
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,100
This land

733
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,420
doesn't have 15%

734
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,860
of the rent and housing demand.

735
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,220
So, under this new rule,

736
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:31,860
it means

737
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,940
the amount of the land is increasing

738
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,420
and the amount of the land is decreasing.

739
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,300
The market's expectation

740
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,020
and price

741
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,420
is about 20% of the land.

742
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,260
So, from any angle,

743
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,700
this is definitely

744
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,340
the most popular way to fight for the land.

745
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,460
And

746
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,940
it's definitely the diamond version.

747
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,820
I'm here to support you.

748
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,060
You won the project of Balaijin.

749
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,060
If you have

750
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,460
the support of Bei Baichuan,

751
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,580
it means

752
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,900
you have enough capital

753
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,300
in Jinda.

754
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,700
Thank you, Chairman.

755
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:08,540
Okay.

756
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,820
We'll have a meeting at 9 a.m. next Friday.

757
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,540
Don't be late.

758
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,420
The topic of the meeting is...

759
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,460
I'll keep my promise to you

760
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,420
and let you join the board.

761
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,980
Because you won the project of Balaijin.

762
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,500
I'm grateful to you.

763
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,260
Thank you, Mr. Balaijin.

764
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,420
You didn't blame me for hiding it from him.

765
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,660
I'm sorry.

766
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,660
Hao Ming'an,

767
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,980
I don't doubt

768
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,660
your ability to do business.

769
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,660
But I don't agree

770
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,620
with your way of doing business.

771
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,020
Business

772
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,460
is based on honesty.

773
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,900
Its core is

774
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,380
cooperation and mutual benefit.

775
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,540
It should be shared.

776
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,380
I don't know why

777
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:56,260
you've changed so much.

778
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,420
But I believe

779
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,380
you understand it now.

780
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,860
It's like the marriage between Yan Yan and me.

781
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,500
During this process,

782
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,780
there are many arguments

783
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,900
and deceit.

784
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,780
But what makes us go on

785
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,700
is our sincerity.

786
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:14,900
Dad,

787
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,900
I've made up with Yan Yan.

788
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,660
I'm happy.

789
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,180
We're still husband and wife.

790
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,220
Yes.

791
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,540
You two make up.

792
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,780
Mom and I agree.

793
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,780
The most important thing is

794
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,580
Hao Chen will be very happy.

795
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:32,700
Yes.

796
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,580
If there's nothing else,

797
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,540
I'll go to work.

798
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,540
Wait a minute.

799
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,580
What's this?

800
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:46,820
This...

801
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,220
This is wonderful.

802
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,620
Mr. Xu,

803
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,180
welcome back.

804
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:53,740
Mr. Liang,

805
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,740
this is for me.

806
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:58,940
Yes.

807
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,380
Thank you.

808
00:35:59,380 --> 00:35:59,900
For you.

809
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,540
Let me.

810
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,380
It's beautiful.

811
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:04,780
It's beautiful.

812
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,540
It's beautiful.

813
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,500
It's beautiful.

814
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,300
It's beautiful.

815
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,180
It's beautiful.

816
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:08,980
It's beautiful.

817
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,020
It's beautiful.

818
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:10,780
It's beautiful.

819
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,580
It's beautiful.

820
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,420
It's beautiful.

821
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,780
What did you learn

822
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,900
from Gu Bei Zhen?

823
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,260
From theory to time.

824
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,780
I learned the history

825
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,980
of the whole Grass Wood Enchantment.

826
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,060
I also learned

827
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,060
how to make it by hand.

828
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:30,980
I've made a lot of money.

829
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,180
I plan to make a whole set

830
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,820
of new series about Grass Wood Enchantment

831
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,580
in the autumn.

832
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,860
I can also help Gu Bei Zhen

833
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,500
promote it.

834
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,220
It's good.

835
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,380
Judging from your

836
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,420
today's state,

837
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,580
you look a little

838
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,340
more like a fairy.

839
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,420
Shen Hao Ming and I have made up.

840
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:57,740
I can tell.

841
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,900
After I finish my work,

842
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,300
I can

843
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,700
move back home.

844
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:07,860
I understand.

845
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,980
Once you've made your decision,

846
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,180
you'll be very decisive.

847
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,620
You're a person

848
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,900
who knows what you want.

849
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,980
But I still want to know

850
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:17,700
why.

851
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,980
A couple can keep a long-lasting relationship

852
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:24,500
by being together.

853
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,300
Either

854
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,700
they love each other frankly,

855
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:28,980
or

856
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,340
they can't separate

857
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,540
what they want.

858
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:34,820
What about you?

859
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,340
We both have.

860
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,980
We used to be

861
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,660
a little shy.

862
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,580
But now,

863
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,780
we're very friendly.

864
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,860
Thank you for telling me

865
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,500
so frankly.

866
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,180
If there's a change

867
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,420
between you two,

868
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,180
please let me know.

869
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,140
I don't mind waiting for you.

870
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,140
Actually, Shen Hao Ming

871
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:04,700
has always been

872
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,700
a single-seller.

873
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,500
It seems that I have to

874
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,780
take a break tonight.

875
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:10,700
Although you didn't even

876
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,300
give me a chance to start,

877
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,900
I was too careless.

878
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,420
I still have to go through

879
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,180
the process of love.

880
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,820
You can still joke.

881
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,060
That means you're in a good state.

882
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,780
And you're acting well.

883
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:27,460
Qu Yuan.

884
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,660
I'm serious.

885
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,260
I'm not going to be able to

886
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,300
be with Qiao Lin.

887
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,460
I'm not going to be able to

888
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,100
be with Qiao Lin,

889
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,540
Yao Liang,

890
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,300
Guan Guan.

891
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,020
I'm going to be the same.

892
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:40,820
I'll always be your

893
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,940
family and partner.

894
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,580
I'll always be the person you can rely on.

895
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,180
I understand.

896
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,260
Thank you.

897
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,300
I was going to be a sister

898
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,580
but I didn't expect to fail.

899
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,660
Then I can only be your sister.

900
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,020
I wish you happiness.

901
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,380
I wish you

902
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,900
a happy life.

903
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,820
I will be happy forever.

904
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,020
Take care.

905
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:49,740
Godfather.

906
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,900
He asked me to discuss with you.

907
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,460
What is it?

908
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,140
Shen Jingcong plans to

909
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,460
let Shen Haoming join the board.

910
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,540
He has informed

911
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,580
all shareholders of Jinta.

912
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,340
Your godfather asked us

913
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,860
to stop this no matter what.

914
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,260
Is Shen Haoming that easy to deal with?

915
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:04,900
Especially now,

916
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,660
if he enters

917
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,980
the board,

918
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,620
he must be careful.

919
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,180
Besides, he has made up with Xu Yuan.

920
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,340
Now, it's time for him to

921
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,260
take the initiative.

922
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,420
Make up?

923
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:15,900
How did you know?

924
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:16,940
I heard Chen Lin and the others

925
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:17,660
make arrangements.

926
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,620
Maybe Xu Yuan will

927
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,860
move back to the wedding room soon.

928
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,100
This guy is good.

929
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,380
Is your relationship

930
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,220
going well?

931
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,700
But Fang Lei mentioned to me

932
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,660
once when he was drunk.

933
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,140
His sister was in England

934
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,340
and had a relationship with Shen Haoming.

935
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,820
I think she's pregnant.

936
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,660
Pregnant?

937
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,020
What about the baby?

938
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,420
Did you give birth to it?

939
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,700
Is it Shen Haoming's?

940
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,140
I don't know. He didn't tell me.

941
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,940
You're always around Fang Lei.

942
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,860
You didn't tell me more.

943
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,060
No.

944
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,060
He's a strict talker.

945
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,540
Then dig it up.

946
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:51,980
I think there's something

947
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:52,780
going on in here.

948
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,420
There's no surprise today.

949
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,420
What's wrong?

950
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,460
Miss Tian Luo, you're not pretending?

951
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,780
How did you get hurt?

952
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:15,900
I got injured in a boxing class.

953
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,140
I was too strong and strong.

954
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:17,860
I'm fine.

955
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,100
Why are you so careless?

956
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,540
Then be careful next time.

957
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,860
If you get hurt,

958
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,020
who will cook for me?

959
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,020
By the way,

960
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,420
when I was shopping today,

961
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,980
I saw a custom-made suit.

962
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,140
It's pretty good.

963
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,580
I'll show you tomorrow.

964
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,820
I'll pick a few for you.

965
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,980
The suit for cutting money

966
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,620
is more sophisticated than Chenyi's.

967
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,380
I have something to tell you.

968
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,540
Get ready for it.

969
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,220
Go ahead.

970
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,220
I just got the news today.

971
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,340
Shen Haoming and Xu Yan are back together.

972
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:58,820
They won't divorce again.

973
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,140
Don't be afraid.

974
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,100
I'll be with you.

975
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,860
If you want to deal with him,

976
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,500
I'll stand by your side unconditionally.

977
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,500
I said

978
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,260
I don't care.

979
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,860
They had a fight.

980
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,500
In the end, he chose Xu Yan.

981
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,580
He doesn't care about your feelings.

982
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,100
He's not a good person.

983
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,540
I don't care.

984
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,460
I'm not a good person.

985
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,820
I'm not a good person.

986
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,540
I'm not a good person.

987
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,260
I'm not a good person.

988
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,500
Why does he care about my feelings?

989
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,980
He chose Xu Yan so firmly.

990
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,260
There must be a reason for it.

991
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:41,820
I don't want to be involved.

992
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,900
You've loved him for so many years.

993
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,500
You don't care about his love

994
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,500
or his pain to you anymore.

995
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,660
Since Shen Haoming never has me in his heart,

996
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,580
I have to let him go.

997
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,100
Listen

998
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,540
if you don't want to talk about his feelings,

999
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,340
just let it go.

1000
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,460
I remember you said when your sister was in the UK

1001
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,140
and she was pregnant.

1002
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,060
It doesn't mean Shen Haoming's child did it, right?

1003
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:23,940
Nothing of that sort.

1004
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,100
You heard it wrong.

1005
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:27,740
How could I hear it wrong?

1006
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:28,540
The other day when we were here...

1007
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,060
Didn't you drink the other night too?

1008
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:31,660
You must be drunk.

1009
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,100
I'm sorry.

1010
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,060
You guys talk first.

1011
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,220
The dishes are almost ready.

1012
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:48,980
Sister-in-law,

1013
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:49,980
are you not mad at my brother?

1014
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,140
Have you two made up?

1015
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,820
We were already good.

1016
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,580
Just look at you.

1017
00:43:58,580 --> 00:43:59,580
There are still many photos

1018
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,140
of you crying under the watch.

1019
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,220
Alright, let's eat.

1020
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:02,860
Don't eat.

1021
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,780
The food is almost ready.

1022
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,540
I have a gift for you.

1023
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,140
Look.

1024
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:12,940
What is it?

1025
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:13,540
Look.

1026
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:16,140
You're drawing again?

1027
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,540
Let me see.

1028
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,660
Let me guess what you drew this time.

1029
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,380
What are these two speakers?

1030
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:23,700
What are these speakers?

1031
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:24,860
These are dragon-shrouded wind.

1032
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:28,060
Look.

1033
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:28,860
After you left,

1034
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,340
it's like dragon-shrouded wind

1035
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,580
blowing

1036
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,940
through the air.

1037
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:33,940
It's not complete anymore.

1038
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:38,700
Look.

1039
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:42,380
I think this is the best drawing.

1040
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:45,980
I'll flip it.

1041
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:50,460
Look.

1042
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:51,580
This one.

1043
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:53,740
The big fat one is my brother.

1044
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:54,700
This is me.

1045
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,020
After you left,

1046
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:59,660
we both wanted you to come back.

1047
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:00,940
We were sad every day.

1048
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:02,740
I am sorry.

1049
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:13,740
This is

1050
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:14,660
you.

1051
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:15,940
Me?

1052
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:17,220
Why?

1053
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:18,780
Look.

1054
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,700
It must have been tough for you

1055
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:21,980
going alone.

1056
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,340
But it's PCG all around.

1057
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:29,820
world.

1058
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,340
I've always kept a lamp for you

1059
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,980
to guide you home.

1060
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,580
Look, we're back now.

1061
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,260
Look, we're so lucky.

1062
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,700
You're back.

1063
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:01,140
We're the happiest family in the world.

1064
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,380
Here, you can spin this.

1065
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,060
What's yours?

1066
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,100
Do you know or do I know no one else?

1067
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,140
Or do I have to?

1068
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:20,420
Tell me,

1069
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:25,580
please stop being a good boy.

1070
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,780
Even if you don't want to sit around

1071
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,340
drinking and talking with others,

1072
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,260
howim Particularly for a woman.

1073
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,340
Can I sleep with you today?

1074
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:35,620
I haven't slept with you and sister-in-law for a long time.

1075
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:36,740
No problem.

1076
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,260
Really?

1077
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:39,860
Great!

1078
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,860
Come on, let's eat.

1079
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:43,260
What are you holding?

1080
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:44,740
What is this?

1081
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:46,500
Give it to me.

1082
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:49,860
Brother Luo, what are you cooking?

1083
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,220
Something delicious.

1084
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,060
Have you washed your hands?

1085
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:54,300
Wash your hands.

1086
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:58,820
Hurry up.

1087
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,460
Okay, come and eat.

1088
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:04,980
Yan Yan.

1089
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:05,940
Sister-in-law, come here.

1090
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:06,860
Coming.

1091
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:09,700
Do you want to take a look?

1092
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:10,540
Okay.

1093
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,300
Hao Chen, can I show this to your brother?

1094
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,300
Of course.

1095
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,100
I've seen it before.

1096
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:18,420
Give it to me.

1097
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:22,860
Eat more.

1098
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:24,540
Come on, let's eat.

1099
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,500
Eat more.

1100
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:29,900
You have to eat vegetables.

1101
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:30,980
You have to eat vegetables.

1102
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:32,020
Come on.

1103
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:33,300
Here you are.

1104
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,220
Eat more vegetables.

1105
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:35,780
You too.

1106
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:36,980
Eat more vegetables.

1107
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:45,780
I'm not going to run.

1108
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,940
I'm going to sleep in the middle of the room today.

1109
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,340
I'm going to sleep in the middle of the room today.

1110
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:55,980
I'll go and call your sister-in-law.

1111
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,220
I'm back.

1112
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:30,860
He has stayed with切喉阿姨

1113
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:31,460
for several nights,

1114
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:32,820
so he has had an isolated years.

1115
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:34,140
You've been talking about him for such a long time.

1116
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,020
Why is that so?

1117
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:35,620
He's so arrogant.

1118
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:36,180
Anyway,

1119
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,660
since I'm your sister,

1120
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:38,780
it doesn't mean that you would allow others

1121
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:40,100
to give you attention.

1122
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,380
But Zhao Shiyi

1123
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:49,700
and I can only

1124
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:51,580
involve Zhang Tianyuan and Zeyu.

1125
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:52,860
After he left the hospital,

1126
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:53,620
they decided to

1127
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,700
talk about his daughter.

1128
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,380
What do you mean?

1129
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:57,940
Isn't someone speechless

1130
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:59,260
about being in such a family in the past?

1131
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:03,580
I just wanna take my time tonight

1132
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:09,900
And do all the things that I said I would try

1133
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:17,500
Like go surfing, go diving, go driving, go flying to a different place

1134
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:24,060
Like go drinking, go partying, go dancing even if I'm the only one

1135
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:29,180
Cause I just have been hurt too many times

1136
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:35,660
I'm giving it all just getting nothing back

1137
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:42,620
I was lost in the dark and too hurt to even see

1138
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:48,460
See the world how it flows what is yours will never let go

1139
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:56,620
So I take my time to reignite

1140
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:01,020
The love that I should deserve

1141
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:13,100
While the time is right and you realize that it will be alright

1142
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:20,140
Cause I just have been hurt too many times

1143
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:24,620
I'm giving it all just getting nothing back

1144
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:31,580
I was lost in the dark and too hurt to even see

1145
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:37,420
See the world how it flows what is yours will never let go

1146
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:45,420
So I take my time to reignite

1147
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:52,460
The love that I should deserve

1148
00:52:54,460 --> 00:53:05,260
While the time is right and you realize that it will be alright
