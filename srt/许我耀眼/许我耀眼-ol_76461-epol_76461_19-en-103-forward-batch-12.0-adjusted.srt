Take a break.

30
00:02:04,093 --> 00:02:05,132
Let's talk about

31
00:02:05,132 --> 00:02:07,212
the makeup and the clothing

32
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:08,173
for the next episode.

33
00:02:11,052 --> 00:02:11,653
What's wrong?

34
00:02:12,373 --> 00:02:13,492
Why are you down?

35
00:02:14,653 --> 00:02:17,412
We've been spending on fabrics

36
00:02:17,492 --> 00:02:18,733
and filming equipment

37
00:02:18,932 --> 00:02:20,132
like water flowing.

38
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:21,973
Our startup funds

39
00:02:23,132 --> 00:02:24,253
are almost gone.

40
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:27,692
I just feel that you trusted me so much,

41
00:02:27,852 --> 00:02:29,012
but the videos we posted

42
00:02:29,412 --> 00:02:30,813
got zero response.

43
00:02:31,493 --> 00:02:34,213
I feel terribly guilty.

44
00:02:36,692 --> 00:02:38,132
Snap out of it.

45
00:02:38,132 --> 00:02:39,653
Stop overthinking.

46
00:02:39,773 --> 00:02:41,132
You're our stylist.

47
00:02:41,172 --> 00:02:43,412
Just focus on making good outfits.

48
00:02:43,412 --> 00:02:44,933
Don't worry about anything else.

49
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:46,012
We'll handle them.

50
00:02:46,093 --> 00:02:46,653
Got it?

51
00:02:49,012 --> 00:02:50,053
Then I'll keep trying.

52
00:02:50,773 --> 00:02:52,253
Not a single stitch will be wasted.

53
00:02:53,213 --> 00:02:54,412
You were saying?

54
00:02:55,253 --> 00:02:55,973
Here's the thing.

55
00:02:56,373 --> 00:02:57,412
Take a look.

56
00:02:57,852 --> 00:02:59,053
Pick from these.

57
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:01,093
I also brought many lipsticks

58
00:03:01,692 --> 00:03:03,053
for you to pick.

59
00:03:04,132 --> 00:03:06,132
We'll only expand our consumer base

60
00:03:06,132 --> 00:03:08,452
after building brand awareness.

61
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,213
Many college students

62
00:03:10,213 --> 00:03:11,612
and young customers

63
00:03:11,612 --> 00:03:13,933
are fond of ethnic-style accessories.

64
00:03:14,172 --> 00:03:14,933
Let's take a look

65
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:17,292
at our overall design philosophy.

66
00:03:18,053 --> 00:03:19,093
As you can see,

67
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:20,892
we want ethnic clothing

68
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:22,172
to shine globally

69
00:03:22,172 --> 00:03:23,132
and make an impact.

70
00:03:23,493 --> 00:03:25,933
We've also conducted some research.

71
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:28,012
Young girl around 20

72
00:03:28,053 --> 00:03:29,892
now prefer ethnic outfits,

73
00:03:29,892 --> 00:03:31,412
including Chinese-style clothing.

74
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,172
Mr. Wang, Mr. Zhang, Mr. Li.

75
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,653
We've prepared a presentation.

76
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:38,012
We target ethnic-style apparel

77
00:03:38,053 --> 00:03:39,292
with customized designs.

78
00:03:39,493 --> 00:03:40,933
This is to you. Cheers.

79
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:43,292
Office workers.

80
00:03:43,612 --> 00:03:44,933

81
00:03:45,452 --> 00:03:47,373
It has modern styling...

82
00:03:51,132 --> 00:03:52,612
It's highly adaptable.

83
00:03:54,612 --> 00:03:56,493
It makes a fashionable daily wear.

84
00:04:26,373 --> 00:04:26,933
Hello?

85
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:27,933

86
00:04:29,893 --> 00:04:30,732

87
00:04:30,773 --> 00:04:31,292
Yeah.

88
00:04:31,653 --> 00:04:32,693
Nothing urgent.

89
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:33,812
I just wanted to

90
00:04:34,213 --> 00:04:36,372

91
00:04:37,372 --> 00:04:39,093
Please review it

116

let's be strangers then.

117

The screen is broken again.

118
00:06:07,052 --> 00:06:07,732
Shen Haoming.

119
00:06:10,852 --> 00:06:11,653
Why are you here?

120
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,492
I came to check on Yan.

121
00:06:18,732 --> 00:06:19,333
Save it.

122
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:24,252
I feel like
speaking for my sister today.

123
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:27,093
She did make mistakes,

124
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:29,013
but you're not so innocent, either.

125
00:06:30,292 --> 00:06:31,052
She tried so hard

126
00:06:31,773 --> 00:06:33,252
to save your relationship.

127
00:06:33,252 --> 00:06:34,492
But what did you do?

128
00:06:35,013 --> 00:06:36,693
Now she's running around,

129
00:06:36,693 --> 00:06:37,693
securing investments.

130
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:39,773
If you'd treated her better,

131
00:06:39,773 --> 00:06:41,812
she wouldn't have ended up like this.

132
00:06:42,093 --> 00:06:43,252
Now you're being nice?

133
00:06:43,252 --> 00:06:44,333
That's unnecessary.

134
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,693
I want to help her,
but she keeps refusing.

135
00:06:50,693 --> 00:06:51,492
Please talk to her.

136
00:06:51,852 --> 00:06:53,372
No, I won't.

137
00:06:55,492 --> 00:06:56,812
She won't take

138
00:06:56,812 --> 00:06:57,932
another penny from you.

139
00:06:58,893 --> 00:06:59,973
You should just leave.

140
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,492
And don't come back.

141
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:15,412
Ms. Xu,

142
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:17,533
the popularity and views of your videos

143
00:07:17,732 --> 00:07:19,932
haven't met our expectations.

144
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:22,533
We will sit on your proposal for now.

145
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,573
Alright, thank you, Mr. Zhang.
Looking forward to working with you.

146
00:07:25,573 --> 00:07:26,052
Alright.

147
00:07:26,492 --> 00:07:27,773
Same here.

148
00:07:41,893 --> 00:07:42,492
Ms. Xu.

149
00:07:46,412 --> 00:07:47,213

00:07:48,252 --> 00:07:49,093
Call me Mr. Liang.

151
00:07:50,252 --> 00:07:50,773
Mr. Liang.

152
00:07:51,492 --> 00:07:52,336
What a coincidence.

153
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:54,492
I have meetings scheduled here

154
00:07:54,693 --> 00:07:56,013
for some venture projects.

155
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:58,172
Are you here

156
00:07:58,893 --> 00:08:00,292
for some promising ventures?

157
00:08:01,573 --> 00:08:02,453
Share the information

158
00:08:02,453 --> 00:08:03,252
if you don't mind.

159
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,872
(Yan Studio)

160
00:08:06,013 --> 00:08:07,492
I'm seeking funding.

161
00:08:07,932 --> 00:08:08,693
Seeking funding?

162
00:08:10,172 --> 00:08:10,693
You?

163
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:14,612
Yes, me.

164
00:08:15,773 --> 00:08:17,052
Ms. Xu, you must be joking.

165
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:18,932
I'm dead serious.

166
00:08:19,812 --> 00:08:20,412
Really.

167
00:08:21,492 --> 00:08:23,052
So the rumors are true.

168
00:08:23,812 --> 00:08:25,773
You and Shen Haoming fell out.

169
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:34,013
That's irrelevant.

170
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:37,773
What's your project about?

171
00:08:50,492 --> 00:08:51,813
Fashion-related short videos.

172
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:53,852
We aim to expand into

173
00:08:53,852 --> 00:08:55,012
offline garment production.

174
00:08:55,612 --> 00:08:56,252
Short videos?

175
00:08:58,813 --> 00:09:00,492
Why enter such saturated waters?

176
00:09:02,372 --> 00:09:03,093
Mr. Jiang Liang...

177
00:09:03,612 --> 00:09:04,053
Sorry.

178
00:09:04,532 --> 00:09:05,213
Mr. Liang.

179
00:09:06,093 --> 00:09:07,132
Any thoughts?

180
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:11,053
Statistically speaking, I'm pessimistic.

181
00:09:11,693 --> 00:09:13,053
By Q2 this year,

182
00:09:13,413 --> 00:09:14,372
there are 1.55 billion

183
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:15,492
short video accounts

184
00:09:15,492 --> 00:09:17,213
across major platforms.

185
00:09:18,693 --> 00:09:19,652
There are 15.08 million

186
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:20,973
professional streamers,

187
00:09:21,252 --> 00:09:23,732
500,000 accounts with 100K fans,

188
00:09:24,132 --> 00:09:25,852
40,000 with a million fans,

189
00:09:26,093 --> 00:09:28,693
and just 1,000
with 10 million followers.

190
00:09:29,892 --> 00:09:31,612
You want to stand out

191
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,892
in 80 million daily uploads?

192
00:09:33,892 --> 00:09:34,933
All I can say is

193
00:09:36,973 --> 00:09:37,732
good luck.

194
00:09:39,892 --> 00:09:41,093
Impressive, Mr. Liang.

195
00:09:42,372 --> 00:09:44,053
You're very well-informed.

196
00:09:48,652 --> 00:09:50,732
Now, your design is not bad.

197
00:09:51,693 --> 00:09:54,333
It fuses ethnic and avant-garde styles.

198
00:09:55,453 --> 00:09:56,012
But

199
00:09:57,892 --> 00:09:58,732
it lacks uniqueness.

200
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,132
The execution is superficial.

201
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,213
It lacks soul.

202
00:10:02,573 --> 00:10:03,612
My rule is

203
00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:06,173
better risky than boring.

204
00:10:09,492 --> 00:10:10,213
No offense.

205
00:10:11,173 --> 00:10:12,132
That's just me.

206
00:10:12,772 --> 00:10:13,532
Straight talker.

207
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:14,333
No offense taken.

208
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,012
Your comment is constructive.

209
00:10:18,252 --> 00:10:19,213
I agree.

210
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,492
To get investors,

211
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:23,693
work on three essentials:

212
00:10:24,532 --> 00:10:25,372
thorough research,

213
00:10:26,173 --> 00:10:27,053
clear strengths,

214
00:10:27,532 --> 00:10:28,492
and absolute execution.

215
00:10:29,293 --> 00:10:30,693
But most people

216
00:10:30,892 --> 00:10:32,693
obsess over the idea alone.

217
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:34,852
Their approach is wrong.

218
00:10:35,612 --> 00:10:38,252
If we don't emphasize
project-specific context,

219
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,333
what should we address?

220
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:42,492
The investors.

221
00:10:44,892 --> 00:10:46,053
The investors?

222
00:10:47,492 --> 00:10:48,772
Every investment firm

223
00:10:48,772 --> 00:10:50,213
has its own philosophy

224
00:10:50,293 --> 00:10:51,372
and key focus areas.

225
00:10:52,573 --> 00:10:55,813
Some value accurate
market understanding,

226
00:10:56,413 --> 00:10:58,492
others emphasize unique selling points,

227
00:10:58,573 --> 00:11:00,693
while some focus on your execution.

228
00:11:01,252 --> 00:11:03,162
Therefore, you must tailor
your proposals

229
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,333
according to the priorities

230
00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:07,093
of each investment firm.

231
00:11:07,892 --> 00:11:11,213
That ensures higher success rates.

232
00:11:24,772 --> 00:11:25,612
Thank you.

233
00:11:27,652 --> 00:11:28,933
Don't be discouraged, though.

234
00:11:29,612 --> 00:11:31,012
It's a solid project.

235
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,612
Make proper adjustments.

236
00:11:33,813 --> 00:11:34,852
It will work.

237
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:39,612
Mr. Liang,

238
00:11:40,813 --> 00:11:43,173
from an investor's perspective,

239
00:11:44,973 --> 00:11:46,213
would you fund this project?

240
00:11:48,012 --> 00:11:49,492
In its current state,

241
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:55,772
I wouldn't.

242
00:11:57,772 --> 00:11:58,693
But I can bring you

243
00:11:58,693 --> 00:11:59,813
a great photographer

244
00:11:59,813 --> 00:12:00,933
who's my friend.

245
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,492
My connection comes free.

246
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:06,053
Thank you.

247
00:12:06,413 --> 00:12:07,973
No problem. It's nothing.

248
00:12:10,492 --> 00:12:11,173
Let me add you

249
00:12:12,772 --> 00:12:13,492
on WeChat.

250
00:12:14,173 --> 00:12:14,732
Alright.

251
00:12:16,813 --> 00:12:17,648
I'll scan your code.

252
00:12:18,492 --> 00:12:19,053
Done.

253
00:12:23,132 --> 00:12:23,933
Mr. Shen,

254
00:12:24,612 --> 00:12:26,933
many executives couldn't believe that

255
00:12:27,492 --> 00:12:29,213
the Cheng'an County project
made a comeback.

256
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:31,492
Hongyun is notorious.

257
00:12:31,892 --> 00:12:34,053
Nobody wants to deal with it.

258
00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:35,252
But this time,

259
00:12:35,492 --> 00:12:38,053
you solved the problems impressively.

260
00:12:38,573 --> 00:12:40,933
This project has been revitalized.

261
00:12:41,213 --> 00:12:42,132
So what?

262
00:12:42,693 --> 00:12:44,732
I'm still sidelined.

263
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,933
Don't you already have a plan?

264
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,213
The Baraikins will arrive in Jingzhou

265
00:12:50,492 --> 00:12:51,772
for vacation at Yanbo Resort.

266
00:12:53,492 --> 00:12:54,093
Golden paint.

267
00:13:00,173 --> 00:13:01,612
Jinda's overseas expansion

268
00:13:02,372 --> 00:13:03,813
has long sought cooperation with

269
00:13:03,813 --> 00:13:05,252
this Russian real estate tycoon.

270
00:13:05,892 --> 00:13:07,093
It's a great opportunity.

271
00:13:07,252 --> 00:13:08,132
But someone

272
00:13:08,772 --> 00:13:10,173
might've beaten us to it.

273
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:12,933
Situo Construction?

274
00:13:14,132 --> 00:13:17,492
They assigned someone named Steve to
speak to the Baraikins.

275
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:20,492
Let him be the vanguard.

276
00:13:22,492 --> 00:13:23,173
Done.

277
00:13:24,252 --> 00:13:24,852
Chen Lin.

278
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,252
I composed this

279
00:13:26,492 --> 00:13:29,973
from 2,441 pieces of agave leaves.

280
00:13:30,093 --> 00:13:30,732
Impressive?

281
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:39,652
Cool.

282
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:00,892
Thank you.

283
00:14:03,012 --> 00:14:03,813
Mr. Baraikin,

284
00:14:04,252 --> 00:14:07,053
if you're willing to cooperate with us,

285
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,973
you can not only enjoy the investment,

286
00:14:11,252 --> 00:14:12,333
our company...

287
00:14:13,293 --> 00:14:13,892
It's okay.

288
00:14:14,372 --> 00:14:15,612
Let's speak Chinese.

289
00:14:18,053 --> 00:14:19,693
Your Chinese proficiency surprises me.

290
00:14:19,973 --> 00:14:21,093
My wife is Chinese.

291
00:14:21,933 --> 00:14:24,053
We speak Chinese at home.

292
00:14:24,973 --> 00:14:25,892
Excellent.

293
00:14:26,173 --> 00:14:27,173
I'll continue in Chinese.

294
00:14:27,413 --> 00:14:27,892
Go ahead.

295
00:14:28,252 --> 00:14:29,053
I meant to say

296
00:14:29,372 --> 00:14:30,772
that if you collaborate with us,

297
00:14:31,093 --> 00:14:32,573
we'll increase investment

298
00:14:32,813 --> 00:14:33,732
and prioritize you

299
00:14:34,012 --> 00:14:35,973
as our crucial
overseas strategic partner.

300
00:14:36,573 --> 00:14:37,892
I'd consider your proposal.

301
00:14:39,132 --> 00:14:40,372
I'll enjoy the vacation

302
00:14:40,492 --> 00:14:41,413
with my wife in China.

303
00:14:41,892 --> 00:14:42,813
After that,

304
00:14:43,053 --> 00:14:45,333
I can visit Situo for business.

305
00:14:46,492 --> 00:14:47,173
Excellent.

306
00:14:47,652 --> 00:14:50,333
May I ask about your plans in China?

307
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:52,532
If you don't mind,

308
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,973
I could be your guide.

309
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:55,372
Thank you.

310
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:58,453
But our itinerary has already been set.

311
00:14:58,772 --> 00:14:59,693
Besides,

312
00:14:59,892 --> 00:15:01,372
I promised my wife

313
00:15:01,372 --> 00:15:02,372
not to talk business

314
00:15:02,732 --> 00:15:03,973
during the vacation.

315
00:15:05,573 --> 00:15:06,892
As you please.

316
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,652
I wish you a pleasant holiday.

317
00:15:11,652 --> 00:15:14,492
I bet you're still single.

318
00:15:15,413 --> 00:15:16,093
Yeah.

319
00:15:16,693 --> 00:15:18,288
Once you get married, you'll realize

320
00:15:18,372 --> 00:15:20,772
that career is just
a small part of life.

321
00:15:21,252 --> 00:15:22,693
A man's achievement is measured

322
00:15:22,732 --> 00:15:24,652
not by wealth nor status,

323
00:15:25,012 --> 00:15:27,492
but by the home he builds.

324
00:15:27,612 --> 00:15:28,093
Here.

325
00:15:29,213 --> 00:15:30,693
To men with families.

326
00:15:31,012 --> 00:15:31,612
Thank you.

327
00:15:32,093 --> 00:15:34,732
Mr. Baraikin values family deeply.

328
00:15:35,053 --> 00:15:37,492
He believes a man who cherishes

329
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:39,573
and cares for his wife

330
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,173
is truly wise, committed,

331
00:15:42,532 --> 00:15:43,852
and a trustworthy partner.

332
00:16:00,848 --> 00:16:05,136
(Yan)

333
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,080
(Yan)

334
00:16:32,293 --> 00:16:33,053
Look.

335
00:16:41,813 --> 00:16:42,852
The sleeves are uneven.

336
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:44,573
And here.

337
00:16:53,492 --> 00:16:54,173
Have some coffee.

338
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:55,732
Thank you.

339
00:16:56,413 --> 00:16:58,492
How do you like
the shooting environment?

340
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:00,053
It's great.

341
00:17:00,732 --> 00:17:01,973
Thank you for your support.

342
00:17:03,012 --> 00:17:03,573
Mr. Liang,

343
00:17:03,612 --> 00:17:04,652
since you're in a hurry,

344
00:17:04,973 --> 00:17:06,173
I've adjusted the order

345
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:07,213
of the shooting.

346
00:17:07,372 --> 00:17:08,453
Let me brief you.

347
00:17:09,132 --> 00:17:11,852
We plan to start with the second set.

348
00:17:11,852 --> 00:17:13,532
The AC is strong. Don't catch a cold.

349
00:17:14,012 --> 00:17:17,812
I can show you the designs to save time.

350
00:17:18,292 --> 00:17:18,772
Right?

351
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,173
Look.

352
00:17:20,413 --> 00:17:23,252
We intend to make this set
our flagship product.

353
00:17:23,693 --> 00:17:24,413
And then...

354
00:17:26,572 --> 00:17:28,213
When a woman becomes unoffendable,

355
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:30,133
unswayable, and unshakable,

356
00:17:30,893 --> 00:17:33,732
she develops an irresistible charm.

357
00:17:36,373 --> 00:17:36,893
Mr. Liang,

358
00:17:37,133 --> 00:17:39,213
your words flow like poetry.

359
00:17:40,012 --> 00:17:40,853
Remarkable.

360
00:17:41,012 --> 00:17:42,213
Neither of us is a fool.

361
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:44,693
I know men like Shen Haoming

362
00:17:44,693 --> 00:17:46,133
born into affluent families.

363
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,052
They never develop

364
00:17:48,052 --> 00:17:49,693
genuine emotional attachments.

365
00:17:50,492 --> 00:17:51,572
They're shallow

366
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:55,173
and heartless.

367
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:56,572
But when you're together,

368
00:17:56,772 --> 00:17:57,893
they make you feel

369
00:17:59,653 --> 00:18:00,653
deeply loved.

370
00:18:02,613 --> 00:18:04,252
You'd better free yourself from him.

371
00:18:04,693 --> 00:18:05,693
I'm willing to help.

372
00:18:05,812 --> 00:18:07,012
And I can be very generous.

373
00:18:07,092 --> 00:18:08,332
Please don't turn me down.

374
00:18:08,453 --> 00:18:08,973
I understand.

375
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,213
I'm glad then.

376
00:18:10,373 --> 00:18:11,252
I'll surely become

377
00:18:11,252 --> 00:18:12,973
your most outstanding partner.

378
00:18:13,732 --> 00:18:14,492
I'll work hard.

379
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:15,693
Trust me.

380
00:18:16,413 --> 00:18:17,133
Qiao Lin.

381
00:18:19,492 --> 00:18:20,532
Qiao Lin, listen.

382
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,292
Set 1 and 3 have the same style.

383
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:22,893
Charming.

384
00:18:23,213 --> 00:18:23,572
Yeah.

385
00:18:23,653 --> 00:18:24,572
I love it.

386
00:18:25,732 --> 00:18:26,373
Swap them.

387
00:18:26,693 --> 00:18:27,532
Okay, then.

388
00:18:27,772 --> 00:18:28,173
It's fine.

389
00:18:28,252 --> 00:18:29,092
Only earrings left.

390
00:18:29,133 --> 00:18:29,812
What about Guan?

391
00:18:29,812 --> 00:18:30,373
Same for her.

392
00:18:30,413 --> 00:18:31,492
This'll be quick.

393
00:18:32,853 --> 00:18:34,092
- I need to take this.
- Okay.

394
00:18:37,168 --> 00:18:38,352
(Shen Haoming)

395
00:18:43,812 --> 00:18:44,373
What's wrong?

396
00:18:47,532 --> 00:18:48,092
I'm busy.

397
00:18:50,332 --> 00:18:51,092
I'm busy.

398
00:18:51,572 --> 00:18:52,413
Okay, go ahead.

399
00:18:59,613 --> 00:19:00,173
Yan.

400
00:19:01,012 --> 00:19:01,613
Who was it?

401
00:19:03,173 --> 00:19:04,052
Shen Haoming.

402
00:19:04,693 --> 00:19:05,812
What does he want?

403
00:19:07,973 --> 00:19:08,653
(I need)

404
00:19:09,052 --> 00:19:09,893
(your help.)

405
00:19:11,492 --> 00:19:13,092
He needs my help with something.

406
00:19:14,532 --> 00:19:15,853
Things are so tense right now.

407
00:19:15,893 --> 00:19:17,092
Would he give you trouble?

408
00:19:22,812 --> 00:19:23,893
You want to see him?

409
00:19:25,092 --> 00:19:26,133
He reached out to me.

410
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:27,653
It must be urgent.

411
00:19:28,413 --> 00:19:29,133
Don't worry.

412
00:19:29,492 --> 00:19:30,893
I'll handle it properly.

413
00:19:31,492 --> 00:19:32,213
Alright.

414
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,173
Go then.

415
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:34,693
You don't listen to anyone.

416
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:36,012
But remember.

417
00:19:36,173 --> 00:19:37,933
Call me if anything happens.

418
00:19:39,213 --> 00:19:39,812
What for?

419
00:19:40,092 --> 00:19:40,973
I'll beat him up.

420
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:47,492
Always so thoughtful.

421
00:19:48,693 --> 00:19:49,332
Go ahead.

422
00:19:49,893 --> 00:19:50,332
Right.

423
00:19:53,572 --> 00:19:54,012
Okay.

424
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:56,893
Madam, hurry.

425
00:20:20,693 --> 00:20:21,173
Sit.

426
00:20:22,492 --> 00:20:23,532
It's been so long.

427
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:24,492
How are you?

428
00:20:28,572 --> 00:20:29,252
I'm fine.

429
00:20:31,332 --> 00:20:32,373
How's your startup going?

430
00:20:34,613 --> 00:20:35,092
Sit.

431
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:45,732
I'm not here for small talk.

432
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:49,613
Just get to the point.

433
00:20:52,492 --> 00:20:53,933
I want to discuss a business deal.

434
00:20:55,373 --> 00:20:58,213
I know you're having funding issues.

435
00:20:59,012 --> 00:21:01,052
Consider this a fundraising opportunity.

436
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,052
You're the one in bigger trouble.

437
00:21:10,492 --> 00:21:11,413
You asked me for help.

438
00:21:12,213 --> 00:21:14,613
So don't put on that superior act.

439
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:17,973
Business requires sincerity.

440
00:21:30,893 --> 00:21:33,492
A Russian couple in real estate

441
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:35,933
is arriving soon.

442
00:21:37,973 --> 00:21:39,973
I want to collaborate with them

443
00:21:40,492 --> 00:21:42,092
to expand our overseas markets.

444
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:46,572
But the husband values family greatly.

445
00:21:47,853 --> 00:21:50,572
I hope we can appear in front of them

446
00:21:51,213 --> 00:21:52,492
as spouses.

447
00:21:53,693 --> 00:21:56,492
Help me gain their approval.

448
00:21:58,532 --> 00:21:59,732
Here's their profile.

449
00:22:03,732 --> 00:22:05,453
We're in the cooling-off period.

450
00:22:06,973 --> 00:22:08,693
We're not divorced yet.

451
00:22:09,173 --> 00:22:09,933
Legally,

452
00:22:10,613 --> 00:22:12,292
we're still married.

453
00:22:18,613 --> 00:22:20,213
I won't ask for free help.

454
00:22:21,453 --> 00:22:25,173
Feel free to state your terms.

455
00:22:37,296 --> 00:22:39,728
(Green Star Group Company Profile)

456
00:22:41,572 --> 00:22:42,893
How much do you make

457
00:22:44,012 --> 00:22:45,052
for sealing this deal?

458
00:22:46,613 --> 00:22:47,732
At least a billion.

459
00:22:59,693 --> 00:23:00,413
One million yuan.

460
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:06,973
One million yuan?

461
00:23:07,092 --> 00:23:09,453
My help brings greater returns.

462
00:23:14,373 --> 00:23:15,572
If you refuse,

463
00:23:17,173 --> 00:23:18,173
find someone else.

464
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:21,492
I meant to say

465
00:23:21,812 --> 00:23:23,052
the apparel industry requires

466
00:23:23,052 --> 00:23:24,012
heavy investment.

467
00:23:24,413 --> 00:23:26,532
A million alone won't make a splash.

468
00:23:28,893 --> 00:23:29,613
Here's the deal.

469
00:23:30,772 --> 00:23:32,973
I'll invest 10 million as a shareholder.

470
00:23:33,532 --> 00:23:35,492
I don't want your investment.

471
00:23:36,213 --> 00:23:37,812
This is an equal partnership.

472
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:39,413
I'll only take my fee.

473
00:23:39,732 --> 00:23:41,812
I don't need anything else.

474
00:23:52,292 --> 00:23:52,772
Okay.

475
00:23:53,973 --> 00:23:54,893
Deal.

476
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:57,973
One million yuan as your fee.

477
00:23:59,012 --> 00:24:00,413
But remember this.

478
00:24:00,653 --> 00:24:03,252
Mr. Baraikin values
marital bonds deeply.

479
00:24:03,653 --> 00:24:05,252
We need to look like

480
00:24:05,252 --> 00:24:07,012
the most loving couple.

481
00:24:10,332 --> 00:24:11,133
To our partnership.

482
00:24:15,492 --> 00:24:16,292
To our partnership.

483
00:24:43,772 --> 00:24:45,332
The outfit I picked for you look nice.

484
00:24:46,532 --> 00:24:47,213
Hello.

485
00:24:49,772 --> 00:24:50,332
Baby.

486
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:51,572
Where are our IDs?

487
00:24:57,292 --> 00:24:58,213
Weren't you the one

488
00:24:58,213 --> 00:24:59,492
keeping them all along?

489
00:24:59,653 --> 00:25:01,213
My job is just to enjoy myself.

490
00:25:03,572 --> 00:25:04,292
It's my fault.

491
00:25:04,853 --> 00:25:05,893
I keep forgetting things.

492
00:25:06,492 --> 00:25:08,052
If we can't check in today,

493
00:25:08,292 --> 00:25:10,613
we'll have to camp outside.

494
00:25:10,772 --> 00:25:12,492
Then we'll sleep in a tent,

495
00:25:12,853 --> 00:25:14,213
watch stars and the moon,

496
00:25:14,292 --> 00:25:17,332
and have a barbecue.

497
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:20,252
Sir, your room key.

498
00:25:20,332 --> 00:25:20,933
Thank you.

499
00:25:21,933 --> 00:25:22,453
Come on.

500
00:25:22,453 --> 00:25:24,812
This couple seems so in love.

501
00:25:25,492 --> 00:25:26,973
But I don't like Barbie.

502
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:30,893
I prefer Twilight romance.

503
00:25:39,133 --> 00:25:39,973
Plan B.

504
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:27,332
Excuse me.

505
00:26:32,893 --> 00:26:33,933
Excuse me.

506
00:26:40,052 --> 00:26:40,653
Look.

507
00:26:41,012 --> 00:26:42,973
These guys look like Edward and Bella.

508
00:26:43,052 --> 00:26:43,853
Yeah.

509
00:26:44,133 --> 00:26:46,532
That's my favorite love story.

510
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:47,933
You used to watch it a lot.

511
00:26:47,933 --> 00:26:49,572
Yeah, once a week.

512
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:55,173
Excuse me.

513
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:56,332
Which floor?

514
00:27:02,973 --> 00:27:03,653
Same.

515
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:14,173
Thank you.

516
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:18,732
This way, please.

517
00:27:20,893 --> 00:27:22,492
Your room's at the end of this hall.

518
00:27:27,133 --> 00:27:28,252
Please give me a second.

519
00:27:28,893 --> 00:27:30,532
Excuse me, please.

520
00:27:32,413 --> 00:27:33,653
Thank you. This way, please.

521
00:27:40,933 --> 00:27:41,772
Almost there.

522
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:48,492
Here.

523
00:27:54,693 --> 00:27:56,413
Enjoy your vacation.

524
00:28:03,292 --> 00:28:05,413
May I ask which room you're staying in?

525
00:28:07,173 --> 00:28:08,213
What floor is this?

526
00:28:09,052 --> 00:28:09,812
The second floor.

527
00:28:10,812 --> 00:28:11,952
We're on the third floor.

528
00:28:18,693 --> 00:28:19,653
Plan C.

529
00:29:02,572 --> 00:29:03,532
We have a room.

530
00:29:05,653 --> 00:29:06,173
Second floor.

531
00:29:07,572 --> 00:29:09,453
I wish you a pleasant stay.

532
00:29:10,492 --> 00:29:10,933
Please.

533
00:29:17,332 --> 00:29:18,772
Enjoy your stay.

534
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:20,492
Thank you.

535
00:29:30,693 --> 00:29:31,252
Hello.

536
00:29:31,772 --> 00:29:34,173
Please send the priciest romance package

537
00:29:34,292 --> 00:29:35,492
to Room 2132.

538
00:29:36,092 --> 00:29:37,772
Make sure the cake says

539
00:29:37,933 --> 00:29:39,092
"I love you" on it.

540
00:29:39,772 --> 00:29:40,292
Thank you.

541
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:11,453
Sir, your cake

542
00:30:11,572 --> 00:30:13,453
and champagne are here.

543
00:30:16,373 --> 00:30:18,973
But we didn't order this.

544
00:30:19,532 --> 00:30:19,973
But...

545
00:30:20,133 --> 00:30:22,292
This is Room 2132.

546
00:30:23,292 --> 00:30:24,653
It looks amazing.

547
00:30:24,973 --> 00:30:26,973
Honey, is this a surprise for me?

548
00:30:27,012 --> 00:30:28,252
Thank you, darling.

549
00:30:29,252 --> 00:30:30,092
Stop acting.

550
00:30:30,092 --> 00:30:31,133
I'm so happy.

551
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:34,572
Please charge it to my room.

552
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,092
Let me bring it inside.

553
00:30:36,092 --> 00:30:36,933
Thank you.

554
00:30:46,332 --> 00:30:46,772
He's gone.

555
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,532
This cake is so good.

556
00:31:09,572 --> 00:31:10,973
Thank you, honey.

557
00:31:12,012 --> 00:31:13,732
Have more if you like it.

558
00:31:15,292 --> 00:31:15,772
Okay.

559
00:31:16,893 --> 00:31:17,292
Made it.

560
00:31:21,732 --> 00:31:22,252
Hello.

561
00:31:22,532 --> 00:31:23,292
May I help you?

562
00:31:23,973 --> 00:31:25,973
We ordered a romance package

563
00:31:26,373 --> 00:31:27,453
and I think the waiter

564
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:29,012
brought it to your room.

565
00:31:29,933 --> 00:31:31,133
Oh, it was yours?

566
00:31:32,413 --> 00:31:33,413
I'm so sorry.

567
00:31:35,973 --> 00:31:37,092
We've already...

568
00:31:39,332 --> 00:31:41,532
I'm sorry, I already took a bite.

569
00:31:47,893 --> 00:31:48,613
I'm sorry, I...

570
00:31:48,613 --> 00:31:50,213
- Hello.
- I already took a bite.

571
00:31:54,133 --> 00:31:54,732
It's okay.

572
00:31:55,373 --> 00:31:56,492
No need to apologize.

573
00:31:57,853 --> 00:31:59,373
A beautiful cake like this

574
00:31:59,812 --> 00:32:01,453
is meant for a beautiful lady.

575
00:32:01,613 --> 00:32:02,133
Sorry.

576
00:32:02,613 --> 00:32:04,052
My wife seemed delighted.

577
00:32:04,092 --> 00:32:05,012
So we accepted it.

578
00:32:06,252 --> 00:32:06,973
I'm sorry.

579
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,252
Me too.

580
00:32:09,812 --> 00:32:10,933
You are so in love.

581
00:32:11,292 --> 00:32:13,933
You're a great role model
for young couples like us.

582
00:32:16,012 --> 00:32:17,693
We won't disturb you. Let's go.

583
00:32:18,012 --> 00:32:18,693
Wait.

584
00:32:19,332 --> 00:32:21,772
How about the four of us share it?

585
00:32:21,812 --> 00:32:22,893
There's champagne too.

586
00:32:24,572 --> 00:32:25,693
This kind of cake

587
00:32:26,693 --> 00:32:27,893
is only meant for a couple.

588
00:32:28,853 --> 00:32:29,772
How about this, honey?

589
00:32:30,492 --> 00:32:31,213
Tonight,

590
00:32:31,572 --> 00:32:33,092
I'll take you to the hotel lawn.

591
00:32:34,133 --> 00:32:36,853
They're known for their shows.

592
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:39,373
So romantic.

593
00:32:40,213 --> 00:32:41,492
You're also going to the lawn?

594
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:45,893
Then let's have a drink later.

595
00:32:46,812 --> 00:32:47,492
- Okay.
- Okay.

596
00:32:48,252 --> 00:32:49,133
- See you tonight.
- See you tonight.

597
00:32:54,332 --> 00:32:55,052
Take the bed.

598
00:32:55,772 --> 00:32:56,532
I'll take the sofa.

599
00:32:56,653 --> 00:32:57,373
Okay, thanks.

600
00:33:08,532 --> 00:33:10,413
That cake was a good idea.

601
00:33:26,292 --> 00:33:27,532
Unpack your own stuff.

various games

632
00:35:05,893 --> 00:35:07,853

Let's see if you can

Who wants to go first

637
00:35:17,733 --> 00:35:19,652
and take the challenge?

638
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:22,492
Excuse me.

639
00:35:22,532 --> 00:35:24,612
Why are you leaving?

640
00:35:24,893 --> 00:35:26,612
Are you scared that you might not

641
00:35:26,773 --> 00:35:27,773

642
00:35:28,492 --> 00:35:29,973
This looks fun. I want to try.

Here.

644
00:35:31,773 --> 00:35:33,413
We have international guests too.

Let's welcome them with applause.

646
00:35:40,132 --> 00:35:41,253
Let's try later too.

647
00:35:44,212 --> 00:35:45,933
It's called "Couples in Sync."

648
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:47,293
How are we in sync?

649
00:35:47,853 --> 00:35:49,333
You Act, I Guess.

Ready, go.

651
00:35:50,973 --> 00:35:52,532
Fine, then forget it.

652
00:35:53,253 --> 00:35:54,572
First question.

653
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:55,973
Two words.

654
00:35:56,656 --> 00:35:58,128
(Sun Wukong)

655
00:35:58,492 --> 00:35:59,813
Let's see if you can guess it.

656
00:36:00,012 --> 00:36:00,733
(Sun Wukong)
Monkey.

657
00:36:01,652 --> 00:36:02,652
- Sun Wukong.
- Two words.

658
00:36:02,733 --> 00:36:04,373
Correct. Congratulations.

659
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:05,172
Excellent.

660
00:36:05,172 --> 00:36:06,293
Alright, next question.

661
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:08,532
Nice.

662
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:10,492
Okay, two words.

663
00:36:13,733 --> 00:36:14,973
Show us your interpretation.

664
00:36:16,052 --> 00:36:17,532
Very vivid.

665
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:18,692
(Giant Panda)
Two words.

666
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:19,652
Big bear.

667
00:36:20,813 --> 00:36:21,652
Giant panda.

668
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:23,492
Correct. Congratulations.

669
00:36:23,612 --> 00:36:24,692
Brilliant.

670
00:36:24,893 --> 00:36:25,773
Our foreign friend

671

674
00:36:30,853 --> 00:36:31,373
Excellent.

675
00:36:31,413 --> 00:36:33,012
Okay, next question.

676
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:35,052
Also two words.

677
00:36:36,733 --> 00:36:37,973
What's happening here?

678
00:36:39,212 --> 00:36:39,813
Okay.

679
00:36:42,172 --> 00:36:42,933
Dancing.

680
00:36:43,532 --> 00:36:44,492
Two words.

681
00:36:45,253 --> 00:36:45,893
Jump.

682
00:36:46,172 --> 00:36:46,733
What...

683
00:36:48,253 --> 00:36:48,973
Swing.

684
00:36:49,492 --> 00:36:50,212
Yangge dancing.

685
00:36:50,492 --> 00:36:52,092
Congratulations, that's correct.

686
00:36:52,612 --> 00:36:53,212
What is this?

00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:54,212
You got everything right.

688
00:36:54,373 --> 00:36:55,092
It's quite windy.

689
00:36:55,092 --> 00:36:55,572
Brilliant.

690
00:36:55,572 --> 00:36:56,853
Next question.

691
00:36:59,532 --> 00:37:00,132
Everyone.

692
00:37:00,492 --> 00:37:01,333
Two words.

693
00:37:01,373 --> 00:37:02,492
Still two words.

694
00:37:03,492 --> 00:37:04,212
There's no wind.

695
00:37:05,492 --> 00:37:07,413
Didn't you agree to cooperate?

696
00:37:08,052 --> 00:37:09,492
Why don't you try to appreciate

697
00:37:09,532 --> 00:37:10,492
your husband?

698
00:37:10,692 --> 00:37:11,973
Tai Chi.

699
00:37:12,413 --> 00:37:15,172
Congratulations again.

700
00:37:15,492 --> 00:37:16,492
A loving couple

701
00:37:16,492 --> 00:37:17,773
wouldn't show off in public.

702
00:37:18,212 --> 00:37:19,492
Don't you understand?

703
00:37:30,012 --> 00:37:30,933
The wife acting up

704
00:37:30,933 --> 00:37:32,132
is a part of the dynamic.

705
00:37:32,572 --> 00:37:33,572
Watch your attitude.

706
00:37:36,973 --> 00:37:39,373
You can act up,
but don't cross the line, okay?

707
00:37:42,572 --> 00:37:43,333
Are you upset?

708
00:37:44,893 --> 00:37:46,092
Replace me then.

709
00:37:46,572 --> 00:37:47,532
I'll just quit.

710
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:50,733
Don't forget we have a contract.

711
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:53,612
It's mutually binding.

712
00:37:54,212 --> 00:37:55,492
I'm not your subordinate.

713
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:58,092
Don't order me around like before.

714
00:38:02,253 --> 00:38:03,933
Congratulations, that's correct.

715
00:38:04,492 --> 00:38:05,492
Amazing.

716
00:38:05,973 --> 00:38:07,373
They're so in sync.

717
00:38:07,373 --> 00:38:07,773
Okay.

718
00:38:07,813 --> 00:38:09,933
Let's proceed to the next part.

719
00:38:10,212 --> 00:38:10,933
Bring the towels.

720
00:38:19,933 --> 00:38:21,572
Unentangle the towels.

721
00:38:21,572 --> 00:38:22,893
It's a simple game.

722
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,333
Let's see what happens.

723
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:26,293
It's impossible to communicate with you.

724
00:38:26,373 --> 00:38:28,132
Then let's stop communicating.

725
00:38:29,492 --> 00:38:30,733
Focus on your task.

726
00:38:30,733 --> 00:38:32,652
Another round of applause for them!

727
00:38:34,172 --> 00:38:36,012
Why do you think we're getting divorced?

728
00:38:36,893 --> 00:38:38,893
If you can't find the right approach,

729
00:38:39,293 --> 00:38:40,492
try different methods.

730
00:38:42,373 --> 00:38:44,052
Try different approaches

731
00:38:44,092 --> 00:38:45,893
to get the towels unentangled.

732
00:38:45,893 --> 00:38:47,212
Because you used me.

733
00:38:49,773 --> 00:38:50,692
Didn't you use me?

734
00:38:50,893 --> 00:38:52,253
But I truly love you.

735
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:00,212
Loved you.

736
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:03,692
I helped you too.

737
00:39:04,172 --> 00:39:05,492
That means, to you,

738
00:39:05,492 --> 00:39:07,692
our relationship was nothing

739
00:39:07,692 --> 00:39:10,413
but a transaction all along, right?

740
00:39:10,612 --> 00:39:12,773
I don't think we need to
reach this point.

741
00:39:12,773 --> 00:39:13,612
What do you mean?

742
00:39:14,813 --> 00:39:15,612
Want to reconcile?

743
00:39:20,532 --> 00:39:21,612
I've tried.

744
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:22,973
Did it work?

745
00:39:26,933 --> 00:39:27,692
It's too late.

746
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:29,612
I just want to tell you

747
00:39:29,692 --> 00:39:31,893
that being with me will benefit you.

748
00:39:32,012 --> 00:39:33,092
Your current business

749
00:39:33,132 --> 00:39:34,293
will waste your money.

750
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:35,532
Only I can save you, okay?

751
00:39:35,532 --> 00:39:36,853
Why do you overestimate yourself?

752
00:39:37,492 --> 00:39:38,973
And why do you belittle me?

753
00:39:40,853 --> 00:39:42,293
You think no one wants to fund me?

754
00:39:42,652 --> 00:39:43,413
Listen carefully.

755
00:39:43,612 --> 00:39:45,652
Investors are lining up.

756
00:39:45,973 --> 00:39:46,813
Want to invest?

757
00:39:47,253 --> 00:39:48,052
Get in line.

758
00:39:49,293 --> 00:39:50,352
Who's investing in you?

759
00:39:51,853 --> 00:39:52,492
Tell me.

760
00:39:52,652 --> 00:39:53,532
Stop talking.

761
00:39:54,733 --> 00:39:55,293
Yan.

762
00:39:58,373 --> 00:39:59,652
Look, this is my trophy.

763
00:39:59,933 --> 00:40:00,893
So cute.

764
00:40:00,933 --> 00:40:01,492
Yeah.

765
00:40:01,572 --> 00:40:03,212
Would you like to give it a try?

766
00:40:03,212 --> 00:40:03,612
It's fun.

767
00:40:03,612 --> 00:40:04,172
Us?

768
00:40:04,373 --> 00:40:05,373
It's really fun.

769
00:40:06,853 --> 00:40:07,813
Want to try, honey?

770
00:40:11,092 --> 00:40:11,612
Alright.

771
00:40:12,373 --> 00:40:13,733
The next game is called:

772
00:40:13,733 --> 00:40:15,172
"Which Way to Look?

773
00:40:15,253 --> 00:40:16,293
One, Two, Three."

774
00:40:16,652 --> 00:40:18,333
It's another test to see if the couples

775
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,373
are in sync.

776
00:40:19,652 --> 00:40:21,853
Please listen to my command.

777
00:40:22,012 --> 00:40:23,012
After I say,

778
00:40:23,253 --> 00:40:25,052
"Which way to look? One, two, three,"

779
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:26,612
turn your heads.

780
00:40:26,893 --> 00:40:28,933
If you turn in the same direction,

781
00:40:28,973 --> 00:40:29,773
you win.

782
00:40:29,933 --> 00:40:32,813
Otherwise, you will
receive a punishment.

783
00:40:33,132 --> 00:40:33,652
Now,

784
00:40:33,692 --> 00:40:35,092
there's water on the table.

785
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:37,532
Whoever grabs it first

786
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:39,413
can splash the other.

787
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:46,012
Who's your investor?

788
00:40:48,293 --> 00:40:49,413
Focus on the game.

789
00:40:54,212 --> 00:40:55,933
Ready, go.

790
00:40:56,293 --> 00:40:57,293
Which way to look?

791
00:40:57,492 --> 00:40:58,052
One.

792
00:40:58,492 --> 00:40:59,253
Two.

793
00:40:59,532 --> 00:41:00,212
Three.

794
00:41:07,212 --> 00:41:08,373
I didn't make the rules.

795
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:09,692
It's fine.

796
00:41:10,132 --> 00:41:11,092
I understand.

797
00:41:17,692 --> 00:41:18,572
Which way to look?

798
00:41:18,813 --> 00:41:19,492
One.

799
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:20,532
Two.

800
00:41:20,813 --> 00:41:21,492
Three.

801
00:41:50,373 --> 00:41:51,893
We were in sync.

802
00:41:54,092 --> 00:41:54,973
Sorry.

803
00:41:55,933 --> 00:41:56,652
I got confused.

804
00:41:58,253 --> 00:41:58,973
It's okay.

805
00:42:00,052 --> 00:42:00,733
I understand.

806
00:42:07,973 --> 00:42:09,253
(Robot)
You Act, I Guess.

807
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:10,733
Ready, go.

808
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:13,413
One word.

809
00:42:14,172 --> 00:42:15,253
Watch the details.

810
00:42:16,012 --> 00:42:17,012
What is he doing?

811
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:19,212
Seniors.

812
00:42:20,212 --> 00:42:21,172
Wrong guess.

813
00:42:23,692 --> 00:42:25,413
Try acting differently.

814
00:42:30,012 --> 00:42:30,933
Great dancing.

815
00:42:31,012 --> 00:42:31,933
Poping?

816
00:42:33,733 --> 00:42:34,813
Getting warmer.

817
00:42:38,132 --> 00:42:39,132
Robot.

818
00:42:39,692 --> 00:42:41,413
Correct. Well done.

819
00:42:41,612 --> 00:42:42,253
Excellent.

820
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:43,492
Next question.

821
00:42:45,373 --> 00:42:46,492
Ready, go.

822
00:42:47,025 --> 00:42:48,112
(Electric fan)

823
00:42:48,813 --> 00:42:49,492
What's this?

824
00:42:52,733 --> 00:42:53,492
Electric fan.

825
00:42:53,692 --> 00:42:55,092
You got it.

826
00:42:55,132 --> 00:42:55,813
Fantastic.

827
00:42:55,893 --> 00:42:57,132
You're reading his mind.

828
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:58,853
Swap positions now.

829
00:42:59,172 --> 00:43:01,413
Let's see how you'll do next.

830
00:43:01,492 --> 00:43:03,132
Everyone, applause please.

831
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:06,773
Thanks. I believe
they will do even better.

832
00:43:07,052 --> 00:43:09,333
(Hide)
Next question. Go.

833
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:12,692
Four letters.

834
00:43:12,692 --> 00:43:13,572
Okay.

835
00:43:14,733 --> 00:43:15,212
Second one.

836
00:43:16,132 --> 00:43:16,652
Up.

837
00:43:18,492 --> 00:43:19,172
Fourth one.

838
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:21,532
Down.

839
00:43:22,853 --> 00:43:23,413
Swim.

840
00:43:23,572 --> 00:43:24,172
Swim.

841
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:29,492
Lookout.

842
00:43:29,813 --> 00:43:30,413
Observation.

843
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:33,212
Next one, please.

844
00:43:33,293 --> 00:43:33,652
(Hide)
Okay.

845
00:43:33,853 --> 00:43:34,773
(Sauerkraut fish)
Next question.

846
00:43:37,333 --> 00:43:37,813
Two words.

847
00:43:37,813 --> 00:43:38,333
Two words.

848
00:43:41,293 --> 00:43:44,413
Is she cooking?

849
00:43:47,172 --> 00:43:48,333
Tastes bad.

850
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:49,853
Final countdown.

851
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:50,813
Five...

852
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:52,973
Cut.

853
00:43:53,293 --> 00:43:54,052
Four...

854
00:43:55,572 --> 00:43:56,333
Three...

855
00:43:56,893 --> 00:43:57,373
Two words.

856
00:43:57,692 --> 00:43:58,293
Swim.

857
00:43:58,373 --> 00:43:58,933
Swimming.

858
00:43:59,253 --> 00:43:59,652
Two...

859
00:43:59,733 --> 00:44:00,293
Skip, please.

860
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:00,773
Okay.

861
00:44:00,933 --> 00:44:02,333
Alright, next question.

862
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:03,092
(Band-Aid)

863
00:44:03,092 --> 00:44:04,652
Get this one correctly,

864
00:44:04,652 --> 00:44:07,212
and you'll win the game and the prize.

865
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:08,652
(Band-Aid)
Let's see if they can win.

866
00:44:08,692 --> 00:44:09,052
Okay.

867
00:44:09,172 --> 00:44:09,773
Ready,

868
00:44:09,973 --> 00:44:10,492
go.

869
00:44:13,092 --> 00:44:14,532
The nurse removed the needle.

870
00:44:14,893 --> 00:44:16,144
I feared you'd keep bleeding,

871
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:17,572
so applied a band-aid.

872
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,576
(Band-Aid)

873
00:44:26,692 --> 00:44:27,492
How many characters?

874
00:44:27,853 --> 00:44:28,893
If you don't start,

875
00:44:28,973 --> 00:44:30,373
(Band-Aid)
we'll start the countdown.

876
00:44:31,612 --> 00:44:32,172
Okay.

877
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:33,293
Hurry.

878
00:44:33,373 --> 00:44:34,212
We're out of time.

879
00:44:34,733 --> 00:44:35,532
Four.

880
00:44:38,413 --> 00:44:39,212
- Three.
- Come on.

881
00:44:39,813 --> 00:44:40,333
Xu Yan.

882
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:40,893
Two.

883
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:45,612
Band-Aid.

884
00:44:46,212 --> 00:44:48,012
Congratulations. The answer is correct.

885
00:44:48,012 --> 00:44:48,496
(Band-Aid)

886
00:44:48,612 --> 00:44:50,012
That's incredible.

887
00:44:50,172 --> 00:44:51,572
At the last second,

888
00:44:51,893 --> 00:44:53,692
you actually got it right.

889
00:44:53,773 --> 00:44:54,853
And that gesture

890
00:44:54,893 --> 00:44:56,253
she made was so simple.

891
00:44:57,132 --> 00:44:58,413
They're 100 percent

892
00:44:58,532 --> 00:44:59,413
in sync.

893
00:44:59,472 --> 00:45:00,528
A round of applause.

894
00:45:01,813 --> 00:45:02,773
