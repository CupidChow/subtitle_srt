00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,780
I know

30
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,140
there are rumors circulating,

31
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,021
that have

32
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:50,300
damaged Yan Studio's reputation.

33
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,580
But those are deliberate smears.

34
00:01:54,021 --> 00:01:55,300
The storm will pass.

35
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:56,821
You are

36
00:01:56,821 --> 00:01:57,780
my collaborators.

37
00:01:58,021 --> 00:01:59,541
You know about our garment quality

38
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,381
and the high sales

39
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:03,060
of our first batch of clothes.

40
00:02:05,901 --> 00:02:07,101
Since you're so concerned

41
00:02:07,101 --> 00:02:08,221
about your own interests,

42
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:09,261
fine.

43
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,101
Whether Yan Studio thrives or fails

44
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:12,981
will no longer

45
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,981
concern you.

46
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:17,981
I'll give you one minute to decide.

47
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:21,221
If you decide to keep working with me,

48
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,781
then go back.

49
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,700
And I'll process final payments

50
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,300
according to contract terms.

51
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:29,821
If you decide not to,

52
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,580
I'll pay you right now.

53
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:43,821
Yan.

54
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,020
Look who's here.

55
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:48,781
Yan.

56
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:49,981
Long time no see.

57
00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:54,981
What brings you here?

58
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,860
Sweetie.

59
00:02:57,341 --> 00:02:58,341
I am

60
00:02:58,381 --> 00:02:59,700
representing Moscow

61
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,180
for a Sino-Russian cultural exchange.

62
00:03:02,941 --> 00:03:04,700
I absolutely adore Yan Studio's dresses.

63
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,541
So,

64
00:03:05,661 --> 00:03:06,941
I came to visit.

65
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:07,860
Of course,

66
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:09,381
I came mainly to see you.

67
00:03:11,781 --> 00:03:13,261
It's an honor to have you.

68
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,501
Who are they?

69
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,661
They are

70
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:24,460
my partners.

71
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,781
Hello.

72
00:03:26,781 --> 00:03:28,020
I must say

73
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:30,180
you've shown excellent judgment

74
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,580
in choosing to collaborate

75
00:03:32,661 --> 00:03:33,620
with a sophisticated

76
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,341
and visionary brand.

77
00:03:36,061 --> 00:03:36,620
Thanks.

78
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:38,180
We're very visionary.

79
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,140
Exactly.

80
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:39,860
Visionary.

81
00:03:39,981 --> 00:03:40,781
Visionary.

82
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,981
You know what?

83
00:03:43,261 --> 00:03:44,740
In Russia now,

84
00:03:44,781 --> 00:03:46,460
Chinese-inspired dresses

85
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,381
are considered the new trend.

86
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,221
Is international expansion

87
00:03:51,261 --> 00:03:52,740
part of Yan Studio's

88
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:54,061
development plans?

89
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,541
Let me know

90
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,501
if I can help.

91
00:03:58,661 --> 00:03:59,101
By the way,

92
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,341
I need

93
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:02,700
to attend a high-end closing banquet.

94
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,541
Must choose a gown from Yan Studio.

95
00:04:06,061 --> 00:04:06,740
Help me pick one?

96
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,341
No problem.

97
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,020
Our new collection's ready.

98
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:11,381
Let me show you.

99
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,541
Hey.

100
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:22,901
Leave it to me.

101
00:04:23,661 --> 00:04:24,180
Okay.

102
00:04:29,661 --> 00:04:30,141
Hi.

103
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,300
Mr. Shen, right?

104
00:04:32,781 --> 00:04:33,541
Nice to meet you.

105
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:34,820
Sit.

106
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,781
We've long admired you.

107
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:39,380
Your father and you

108
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,541
are role models

109
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,740
for all entrepreneurs.

110
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:42,661
Indeed.

111
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,420
Today,

112
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,701
it's a pleasure

113
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,420
to meet you.

114
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:47,901
Yes, absolutely.

115
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:48,901
Me too.

116
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:49,781
Mr. Shen.

117
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,620
Who is

118
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,940
that lady?

119
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,781
She's the wife

120
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,901
of a Russian real estate tycoon,

121
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,940
and Ms. Xu's close friend.

122
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:01,461
She trusts this studio's potential.

123
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,021
Perhaps Yan Studio will

124
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:05,581
become an officially recognized company

125
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,221
for cultural promotion.

126
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:09,180
Orders will flood in.

127
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:11,141
It's true?

128
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,856
It's not easy
for my wife to do business.

129
00:05:16,221 --> 00:05:17,264
Please look out for her.

130
00:05:18,021 --> 00:05:19,541
No problem.

131
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:21,221
We're all loyal partners

132
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:22,940
of Yan Studio.

133
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,781
Mr. Shen.

134
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,341
Today,

135
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,500
I promise you.

136
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,461
Ms. Xu's business

137
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:30,661
is ours.

138
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:31,541
You can count on us.

139
00:05:33,141 --> 00:05:33,781
Thank you.

140
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:36,141
Yan.

141
00:05:37,701 --> 00:05:38,221
Look!

142
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,221
Is it pretty?

143
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,461
I absolutely

144
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:42,820
adore the dress you picked for me.

145
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,901
It's perfect!

146
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:44,820
So beautiful!

147
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,141
Truly stunning!

148
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,341
Yan,

149
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,901
are you in some kind of trouble?

150
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,701
No.

151
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,101
Your husband told me everything.

152
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,060
I believe

153
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,820
you'll push through this darkness

154
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,021
and see your rainbow.

155
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:04,260
At Yanbo Resort,

156
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:06,820
I saw your passion for your career.

157
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,620
Any challenge

158
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,260
won't defeat you.

159
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,620
Those are the most empowering

160
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,541
and comforting words

161
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,541
I've heard recently.

162
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,221
You can do this.

163
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,260
Rest assured,

164
00:06:31,901 --> 00:06:32,860
I'll do my best

165
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:33,904
to overcome the crisis.

166
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,260
I'll keep wearing your designs

167
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,820
and show them to the world.

168
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,141
How long will you stay

169
00:06:41,221 --> 00:06:42,021
in Jingzhou?

170
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,940
I came with my husband.

171
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,300
He is here

172
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,860
for a cross-border collaboration.

173
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,620
For business?

174
00:06:49,021 --> 00:06:50,541
So, we do our things separately.

175
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:51,860
By the way,

176
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,300
your husband's company

177
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,541
has been shortlisted

178
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:55,420
for a partnership.

179
00:06:55,661 --> 00:06:57,420
But all candidates undergo

180
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,740
a three-month evaluation period.

181
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,860
I'll await good news in three months.

182
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:06,541
During the evaluation period,

183
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:07,860
you must come see me.

184
00:07:08,141 --> 00:07:09,581
I definitely will!

185
00:07:11,141 --> 00:07:12,141
Open your arms.

186
00:07:15,221 --> 00:07:17,820
Get precise measurements taken.

187
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:18,701
Again?

188
00:07:18,781 --> 00:07:19,500
Of course!

189
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:20,500
Then you can choose

190
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,740
plenty of styles that suit you.

191
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,101
Sounds great!

192
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,860
Good luck.

193
00:07:27,461 --> 00:07:27,981
Goodbye.

194
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:28,981
Goodbye.

195
00:07:42,581 --> 00:07:43,420
Thank you for today.

196
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,981
I've heard

197
00:07:48,341 --> 00:07:49,141
of your situation.

198
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,620
I keep watching you online.

199
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:54,781
What?

200
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,221
Want to lend me money?

201
00:07:59,581 --> 00:08:01,060
I won't undermine your principles

202
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:01,820
or resolutions.

203
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,221
But I must do something.

204
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,420
Hear me out first.

205
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:09,620
Look at this.

206
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:12,420
This could help get your company

207
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,300
out of crisis.

208
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,141
Qinglan Cup Fashion Design Competition?

209
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:22,581
Yao mentioned this before.

210
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,060
It's highly influential

211
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,940
in the design community.

212
00:08:29,101 --> 00:08:30,661
Major media outlets

213
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:32,341
will cover it too.

214
00:08:32,821 --> 00:08:34,660
Winning this competition would

215
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,500
help you

216
00:08:36,221 --> 00:08:37,101
gain recognition

217
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,260
from the fashion industry.

218
00:08:39,181 --> 00:08:40,221
With an award, you will

219
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,660
have a chance to speak,

220
00:08:42,301 --> 00:08:43,061
show people

221
00:08:43,181 --> 00:08:44,780
the authentic brocade,

222
00:08:45,581 --> 00:08:47,260
and restate Yan Studio's philosophy.

223
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:48,821
You can tell consumers

224
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,260
that intangible heritage stuff
is not priceless

225
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,941
but worthwhile.

226
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,740
Registration has closed already.

227
00:08:58,941 --> 00:09:00,221
I've already signed you up.

228
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,821
Just submit the company documents
on time,

229
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,981
along with the photos.

230
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,301
Am I crossing the line?

231
00:09:12,941 --> 00:09:14,061
Thank you.

232
00:09:18,221 --> 00:09:19,181
I really

233
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,461
appreciate it.

234
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,821
I won't disturb you.

235
00:09:25,701 --> 00:09:26,380
I'm leaving.

Good luck!

253
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:12,341
I hope

254
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,740
you can do your best.

255
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:15,421
Now, let's have Yao explain

256
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:17,221
the concept behind
our competition entries.

257
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,260
For this collection,

258
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,461
I'm planning

259
00:10:20,461 --> 00:10:21,900
to use traditional handmade fabrics.

260
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,301
The fabrics

261
00:10:23,301 --> 00:10:25,380
require Su embroidery techniques.

262
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,421
These three

263
00:10:26,421 --> 00:10:28,380
are my preliminary designs.

264
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,301
The first piece,

265
00:10:29,301 --> 00:10:30,900
titled Flames,

266
00:10:30,941 --> 00:10:32,821
uses white

267
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:34,860
and red hues

268
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,181
to make a great contrast,

269
00:10:36,701 --> 00:10:38,260
expressing both elegance

270
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,540
and attraction.

271
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,101
The second one...

272
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:41,900
We need photographs

273
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,981
showing front,

274
00:10:42,981 --> 00:10:43,981
back,

275
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,260
and side profiles

276
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,981
of each garment.

277
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,821
Ensure structural

278
00:10:48,821 --> 00:10:50,020
and design integrity,

279
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:51,140
and complete accessories.

280
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:52,860
Through detailed close-ups,

281
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,101
we must highlight the quality

282
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,461
and texture of the fabrics

283
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,181
and the fancy hand craftsmanship.

You've well mixed traditional fashion

290
00:11:12,701 --> 00:11:13,821
with modern one.

291
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,061
The detailing is impeccable.

292
00:11:17,181 --> 00:11:18,660
This is true artisanal craftsmanship.

293
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,780
Yao, you know what?

294
00:11:21,101 --> 00:11:22,301
My proudest achievement

295
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,981
is being your permanent model.

Why are you crying?

299
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:35,140
The stress just got to me.

300
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,620
Cry if you want to.

301
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,140
Let it all out.

302
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,421
Look,

303
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:41,780

304

306
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,941
I'm just emotional

307
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,421

308
00:11:49,101 --> 00:11:50,020

I'll go try the outfit.

315
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,380
Wait a moment.

316
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,941

Ms. Xu.

326
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,900
I noticed an accounting irregularity

327
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,301
while processing payments.

328
00:12:46,981 --> 00:12:47,620
Take a look.

329
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:51,821
This situation

330
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,221
is completely new to me.

331
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,380
I usually just

332
00:12:55,461 --> 00:12:56,341
assist Mr. Dong,

333
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,540
so I'm unfamiliar

334
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,740
with the remaining procedures.

335
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,101
I have no idea

336
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:01,020
how to fix this.

337
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,941
Tried to reach Dong?

338
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,301
Sure.

339
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,260
But his phone's disconnected.

340
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,740
His WeChat account is deleted.

341
00:13:08,101 --> 00:13:08,900
He has

342
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,421
crossed the line!

343
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,941
He doesn't want us to find him.

344
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:13,020
He's running away.

345
00:13:15,312 --> 00:13:17,584
(Sold a batch of clothing,
processing fee)

346
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:20,140
Mr. Lin once collaborated

347
00:13:20,181 --> 00:13:22,020
with Mr. Dong

348
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:22,900
on work.

349
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,061
He seemed professional

350
00:13:25,821 --> 00:13:27,341
and checked the accounting quickly.

351
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,620
Why don't we

352
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,900
ask him for help?

353
00:13:30,461 --> 00:13:31,020
I see.

354
00:13:31,301 --> 00:13:31,941
You may leave.

355
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:32,900
Alright, Ms. Xu.

356
00:13:33,101 --> 00:13:33,860
I'll go back.

357
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,620
Yan.

358
00:13:48,421 --> 00:13:49,301
Good idea.

359
00:13:50,341 --> 00:13:50,821
Can we talk?

360
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:51,941
Sure.

361
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:55,061
Here is the thing.

362
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:56,860
You know

363
00:13:57,101 --> 00:13:58,821
we've been struggling to hire a CFO.

364
00:13:59,341 --> 00:14:00,341
The accounting assistant

365
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:01,260
has been overwhelmed.

366
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,821
So she asked me

367
00:14:03,101 --> 00:14:03,941
if it's possible

368
00:14:04,701 --> 00:14:07,181
to have Lin Tao temporarily
fill the position.

369
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,301
Lin Tao?

370
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:09,981
It's fine.

371
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:11,301
If you have a problem,

372
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,701
we could actually

373
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:13,701
wait a bit longer.

374
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,941
We'll hire someone anyway.

375
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,821
No problem. I don't object.

376
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,181
We can't
leave a finance position vacant.

377
00:14:19,701 --> 00:14:20,500
It's for business.

378
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,140
Are you concerned about...?

379
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,061
No, I'm not worried.

380
00:14:27,421 --> 00:14:28,860
Lin Tao happens to be unemployed.

381
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,301
He's got nothing to do.

382
00:14:30,581 --> 00:14:31,581
This position actually

383
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,821
suits him well.

384
00:14:33,061 --> 00:14:33,701
I'll explain

385
00:14:33,701 --> 00:14:34,701
to Yu Yiming.

386
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,500
Don't worry.

387
00:14:36,101 --> 00:14:36,981
Is it really okay?

388
00:14:37,221 --> 00:14:37,740
Sure.

389
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,301
Okay.

390
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,620
Then it's settled.

391
00:14:41,941 --> 00:14:42,500
I'm leaving.

392
00:14:47,568 --> 00:14:48,421
(Payment Reminder:
Please settle balance promptly)

393
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:49,301
(Sender: Ruibo Fabric Company)
This was received

394
00:14:49,301 --> 00:14:50,581
yesterday.

395
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,581
This wasn't

396
00:14:52,581 --> 00:14:53,620
filed before.

397
00:14:53,821 --> 00:14:54,701
Mr. Dong

398
00:14:54,701 --> 00:14:55,860
handled this personally.

399
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,941
I was completely unaware of it.

400
00:14:58,341 --> 00:14:59,301
Now,

401
00:14:59,341 --> 00:15:00,500
he's completely disappeared

402
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,701
and can't be found.

403
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,461
Don't worry.

404
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,740
Ruibo Fabric Company?

405
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:12,860
Liu.

406
00:15:13,341 --> 00:15:14,500
I remember

407
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,581
during our last session,

408
00:15:15,821 --> 00:15:17,020
there was a receipt

409
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:19,020
from the same company.

410
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,620
Gather all financial records

411
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,860
of the company.

412
00:15:23,301 --> 00:15:24,181
Let's recheck them.

413
00:15:24,421 --> 00:15:25,780
Okay, I'll retrieve them.

414
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,380
All here.

415
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,181
Mr. Lin.

416
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,581
I owe you.

417
00:15:32,581 --> 00:15:33,860
Thank you so much.

418
00:15:34,061 --> 00:15:34,821
You actually

419
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:36,221
remember a receipt.

420
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,101
Unexpectedly, it led us to uncover

421
00:15:38,101 --> 00:15:39,101
such a substantial sum.

422
00:15:40,061 --> 00:15:40,620
No problem.

423
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,421
If you have any problems, let me know.

424
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,020
Finance work is always

425
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:44,941
detail-oriented.

426
00:15:45,181 --> 00:15:46,221
Every detail matters

427
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,101
immensely.

428
00:15:47,221 --> 00:15:47,780
Understood.

429
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,181
Ms. Xu.

430
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:51,380
It's all settled.

431
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,740
All thanks to

432
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,941
Mr. Lin's assistance today.

433
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,181
Thank you.

434
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,581
Liu,

435
00:15:57,981 --> 00:15:58,620
you may leave.

436
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,941
I'll get back to work.

437
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,540
Lin Tao.

438
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,020
It's time to have lunch.

439
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:05,500
Join us for lunch?

440
00:16:05,821 --> 00:16:06,701
I'll pass.

441
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,221
I'm glad I could help.

442
00:16:08,461 --> 00:16:09,301
See you.

443
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,260
Lin Tao.

444
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:13,341
Qiao Lin told me

445
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,701
about your situation.

446
00:16:15,701 --> 00:16:17,301
Where are you working?

447
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,461
At the martial arts gym.

448
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:21,821
Doing odd jobs.

449
00:16:22,421 --> 00:16:23,140
Just let me know

450
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,701
if you have financial matters.

451
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,540
I can be your external consultant.

452
00:16:29,301 --> 00:16:29,981
Here's the thing.

453
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,900
Since our CFO

454
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,821
left his position,

455
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:36,260
the role has been vacant.

456
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,701
So,

457
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:41,780
if you want to change your job,

458
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,540
you can join us.

459
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,260
Me?

460
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,380
Is that okay?

461
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,540
Absolutely.

462
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,341
You understand my company's finances

463
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,101
and have professional skills.

464
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:58,221
Even Liu admires you.

465
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,221
But for the record,

466
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,600
there's a three-month probation period.

467
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:05,020
If it's okay,

468
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,100
you can start tomorrow.

469
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,100
Of course.

470
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:09,381
To be honest,

471
00:17:10,141 --> 00:17:11,060
Qiao Lin knows

472
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,500
I lost my banking job.

473
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,020
I don't want to return home

474
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,008
and upset my parents.

475
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,540
I wanted to stay in Jingzhou

476
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,580
and find a new job

477
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,461
before telling them.

478
00:17:20,661 --> 00:17:22,221
I don't want them to worry about me.

479
00:17:23,221 --> 00:17:24,020
You should

480
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,941
call them later

481
00:17:24,981 --> 00:17:25,701
and reassure them.

482
00:17:26,701 --> 00:17:28,060
Welcome aboard.

483
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,020
Welcome.

484
00:17:31,621 --> 00:17:33,020
Thank you for trusting me.

485
00:17:33,461 --> 00:17:34,421
I will

486
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:35,500
do a good job,

487
00:17:35,981 --> 00:17:37,381
so you can focus on business

488
00:17:37,621 --> 00:17:39,100
without worries.

489
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:40,981
See you tomorrow.

490
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:42,141
Okay.

491
00:17:42,221 --> 00:17:43,340
I'll go get prepared.

492
00:17:52,701 --> 00:17:53,820
Let's get back

493
00:17:53,861 --> 00:17:54,780
to where we were.

494
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,260
When pairing with silver accessories,

495
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,300
use black eyeshadow.

496
00:17:59,381 --> 00:17:59,820
Yan.

497
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,020
Yes?

498
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:02,740
Our eligibility

499
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,621
for the competition

500
00:18:03,621 --> 00:18:04,340
was revoked.

501
00:18:05,008 --> 00:18:05,904
(We regret to inform you of your disqualification
from the Qinglan Cup competition.)

502
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,381
Stop wasting your time here.

503
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,621
It's pointless.

504
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,981
Getting Yan Studio requalified

505
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:18,141
isn't within my authority.

506
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,340
Can you help us

507
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,020
contact

508
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,381
the person in charge?

509
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,020
We can

510
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,181
explain it again

511
00:18:25,461 --> 00:18:26,941
in detail.

512
00:18:27,181 --> 00:18:27,941
I assure you

513
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,100
our clothing quality

514
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,260
is impeccable.

515
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:31,861
You've explained

516
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:32,621
clearly enough,

517
00:18:32,941 --> 00:18:33,941
but the point is,

518
00:18:33,941 --> 00:18:35,740
explanations aren't enough.

519
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:37,141
A contestant

520
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:38,381
with ongoing public disputes

521
00:18:38,381 --> 00:18:39,100
would negatively

522
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,421
controversial our competition.

523
00:18:40,941 --> 00:18:42,060
But we're clearly

524
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,500
the victims of counterfeits!

525
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,100
How does that make us guilty?

526
00:18:45,421 --> 00:18:45,981
Miss.

527
00:18:46,181 --> 00:18:48,020
We've tried our best

528
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,941
to mitigate the negative impact.

529
00:18:49,941 --> 00:18:51,300
- So...
- But the rumors persist!

530
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,181
It's provoked gossip,

531
00:18:53,181 --> 00:18:54,020
true or not.

532
00:18:54,181 --> 00:18:55,221
Please leave now.

533
00:18:55,941 --> 00:18:56,381
Miss.

534
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,020
Wait.

535
00:18:57,461 --> 00:18:58,181
Please consider.

536
00:18:58,381 --> 00:18:59,381
Yan Studio

537
00:18:59,381 --> 00:19:00,780
values cultural heritage.

538
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,621
We use

539
00:19:01,621 --> 00:19:02,901
handwoven brocade.

540
00:19:02,981 --> 00:19:03,740
The counterfeits

541
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,740
are machine-made.

542
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,100
You should investigate it!

543
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,701
Why aren't you investigating?

544
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,701
Miss.

545
00:19:10,981 --> 00:19:11,981
Miss, here's the thing.

546
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,981
The reason we persist so strongly

547
00:19:13,981 --> 00:19:15,100
in joining this competition

548
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,901
is to seize this chance
to help the public

549
00:19:17,461 --> 00:19:18,820
distinguish right from wrong.

550
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,461
This isn't just
about clearing Yan Studio's name

551
00:19:21,584 --> 00:19:23,901
but also showing respect
for intangible cultural heritage.

552
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:24,701
What do you say?

553
00:19:24,941 --> 00:19:25,701
Clearing your name

554
00:19:25,701 --> 00:19:27,300
isn't the organizer's obligation.

555
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,661
I've made my position clear.

556
00:19:29,981 --> 00:19:30,740
I can't

557
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,580
help you.

558
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,981
Instead of wasting time here,

559
00:19:32,981 --> 00:19:34,461
you should focus on damage control.

560
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,221
Removing your stains matters.

561
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:38,580
Chen.

562
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:39,820
Come.

563
00:19:39,941 --> 00:19:40,621
The fifth group.

564
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,540
Are we really leaving like this?

565
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,780
We should stay here

566
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,181
until they give us approval.

567
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,141
She said we have stains?

568
00:19:58,621 --> 00:19:59,861
What kind of organizer is that?

569
00:19:59,901 --> 00:20:00,941
With zero accountability.

570
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,768
Always dodging responsibility.

571
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,421
Let's try something else.

572
00:20:09,181 --> 00:20:10,448
We must join the competition.

573
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:26,661
(Qiao Lin)
Yan Studio has been disqualified

574
00:20:26,661 --> 00:20:27,461
for the competition

575
00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:28,820
and thinks we would

576
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:30,500
negatively impact the competition.

577
00:20:35,661 --> 00:20:36,221
Mr. Shen.

578
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,300
Sun Siwei is here.

579
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,020
She wants to interview you.

580
00:20:41,181 --> 00:20:42,141
Haven't I already

581
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:42,740
declined?

582
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:43,340
Fine.

583
00:20:43,661 --> 00:20:44,421
I'll send her away.

584
00:20:45,981 --> 00:20:46,421
Wait.

585
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,300
Have her get ready.

586
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,260
This is

587
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,300
an update on the progress

588
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:55,580
of the New District project.

589
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,181
Good.

590
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,941
Thank you

591
00:20:57,941 --> 00:20:58,981
for this interview.

592
00:20:59,421 --> 00:21:00,461
We know you are

593
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:01,421
typically low-profile

594
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:03,100
and rarely appear

595
00:21:03,141 --> 00:21:04,020
in the spotlight.

596
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,381
Making an exception today

597
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:06,300
to be interviewed by me

598
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,221
is my honor.

599
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,300
Don't overinterpret this.

600
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,661
I'm not making exceptions for anyone.

601
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,221
My wife founded Yan Studio

602
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,621
and faced some complications.

603
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:19,100
I learn

604
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:21,861
that keeping low-key is good.

605
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,020
But if overdone,

606
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,780
it will be bad.

607
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,181
It makes others overlook

608
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:30,340
your strengths.

609
00:21:31,221 --> 00:21:33,540
My wife originally wanted

610
00:21:33,621 --> 00:21:34,941
to work quietly.

611
00:21:34,941 --> 00:21:36,661
She stopped me

612
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,820
from promoting her brand.

613
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:40,340
But in the end,

614
00:21:41,181 --> 00:21:42,461
some people maliciously

615
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,901
created knockoffs,

616
00:21:43,941 --> 00:21:45,060
tarnishing her reputation.

617
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,060
Yet numerous influencers

618
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,580
conducted comparisons

619
00:21:49,621 --> 00:21:51,100
between Yan Studio's clothes

620
00:21:51,141 --> 00:21:52,461
and the counterfeits.

621
00:21:52,621 --> 00:21:54,500
Their conclusion showed

622
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,580
no big differences.

623
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,100
Perhaps

624
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,300
the only difference is

625
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,661
that Yan Studio charges more.

626
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,060
Many consumers

627
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,260
felt outraged

628
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,381
by the result,

629
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:03,941
accusing

630
00:22:04,141 --> 00:22:05,100
Yan Studio

631
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,861
of treating customers as fools.

632
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,901
What's your response, Mr. Shen?

633
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,221
As everyone knows,

634
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,740
Jinda Group's properties

635
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,580
never compete through price wars.

636
00:22:16,941 --> 00:22:19,181
Our construction philosophy ensures

637
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,981
every brick,

638
00:22:21,701 --> 00:22:23,020
or every steel beam,

639
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,181
or even every grain of sand

640
00:22:25,421 --> 00:22:26,981
meets national standards.

641
00:22:27,421 --> 00:22:28,500
It's not

642
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,740
about appearance.

643
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,540
After enduring a storm,

644
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,020
property owners will know

645
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,981
what it means

646
00:22:36,461 --> 00:22:37,461
to get what they pay for.

647
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,901
Just like Yan Studio,

648
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,340
they insist on using handwoven brocade,

649
00:22:43,941 --> 00:22:45,941
aiming to convey cultural values

650
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,901
embedded in the craftsmanship.

651
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,981
Some attention-seeking influencers

652
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,181
distort facts and claim

653
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,221
that my wife

654
00:22:53,181 --> 00:22:54,861
is exploiting nostalgia for profit

655
00:22:55,861 --> 00:22:57,020
and deceiving consumers.

656
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,701
That is nonsense.

657
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,461
May I ask if your statement

658
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,780
represents Jinda's position?

659
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,141
Or is this a personal endorsement

660
00:23:05,141 --> 00:23:06,500
for Yan Studio?

661
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,901
The public should

662
00:23:08,901 --> 00:23:09,540
listen to

663
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,020
Yan Studio.

664
00:23:12,621 --> 00:23:13,941
Certain malicious individuals

665
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,020
disregarded truths

666
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,661
for attention.

667
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,780
They created the buzz

668
00:23:18,861 --> 00:23:20,820
to tarnish Yan Studio's reputation.

669
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,941
This is cyberbullying,

670
00:23:24,221 --> 00:23:24,941
not justice.

671
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,260
Understood.

672
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,780
As a spouse,

673
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:32,100
what advice would you give

674
00:23:32,141 --> 00:23:33,340
your entrepreneurial wife?

675
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,901
Her vision remains

676
00:23:35,901 --> 00:23:36,820
remarkably clear.

677
00:23:36,901 --> 00:23:37,461
Therefore,

678
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,421
she requires no suggestions from me.

679
00:23:39,981 --> 00:23:41,461
Instead, I should learn

680
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,540
about her perseverance

681
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,100
and composure.

682
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,500
In this fast-paced world,

683
00:23:48,901 --> 00:23:51,221
my wife deliberately chose

684
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,861
labor-intensive handmade textiles.

685
00:23:53,381 --> 00:23:54,381
(She knew)

686
00:23:54,381 --> 00:23:55,461
(this path would be tough.)

687
00:23:56,221 --> 00:23:57,981
(Yet she leads her team)

688
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,661
(into rural villages,)

689
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,901
(realizing production)

690
00:24:01,981 --> 00:24:03,221
(of the embroidery,)

691
00:24:04,381 --> 00:24:05,621
(and giving local women)

692
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,941
(many jobs to do.)

693
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,020
(Their husbands working outside)

694
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,500
(may return home)

695
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:12,500
(and live with their families)

696
00:24:12,901 --> 00:24:14,181
(and children.)

697
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,300
(Children won't be left behind.)

698
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,300
(My wife is)

699
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,421
(doing a meaningful career)

700
00:24:19,621 --> 00:24:21,181
(with compassion.)

701
00:24:23,861 --> 00:24:24,981
(She's my role model.)

702
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,060

Boss.

720
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,060
Shen Haoming

721
00:25:22,381 --> 00:25:23,221
is pretty smart.

722
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,941
He leveraged press coverage
to reverse public opinion

723
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,141
while promoting himself

724
00:25:29,181 --> 00:25:30,621
as a good husband.

725
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,141
He is quite shrewd.

726
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,861
If Xu Yan knows

727
00:25:38,032 --> 00:25:39,701
about Baraikin's three-month probation

728
00:25:39,701 --> 00:25:41,060
for Shen Haoming,

729
00:25:43,221 --> 00:25:43,981
how

730
00:25:43,981 --> 00:25:44,981
will she

731
00:25:45,861 --> 00:25:46,901
perceive his actions?

Yan.

defending Yan Studio

736
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:52,861
went viral.

737
00:25:52,941 --> 00:25:53,621
I saw it.

738
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,901
(I'm proud of her.)

739
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,780
We have 500 more followers in an hour.

740
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,421
The video traffic has spiked.

741
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,461
We got more orders.

742
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,661
Cancellations reversed.

743
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:03,060
Mrs. Baraikin

744
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,701
went to a party in a dress we designed.

745
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,461
We're trending!

746
00:26:05,461 --> 00:26:06,381
Really?

00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:07,901
Let me see.

00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,381
Important figures choose Yan Studio.

752
00:26:16,381 --> 00:26:17,540
True connoisseurs exist!

753
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,780
Influencers can't

754
00:26:18,861 --> 00:26:19,981
appreciate the value

755
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,020
of the genuine artistry.

756
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:29,820
So we can't

757
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,981
keep making compromises.

758
00:26:33,381 --> 00:26:35,141
We can also utilize
the power of social media

759
00:26:36,421 --> 00:26:39,020
to fight against those
scheming behind our backs,

760
00:26:40,981 --> 00:26:42,661
defend our rightful interests,

761
00:26:42,861 --> 00:26:44,340
and reclaim what's ours.

762
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:47,780

This is the script.

00:26:48,861 --> 00:26:49,461
All of you,

764
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:50,861
get ready.

765
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:55,621
Hello, guys.

766
00:26:55,621 --> 00:26:57,421
I'm Guan, Yan Studio's streamer.

767
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,141
Recently,

768
00:26:59,181 --> 00:27:00,820
Yan Studio has faced negative rumors.

769
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,661
We didn't respond publicly

770
00:27:02,981 --> 00:27:04,861
to avoid falling into a trap.

771
00:27:05,181 --> 00:27:05,740
However,

772
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:07,661
your supportive voices reached us.

773
00:27:07,941 --> 00:27:08,740
Now, it's time

774
00:27:08,981 --> 00:27:10,701
to show the real Yan Studio.

775
00:27:11,221 --> 00:27:11,820
Hello, guys.

776
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,540
I'm Lu Baoyao, designer

777
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,300
at Yan Studio.

778
00:27:15,421 --> 00:27:16,701
As a girl of the Yi people,

779
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,060
(I grew up watching my grandma,)

780
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,661
(mother,)

781

Hello?

840
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,661
Is this Yan Studio?

841
00:29:04,141 --> 00:29:05,221
Yes, who is this?

842
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,240
This is the organizer
of the Qinglan Cup.

843
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,221
We have

844
00:29:10,221 --> 00:29:11,941
received many public requests

845
00:29:11,941 --> 00:29:13,941
to requalify Yan Studio

846
00:29:13,941 --> 00:29:15,300
for the competition.

847
00:29:15,941 --> 00:29:16,780
After deliberation,

848
00:29:16,901 --> 00:29:18,221
we decided

849
00:29:18,221 --> 00:29:19,300
to requalify Yan Studio.

850
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,260
Thank you.

851
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,701
When choosing partners,

852
00:29:27,181 --> 00:29:28,901
I value more than just business acumen.

853
00:29:29,661 --> 00:29:32,661
I also assess his character
and attitude towards family members.

854
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,421
My wife mentioned

855
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,100
Yan Studio has encountered difficulties.

856
00:29:36,661 --> 00:29:38,500
What impressed me was your approach.

857
00:29:38,941 --> 00:29:40,820
As a husband,
you silently supported your wife

858
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,381
without overshadowing her brilliance.

859
00:29:43,701 --> 00:29:44,820
That's truly commendable.

860
00:29:45,901 --> 00:29:46,540
You flatter me.

861
00:29:48,181 --> 00:29:48,820
Actually,

862
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,740
what made me decide

863
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,421
to partner with Jinda Group

864
00:29:52,901 --> 00:29:54,100
was seeing how wisely

865
00:29:54,221 --> 00:29:55,820
you manage your marriage

866
00:29:56,941 --> 00:29:59,020
and your wife's relentless drive

867
00:29:59,141 --> 00:30:00,500
to succeed.

868
00:30:00,941 --> 00:30:01,580
Mr. Shen.

869
00:30:02,421 --> 00:30:04,020
After our interactions,

870
00:30:04,141 --> 00:30:05,861
I'm satisfied with Jinda's strength

871
00:30:05,941 --> 00:30:06,941
and sincerity.

872
00:30:08,421 --> 00:30:09,661
Jinda also highly values

873
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,701
this collaboration.

874
00:30:11,941 --> 00:30:12,421
Good.

875
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:15,340
Before the evaluation period ends,

876
00:30:15,381 --> 00:30:16,701
maintain your current performance

877
00:30:17,701 --> 00:30:18,740
and don't let me down.

878
00:30:19,421 --> 00:30:19,861
Sure.

879
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:21,740
By the way,

880
00:30:21,941 --> 00:30:23,461
Sophia loved the dress

881
00:30:23,461 --> 00:30:24,981
from Ms. Xu.

882
00:30:25,661 --> 00:30:26,981
It put her in the spotlight.

883
00:30:28,221 --> 00:30:29,621
Yan is happy

884
00:30:29,901 --> 00:30:31,260
that her aesthetic sense

885
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,528
earns Sophia's approval.

886
00:30:32,981 --> 00:30:33,461
Alright.

887
00:30:34,461 --> 00:30:34,901
Take care.

888
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,621
Take care.

889
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,461
Dr. Yu.

890
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,461
Are you here for Qiao Lin?

891
00:31:00,861 --> 00:31:01,500
She will

892
00:31:01,621 --> 00:31:02,820
be out soon.

893
00:31:05,181 --> 00:31:05,701
Well,

894
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,381
please don't misunderstand.

895
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,861
Yan Studio's accountant fled,

896
00:31:09,981 --> 00:31:10,941
causing chaos.

897
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,461
I'm filling in.

898
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,621
I'm not here to pester Qiao Lin.

899
00:31:18,381 --> 00:31:19,221
I said I'd move on.

900
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,580
I meant it.

901
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,820
I'm genuinely here to help.

902
00:31:23,661 --> 00:31:24,461
Since we met,

903
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:25,981
I'll make it clear

904
00:31:26,221 --> 00:31:27,020
to you.

905
00:31:29,861 --> 00:31:30,960
Qiao Lin already told me.

906
00:31:37,461 --> 00:31:38,340
I'm truly sorry.

907
00:31:38,701 --> 00:31:40,260
They need an accountant,

908
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,780
and I can be.

909
00:31:42,181 --> 00:31:42,820
Also,

910
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,981
I genuinely need this job.

911
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:50,861
Finished?

912
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,020
Buddy,

913
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,141
if you need to vent,

914
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:53,981
hit me.

915
00:31:54,181 --> 00:31:54,820
I'll take it.

916
00:32:09,381 --> 00:32:11,461
You're not holding it against me?

917
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,181
I hope you'll contribute to Yan Studio.

918
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,861
We're adults.

919
00:32:17,461 --> 00:32:18,861
I hope you'll keep your word.

920
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,020
Thank you.

921
00:32:21,221 --> 00:32:22,580
Having a nice chat?

922
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:26,500
Well,

923
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,461
Dr. Yu is here for you.

924
00:32:29,141 --> 00:32:30,260
I'll leave you two alone.

925
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:31,141
I'm off.

926
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,141
Bye.

927
00:32:32,221 --> 00:32:32,701
Bye.

928
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,340
I'm sorry.

929
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,340
I should've told you

930
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,580
about Lin Tao working here.

931
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,020
I didn't expect you'd still

932
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,020
clarify things with him.

933
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,181
Thank you

934
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,424
for putting him at ease.

935
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,421

936

937
00:32:49,181 --> 00:32:50,461

Correct.

989
00:35:16,821 --> 00:35:18,020
This part was well-adjusted.

990

991
00:35:19,261 --> 00:35:20,421

I'll do it.

Yan, I'm leaving.

1004
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,500
Remember to send me the videos

1005
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,140
and photos.

1006
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:45,620
Okay.

Thank you.

go change clothes.

Yan, I'm taking them to change.

1011
00:35:54,301 --> 00:35:54,981
Thank you, Yao.

1012
00:35:55,381 --> 00:35:55,861
No problem.

1013
00:35:56,461 --> 00:35:57,421
Bye, Yan.

1014
00:35:57,461 --> 00:35:57,941

1015
00:35:57,941 --> 00:35:58,580
Thank you.

1016
00:35:58,861 --> 00:35:59,381
Well done.

1017
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:04,461
Well done.

1018
00:36:04,741 --> 00:36:05,540
So beautiful.

1019
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:06,580
I'm off.

1020
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,580
No issues.

1021
00:36:47,781 --> 00:36:49,100
The set design is perfect.

1022
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:50,901
Looks fantastic.

1023
00:36:52,981 --> 00:36:54,341
The music works well.

1024
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,261
The rhythm is on point.

1025
00:37:07,381 --> 00:37:07,901
Exactly.

1026
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,100
I didn't feel touched.

1027
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:11,540
No, I didn't.

1028
00:37:13,341 --> 00:37:15,220
Then why...?

1029
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:21,341
I think the models performed well.

1030
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:23,821
So why...

1031
00:37:23,821 --> 00:37:25,540
Why didn't it move you?

1032
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,100
Are you unsatisfied

1033
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,020
with this runway show?

1034
00:37:47,461 --> 00:37:48,620
Or do you have no confidence

1035
00:37:48,941 --> 00:37:49,741
in yourself?

1036
00:37:49,741 --> 00:37:50,540
Absolutely not.

1037
00:37:51,381 --> 00:37:52,861
I'm very confident in myself.

1038
00:37:53,901 --> 00:37:55,461
I'm even more confident in Yan Studio.

1039
00:37:58,261 --> 00:37:59,261
Within such a short time,

1040
00:37:59,261 --> 00:38:00,140
we've optimized

1041
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:05,341
the lighting, stage design, music,
models, and overall tone

1042
00:38:05,981 --> 00:38:07,060
to perfection.

1043
00:38:07,821 --> 00:38:08,821
Everything now

1044
00:38:08,821 --> 00:38:09,660
looks perfect.

1045
00:38:12,341 --> 00:38:13,660
I have watched

1046
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,741
today's full rehearsal.

1047
00:38:15,261 --> 00:38:16,341
During the presentation,

1048
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,461
the outfits are stunning,
and the sets are good.

1049
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,100
Everything's excellent,

1050
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:22,981
yet there's an emptiness.

1051
00:38:23,981 --> 00:38:25,821
Like there's no connection between them.

1052
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,381
As you said,

1053
00:38:28,901 --> 00:38:29,741
it didn't move me.

1054
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,341
The missing connection

1055
00:38:32,381 --> 00:38:34,180
refers to emotional resonance, right?

1056
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:36,180
Exactly.

1057
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,060
I want audiences

1058
00:38:38,981 --> 00:38:40,620
and judges to not only appreciate

1059
00:38:41,261 --> 00:38:41,981
the craftsmanship

1060
00:38:41,981 --> 00:38:43,100
in our collection,

1061
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,941
but also feel the stories

1062
00:38:46,901 --> 00:38:48,620
behind these garments.

1063
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,461
I only understand architecture.

1064
00:38:56,861 --> 00:38:58,981
But I know
every creator's original intention

1065
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,421
stems

1066
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,180
from the simplest,

1067
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:04,861
most fundamental hope.

1068
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:06,381
They're emotionally driven.

1069
00:39:06,781 --> 00:39:07,821
For example,

1070
00:39:08,821 --> 00:39:09,861
the Potala Palace

1071
00:39:10,901 --> 00:39:12,580
was built by Songtsen Gampo

1072
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,620
for Princess Wencheng.

1073
00:39:14,861 --> 00:39:15,381
Of course,

1074
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:17,540
there are
many similar architectural wonders.

1075
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,020
The runway setup

1076
00:39:19,301 --> 00:39:20,540
creates spatial layers

1077
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,100
through dimensional design.

1078
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,941
It visually conveys beauty

1079
00:39:25,461 --> 00:39:26,421
and evokes emotions.

1080
00:39:27,261 --> 00:39:28,060
But things like this

1081
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,901
can't impart souls

1082
00:39:29,941 --> 00:39:30,741
or emotions.

1083
00:39:32,981 --> 00:39:34,180
Do you remember

1084
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,461
when you started Yan Studio,

1085
00:39:36,981 --> 00:39:38,461
what moved you most?

1086
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,941
Yao once mentioned

1087
00:39:49,461 --> 00:39:50,941
that every Yi girl,

1088
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,741
in the whole process

1089
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,301
of growth,

1090
00:39:54,301 --> 00:39:55,500
at every significant stage,

1091
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,700
has gifts.

1092
00:39:58,341 --> 00:39:59,700
Their families craft

1093
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,060
special outfits
and dazzling headpieces for them.

1094
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,261
Every stitch

1095
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,261
carries their love for their children.

1096
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,140
Good.

1097
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,540
It's something

1098
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,901
that can resonate with people.

1099
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:17,821
In the finals,

1100
00:40:17,901 --> 00:40:18,660
all teams

1101
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,180
showcase technical perfection.

1102
00:40:20,941 --> 00:40:23,060
We'll focus on raw emotionality

1103
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,781
for the runway presentation.

1104
00:40:39,301 --> 00:40:41,381
Grandmothers pass craftsmanship
to mothers,

1105
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,461
mothers to daughters.

1106
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:45,901
It's heritage

1107
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:49,700
and evolution.

1108
00:40:53,381 --> 00:40:55,421
It's the bloodline connecting

1109
00:40:57,741 --> 00:40:59,381
craftspeople to the craftsmanship.

1110
00:41:13,741 --> 00:41:14,381
Hello?

1111
00:41:14,781 --> 00:41:15,700
Are you home?

1112
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,580
Can you gather everyone

1113
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,741
for a meeting at the office?

1114
00:41:19,341 --> 00:41:20,781
I need to modify our strategy.

1115
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:21,540
Got it.

1116
00:41:22,341 --> 00:41:22,981
Appreciate it.

1117
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,341
Thank you.

1118
00:41:41,301 --> 00:41:41,968
I'll drive you.

1119
00:41:42,981 --> 00:41:43,461
Okay.

1120
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,280
Blending tradition with modernity,

1121
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,060
(Yan Studio reveals
neo-Chinese aesthetics)

1122
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,576
(rooted in ethnic cultural essence.)

1123
00:41:58,576 --> 00:41:59,620
(Due to the counterfeits,)

1124
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,660
(the brand)

1125
00:42:00,821 --> 00:42:01,540
(once faced)

1126
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,020
(a devastating impact)

1127
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,341
(that damaged its reputation)

1128
00:42:04,341 --> 00:42:05,821
(and consumer trust.)

1129
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,220
(However, through this competition,)

1130
00:42:08,301 --> 00:42:09,741
(they've demonstrated)

1131
00:42:09,741 --> 00:42:11,981
(a unique design philosophy
and commercial success.)

1132
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,020
(Meanwhile,)

1133
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,620
(they gained acclaim,)

1134
00:42:14,861 --> 00:42:16,261
(won the Commercial Value Award,)

1135
00:42:16,301 --> 00:42:18,620
(and achieved miraculous sales growth.)

1136
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:19,540
Cheers.

1137
00:42:21,941 --> 00:42:22,700
Guys.

1138
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,660
Right now,

1139
00:42:24,901 --> 00:42:25,981
let Ms. Xu

1140
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,781
speak.

1141
00:42:28,741 --> 00:42:29,580
Welcome.

1142
00:42:32,981 --> 00:42:33,500
Alright.

1143
00:42:33,741 --> 00:42:34,861
On behalf

1144
00:42:35,461 --> 00:42:36,341
of Yan Studio,

1145
00:42:36,381 --> 00:42:37,620
I'm speaking.

1146
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,620
This journey

1147
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,901
has been challenging.

1148
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,461
I think

1149
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,660
we're all aware of that.

1150
00:42:46,781 --> 00:42:49,140
Yan Studio's success

1151
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,981
belongs to

1152
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,821
every team member here.

1153
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:53,861
Thank you all.

1154
00:42:58,421 --> 00:42:59,180
What's more,

1155
00:42:59,461 --> 00:43:01,781
special gratitude goes

1156
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,540
to someone.

1157
00:43:06,941 --> 00:43:08,421
Well,

1158
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,421
in the lowest moments

1159
00:43:11,421 --> 00:43:12,540
of Yan Studio,

1160
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,580
he backed us up

1161
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,261
and gave us strength.

1162
00:43:21,381 --> 00:43:22,580
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

1163
00:43:24,741 --> 00:43:25,941
That's our first investor.

1164
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,220
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

1165
00:43:27,821 --> 00:43:31,821

1166
00:43:32,421 --> 00:43:33,140
Listen,

1167
00:43:33,821 --> 00:43:34,781
I'll continue investing.

1168
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,140
The amount will double.

1169
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,781
In the coming days, Yan Studio and I

1170
00:43:39,941 --> 00:43:40,700
will advance

1171
00:43:40,821 --> 00:43:41,901
together.

1172
00:43:42,781 --> 00:43:43,381
Also,

1173
00:43:44,381 --> 00:43:45,461
after drinking,

1174
00:43:45,981 --> 00:43:47,020
we'll have a lucky draw.

1175
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,301
No cap on the prize money!

1176
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:50,620
Cheers!

1177
00:43:50,781 --> 00:43:54,301
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

1178
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,261
Thank you.

1179
00:43:55,461 --> 00:43:56,060
Thank you.

1180
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:56,781
So exciting!

1181
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,540
There's prize money.

1182
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:02,781
Listen.

1183
00:44:02,821 --> 00:44:03,700
There's prize money.

1184
00:44:06,781 --> 00:44:08,341
The renowned Spanish designer

1185
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,060
Ivan

1186
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:10,981
saw your performance

1187
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,341
at the Qinglan Cup competition

1188
00:44:12,381 --> 00:44:13,220
and showed interest.

1189
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:14,901
His assistant called me,

1190
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,500
saying Ivan wants to meet you.

1191
00:44:18,421 --> 00:44:19,540
What's that? Is it good?

1192
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:20,140
Get me one.

1193
00:44:21,421 --> 00:44:23,020
I'll inform them later.

1194
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:25,580
So what should we prepare?

1195
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:27,301
Samples,

1196
00:44:27,381 --> 00:44:28,781
and have all documents ready.

1197
00:44:29,941 --> 00:44:31,700
I think to show our

1198
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,381
sincerity,

1199
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,461
you should learn some

1200
00:44:34,461 --> 00:44:35,220
Spanish.

1201
00:44:35,341 --> 00:44:36,220
Definitely.

1202
00:44:36,461 --> 00:44:37,341
Cheers!

1203
00:44:37,901 --> 00:44:39,381
I'll find a tutor.

1204
00:44:39,781 --> 00:44:40,580
No need.

1205
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:41,341
I'll teach you.

1206
00:44:42,261 --> 00:44:43,020
It's easy.

1207
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:44,100
Hello. Thank you.

1208
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,741
It's an honor to meet you.

1209
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:47,440
Say hi in Spanish.
