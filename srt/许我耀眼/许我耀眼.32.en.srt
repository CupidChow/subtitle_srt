00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,000
Let me watch

81
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Let me watch

82
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Ok

83
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Ok

84
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Qu Mingcheng's land transaction

85
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Has been frozen by the government

86
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
There is no way to complete

87
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The map of the board of directors

88
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The next days

89
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's not easy

90
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
He's like a crazy man

91
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Suddenly fell down

92
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Then fell

93
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Dizzy

94
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
When I woke up

95
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I found myself

96
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I was tied up

97
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I have to thank you for your cooperation

98
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Anyway

99
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You are in my heart

100
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Always my big brother

101
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Although

102
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You compete with me in business

103
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But

104
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But I

105
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I really don't want to see you like this

106
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You don't have to say it again

107
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Anyway, my dad can't hear

108
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
He has been unconscious

109
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
No awareness at all

110
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Hao Ming

111
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Your dad

112
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Sudden brain hemorrhage

113
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This is not predictable

114
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He is like this

115
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I feel very uncomfortable

116
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I want to come and see him again

117
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Have you finished watching

118
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Anyway, my mom will come in a while

119
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He won't want to see you

120
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Good good

121
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Take good care of your dad

122
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What is the need

123
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What is the need

124
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I will do my best

125
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You think

126
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I and Lao Qu

127
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Who is better?

128
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It must be your dad

129
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You are better at acting

130
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Be careful

131
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Before the end of the bidding

132
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I have to tell you

133
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I have to tell you

134
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I have to tell you

135
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I have to tell you

136
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Before the end of the bidding

137
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I still want you to work hard

138
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Stay here for a while

139
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Row

140
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Listen to you

141
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You let me live in the hospital

142
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
To let Qu Mingcheng relax

143
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The board of directors and his team

144
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's also your hand

145
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Right

146
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Mainly in the board of directors

147
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
In the board of directors

148
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Many of the uncle and aunt

149
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Are on your side

150
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I went to them in private

151
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I told them about this topic

152
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
They all agree

153
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But

154
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
There is one thing

155
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I didn't think too much

156
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Qu Mingcheng and Huang Chu Ming

157
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The bidding is internal news

158
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Not everyone

159
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You can ask around

160
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Ok

161
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Mr. Huang

162
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Qu Mingcheng has been officially approved

163
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The diamond block project

164
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Designs a huge amount

165
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Qu Mingcheng can't escape the legal sanctions

166
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This scene

167
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Finally ended

168
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
If it weren't for you, Mr. Huang

169
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
If you are in the game

170
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The move to Qu Mingcheng's plan

171
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It won't go so smoothly

172
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Mr. Huang

173
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Why did you choose

174
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
To cooperate with me?

175
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
To be honest

176
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You and Shen Haoming

177
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Have the same conditions

178
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
But you have the golden answer

179
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Shen Haoming is too small

180
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But I have a request

181
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Say it

182
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Except for our good deal

183
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I also want you

184
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
In Hong Kong

185
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Those two companies

186
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I want you to be in Hong Kong

187
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I want you to be in Hong Kong

188
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Those two companies

189
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You are talking big

190
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
This is my only condition

191
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You should know

192
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That's what I have been thinking for years

193
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
When you become the official chairman

194
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You won't be able to do anything for that side

195
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But those two companies

196
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Are very important to my layout in Hong Kong

197
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You are the man

198
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I won't force you

199
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Is there any other choice?

200
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This time I will accompany you to be the official secretary

201
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I will get more revenge

202
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
One more

203
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I don't think so

204
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He is greedy

205
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I am more greedy than him

206
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
He can trust me

207
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
According to the situation of both sides

208
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
He is indeed on the upper side

209
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I have been thinking about one question for a long time

210
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Why did Mr. Huang choose to trust me?

211
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
First, he pulled me as the target

212
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
He made a mistake at the beginning of this game

213
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Second, you are very generous

214
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You met my requirements

215
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Third, you have been in the business for so many years

216
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You have seen a lot of people

217
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But there are few people you can trust

218
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You should be honest

219
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Haoming

220
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I like both of you

221
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I believe you will go further

222
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Thank you

223
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I have to go now

224
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The phone is ringing

225
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Grandpa

226
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I just broke up with Mr. Huang

227
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It went well

228
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What?

229
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Fang Lei came home

230
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Ok, I will be back

231
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What do you want to see me?

232
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Look at this

233
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I am sorry

234
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Chenchen

235
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
He is not your child

236
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What are you talking about?

237
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Say something

238
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What's going on?

239
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What's going on?

240
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
My sister came to me suddenly

241
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
She told me she was pregnant

242
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You are pregnant?

243
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Whose child is it?

244
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I don't know if the child belongs to Shen Haoming

245
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What are you talking about?

246
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You broke up with Haoming

247
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes, but we have been separated for two months

248
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Did he know?

249
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I can't guarantee that he is the child

250
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I went to the bar to drink on the day of the breakup

251
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I met a Chinese painter

252
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I didn't know he was the painter

253
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I didn't know he was the painter

254
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I doubted the painter

255
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
We both drank a lot that day

256
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Then

257
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But it was the only time

258
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Who is the painter?

259
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Where is he now?

260
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I didn't even keep the contact

261
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What are you going to do now?

262
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Later

263
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
My sister came to you

264
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Tell me

265
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Tell me

266
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
The paternity test that year

267
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Why does it prove that Chen Zhen and I are related by father and son?

268
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Why?

269
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's all my fault

270
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's all my fault

271
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I thought

272
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
As long as you always think

273
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Chen Chen is your biological child

274
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Me and you

275
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The relationship of this life

276
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Can't be separated

277
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Stay together

278
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
More smoothly

279
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's me

280
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I know you're going to do the paternity test report

281
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
After the report

282
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
With the fake self-proclaimed

283
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Replace the real result

284
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You are a lunatic

285
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I know I'm ridiculous and childish

286
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Is this ridiculous and childish?

287
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Is it your selfishness?

288
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I know

289
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I know

290
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I know

291
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I know

292
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I know

293
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I know

294
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I know

295
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I know

296
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I know

297
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I know

298
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I know I'm wrong

299
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I know I'm wrong

300
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm sorry

301
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

302
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I can go to Jingda now

303
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'll tell them

304
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Chen Chen's real identity

305
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So you and Uncle Shen

306
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Can go back to the board of directors

307
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Fang Lei

308
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You are not human at all

309
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You have no heart

310
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Have you ever thought about Chen Chen's future?

311
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What will Chen Chen do in the future?

312
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Chen Chen finally got Haomi as a father

313
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Do you know how much we have done?

314
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
How much he has done?

315
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I tell you

316
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I won't allow anyone to hurt Chen Chen

317
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
He can only stay with me

318
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Do you understand?

319
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Chen Chen will always be my son

320
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Yanyan and I are his parents

321
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
This home

322
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Is Chen Chen's home

323
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I know

324
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I know

325
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I know

326
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm sorry

327
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm sorry

328
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm really sorry

329
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm sorry

330
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm sorry

331
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm sorry

332
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm sorry

333
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm sorry

334
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm sorry

335
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm sorry

336
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm sorry

337
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,680
Have some drinks.

338
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,120
Though more than that.

339
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,760
Great.

340
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm a lawyer from the 15th District.

341
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,880
If you need anything,

342
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,120
just call me anytime.

343
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,880
What else do you want?

344
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,720
Steve went in with your godfather.

345
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,680
You should be glad

346
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,040
that you were abandoned by them

347
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,280
and became their wife.

348
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,040
Waiter,

349
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,360
get me a bottle.

350
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,640
I'm sorry.

351
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,400
I'm sorry.

352
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,080
I'm sorry.

353
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,800
I'm sorry.

354
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,560
I'm sorry.

355
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,320
I'm sorry.

356
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,120
I'm sorry.

357
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,080
So you're here to laugh at me, right?

358
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,400
Let's drink while we talk.

359
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,120
I'm going back to England.

360
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,120
Go ahead.

361
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,640
Come with me.

362
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,240
Compared to those people I don't know,

363
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,680
at least I know

364
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,440
that you're a bad person.

365
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,640
In order to avoid you going into society,

366
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,880
you'd better stay in my hands

367
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,320
so that you don't harm others.

368
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,560
I'll give you a day to think about it.

369
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,880
Haoming,

370
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,840
although Qu Mingcheng has left,

371
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,560
the case of Shen Family

372
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,360
has caused a great loss to Jin Da.

373
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,600
You're now proposing

374
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,920
to return the board of directors

375
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,280
and Jin Da.

376
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,280
We also want to ask you

377
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,720
what you can do for Jin Da.

378
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:13,880
Captain,

379
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,520
without a solid performance,

380
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,960
we can't get the board of directors.

381
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,000
My plan has never changed.

382
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,560
I'll take the North Overseas Spring and get the diamond money.

383
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,280
Jin Da has lost the right to bid.

384
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,000
The original funds

385
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,440
can be invested in my company,

386
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,240
Xinye.

387
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,360
You're going to do your own business

388
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,080
with Jin Da's money?

389
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:35,800
This...

390
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,160
When the bidding is successful,

391
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,800
Xinye will get the block

392
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,800
and we can develop it together with Jin Da.

393
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,480
We need to review

394
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,480
the bidding plan and development strategy.

395
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,960
I'm ready.

396
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,560
Please open it.

397
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,760
Before we start the meeting,

398
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,680
let's welcome

399
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,760
the new members of Yan Yifang.

400
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,800
Welcome.

401
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,720
Yan Yifang and Cao Muran's cooperation

402
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,600
has made the number of tourists in Gubei town

403
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,960
increase to 32%.

404
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,400
Thank you for your hard work.

405
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,280
I'd like to say something.

406
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,160
Yan Yifang's offline physical store

407
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,800
is about to start.

408
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,880
I hope we can not only promote

409
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,480
the new Chinese service,

410
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,360
but also create a chance

411
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,800
for more people

412
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,960
through offline layout.

413
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,720
It's very important.

414
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,600
So now, let's let Mr. Qiao

415
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,120
tell us about our offline layout.

416
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:38,640
Okay.

417
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,120
Next,

418
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,640
we'll focus on the plan for the next three years.

419
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,400
Our plan is to add 50 new stores

420
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,120
to the offline physical store.

421
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,760
We're expected to provide more than 300 job positions.

422
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,360
Okay.

423
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,360
Great.

424
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,960
Our marketing department

425
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,600
will combine the online and offline sales

426
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,960
to further enhance the platform.

427
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,240
Then, Cao Muran's new series of summer football

428
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,320
is looking forward to it.

429
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,360
Don't say that.

430
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,440
I can't wait.

431
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,280
You know, I practice so hard

432
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,240
at home every day.

433
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,160
Let me tell you.

434
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,040
Among our JTC colleagues,

435
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,080
there are your fans.

436
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,640
You know, they're all young.

437
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,080
Cao Muran.

438
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,600
Where are you going?

439
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,080
Where are you going?

440
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,640
I'm not going to be a good friend of yours.

441
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,640
I'm going to be a good friend of yours.

442
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,640
I'm going to be a good friend of yours.

443
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,640
I'm going to be a good friend of yours.

444
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,640
I'm going to be a good friend of yours.

445
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,640
I'm going to be a good friend of yours.

446
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,640
I'm going to be a good friend of yours.

447
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,640
I'm going to be a good friend of yours.

448
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,640
I'm going to be a good friend of yours.

449
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,640
I'm going to be a good friend of yours.

450
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,640
I'm going to be a good friend of yours.

451
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,640
I'm going to be a good friend of yours.

452
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,640
I'm going to be a good friend of yours.

453
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,640
I'm going to be a good friend of yours.

454
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,640
It's definitely you, Wang Xiaolu.

455
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,640
I hope you'll continue to be wonderful.

456
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,640
The child has a cold.

457
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,640
Use the Kuihua child's Anfen Huang's immune system

458
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,640
to relieve the child's severe cold.

459
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,640
Kuihua invites you to continue to be wonderful.

460
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,640
What's wrong?

461
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,640
What did the board say?

462
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,640
They rejected it.

463
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,640
What's the reason?

464
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,640
They have no objections to the bidding plan.

465
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,640
But they are not very satisfied

466
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,640
with the development plan of North Overseas Sichuan.

467
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,640
They are not very satisfied with the development plan of North Overseas Sichuan.

468
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,640
They think it's a fair game.

469
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,640
They think it's a fair game.

470
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,640
They think it's a fair game.

471
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,640
They think it's a fair game.

472
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,640
Duygusal.

473
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,640
Take away a laugh.

474
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,640
Take away a laugh.

475
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,640
No.

476
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,480
No.

477
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,640
I can't do it.

478
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,640
Keep saying it.

479
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,640
No.

480
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,640
No.

481
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,520
we've been looking for

482
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,400
the characteristics of the brand.

483
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,920
I remember the first time

484
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,120
I showed the proposal to Jiang Liang,

485
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,040
he rejected it completely.

486
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,760
That's why we changed the direction.

487
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,760
From the ultimate pursuit of fashion design

488
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,080
to the actual demand of the public

489
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,360
in fashion,

490
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,160
this change

491
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,720
opened Yan Yifang's eyes.

492
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,040
Yan Yan, do you remember

493
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,160
you told me

494
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,960
that you found that governments

495
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,760
are very important

496
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,720
to the inheritance and protection of human history?

497
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,040
That's right.

498
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,560
So,

499
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,960
can I hire you

500
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,200
as the co-pilot

501
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,280
of the North Overseas Ship?

502
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,960
Show me the proposal.

503
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,040
Here it is.

504
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,840
This one.

505
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,240
Look at the next one.

506
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,000
But this ship has been

507
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,880
followed by many

508
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,160
famous developers.

509
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,760
Thank you, shareholders,

510
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,720
for coming to our

511
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,720
project introduction

512
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,480
of the No. 1137 piece.

513
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,560
Mr. Shen,

514
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
please introduce

515
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,640
the features of the project.

516
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,480
After all, the last time we came back

517
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,080
was at this critical point.

518
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,440
This is our main building.

519
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,640
The elements of our design

520
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,200
are the core of Jiangshui.

521
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,760
The mobile water-wood wall technology

522
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,160
can enhance

523
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,160
our light and shadow effect.

524
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:19,960
Not bad.

525
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,880
This is a beautiful piece of art.

526
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,480
Mr. Shen,

527
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,640
this main building,

528
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,960
although we think it's good,

529
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,480
how can you be sure

530
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,200
that the No. 1137 piece

531
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,240
will become

532
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,280
the top piece of the project?

533
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,760
Regarding the cultural positioning

534
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,760
of our project,

535
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,400
please welcome

536
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,080
the famous art director

537
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,880
of our special project,

538
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:41,960
the famous

539
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,320
founder of Yan Yifang,

540
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,000
Miss Xu Yan,

541
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,280
to introduce the project.

542
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,440
Hello, shareholders.

543
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,120
I'm Xu Yan.

544
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,640
Regarding the design of the No. 1137 piece,

545
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,720
our initial plan

546
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,600
is to improve the value of the project

547
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,000
through cultural activities

548
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,600
and art exhibitions.

549
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,320
Most of the business complexes

550
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,680
in the past

551
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,920
were made by foreign brands

552
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,360
to show the core value.

553
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,120
However, in recent years,

554
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,120
consumers are increasingly interested

555
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,360
in Chinese style and consume for it.

556
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,280
So we can see

557
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,440
the rise of Chinese culture

558
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,480
and the improvement of national honor

559
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,480
and cultural confidence.

560
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,160
In the past three years,

561
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,080
the annual increase in the V-E consumer market

562
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,360
has exceeded 40%.

563
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,640
The market has now reached

564
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,640
150 billion yuan.

565
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:28,840
Last year,

566
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,360
the sales of Chinese style clothing

567
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,120
increased by 43%.

568
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,400
The increase of non-event handcrafted products

569
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,080
has increased by 60%.

570
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,200
Tell us more about your plan.

571
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,000
The core strategy of this project

572
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,720
is to introduce a series of

573
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,360
Chinese style lung brand.

574
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,680
We have three stages.

575
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,760
The first stage

576
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,720
will introduce

577
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,520

00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,960

Nanjing Yunjin Zhizao Memory,

580
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,600
and Hunan Xiangxiu Memory.

581
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,360
The second stage

582
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,400
will introduce

583
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,680
traditional craft brand,

584
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,440
such as

585
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,560
Yixing's Zishatou,

586
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,920
Longquan Qingci,

587
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,200
and Henan Ruchi.

588
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,480
The third stage

589
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,280
will introduce

590
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,440
jewelry and art brands.

591
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,600
Jin Si Fahlang Craft,

592
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,880
Hua Si Xiangqian,

593
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,840
and Jingtai Lan.

594
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,120
These brands

595
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,560
are all for our purpose

596
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,800
to create a non-event.

597
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,040
The purpose of our project

598
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,120
is to create

599
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,880
a sustainable and economic

600
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,000
cycle.

601
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,520
We want these craftsmen

602
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,880
to have a sustainable

603
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,280
and secure

604
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,320
sustainable development.

605
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,920
We hope

606
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,520
this area

607
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,320
is not a short-term

608
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,120
activity

609
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,640
or a exhibition.

610
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,560
We want them

611
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,000
to live here,

612
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,440
work here,

613
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,200
and have a sense of belonging

614
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,600
here.

615
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,520
How do we avoid

616
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,200
Jin Da's investment risk?

617
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,680
Shen Family's free funds

618
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,840
will be used as a reserve fund.

619
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,920
Jin Da's investment funds

620
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,600
will be used as priority funds.

621
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,760
You can get the profit

622
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,360
and take the risk.

623
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,800
I hope that

624
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,240
Jin Da's investment risk

625
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,360
will be reduced to the lowest.

626
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,520
After two and a half hours

627
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,880
and 186 rounds of sale,

628
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,600
the new building

629
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,600
has been sold for 38.06 billion yuan

630
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,320
and has been successfully sold

631
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,280
to the overseas market.

632
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,680
The price is 27.4 percent.

633
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:36,920
Mr. Shen,

634
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,120
do you have any plans

635
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,160
for the future development of Xinyi?

636
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,760
I want to say that

637
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,120
today is a day

638
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,400
of our company's ceremony.

639
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,600
I hope that everyone

640
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,640
will continue to follow us.

641
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,680
Thank you.

642
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,040
Today's meeting

643
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,000
is very meaningful.

644
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,200
First of all,

645
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,400
we need to get rid of

646
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,600
Mr. Shen Jinsong

647
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,120
and Mr. Shen Haoming's

648
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,000
compensation lawsuit

649
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,320
and recover all the jobs of the two people.

650
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,200
Next,

651
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,800
we need to re-discuss

652
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,320
the new personnel and mission arrangement.

653
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,520
Currently,

654
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,280
Jin Da and Xinyi

655
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,960
have successfully reached

656
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,080
the acquisition agreement

657
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,600
and jointly developed

658
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,560
the No. 1137

659
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,000
of Beiwai Pass.

660
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,560
Mr. Shen has made a great contribution

661
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,000
to this major cooperation.

662
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,760
He has shown his outstanding management

663
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,000
in the project operation.

664
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:19,960
After that,

665
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,240
he will build

666
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,240
a strong leadership team.

667
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,360
He will be in charge

668
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,600
of the whole project development.

669
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,360
After careful consideration,

670
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,120
I suggest

671
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,640
that Mr. Shen

672
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,400
officially join the board of directors

673
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,600
and be promoted to

674
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,520
the president of Jin Da Group.

675
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,520
Raise your hand if you agree.

676
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,520
Okay.

677
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,880
All votes are passed.

678
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,400
Congratulations, Mr. Shen.

679
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,800
Thank you, directors,

680
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,200
for your support and trust.

681
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,720
Thank you, everyone.

682
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:04,680
Okay.

683
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,360
I hope you can lead everyone

684
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,360
and Jin Da Group

685
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,720
to the right path.

686
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,560
Mr. Shen,

687
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,640
I will do my best

688
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,800
and not let you down.

689
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,400
I won't let you down.

690
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,160
I won't let you down

691
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,280
and my expectations.

692
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,040
Make more stuffing.

693
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,720
Grandma.

694
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,360
It's obvious that I made it.

695
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,040
It's obvious that you made it.

696
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,880
Why does it always look like this?

697
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,320
Yanyan,

698
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,840
no matter what you make,

699
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,360
I like it.

700
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,560
I think Haoming

701
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,920
will like it too.

702
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,040
He will.

703
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,240
He must like it.

704
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,480
Grandma, look.

705
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,080
How's my dumpling skin?

706
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,080
Not bad.

707
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,400
It's improved a lot.

708
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,000
Haoming,

709
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,600
actually, making dumplings

710
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,680
is a kind of goodwill.

711
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,960
You can eat it

712
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,640
and feel blessed.

713
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,400
You rolled the lucky wrapper here.

714
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,800
You made the stuffing.

715
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,240
I made the stuffing

716
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,360
and I'm the lucky one.

717
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,280
You're so good at talking.

718
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,640
Are you watching this online?

719
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,920
Are you staying up late again?

720
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,520
No.

721
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,280
Look at these

722
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,880
chubby dumplings.

723
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,640
I'm so happy.

724
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,200
And

725
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,480
we made

726
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,320
beef stuffing today.

727
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,720
It's so red.

728
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,720
You're a family.

729
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,320
The dumplings

730
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,680
will be the future of the imperial family.

731
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,480
We'll be blessed with a bright future.

732
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,520
Grandma.

733
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,840
Look.

734
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,680
If you stay here,

735
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,640
Haoming and I

736
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,360
can have a meal

737
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,120
every week.

738
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,280
But if you leave,

739
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,960
where can we eat dumplings?

740
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,880
How about

741
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,480
staying here?

742
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,400
I've been living here

743
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,160
for a while.

744
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,360
I miss

745
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,520
the flowers and grass in my yard.

746
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,680
And those chickens and ducks.

747
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,600
I ask my neighbors

748
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,600
to take care of them.

749
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,280
I think you're

750
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,880
really nice here.

751
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,680
You're happy.

752
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,680
But I still

753
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,760
want to go back to my yard.

754
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,640
I just want you

755
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,800
to have a happy life.

756
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,720
I'm contented.

757
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,640
What are you doing?

758
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,280
We're taking photos.

759
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,800
Today is reunion dinner.

760
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,160
Let's take a photo.

761
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,520
With dumplings?

762
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,560
Yes.

763
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,080
Let's take a selfie.

764
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,200
Here.

765
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:16,920
I...

766
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,560
Is it okay?

767
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,360
How can I take a photo?

768
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,400
Look at this.

769
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,440
Dumplings.

770
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,720
One, two, three.

771
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,200
Look.

772
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,520
What's wrong?

773
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,760
Look.

774
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,560
Grandma.

775
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,360
You're so beautiful.

776
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,640
She took half a photo with you.

777
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,400
No.

778
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,120
Look.

779
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,160
I'll perform a magic trick.

780
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,200
Okay?

781
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,800
Look.

782
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,560
Get ready.

783
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,160
Be careful.

784
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,360
Let me see.

785
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,360
Why did it run away?

786
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,760
What's this?

787
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,400
Why did it come out of the top?

788
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,600
What's going on?

789
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,240
Come on.

790
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:57,960
Change the line.

791
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:58,680
Look.

792
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,280
You have to dance.

793
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:00,680
Come on.

794
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,560
How can I use it?

795
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,360
Hold it.

796
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,000
Change it.

797
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,880
Change it.

798
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:04,840
This is magic.

799
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,480
Hold it.

800
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,200
Hold it.

801
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:06,840
Okay.

802
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,240
Come on.

803
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,280
Warm up.

804
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,560
Okay.

805
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,360
Do you want to perform a magic trick?

806
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,000
Okay.

807
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,640
Okay.

808
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,120
Let's give it some power.

809
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,720
Okay.

810
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,080
Can I open it?

811
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:17,720
Yes.

812
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,920
Don't disappear.

813
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,720
It's colorful.

814
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,080
Yes.

815
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,840
Look.

816
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,800
The eyes in the photo are so big.

817
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,080
It's a line.

818
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,680
Line.

819
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,400
Line.

820
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,280
What does it mean?

821
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,560
Grandma, this is called...

822
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,200
This is called Pairide.

823
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,720
Grandma, look at your head.

824
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,120
It's stuck here.

825
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,080
You're so good at Pairide.

826
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,600
Look how happy you are.

827
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,720
I'm so happy.

828
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,760
Grandma, you're asleep.

829
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,040
Yes.

830
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,560
What are you looking at?

831
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,440
This is the gift I gave you.

832
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,080
Isn't this my photo album?

833
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,920
Look.

834
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,920
How old were you when you took this?

835
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,360
Twenty-three.

836
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,040
Twenty-three.

837
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,160
Twenty-three.

838
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,200
Twenty-three.

839
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,320
Twenty-three.

840
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,440
Twenty-three.

841
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,640
Twenty-three.

842
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,840
Twenty-three.

843
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,960
Twenty-three.

844
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,320
Twenty-three.

845
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,760
Twenty-three.

846
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,200
Twenty-three.

847
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,640
Twenty-three.

848
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,080
Twenty-three.

849
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,600
Twenty-three.

850
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,040
Twenty-three.

851
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,400
Twenty-three.

852
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,840
Twenty-three.

853
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,440
Twenty-three.

854
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,040
Twenty-three.

855
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,640
Twenty-three.

856
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,240
Twenty-three.

857
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,800
You've thanked me.

858
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,840
The flowers are blooming.

859
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,400
I've found the answer.

860
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,680
I've been through it all.

861
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,800
In the future,

862
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,440
it will become our family portrait.

863
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,200
Here.

864
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,120
Here.

865
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,400
Here.

866
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,040
Fill it up here.

867
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,640
I think by now you know it.

868
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,240
About me and you.

869
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,480
You're so happy.

870
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,000
I am too.

871
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,800
Right now, I'll still be here with you.

872
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,120
Yeah.

873
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,240
I like you here in my arms.

874
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,880
Yeah.

875
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,280
I like you here in my arms.

876
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,200
What already happened.

877
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,560
Feeling so lost and feeling so much distractions.

878
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,920
I never thought you could be with me.

879
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,440
You comfort my sadness.

880
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,880
At the street in the morning,

881
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,640
the vague corner of the street.

882
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,240
Right then,

883
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,960
you smile at me.

884
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,480
Yeah.

885
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,280
At that moment,

886
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,520
you and I are the only ones in the world.

887
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:30,200
I want to say I'm holding your hand in this world.

888
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,840
Laola.

889
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,920
I'll remind you again.

890
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,960
Call me if you need anything.

891
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,720
I know.

892
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,880
I've kept it in my heart.

893
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,120
Yan Yan, don't worry.

894
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,800
You and Ling Ling work hard.

895
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,560
We'll take care of Laolao.

896
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,080
Your mom and I want to sell the hair salon.

897
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,480
Then move to live with Laolao.

898
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,160
It's convenient to take care of her.

899
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,720
I'm relieved then.

900
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,160
Let's go. I'll see you off.

901
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,760
Don't see me off.

902
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,040
You'll be late for work.

903
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,560
Pack up quickly.

904
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,560
Mom, let's go.

905
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,480
Bye.

906
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,200
Mom and dad, you can come here anytime.

907
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,000
Come with me next time.

908
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,240
Stay a few more days.

909
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,960
Hold the phone on the ground.

910
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,160
Weint Uhm,

911
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,320
go back with me to Island of W especies.

912
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:57,020
I'll make some

913
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,920
Don't be afraid, it's cold.

914
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,920
Let's go.

915
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,920
Get up.

916
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,920
Actually, you don't have to be so anxious.

917
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,920
Who said Yan Yifang

918
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,920
is also one of the key targets

919
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,920
of this North Overseas Ship project?

920
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,920
Who asked me to sign the contract?

921
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,920
Now you say you're not anxious.

922
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,920
What's the matter?

923
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,920
Thank you, Director Xu, for agreeing to add me.

924
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,920
Okay.

925
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,920
Thank you.

926
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,320
Where's the operation?

927
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,120
Father said I can go now.

928
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,360
You...

929
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,200
We've already

930
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,880
agreed on the contract.

931
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,640
If Mr. Xu

932
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,920
has no problem,

933
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,400
we can sign the contract.

934
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,120
Mr. Shan,

935
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,200
have a good cooperation.

936
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,200
Have a good cooperation.

937
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,320
You...

938
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,440
Have a good cooperation.

939
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,200
That's all.

940
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,580
The bar is full

941
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,660
Let's walk forward

942
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,680
Look at the traffic line

943
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,580
Is this the Haar Organ?

944
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:31,740
The neatly-made warehouse

945
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,660
marked on the background

946
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,640
was named預言

947
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,440
It's the beginning of the new style

948
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,160
People who were SA侯

949
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:39,940
prefer to stay away from it

950
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:40,560
Better to stay way away

951
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:47,560
I just want to take my time tonight

952
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,760
This is so cool

953
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,880
So beautiful

954
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,560
Is it good?

955
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:50,960
Yes

956
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,120
I'll show you

957
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,640
I'll show you what I'm wearing

958
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,160
Are you going to post it on WeChat?

959
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,120
I don't know if you're more popular

960
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:56,920
My designer

961
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,920
I'll show you

962
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,480
The one Mr. Qiao wears is beautiful

963
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,040
You look so good

964
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,560
Yes

965
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,640
Thank you Mr. Qiao

966
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,200
Go try on the body coat

967
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:09,000
Dancing even if I'm the only one

968
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:15,440
Because I just have been here too many times

969
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,600
I want to wear this dress

970
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,800
I'm so busy

971
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,320
Who cares about who I'm not

972
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,760
You can't take it off from now on

973
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,760
Until the end of the winter

974
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,000
Keep wearing it

975
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,200
I saw this dress the next morning

976
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,560
So beautiful

977
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,280
You're about the same height as Yu Yiming

978
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,000
Go go go

979
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,640
You two match

980
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,880
I'll see if it matches

981
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,680
Go

982
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,600
So good

983
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,800
Is it suitable?

984
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,600
I think so

985
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,560
Not suitable

986
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,480
Don't move

987
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,280
Is it good?

988
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,040
Is it good?

989
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,280
So good

990
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:40,680
Wait a minute

991
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,240
I'll change the angle

992
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,200
Take a photo of this side

993
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,320
Don't move

994
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,760
Sweeter

995
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,720
You two look at it closer

996
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,280
Come on, come on, come on

997
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,040
I want to take a photo too

998
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:51,640
Come on

999
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,440
Come on

1000
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,240
Don't move

1001
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:53,840
Come on

1002
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,800
I'll take a photo of this side

1003
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,400
Don't move

1004
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,120
Don't move

1005
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:56,720
Don't move

1006
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,320
Don't move

1007
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:57,840
Don't move

1008
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,360
Don't move

1009
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:06,680
Because I just have been here too many times

1010
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:11,240
I'm giving it all just getting nothing back

1011
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:18,120
I was lost in the dark and too hurt to even see

1012
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,680
See the world how it flows

1013
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:24,080
What is yours will never let go

1014
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:32,080
So I take my time to reunite

1015
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:36,760
The love that I should deserve

1016
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,680
When the time is right

1017
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:49,560
And you realize that it will be alright
