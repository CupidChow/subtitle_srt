Okay.

00:02:44,136 --> 00:02:44,576
Okay.

49
00:02:44,576 --> 00:02:47,215
Next, let me introduce
our second auction item.

50
00:02:48,456 --> 00:02:51,016
Qinghua porcelain vase
with dragon and lotus motifs.

51
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,176
As you can see here.

52
00:02:53,255 --> 00:02:55,176
It features elegant shaping
and fluid lines.

53
00:02:55,456 --> 00:02:56,815
With centuries of history,

54
00:02:56,815 --> 00:02:58,056

Quite exquisite.

You like it?

59
00:03:19,215 --> 00:03:20,336
I can't give you this one.

60
00:03:24,095 --> 00:03:26,495
But this one is fine.

61
00:03:31,056 --> 00:03:31,576
No need.

62
00:03:31,975 --> 00:03:32,456
Don't move.

63
00:03:33,136 --> 00:03:34,176
Auctions

64
00:03:34,456 --> 00:03:36,655
are just excuses for show.

65
00:03:37,495 --> 00:03:38,975
Charity's the real purpose.

66
00:03:39,695 --> 00:03:40,640
Kindness matters most.

67
00:03:41,456 --> 00:03:42,495
That's why you won't find

68
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:43,935
real treasures here.

69
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,775
You think it's worth three mil?

70
00:03:52,695 --> 00:03:53,655
Take it if you like it.

71
00:03:56,296 --> 00:03:57,935
It suits you.

72
00:03:58,416 --> 00:03:59,176
Isn't it lovely?

73
00:04:00,176 --> 00:04:01,215
So beautiful.

74
00:04:01,935 --> 00:04:03,016
It was made for you.

75
00:04:03,695 --> 00:04:04,456
It's yours now.

76
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:06,016
Let's go, dear.

77
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:08,935
What a trinket.

78
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:11,552
What else do you like?

79
00:04:12,224 --> 00:04:13,408
I'll bid for it next round.

80
00:04:13,935 --> 00:04:15,016
Know your limits.

81
00:04:15,695 --> 00:04:16,495
Be gracious.

82
00:04:17,016 --> 00:04:17,655
You said it.

83
00:04:18,136 --> 00:04:18,935
Remember to smile.

84
00:04:19,576 --> 00:04:20,215
Ms. Xu, hello.

85
00:04:20,215 --> 00:04:20,815
Mr. Shen.

86
00:04:20,815 --> 00:04:21,815
What an enviable couple.

87
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:23,935
So beautiful.

88
00:04:24,215 --> 00:04:25,215
Hello, Ms. Xu.

89
00:04:25,655 --> 00:04:26,255
Mr. Shen.

90
00:04:31,255 --> 00:04:33,736
Good evening, viewers across the nation.

91
00:04:34,176 --> 00:04:37,176
Welcome to Financial News.
I'm host Xu Yan.

92
00:04:38,176 --> 00:04:42,375
Groundbreaking ceremony of Jinda Group's
Huanyu International real estate project

93
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,216
successfully concluded today.

94
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:47,776
This 300,000 square meter development

95
00:04:47,895 --> 00:04:49,335
features not only luxury residences,

96
00:04:49,495 --> 00:04:51,656
but also international-grade
office towers

97
00:04:51,776 --> 00:04:53,056
and premium shopping complexes.

98
00:04:53,296 --> 00:04:56,015
It's crowned as Jinda Group's
flagship endeavor.

99
00:04:57,135 --> 00:04:58,375
(Good evening, everyone.)

100
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,216
(This is Entertainment Frontline.)

101
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,375
(At Jinda Group's recent
groundbreaking event,)

102
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,096
(we met picture-perfect newlyweds.)

103
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,736
(They sweetened our screens.)

104
00:05:06,815 --> 00:05:08,255
(Shen Haoming, Xu Yan, a couple's quiz)
(Sugar overload warning!)

105
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:10,455
(You maintain such marital bliss.)

106
00:05:10,495 --> 00:05:11,616
(Any secret formula?)

107
00:05:11,616 --> 00:05:12,895
(Share with our audience.)

108
00:05:19,255 --> 00:05:20,616
(No secrets here,)

109
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,856
(just good fortune.)

110
00:05:24,856 --> 00:05:25,695
(Then comes)

111
00:05:26,056 --> 00:05:29,695
(mutual admiration between partners.)

112
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:31,736
(I respect her capabilities,)

113
00:05:32,216 --> 00:05:33,736
(but most commendable is that)

114
00:05:34,135 --> 00:05:37,495
(despite having easier career options)

115
00:05:37,976 --> 00:05:39,495
(or even choosing domestic life,)

116
00:05:40,495 --> 00:05:43,695
(she pursued her childhood dream.)

117
00:05:59,096 --> 00:06:00,736
Yan, your tea.

118
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:06,296
First time seeing a host report
on her own husband's business.

119
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:08,216
You two look perfect together,

120
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:09,815
just like a match made in heaven.

121
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:11,935
Your husband clearly adores you.

122
00:06:16,015 --> 00:06:17,976
Yan, are you tired?

123
00:06:21,335 --> 00:06:22,695
Take a breather then.

124
00:06:22,935 --> 00:06:24,135
I'll monitor the edits.

Hello, Grandma.

154
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,416
Yan,

155
00:08:49,056 --> 00:08:50,855
how have you been lately?

156
00:08:54,695 --> 00:08:56,056
Why do you ask?

157
00:08:58,815 --> 00:08:59,656
Nothing.

158
00:09:00,335 --> 00:09:05,296
I just saw you on TV.
You looked a bit unhappy.

159
00:09:06,575 --> 00:09:10,215
I'm just worried you're going
through some trouble.

160
00:09:15,376 --> 00:09:17,056
If I'm overthinking it...

161
00:09:18,575 --> 00:09:20,176
I'm glad you're okay.

162
00:09:20,256 --> 00:09:21,615
Good that you're okay.

163
00:09:28,296 --> 00:09:29,136
(Yan)
Everything is fine.

164
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,656
Don't worry.

165
00:09:32,256 --> 00:09:32,855
Okay.

166
00:09:33,575 --> 00:09:34,416
That's good.

167
00:09:35,896 --> 00:09:36,935
Yan,

168
00:09:38,335 --> 00:09:42,656
you've had such a tough journey
building your career.

169
00:09:43,776 --> 00:09:46,296
Now that you've found a job you love,

170
00:09:47,496 --> 00:09:48,896
you must cherish it.

171
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,335
Whether it's work

172
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,896
or personal life,

173
00:09:54,256 --> 00:09:55,695
be down-to-earth.

174
00:09:56,056 --> 00:09:57,016
As for me,

175
00:09:57,536 --> 00:09:58,695
I'm getting old.

176
00:09:59,735 --> 00:10:05,095
I won't be around much longer, right?

177
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:07,455
Don't talk like that.

178
00:10:11,656 --> 00:10:13,935
I'll take leave next week

179
00:10:14,176 --> 00:10:15,615
and spend more days with you,

180
00:10:15,896 --> 00:10:16,496
okay?

181
00:10:17,975 --> 00:10:19,776
No need, really.

182
00:10:20,296 --> 00:10:21,575
If you have time for a vacation,

183
00:10:21,735 --> 00:10:23,095
find a nice place

184
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,575
and travel with Haoming.
That'd be lovely!

185
00:10:27,815 --> 00:10:29,776
Take lots of photos to show me.

186
00:10:29,975 --> 00:10:32,016
I'd be so happy.

187
00:10:34,095 --> 00:10:37,095
We have plenty of time together.

188
00:10:41,776 --> 00:10:43,455
I just miss you.

189
00:10:47,615 --> 00:10:48,695
I want to come home.

190
00:10:52,056 --> 00:10:53,855
I miss you too.

191
00:11:00,776 --> 00:11:04,776
Do you want to have a child?

192
00:11:06,176 --> 00:11:10,215
I want a great-grandchild.

193
00:12:43,575 --> 00:12:44,136
Grandma.

194
00:12:49,896 --> 00:12:50,656
Grandma!

195
00:12:54,296 --> 00:12:55,095
Grandma!

196
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:06,256
Yan,

197
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,935
- you're finally back!
- Hello, madam.

198
00:13:08,256 --> 00:13:10,016
Your grandma fainted last night.

199
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,256
We rushed her to the county hospital.

200
00:13:13,896 --> 00:13:14,615
County hospital?

201
00:13:15,376 --> 00:13:16,695
Your parents went too.

202
00:13:29,536 --> 00:13:30,095
Yan,

203
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:30,935
you're here.

204
00:13:30,975 --> 00:13:32,016
Check on Grandma.

205
00:13:33,776 --> 00:13:34,376
Grandma.

206
00:13:38,815 --> 00:13:39,496
Grandma.

207
00:13:39,896 --> 00:13:40,335
Yan.

208
00:13:40,855 --> 00:13:41,376
Yan,

209
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:43,215
don't worry.

210
00:13:44,215 --> 00:13:45,056
The doctor said

211
00:13:45,296 --> 00:13:47,575
she had transient cerebral ischemia.

212
00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:49,615
Luckily, we brought her in time.

213
00:13:50,335 --> 00:13:51,416
She's stable now.

214
00:13:51,975 --> 00:13:53,016
She'll be fine.

215
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:58,296
When will she wake up?

216
00:13:59,656 --> 00:14:01,016
She's just weak,

217
00:14:01,335 --> 00:14:02,656
and needs rest now.

218
00:14:12,176 --> 00:14:12,935
You can go home.

219
00:14:13,136 --> 00:14:13,855
I'll stay.

220
00:14:14,536 --> 00:14:16,095
Let's all stay together.

221
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,296
I'll be fine here.

222
00:14:28,896 --> 00:14:29,335
Okay.

223
00:14:29,776 --> 00:14:31,776
We'll relieve you tomorrow morning.

224
00:14:38,575 --> 00:14:39,656
If anything happens,

225
00:14:39,815 --> 00:14:41,095
call us, okay?

226
00:15:10,496 --> 00:15:14,735
(At this moment, I decided
to divorce Shen Haoming.)

227
00:15:17,176 --> 00:15:18,656
(If not for maintaining lies,)

228
00:15:19,656 --> 00:15:21,496
(Grandma could've seen me
in a wedding dress.)

229
00:15:22,695 --> 00:15:24,136
(If not for maintaining lies,)

230
00:15:24,776 --> 00:15:26,575
(Grandma should've been by my side,)

231
00:15:26,855 --> 00:15:28,896
(rather than collapsing
alone and helpless.)

232
00:15:30,776 --> 00:15:33,136
(My only chance to make amends)

233
00:15:34,176 --> 00:15:37,815
(is to completely end the lies myself.)

234
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:03,735
Who told you to come back?

235
00:16:09,296 --> 00:16:10,095
You're awake.

236
00:16:11,656 --> 00:16:12,575
Still feeling unwell?

237
00:16:16,215 --> 00:16:17,056
Have some water.

238
00:16:19,776 --> 00:16:20,256
Come on.

239
00:16:20,776 --> 00:16:21,536
Small sips.

240
00:16:23,056 --> 00:16:23,735
Small sips.

241
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:26,776
Don't choke on it.

242
00:16:32,735 --> 00:16:33,855
Are you feeling okay?

243
00:16:34,615 --> 00:16:35,256
Yes.

244
00:16:36,176 --> 00:16:36,935
Yan,

245
00:16:37,975 --> 00:16:40,176
raise my bed a bit straighter.

246
00:16:40,455 --> 00:16:41,815
Why? It's the middle of the night.

247
00:16:41,815 --> 00:16:42,575
Just sleep.

248
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:43,935
Just do it.

249
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:54,855
- It's okay.
- Okay?

250
00:16:55,095 --> 00:16:56,056
Okay.

251
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:04,256
Yan.

252
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:07,975
Something's bothering you.

253
00:17:09,776 --> 00:17:11,136
Tell me about it.

254
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:17,256
Come back to Jingzhou with me.

255
00:17:20,736 --> 00:17:21,655
Once you're discharged,

256
00:17:21,655 --> 00:17:23,135
we'll go pack your things, okay?

257
00:17:24,296 --> 00:17:26,855
I've lived in the countryside
my whole life,

258
00:17:27,696 --> 00:17:30,536
and I enjoy the peaceful life here.

259
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,175
I know.

260
00:17:32,776 --> 00:17:34,095
So I've thought it through.

261
00:17:34,615 --> 00:17:37,135
We can rent a place with a small yard

262
00:17:37,496 --> 00:17:39,095
in the suburbs of Jingzhou.

263
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:41,575
You can grow flowers and plants there,

264
00:17:41,655 --> 00:17:43,415
just like you do now. How's that?

265
00:17:45,016 --> 00:17:47,415
That does sound nice.

266
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,736
I know you're worried about me,

267
00:17:53,496 --> 00:17:57,736
but working alone in the city
must be so hard for you.

268
00:17:58,056 --> 00:18:02,936
I just want you
to live your own life well.

269
00:18:04,175 --> 00:18:07,615
Your happiness is my happiness.

270
00:18:14,776 --> 00:18:16,415
I'm doing fine.

271
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:17,736
Don't worry about me.

272
00:18:19,296 --> 00:18:24,216
Folks like us from the countryside

273
00:18:24,976 --> 00:18:27,175
are used to living in old houses

274
00:18:27,855 --> 00:18:29,456
and doing farm work.

275
00:18:30,335 --> 00:18:32,615
Suddenly moving away

276
00:18:33,056 --> 00:18:33,655
and settling

277
00:18:34,415 --> 00:18:36,855
into a big city house

278
00:18:38,135 --> 00:18:39,575
would leave me feeling lost.

279
00:18:40,016 --> 00:18:42,976
My whole being would feel uneasy.

280
00:18:45,135 --> 00:18:45,936
Got it.

281
00:18:48,135 --> 00:18:49,655
I'll sleep now. You should leave.

282
00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:13,895
Mr. Shen,

283
00:19:14,016 --> 00:19:16,135
the legal risk report
requires your signature.

284
00:19:21,936 --> 00:19:22,536
Mr. Shen,

285
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,976
I have some information about your wife.

286
00:19:26,855 --> 00:19:27,415
Go on.

287
00:19:28,095 --> 00:19:29,655
She is looking for a divorce lawyer.

288
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,335
She won't divorce me.

289
00:19:34,095 --> 00:19:37,016
I recommend making early preparations,

290
00:19:37,415 --> 00:19:38,175
just in case.

291
00:19:38,575 --> 00:19:40,448
Now's critical for her job confirmation.

292
00:19:41,095 --> 00:19:42,175
She's worked so hard

293
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:43,496
for that position.

294
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:45,655
She won't give it up now.

295
00:19:45,776 --> 00:19:47,855
Nor will she abandon
everything she's achieved.

296
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,286
(Shen Haoming)

297
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:20,591
(Divorce Agreement)

298
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:22,976
Let's get divorced.

299
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:29,256
Didn't we clarify everything last time?

300
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:30,736
What do you want now?

301
00:20:30,815 --> 00:20:32,095
I'll leave with nothing,

302
00:20:34,736 --> 00:20:35,895
not taking a cent from you.

303
00:20:42,296 --> 00:20:43,655
Xu Yan, you know very well

304
00:20:44,855 --> 00:20:47,375
that once we divorce, the luxury cars,

305
00:20:47,976 --> 00:20:48,536
mansions,

306
00:20:48,976 --> 00:20:49,696
chauffeurs,

307
00:20:49,855 --> 00:20:50,415
maids,

308
00:20:50,855 --> 00:20:51,456
designer goods,

309
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:54,415
and all Shen family resources

310
00:20:54,696 --> 00:20:55,815
will be stripped from you.

311
00:20:55,936 --> 00:20:57,216
They were never truly mine.

312
00:20:59,976 --> 00:21:01,296
And I don't need them anymore.

313
00:21:06,895 --> 00:21:09,175
Or do you think
now that you have your career

314
00:21:11,256 --> 00:21:13,415
and that host position within reach,

315
00:21:14,335 --> 00:21:15,736
you can afford to be reckless?

316
00:21:21,095 --> 00:21:21,815
Mr. Zhou,

317
00:21:23,496 --> 00:21:24,696
as we previously agreed,

318
00:21:24,855 --> 00:21:25,536
my sponsorship

319
00:21:25,976 --> 00:21:26,696
will be postponed.

320
00:21:30,296 --> 00:21:31,256
Should I send it?

321
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,216

322
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,216
(Audio Recording)

323
00:21:54,216 --> 00:21:55,016
What do you want?

324
00:21:59,855 --> 00:22:00,415
Fang Lei,

325
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:03,615
I'm warning you
to stop harassing my husband.

326
00:22:03,615 --> 00:22:04,536
(Cancel)

327
00:22:04,536 --> 00:22:05,936
If you have any dignity,

328
00:22:06,855 --> 00:22:08,456
disappear from our lives.

329
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:10,256
Who are you to order me?

330
00:22:11,976 --> 00:22:12,895
I put the past down

331
00:22:14,256 --> 00:22:15,776
to your youth and immaturity.

332
00:22:17,855 --> 00:22:19,615
But if you keep this up,

333
00:22:20,655 --> 00:22:22,696
you're deliberately
destroying a marriage.

334
00:22:27,855 --> 00:22:29,575
If your parents also have any dignity,

335
00:22:31,175 --> 00:22:32,335
I advise you to stop.

336
00:22:32,736 --> 00:22:33,496
Is that a threat?

337
00:22:33,815 --> 00:22:36,655
(Fang Lei)
Xu Yan, let me be frank with you.

338
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:40,095
I returned just to be with Haoming.

339
00:22:40,296 --> 00:22:42,696
I don't care if he's married.

340
00:22:42,976 --> 00:22:45,175
I made myself clear last time.

341
00:22:45,415 --> 00:22:47,536
Haochen is Haoming's son,

342
00:22:47,776 --> 00:22:49,855
and I'm Haochen's aunt.

343
00:22:50,415 --> 00:22:52,056
I've already won this battle.

344
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:54,736
(End)
The one clinging to the Shen family...

345
00:22:55,855 --> 00:22:59,575

or a fight to the bitter end?

Her teacher said she's
attentive in class lately.

380
00:24:56,776 --> 00:24:57,895
No more skipping school,

381
00:24:57,895 --> 00:24:58,936
and has become humble

382
00:24:59,016 --> 00:25:00,296
in seeking help.

383
00:25:01,216 --> 00:25:02,536
Her grades have really improved.

384
00:25:03,976 --> 00:25:04,415
Thanks.

385
00:25:05,415 --> 00:25:07,456
Please keep looking after Qiao Lin.

386
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:09,016
Don't worry.

387
00:25:10,615 --> 00:25:11,335
Why not go in?

388
00:25:12,696 --> 00:25:14,335
I saw her leave.

389
00:25:15,216 --> 00:25:17,175
I have something to
attend to. I'm leaving.

390
00:25:17,536 --> 00:25:19,296
Alright.

391
00:25:19,415 --> 00:25:20,776
I'm taking out trash. Let's walk.

392
00:25:27,016 --> 00:25:27,895
Fate's funny.

393
00:25:28,335 --> 00:25:30,095
The previous tenant just moved out

394
00:25:30,216 --> 00:25:31,175
when you came back.

395
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:34,296
It seems like this apartment
was waiting for you.

396
00:25:35,776 --> 00:25:37,736
Same terms as before.
Deposit one, pay three.

397
00:25:38,575 --> 00:25:39,335
Here's your key.

398
00:25:39,615 --> 00:25:40,016
Thank you.

399
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,095
I'll get going then.

400
00:25:41,216 --> 00:25:42,736
If anything comes up, just call me.

401
00:25:42,855 --> 00:25:43,655
Thank you.

402
00:25:43,815 --> 00:25:44,296

Hello, sir.

405
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:53,815
Yiming,

406
00:27:54,175 --> 00:27:55,895
the next surgery is in the next week.

407
00:27:56,335 --> 00:27:57,815
This is a high-risk procedure.

408
00:27:58,175 --> 00:27:59,496
As you know, the patient's family

409
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:01,615
has reservations about you.

410
00:28:02,016 --> 00:28:03,895
So failure isn't an option here.

411
00:28:04,175 --> 00:28:06,575
Otherwise, the malpractice fallout
alone will ruin you.

412
00:28:08,056 --> 00:28:08,976
Understood, sir.

413
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:10,776
Get some good rest.

414
00:28:54,135 --> 00:28:55,335
What are you doing?

415
00:28:55,615 --> 00:28:56,335
Stress relief.

416
00:29:02,895 --> 00:29:04,575
Still worried about the surgery?

417
00:29:06,855 --> 00:29:07,575
Then come with me.

418
00:29:08,095 --> 00:29:08,536
Where to?

419
00:29:09,016 --> 00:29:10,855
We've got six hours until dawn.

420
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:12,456
No point wasting time here, right?

421
00:29:14,056 --> 00:29:15,232
Seriously, what's your plan?

422
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:16,335
Come on, I don't bite.

423
00:29:16,615 --> 00:29:17,016
Come.

471
00:31:12,536 --> 00:31:14,256
was our service unsatisfactory?

00:31:14,335 --> 00:31:16,256

That guy

490
00:32:08,175 --> 00:32:09,655
is 19 years younger than my mom.

491
00:32:09,976 --> 00:32:11,335
At first, he sweet-talked my mom

492
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:12,575
to buy him houses and cars.

493
00:32:12,615 --> 00:32:12,976
Alright.

494
00:32:13,175 --> 00:32:15,615
After succeeding, he started
coveting our family's shares.

495
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:18,456
This young wolf sure knows his tricks.

496
00:32:19,256 --> 00:32:21,696
My mom's currently blinded by passion.

497
00:32:21,696 --> 00:32:22,976
But I won't stand for it.

00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:25,655

00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,615

field interview schedule change?

515
00:33:07,855 --> 00:33:08,976
I haven't heard anything.

516
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:11,296
Yan is not just asking for leave,

517
00:33:11,536 --> 00:33:13,056
she's asking for an extended leave.

518
00:33:13,615 --> 00:33:14,615
You didn't know that?

519
00:33:14,936 --> 00:33:17,216
Why would she take an extended leave
all of a sudden?

520
00:33:17,855 --> 00:33:20,175
Could it be some big news

521
00:33:20,536 --> 00:33:21,335
about a baby?

522
00:33:21,976 --> 00:33:24,216
I heard she's getting divorced.

523
00:33:25,175 --> 00:33:26,415
Could there be an affair?

524
00:33:26,936 --> 00:33:28,175
I really don't know.

525
00:33:28,936 --> 00:33:30,256
I said nothing.

526
00:33:46,776 --> 00:33:47,456

Don't you always keep things business?

533
00:34:03,855 --> 00:34:04,216
Okay.

534
00:34:04,415 --> 00:34:05,736
Let's discuss business then.

00:34:06,095 --> 00:34:08,415
My father and I contributed
to the New District project.

536

A business dinner
isn't unreasonable, right?

537
00:34:11,456 --> 00:34:13,056
Is this really necessary?

538
00:34:14,016 --> 00:34:15,056
I heard you're divorcing.

539
00:34:20,855 --> 00:34:21,815
It seems true.

540
00:34:23,135 --> 00:34:25,295
I heard she hired a lawyer.

541
00:34:28,135 --> 00:34:28,896
I knew it.

542
00:34:28,936 --> 00:34:30,056
Someone like her

543
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:32,255
only pretends to love you.

544
00:34:32,615 --> 00:34:34,135
Once realizing she can't control you,

545
00:34:34,135 --> 00:34:35,376
she finds escape routes,

546
00:34:35,496 --> 00:34:36,416
maximizing her gains.

547
00:34:37,456 --> 00:34:38,175

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,655
the interview's in the executive lounge
on this floor.

550
00:34:42,135 --> 00:34:43,175
The guest will come

551
00:34:43,175 --> 00:34:44,175
after makeup.

552
00:34:48,735 --> 00:34:50,336
When will you see clearly?

553
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:52,095
I'm the one who truly loves you.

554
00:35:50,695 --> 00:35:52,016
Before my divorce,

555
00:35:53,135 --> 00:35:54,255
you're the other woman.

556
00:36:14,775 --> 00:36:15,896
How could she hit me?

557
00:36:17,615 --> 00:36:18,695
Xu Yan, stop right there!

558
00:36:23,775 --> 00:36:24,976
She's right.

559
00:36:27,056 --> 00:36:28,376
Who said we're divorced?

560
00:36:31,416 --> 00:36:34,056
Couples quarrel sometimes, okay?

561
00:36:34,416 --> 00:36:38,295
You're the Fang family heiress.
You can't be the other woman.

562
00:36:39,255 --> 00:36:40,336
Think carefully.

563
00:36:41,775 --> 00:36:42,735
Stop bothering me.

564
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:30,976
Yan,

565
00:37:32,695 --> 00:37:34,896
there've been rumors lately

566
00:37:35,536 --> 00:37:38,336
that you and Mr. Shen
are getting a divorce.

567
00:37:39,536 --> 00:37:41,416
Everyone's buzzing about it.

568
00:37:41,735 --> 00:37:44,056
Even the management
are discreetly asking.

569
00:37:45,336 --> 00:37:46,295
I'm sure

570
00:37:46,735 --> 00:37:48,856
Sun Siwei started these rumors.

571
00:37:49,775 --> 00:37:50,655
But Yan,

572
00:37:51,295 --> 00:37:53,936
your move to host the evening news

573
00:37:54,295 --> 00:37:56,456
was practically confirmed.

574
00:37:56,976 --> 00:37:59,936
Now suddenly they favor Sun Siwei

575
00:38:00,456 --> 00:38:02,816
and start the restructuring

576
00:38:02,896 --> 00:38:04,496
to cut some shows.

577
00:38:04,856 --> 00:38:08,095
Family Feast's sponsors
are meddling too.

578
00:38:10,856 --> 00:38:14,655
I heard they secretly contacted
Sun Siwei's team.

579
00:38:17,016 --> 00:38:17,536
Yan,

580
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,295
really divorced?

581
00:38:24,416 --> 00:38:25,695
You scared me.

582
00:38:25,816 --> 00:38:26,655
I knew it.

583
00:38:26,735 --> 00:38:27,775
You two were so close.

584
00:38:27,775 --> 00:38:28,615
How's this possible?

585
00:38:29,215 --> 00:38:32,775
But occasional arguments
between couples are normal, right?

586
00:38:34,095 --> 00:38:35,095
Don't worry about it.

587
00:38:35,936 --> 00:38:36,735
Go back to work.

588
00:38:37,135 --> 00:38:37,655
Alright.

589
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:38,856
I'll get back to work.

590
00:38:40,255 --> 00:38:40,816
But listen,

591
00:38:41,536 --> 00:38:43,215
handle any issues properly.

592
00:38:43,376 --> 00:38:44,496
Don't act impulsively.

593
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:47,735
Xu Yan, the star host.

594
00:39:26,095 --> 00:39:27,536
Aren't you working today?

595
00:39:31,095 --> 00:39:32,095
You saw me?

596
00:39:35,695 --> 00:39:37,175
I'm just concerned about you.

597
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,016
After you secured the host position,

598
00:39:39,056 --> 00:39:41,175
I was going to buy flowers to celebrate.

599
00:39:41,735 --> 00:39:42,655
But look what happened.

600
00:39:43,336 --> 00:39:46,095
News about your divorce
is spreading everywhere.

601
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,496
The situation looks bad.

602
00:39:49,056 --> 00:39:50,896
You never fix your issues.

603
00:39:53,735 --> 00:39:55,215
I've told you countless times.

604
00:39:57,496 --> 00:39:59,536
Focus on your own work.

605
00:40:00,936 --> 00:40:02,016
Then it won't be like this.

606
00:40:03,376 --> 00:40:04,615
Such a hypocrite.

607
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,135
Focus on yourself?

608
00:40:07,016 --> 00:40:09,056
You really think your hosting skills

609
00:40:09,175 --> 00:40:12,016
made others concede defeat?

610
00:40:18,735 --> 00:40:19,816
I don't know if they

611
00:40:19,816 --> 00:40:20,655
concede defeat.

612
00:40:23,376 --> 00:40:23,976
But you...

613
00:40:37,775 --> 00:40:39,816
You used your husband's connections

614
00:40:39,856 --> 00:40:42,456
to invite those elites
to Family Feast, didn't you?

615
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,135
Otherwise, who would even know you,

616
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:45,536
let alone talk to you?

617
00:40:46,095 --> 00:40:49,615
You only got this position
because your husband

618
00:40:49,735 --> 00:40:52,215
struck a deep strategic deal with them

619
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:54,735
and built up trust with them.

620
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:57,416
They say they concede defeat,

621
00:40:57,775 --> 00:40:59,016
but it's not you they respect.

622
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:00,416
It's your husband.

623
00:41:00,775 --> 00:41:03,536
Now that divorce rumors
have just started,

624
00:41:03,536 --> 00:41:04,976
your position's already crumbling.

625
00:41:05,016 --> 00:41:05,735
Xu Yan,

626
00:41:06,575 --> 00:41:07,936
think carefully.

627
00:41:08,775 --> 00:41:11,255
What's truly yours?

628
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:55,775
Hello?

629
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,695
Xu Yan, come to my office.

630
00:42:02,336 --> 00:42:02,936
Okay.

631
00:42:05,416 --> 00:42:05,936
Xu Yan,

632
00:42:06,856 --> 00:42:07,976
we received an anonymous tip

633
00:42:08,376 --> 00:42:10,575
about you falsifying family background.

634
00:42:11,056 --> 00:42:12,175
What's going on?

635
00:42:15,215 --> 00:42:15,936
Sir,

636
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:20,295
I'll resign.

637
00:42:21,496 --> 00:42:22,135
Why?

638
00:42:23,175 --> 00:42:24,295
Your marriage really...

639
00:42:24,816 --> 00:42:26,016
Nothing to do with my husband.

640
00:42:30,255 --> 00:42:36,336
I'm just tired.

641
00:42:52,496 --> 00:42:54,936
(The key is controlling the heat.)

642
00:42:55,175 --> 00:42:57,095
(Oil temperature matters too.)

643
00:42:57,215 --> 00:42:58,896
(Should beef use higher heat?)

644
00:43:00,056 --> 00:43:01,695
(It depends on the cut.)

645
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:04,016
(You also...)

646
00:43:04,016 --> 00:43:05,735
(Inviting you was clearly
the right call.)

647
00:43:06,295 --> 00:43:08,575
(Okay, your dishes are nearly ready.)

648
00:43:08,615 --> 00:43:12,456
(The studio's filled with aromas.)

649
00:43:12,735 --> 00:43:15,215
(These scents make me homesick.)

650
00:43:21,775 --> 00:43:23,976
(All my career achievements)

651
00:43:24,896 --> 00:43:26,575
(were just fleeting illusions.)
