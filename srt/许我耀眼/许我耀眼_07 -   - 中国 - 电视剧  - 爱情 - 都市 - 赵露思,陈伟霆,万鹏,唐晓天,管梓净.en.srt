I'll try the eyeshadow.

30
00:02:12,836 --> 00:02:13,357
Gone?

31
00:02:15,237 --> 00:02:15,876
I'm right here.

32
00:02:16,716 --> 00:02:17,396
What do you want?

33
00:02:18,116 --> 00:02:19,237
I'll try the eyeshadow.

34
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:21,237
Go ahead.

35
00:02:25,156 --> 00:02:26,757
This color looks nice.

36
00:02:27,156 --> 00:02:28,556
Could you get me a lipstick?

37
00:02:28,676 --> 00:02:29,357
Another color.

38
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:30,917
I used No.103 yesterday.

39
00:02:30,996 --> 00:02:31,957
Get me No.105 today.

40
00:02:40,517 --> 00:02:41,116
It looks good.

41
00:02:41,237 --> 00:02:41,996
I'm leaving. Bye.

42
00:02:42,556 --> 00:02:43,996
Wait. It does look good.

43
00:02:44,436 --> 00:02:45,957
Why don't you buy one of the things

44
00:02:45,996 --> 00:02:46,957
you just tried?

45
00:02:47,197 --> 00:02:49,197
Why? I use the testers every time.

46
00:02:50,156 --> 00:02:51,357
It's been a week, Miss.

47
00:02:51,477 --> 00:02:53,797
Whether it's windy or pouring rain,

48
00:02:53,957 --> 00:02:55,556
you'd show up at 5 PM sharp

49
00:02:55,596 --> 00:02:56,957
to freeload makeup.

50
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:58,396
People might think you're here

51
00:02:58,436 --> 00:02:59,357
clocking in for work.

52
00:02:59,957 --> 00:03:00,676
An eyebrow pencil

53
00:03:00,676 --> 00:03:02,077
only costs six yuan,

54
00:03:02,077 --> 00:03:03,276
and you won't even buy one?

55
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,077
Wait.

56
00:03:04,396 --> 00:03:06,037
What do you mean "freeload makeup"?

57
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:07,317
I need to try them on

58
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:08,477
before knowing what to buy.

59
00:03:08,876 --> 00:03:09,436
Besides,

60
00:03:09,637 --> 00:03:11,276
you don't limit the makeup trials.

61
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,064
(Trials up to 6 times a week.)

62
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:17,757
I never saw this before.

63
00:03:18,357 --> 00:03:20,116
This rule was made specifically for you.

64
00:03:21,197 --> 00:03:21,917
I just won't buy.

65
00:03:22,156 --> 00:03:22,876
So what?

66
00:03:23,876 --> 00:03:24,596
Save it.

67
00:03:24,676 --> 00:03:26,116
This is consumer fraud!

68
00:03:26,637 --> 00:03:27,676
I'll report you!

69
00:03:28,156 --> 00:03:29,436
Focus on your job. Bye.

70
00:03:47,197 --> 00:03:47,757
Mom.

71
00:03:48,676 --> 00:03:49,757
I transferred the money.

72
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:50,517
Did you see it?

73
00:03:52,596 --> 00:03:54,517
Don't be frugal with it,

74
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:57,197
calculating every egg for breakfast.

75
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,317
It's not expensive!

76
00:03:58,957 --> 00:04:00,996
I know you work hard for the money.

77
00:04:01,477 --> 00:04:02,716
Being alone in Jingzhou,

78
00:04:03,116 --> 00:04:05,077
your health matters most.

79
00:04:06,957 --> 00:04:08,676
I told you I can earn enough.

80
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:10,836
You don't know how much I make daily.

81
00:04:11,037 --> 00:04:11,797
I have everything.

82
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:12,757
Okay, okay, okay.

83
00:04:13,037 --> 00:04:14,436
I know you're capable.

84
00:04:15,276 --> 00:04:17,437
But take care of yourself.

85
00:04:31,317 --> 00:04:32,396
Wh-What are those?

86
00:04:34,557 --> 00:04:35,997
These are all the testers you tried.

87
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,836
I brought you some new ones.

88
00:04:39,877 --> 00:04:41,877
Do your makeup at home from now on.

89
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:42,957
Don't come to the counter.

90
00:04:47,437 --> 00:04:49,036
If you keep pestering me there,

91
00:04:49,077 --> 00:04:50,356
I'll only be serving you.

92
00:04:50,396 --> 00:04:51,276
How will I make money?

93
00:05:07,637 --> 00:05:08,557
It's almost expired.

94
00:05:16,677 --> 00:05:17,796
The warehouse is so hot.

95
00:05:18,836 --> 00:05:20,957
Qiao Lin, we're short-staffed now.

96
00:05:21,117 --> 00:05:22,036
Can you do dispatch?

97
00:05:22,236 --> 00:05:22,796
I can.

98
00:05:23,997 --> 00:05:24,432
These.

99
00:05:25,077 --> 00:05:25,584
Great.

100
00:05:25,836 --> 00:05:27,077
Let me help you.

101
00:05:27,156 --> 00:05:27,757
Thank you.

102
00:05:29,877 --> 00:05:30,596
Wait. Wait.

103
00:05:30,677 --> 00:05:31,197
Phone call.

104
00:05:31,408 --> 00:05:31,957
Okay.

105
00:05:32,276 --> 00:05:32,916
I can do it.

106
00:05:34,156 --> 00:05:35,036
- Wait for me.
- Okay.

107
00:05:36,396 --> 00:05:36,916
Mr. Zhang.

108
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:39,637
An HQ meeting?

109
00:05:40,476 --> 00:05:41,437
Got it. Be right there.

110
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:46,197
What's wrong?

111
00:05:47,476 --> 00:05:48,396
Sorry. It's nothing.

112
00:05:48,476 --> 00:05:48,916
I'm okay.

113
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,396
I told you to wait.

114
00:05:50,437 --> 00:05:51,356
Be careful, will you?

115
00:05:51,437 --> 00:05:51,997
Sorry.

116
00:05:51,997 --> 00:05:52,396
My bad.

117
00:05:58,077 --> 00:05:59,437
Go to the hospital now.

118
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,557
Just go. Leave it to me.

119
00:06:02,557 --> 00:06:03,437
Sorry, sir.

120
00:06:04,476 --> 00:06:05,757
Th-Then I'll go first.

121
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:06,796
- Just go.
- I'm so sorry.

122
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:11,036
Works a little and demands payment.

123
00:06:18,236 --> 00:06:19,236
I got it scheduled.

124
00:06:19,757 --> 00:06:21,236
A top specialist appointment.

125
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:22,476
Your turn soon.

126
00:06:22,992 --> 00:06:23,952
(No. 37 Qiao Lin)

127
00:06:24,757 --> 00:06:25,716
Thanks, Guan.

128
00:06:26,197 --> 00:06:26,677
Sure thing.

129
00:06:28,356 --> 00:06:29,197
I'm okay. I'm okay.

130
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:30,077
We live together.

131
00:06:30,317 --> 00:06:31,356
We help each other out.

132
00:06:31,957 --> 00:06:33,836
If you ever need any help,

133
00:06:33,877 --> 00:06:35,036
you must tell me.

134
00:06:38,437 --> 00:06:39,317
Alright, I'm leaving.

135
00:06:39,356 --> 00:06:39,957
Back to stream.

136
00:06:39,997 --> 00:06:40,916
Leaving so soon?

137
00:06:41,677 --> 00:06:42,276
I need money

138
00:06:42,437 --> 00:06:43,757
to buy you bone broth.

139
00:06:44,877 --> 00:06:45,437
Love you!

140
00:06:45,637 --> 00:06:46,077
Going now.

141
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:46,637
Good luck.

142
00:06:46,757 --> 00:06:47,197
Bye.

143
00:06:48,836 --> 00:06:49,317
Wait here.

144
00:06:50,356 --> 00:06:52,637
Now calling No. 37, Qiao Lin

145
00:06:52,836 --> 00:06:54,077
to Examination Room 4.

146
00:06:54,716 --> 00:06:55,156
Hold her.

147
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:57,836
God, will it hurt?

148
00:06:58,877 --> 00:06:59,356
It's okay.

149
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:00,396
Relax your muscles.

150
00:07:01,317 --> 00:07:02,637
You'll feel it, but hold on.

151
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:09,156
Well?

152
00:07:11,596 --> 00:07:12,156
That's it?

153
00:07:14,077 --> 00:07:14,637
Check it out.

154
00:07:15,197 --> 00:07:16,716
It seems... better now.

155
00:07:17,117 --> 00:07:17,757
Help her up.

156
00:07:18,557 --> 00:07:19,197
Move it around.

157
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:19,957
Don't force it.

158
00:07:20,677 --> 00:07:21,637
Okay, thank you.

159
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:24,957
I feel better.

160
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:26,916
I've realigned it.

161
00:07:27,476 --> 00:07:29,117
No heavy lifting for three months,

162
00:07:30,236 --> 00:07:31,077
and don't overuse it.

163
00:07:32,276 --> 00:07:34,036
Otherwise, you might re-dislocate.

164
00:07:34,957 --> 00:07:36,117
So... it heals this fast?

165
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,197
Will it hurt again?

166
00:07:37,716 --> 00:07:39,036
If it hurts again later,

167
00:07:39,117 --> 00:07:40,317
I'll come straight to you.

168
00:07:40,557 --> 00:07:42,317
I won't pay the registration fee.

169
00:07:45,396 --> 00:07:46,557
You really haven't changed.

170
00:07:50,197 --> 00:07:50,757
Qiao Lin.

171
00:07:56,557 --> 00:07:57,356
Yu Yiming?

172
00:07:57,546 --> 00:08:00,176
(Yu Yiming)

173
00:08:00,176 --> 00:08:02,000
(City ranking: No. 1)

174
00:08:02,957 --> 00:08:05,557
Feels like we're growing apart.

175
00:08:06,276 --> 00:08:07,197
Don't be sad.

176
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,236
We're all repeating.

177
00:08:08,276 --> 00:08:09,156
We can hang out.

178
00:08:09,997 --> 00:08:10,317
Exactly.

179
00:08:10,437 --> 00:08:11,476
Think about it again.

180
00:08:11,517 --> 00:08:12,517
Feel any better?

181
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,596
I actually feel worse.

182
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,557
I'll give you drugs for the pain.

183
00:08:19,396 --> 00:08:20,796
You might not feel anything now,

184
00:08:21,117 --> 00:08:22,557
but in 2-3 hours,

185
00:08:22,796 --> 00:08:23,476
it might hurt.

186
00:08:24,156 --> 00:08:25,396
Take meds if it's mild.

187
00:08:25,877 --> 00:08:27,517
If severe, come for an X-ray

188
00:08:27,836 --> 00:08:29,276
to check for soft tissue effusion.

189
00:08:29,557 --> 00:08:29,997
Okay.

190
00:08:30,637 --> 00:08:31,356
Thank you.

191
00:08:34,397 --> 00:08:35,157
Been here long?

192
00:08:35,917 --> 00:08:38,636
I arrived about two months ago.

193
00:08:39,077 --> 00:08:39,476
You live?

194
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:42,636
I share an apartment with two friends.

195
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:43,557
Girls.

196
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:46,516
It's set back now.

197
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:47,917
But if any issues arise,

198
00:08:48,077 --> 00:08:49,157
come see me immediately.

199
00:08:50,116 --> 00:08:50,917
No registration fee.

200
00:08:53,476 --> 00:08:54,836
Daily life will be inconvenient.

201
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:56,756
Contact your parents?

202
00:08:57,356 --> 00:08:58,596
They're back in our hometown.

203
00:08:59,557 --> 00:09:00,236
Qiao Yan?

204
00:09:04,157 --> 00:09:04,677
Qiao Yan.

205
00:09:05,876 --> 00:09:06,797
My letter.

206
00:09:07,397 --> 00:09:08,116
Did you read it?

207
00:09:10,037 --> 00:09:10,756
Take it back.

208
00:09:12,957 --> 00:09:13,476
Yu Yiming.

209
00:09:13,876 --> 00:09:15,317
I came today to tell you

210
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:17,957
I don't want to date.

211
00:09:18,397 --> 00:09:20,236
I just want to focus on studying.

212
00:09:20,557 --> 00:09:21,957
Other things aren't in my plans.

213
00:09:22,236 --> 00:09:23,397
I won't disturb your studies.

214
00:09:24,317 --> 00:09:25,756
I just wanted to say I like you.

215
00:09:25,797 --> 00:09:26,636
I don't like you.

216
00:09:41,077 --> 00:09:42,516
She goes by Xu Yan now.

217
00:09:43,437 --> 00:09:44,277
Ever been in touch?

218
00:09:44,957 --> 00:09:45,677
Have you?

219
00:09:47,797 --> 00:09:48,596
No.

220
00:09:49,557 --> 00:09:51,116
She came here for college, right?

221
00:09:51,636 --> 00:09:52,077
Yes.

222
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:54,557
But she's too busy with work now.

223
00:09:54,836 --> 00:09:55,756
My injury is fine.

224
00:09:55,756 --> 00:09:56,437
I'm alright.

225
00:09:56,756 --> 00:09:58,037
Bone injuries are serious.

226
00:09:58,317 --> 00:09:59,636
Trust your doctor's advice.

227
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:01,116
If it's awkward for you,

228
00:10:01,836 --> 00:10:02,636
give me her number.

229
00:10:02,756 --> 00:10:03,356
I'll call her.

230
00:10:03,596 --> 00:10:04,636
No, that's unnecessary.

231
00:10:14,512 --> 00:10:16,944
(Jingzhou Yuekang Hospital)

232
00:10:18,876 --> 00:10:20,596
I don't think she'll come.

233
00:10:20,636 --> 00:10:21,756
Her work keeps her occupied.

234
00:10:22,476 --> 00:10:24,197
You don't need to stay with me.

235
00:10:24,236 --> 00:10:25,037
I'm fine on my own.

236
00:10:25,836 --> 00:10:27,397
It's fine. I'm off duty anyway.

237
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:30,197
Xu Yan.

238
00:10:33,197 --> 00:10:34,116
Yu Yiming?

239
00:10:34,716 --> 00:10:35,516
Long time no see.

240
00:10:41,356 --> 00:10:42,236
What happened?

241
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,677
Nothing serious. Just a minor injury.

242
00:10:45,836 --> 00:10:46,957
If you're busy,

243
00:10:46,957 --> 00:10:47,677
I'm fine.

244
00:10:47,756 --> 00:10:48,596
You can go back.

245
00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:51,716
It's been a long time.

246
00:10:52,077 --> 00:10:52,876
How have you been?

247
00:10:53,636 --> 00:10:54,317
Working at?

248
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:58,317
After graduation,

249
00:10:58,437 --> 00:10:59,756
I stayed in Jingzhou.

250
00:11:00,797 --> 00:11:01,437
That's good.

251
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:02,876
I work here.

252
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:04,797
An orthopedic doctor.

253
00:11:08,116 --> 00:11:09,116
Thank you for today.

254
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:10,197
Of course.

255
00:11:16,957 --> 00:11:17,596
You got married?

256
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:21,236
Yes, last month.

257
00:11:22,677 --> 00:11:23,716
Though it's a bit late,

258
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:25,356
congratulations.

259
00:11:27,836 --> 00:11:29,037
Now that your sister's here,

260
00:11:29,077 --> 00:11:29,716
I'm relieved.

261
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:31,077
Take your drugs.

262
00:11:31,756 --> 00:11:33,677
If anything, let me know.

263
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:39,636
Bye.

264
00:12:00,996 --> 00:12:01,516
Let's go.

265
00:12:03,437 --> 00:12:04,557
Okay, let's go.

266
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:08,437
Thanks for coming.

267
00:12:13,277 --> 00:12:14,636
My room is right across.

268
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:30,116
Found a place,

269
00:12:31,756 --> 00:12:32,876
got a job too.

270
00:12:34,636 --> 00:12:36,437
Seems you're really staying in Jingzhou.

271
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:37,996
Stop meddling in my affairs.

272
00:12:42,836 --> 00:12:44,917
Those two are my roommates' rooms.

273
00:12:51,797 --> 00:12:52,356
Move out.

274
00:12:53,917 --> 00:12:55,636
What nonsense are you saying?

275
00:12:55,797 --> 00:12:56,756
Your bedroom's small,

276
00:12:56,957 --> 00:12:58,157
with no private bathroom

277
00:12:58,756 --> 00:12:59,797
and barely any furniture.

278
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:03,088
I'll find you a new place.

279
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,516
Who asked you to do that?

280
00:13:06,197 --> 00:13:07,277
I'm not helping you.

281
00:13:08,516 --> 00:13:10,197
Since you're staying in Jingzhou,

282
00:13:10,677 --> 00:13:12,437
I don't need any trouble from you.

283
00:13:14,636 --> 00:13:15,596
If not for Yu Yiming,

284
00:13:15,636 --> 00:13:16,797
I wouldn't have called you.

285
00:13:17,157 --> 00:13:18,797
Even if I got hurt like today

286
00:13:18,836 --> 00:13:20,077
or die somewhere someday,

287
00:13:20,157 --> 00:13:22,356
I'd never blame you for it.

288
00:13:22,397 --> 00:13:22,876
Okay?

289
00:13:26,756 --> 00:13:27,356
What?

290
00:13:33,116 --> 00:13:34,516
The room right across.

291
00:13:34,557 --> 00:13:35,197
Empty it.

292
00:13:35,516 --> 00:13:36,037
Thanks.

293
00:13:37,356 --> 00:13:38,116
Why are you inside?

294
00:13:38,356 --> 00:13:38,756
No, no.

295
00:13:39,317 --> 00:13:39,876
What now?

296
00:13:43,437 --> 00:13:44,476
I said I'm not moving!

297
00:13:44,716 --> 00:13:45,957
Why dismantle my place?

298
00:13:47,197 --> 00:13:48,157
You have two options.

299
00:13:48,636 --> 00:13:49,077
First,

300
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:51,317
have your parents
take you home to recover.

301
00:13:51,557 --> 00:13:52,756
Second, obey me.

302
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:55,356
Who's the elder sister here?

303
00:13:55,516 --> 00:13:57,236
Don't think your success makes you king.

304
00:13:57,397 --> 00:13:58,476
Don't touch my things!

305
00:13:58,636 --> 00:13:59,476
Hands off my stuff!

306
00:14:00,236 --> 00:14:00,836
Keep this up,

307
00:14:00,876 --> 00:14:01,917
and I'll call the police.

308
00:14:01,957 --> 00:14:03,236
Trespassing! You know that?

309
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:04,756
Make them leave.

310
00:14:09,037 --> 00:14:10,236
Don't be ungrateful.

311
00:14:11,516 --> 00:14:13,157
When we were kids,

312
00:14:14,077 --> 00:14:15,077
you helped me fight.

313
00:14:15,636 --> 00:14:16,636
I'm repaying the favor.

314
00:14:18,037 --> 00:14:20,077
You remembered such a small matter?

315
00:14:20,636 --> 00:14:21,516
It's fine. Not needed.

316
00:14:21,636 --> 00:14:22,596
I don't need that.

317
00:14:22,716 --> 00:14:23,797
But I must return it

318
00:14:24,236 --> 00:14:26,197
so that I can feel no debts between us.

319
00:14:26,797 --> 00:14:27,317
I won't move.

320
00:14:28,797 --> 00:14:29,636
You won't move?

321
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:30,277
No.

322
00:14:32,596 --> 00:14:33,157
Fine.

323
00:14:34,356 --> 00:14:35,317
I forgot to tell you.

324
00:14:35,677 --> 00:14:37,557
The new apartment's neighbor
is Yu Yiming.

325
00:14:38,116 --> 00:14:39,197
No need to move, guys.

326
00:14:39,476 --> 00:14:40,077
Move! Move!

327
00:14:40,116 --> 00:14:40,797
I must move!

328
00:14:40,957 --> 00:14:42,197
Sorry about earlier.

329
00:14:42,356 --> 00:14:43,476
Let me help you with that.

330
00:14:43,636 --> 00:14:44,557
Here, I'll pack this.

331
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:47,636
Who is it?

332
00:15:03,677 --> 00:15:04,236
Good morning.

333
00:15:04,996 --> 00:15:05,356
Morning.

334
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:08,317
Qiao Lin.

335
00:15:09,596 --> 00:15:09,957
Qiao Lin?

336
00:15:12,116 --> 00:15:12,756
You're injured.

337
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:13,596
Your breakfast.

338
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:16,037
Thanks.

339
00:15:18,516 --> 00:15:20,077
Have... you eaten? Join me?

340
00:15:20,236 --> 00:15:20,797
I already ate.

341
00:15:21,317 --> 00:15:21,636
Oh.

342
00:15:21,996 --> 00:15:23,356
I'll send you the cafeteria menu.

343
00:15:23,596 --> 00:15:24,836
You can give me a lunch order.

344
00:15:25,797 --> 00:15:26,836
- Leaving.
- Bye.

345
00:15:28,476 --> 00:15:28,996
Bye.

346
00:15:37,776 --> 00:15:40,689
(Jingzhou Yuekang Hospital
Staff Cafeteria Weekly Menu)

347
00:16:00,756 --> 00:16:01,797
Dad, Mom.

348
00:16:02,876 --> 00:16:03,557
What's wrong?

349
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:06,957
It's so late. Why haven't you cooked?

350
00:16:07,756 --> 00:16:08,677
Do you know

351
00:16:09,596 --> 00:16:11,636
our whole family
got tricked by that Qiao?

352
00:16:14,037 --> 00:16:14,836
How?

353
00:16:15,277 --> 00:16:17,516
I ran into Ms. Chen today on the road.

354
00:16:17,996 --> 00:16:19,836
She used to work with Wang Yazhen.

355
00:16:19,876 --> 00:16:20,397
Remember her?

356
00:16:21,516 --> 00:16:23,157
Qiao Jianbin and Wang Yazhen

357
00:16:23,437 --> 00:16:25,317
bought a storefront on Commercial Street

358
00:16:25,397 --> 00:16:26,077
for a barbershop.

359
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,516
Already paid the down payment.

360
00:16:28,037 --> 00:16:28,677
Think about it.

361
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:29,957
Where is the money from?

362
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,277
How would I know?

363
00:16:31,677 --> 00:16:33,157
Are you stupid?

364
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:35,476
Their family is dirt poor.

365
00:16:35,836 --> 00:16:36,917
How could they afford this?

366
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,797
Must've used our bride price money!

367
00:16:40,037 --> 00:16:40,957
Never thought the girl

368
00:16:41,077 --> 00:16:42,836
who acts so carelessly

369
00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:45,197
would be so shrewd with money.

370
00:16:45,516 --> 00:16:47,116
Good thing you didn't marry her!

371
00:16:48,516 --> 00:16:49,596
Listen, son.

372
00:16:50,157 --> 00:16:52,077
We need to get that money back.

373
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:55,077
We can't lose face and money!

374
00:16:59,472 --> 00:17:00,472
(Qiao Lin, my parents want
the bride price back.)

375
00:17:00,472 --> 00:17:01,332
(But don't worry, I don't agree.)

376
00:17:01,332 --> 00:17:02,042
(Because I still love you.)

377
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:02,542
(I won't hold this against you.)

378
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:03,536
(I'll come to Jingzhou tomorrow.
Let's meet up.)

379
00:17:07,024 --> 00:17:08,240
(The message was sent
but rejected by the recipient.)

380
00:17:10,877 --> 00:17:11,917
She blocked me.

381
00:17:17,556 --> 00:17:19,877
Sorry, the number you dialed

382
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:21,316

Please try again later.

384
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:25,437
Phone's blocked too.

385
00:17:26,036 --> 00:17:26,756
Qiao Lin.

386
00:17:27,597 --> 00:17:28,516
This is too much.

387
00:17:43,597 --> 00:17:44,036
Hello.

388
00:17:44,157 --> 00:17:45,637
- Hello.
- I'm looking for

389
00:17:45,756 --> 00:17:47,476
the host of Family Feast,

390
00:17:47,597 --> 00:17:48,397
named Qiao Yan.

391
00:17:49,796 --> 00:17:51,076
She goes by Xu Yan now.

392
00:17:51,197 --> 00:17:52,637
Do you have an appointment, sir?

393
00:17:53,316 --> 00:17:53,837
No.

394
00:17:54,597 --> 00:17:55,157
I'm sorry.

395
00:17:55,236 --> 00:17:56,837
No visitors without appointments.

396
00:17:59,197 --> 00:18:01,597
Could you call her to come meet me?

397
00:18:01,996 --> 00:18:03,716
Her brother-in-law Lin Tao is here.

398
00:18:04,756 --> 00:18:06,917
You can call her to come get you.

399
00:18:12,397 --> 00:18:13,076
Thanks then.

400
00:18:13,236 --> 00:18:14,197
You're welcome, sir.

401
00:18:21,516 --> 00:18:22,117
Sir.

402
00:18:22,877 --> 00:18:24,076
Who are you looking for?

403
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:25,756
Uh...

404
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:27,877
I'm looking for Xu Yan,
the host of Family Feast.

405
00:18:28,397 --> 00:18:29,437
Do you have a pass?

406
00:18:32,677 --> 00:18:33,716
No entry without a pass.

407
00:18:34,236 --> 00:18:34,957
Please leave now.

408
00:18:34,996 --> 00:18:35,677
Get out of there.

409
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,476
No, I'll just be a moment.

410
00:18:37,556 --> 00:18:38,316
Sir, please.

411
00:18:38,357 --> 00:18:39,117
Leave immediately.

412
00:18:47,276 --> 00:18:49,437
Thank you so much, Yiming.

413
00:18:51,877 --> 00:18:53,117
You're very welcome.

414
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:55,276
We're high school classmates

415
00:18:55,397 --> 00:18:56,157
and folks at home.

416
00:18:56,597 --> 00:18:57,357
In Jingzhou,

417
00:18:57,397 --> 00:18:58,677
we should help each other.

418
00:18:59,276 --> 00:18:59,996
Besides,

419
00:19:01,076 --> 00:19:02,236
Qiao Lin is my patient.

420
00:19:04,796 --> 00:19:05,397
From now on,

421
00:19:05,516 --> 00:19:06,957
if Qiao Lin needs anything

422
00:19:06,996 --> 00:19:08,197
or gets in trouble,

423
00:19:08,837 --> 00:19:10,556
please contact me directly.

424
00:19:12,516 --> 00:19:12,996
No problem.

425
00:19:16,117 --> 00:19:17,036
You know,

426
00:19:17,996 --> 00:19:19,637
Qiao Lin's family and I

427
00:19:19,677 --> 00:19:20,716
are always like this.

428
00:19:22,476 --> 00:19:23,236
Thank you.

429
00:19:24,877 --> 00:19:25,917
Actually, I can tell

430
00:19:26,637 --> 00:19:28,316
you care deeply about your sister.

431
00:19:29,677 --> 00:19:32,236
Why don't you just sit down and talk?

432
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:33,556
I like it this way.

433
00:19:34,157 --> 00:19:35,796
We have our own lives,

434
00:19:36,516 --> 00:19:37,637
keeping a distance,

435
00:19:38,316 --> 00:19:39,157
and being at peace.

436
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:40,236
It's great.

437
00:19:49,437 --> 00:19:50,756
Hey, Lin Tao.

438
00:19:51,276 --> 00:19:51,837
Mr. Qiao,

439
00:19:54,197 --> 00:19:57,117
do you have Qiao Yan's number?

440
00:19:57,637 --> 00:19:58,236
Yan?

441
00:19:59,236 --> 00:20:00,476
Do you need to contact her?

442
00:20:02,716 --> 00:20:03,397
Yeah.

443
00:20:04,677 --> 00:20:06,516
Alright, I'll look for it.

444
00:20:13,756 --> 00:20:14,236
Sir,

445
00:20:14,837 --> 00:20:15,597
don't bother.

446
00:20:16,276 --> 00:20:16,957
I got it.

447
00:20:17,996 --> 00:20:18,556
I know

448
00:20:19,397 --> 00:20:21,076
you want Qiao Lin and me to be close.

449
00:20:23,316 --> 00:20:24,597
But it's been too long.

450
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,036
There's no need.

451
00:20:26,796 --> 00:20:28,157
Qiao Lin just broke up

452
00:20:28,236 --> 00:20:29,437
and lives alone now.

453
00:20:30,556 --> 00:20:31,476
With you next door,

454
00:20:31,516 --> 00:20:32,556
I feel more at ease.

455
00:20:33,756 --> 00:20:35,597
But please do look after her for me.

456
00:20:36,316 --> 00:20:37,157
Don't worry.

457
00:20:37,677 --> 00:20:38,476
It's appropriate

458
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,117
for me to take care of her.

459
00:20:40,597 --> 00:20:41,036
Thank you.

460
00:20:41,756 --> 00:20:42,276
Qiao Yan.

461
00:20:45,796 --> 00:20:47,076
Why ask him to do that?

462
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:48,516
Who is he?

463
00:20:55,556 --> 00:20:56,117
Who is he?

464
00:20:56,637 --> 00:20:57,837
Lin Tao, calm down.

465
00:20:58,197 --> 00:21:00,076
Qiao Lin and I
went to high school with him.

466
00:21:00,117 --> 00:21:00,677
That's all.

467
00:21:00,996 --> 00:21:01,476
Hello.

468
00:21:02,837 --> 00:21:03,556
I'm Yu Yiming.

469
00:21:04,637 --> 00:21:05,597
High school classmates?

470
00:21:06,476 --> 00:21:08,756
Then why let Qiao Lin
move next door to him?

471
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:12,076
I know why Qiao Lin
called off our engagement.

472
00:21:12,316 --> 00:21:13,837
You schemed it, didn't you?

473
00:21:13,837 --> 00:21:14,597
What did I do?

474
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:16,837
Take this out.

475
00:21:16,877 --> 00:21:18,157
If you hadn't tricked Qiao Lin,

476
00:21:18,597 --> 00:21:19,516
why would she come here

477
00:21:19,756 --> 00:21:20,837
and get close to him?

478
00:21:21,117 --> 00:21:22,397
Qiao Yan, what's wrong with you?

479
00:21:22,437 --> 00:21:23,756
This is a public place.

480
00:21:26,157 --> 00:21:28,476
Go outside, and we'll talk.

481
00:21:28,796 --> 00:21:29,197
No.

482
00:21:29,476 --> 00:21:29,877
Qiao Yan.

483
00:21:30,397 --> 00:21:31,437
What's wrong with you?

484
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,157
Wait, hold on a second.

485
00:21:36,197 --> 00:21:36,677
Wait.

486
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:39,157
You pushed me!

487
00:21:39,597 --> 00:21:41,716
You seduced my fiancée,
and now you're pushing me?

488
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:42,437
Qiao Yan.

489
00:21:42,837 --> 00:21:44,316
You helped your sister cheat.

490
00:21:44,597 --> 00:21:46,117
You two are disgusting.

491
00:21:46,157 --> 00:21:47,236
Watch your mouth.

492
00:21:47,397 --> 00:21:47,996
Go outside.

493
00:21:48,197 --> 00:21:48,677
No.

494
00:21:48,996 --> 00:21:50,316
Say it here.

495
00:21:50,556 --> 00:21:51,756
Where is Qiao Lin really?

496
00:21:51,996 --> 00:21:52,957
Get her here

497
00:21:53,117 --> 00:21:54,437
and explain everything.

498
00:21:54,637 --> 00:21:56,397
I want every detail laid out clearly.

499
00:21:56,437 --> 00:21:57,316
I know where she is.

500
00:21:59,397 --> 00:22:00,197
I'll take you there.

501
00:22:05,276 --> 00:22:05,796
Go ahead.

502
00:22:16,556 --> 00:22:17,276
No lying, huh?

503
00:22:20,157 --> 00:22:20,877
What happened?

504
00:22:20,877 --> 00:22:21,316
Sorry.

505
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:22,276
I'm not sure.

506
00:22:22,476 --> 00:22:23,476
Ask this gentleman.

507
00:22:23,917 --> 00:22:25,236
Sorry, are your clothes alright?

508
00:22:25,597 --> 00:22:26,316
Yeah, thank you.

509
00:22:26,877 --> 00:22:27,516
Hey, handsome.

510
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,837
What happened here earlier?

511
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:31,316
You are...

512
00:22:31,796 --> 00:22:33,197
I'm Xu Yan's colleague.

513
00:22:33,357 --> 00:22:35,437
I saw a man leave with her just now.

514
00:22:35,476 --> 00:22:36,276
Are they...

515
00:22:37,236 --> 00:22:37,996
I don't know them.

516
00:22:38,236 --> 00:22:39,637
They bumped into me just now.

517
00:22:40,036 --> 00:22:40,637
Sorry.

518
00:22:48,597 --> 00:22:49,917
You teamed up

519
00:22:49,957 --> 00:22:51,197
to help her cheat on me, huh?

520
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,597
This matter won't be
swept under the rug.

521
00:22:53,837 --> 00:22:55,637
What I just said simply

522
00:22:57,036 --> 00:22:59,076
went through one ear
and out the other, right?

523
00:22:59,597 --> 00:23:00,556
Get her here

524
00:23:01,397 --> 00:23:02,357
to explain it to me.

525
00:23:02,556 --> 00:23:04,276
She'll swear that she has

526
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:05,716
no romance with that Yu.

527
00:23:05,796 --> 00:23:06,516
You're pathetic.

528
00:23:06,837 --> 00:23:07,556
Scared, huh?

529
00:23:08,837 --> 00:23:09,996
Afraid she'll slip up.

530
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,036
Qiao Yan, you never speak the truth.

531
00:23:18,556 --> 00:23:19,157
I'm leaving.

532
00:23:19,837 --> 00:23:21,197
Two final things for you.

533
00:23:21,556 --> 00:23:22,036
First,

534
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,796
you've broken up with Qiao Lin.

535
00:23:25,877 --> 00:23:27,197
You have no connection anymore.

536
00:23:27,276 --> 00:23:28,036
- I...
- Second,

537
00:23:28,597 --> 00:23:30,917
I forbid you from meddling in
her current life.

538
00:23:32,357 --> 00:23:33,556
I'm done. Understood?

539
00:23:36,796 --> 00:23:37,397
Firstly,

540
00:23:38,197 --> 00:23:39,957
the breakup was her unilateral decision.

541
00:23:40,197 --> 00:23:40,957
I never agreed.

542
00:23:41,316 --> 00:23:42,677
How can we have no connection?

543
00:23:43,076 --> 00:23:44,076
She's my fiancée!

544
00:23:44,236 --> 00:23:46,076
Your family accepted the bride price!

545
00:23:49,917 --> 00:23:50,516
How much?

546
00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:51,597
I'll pay.

547
00:23:55,556 --> 00:23:56,877
This isn't about money!

548
00:23:56,957 --> 00:23:58,276
I want her! Her!

549
00:23:59,276 --> 00:23:59,957
I don't know.

550
00:24:02,236 --> 00:24:02,756
Fine.

551
00:24:04,197 --> 00:24:04,877
Won't talk?

552
00:24:05,756 --> 00:24:06,837
Then I'll come every day.

553
00:24:07,076 --> 00:24:08,476
I'll demand her at your workplace.

554
00:24:08,597 --> 00:24:09,796
Hound your in-laws for her.

555
00:24:10,397 --> 00:24:11,476
Didn't you marry well?

556
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:12,957
I'll show them what kind

557
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:13,996
of shameless things

558
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,696
you've been doing behind their backs.

559
00:24:25,437 --> 00:24:26,076
Suit yourself.

560
00:24:36,437 --> 00:24:36,996
Coming.

561
00:24:45,437 --> 00:24:45,917
I'll get it.

562
00:24:57,437 --> 00:24:58,197
Good grief!

563
00:24:59,996 --> 00:25:02,197
He's completely insane!

564
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,357
Always looked down on me,

565
00:25:05,716 --> 00:25:08,076
saying I couldn't help his career,

566
00:25:08,476 --> 00:25:10,197
now falsely accusing me of cheating!

567
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:10,716
Well,

568
00:25:10,957 --> 00:25:11,476
such madness!

569
00:25:11,728 --> 00:25:12,516
I'm so pissed off!

570
00:25:15,236 --> 00:25:16,276
What will you do?

571
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:19,957
He wants me to confront him directly?

572
00:25:20,157 --> 00:25:20,516
Fine.

573
00:25:20,756 --> 00:25:21,597
Talk to him directly.

574
00:25:21,716 --> 00:25:22,716
Watch me beat him hard!

575
00:25:27,197 --> 00:25:28,236
I won't recommend that.

576
00:25:29,357 --> 00:25:31,440
It's unnecessary for you
to drain yourself like this.

577
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,516
Since you broke up,

578
00:25:33,877 --> 00:25:35,796
make a clean break from the past.

579
00:25:37,197 --> 00:25:38,117
I talked with Lin Tao.

580
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:39,796
What he cares about

581
00:25:40,157 --> 00:25:42,076
is your emotional loyalty to him.

582
00:25:42,197 --> 00:25:45,316
But his parents only
care about the money.

583
00:25:47,076 --> 00:25:48,516
Don't worry about the money.

584
00:25:48,917 --> 00:25:49,996
I'll handle it for you.

585
00:25:50,437 --> 00:25:51,197
This way,

586
00:25:51,796 --> 00:25:53,197
even if he causes trouble here,

587
00:25:53,837 --> 00:25:55,036
his parents will stop him.

588
00:25:57,877 --> 00:25:59,437
I don't need your help with this.

589
00:25:59,556 --> 00:26:00,516
I'll handle it myself.

590
00:26:00,677 --> 00:26:01,276
How exactly?

591
00:26:03,316 --> 00:26:04,276
When will you handle it?

592
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:06,476
With what?

593
00:26:07,236 --> 00:26:07,677
I...

594
00:26:17,917 --> 00:26:19,877
By the time you got the money,

595
00:26:20,677 --> 00:26:21,957
Lin Tao would have made this

596
00:26:21,996 --> 00:26:23,076
public knowledge by then.

597
00:26:23,996 --> 00:26:25,397
By then, my workplace,

598
00:26:25,677 --> 00:26:26,316
the Shen family,

599
00:26:26,597 --> 00:26:27,796
and everyone else would know.

600
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:30,556
I...

601
00:26:31,236 --> 00:26:31,837
I thought

602
00:26:31,837 --> 00:26:33,476
you were considering my interests.

603
00:26:33,837 --> 00:26:36,080
Turns out you're just afraid
your lies will be exposed.

604
00:26:40,197 --> 00:26:40,716
Yes.

605
00:26:43,677 --> 00:26:44,957
I did it for myself.

606
00:26:48,157 --> 00:26:49,157
Because since childhood,

607
00:26:49,197 --> 00:26:50,877
I've had to learn to prioritize myself.

608
00:26:50,917 --> 00:26:52,036
I'm not you.

609
00:26:55,796 --> 00:26:57,556
I don't need you causing
more trouble for me.

610
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:00,036
If money can solve it,

611
00:27:00,197 --> 00:27:01,076
I'll handle it.

612
00:27:01,877 --> 00:27:03,824
Fine. I won't cause you trouble.

613
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:06,357
Consider this money a loan.

614
00:27:06,516 --> 00:27:08,197
The rent for the apartment
is also a loan.

615
00:27:08,236 --> 00:27:09,796
I'll pay you back in installments.

616
00:27:10,236 --> 00:27:10,877
Qiao Lin.

617
00:27:11,276 --> 00:27:11,756
What?

618
00:27:11,888 --> 00:27:13,516
What do you ever do
besides acting tough?

619
00:27:13,516 --> 00:27:14,036
I don't.

620
00:27:14,236 --> 00:27:15,397
- Look at your arm!
- I...

621
00:27:43,837 --> 00:27:45,157
Who is this Lin Tao?

622
00:27:46,117 --> 00:27:47,117
Claims to be your wife's

623
00:27:47,157 --> 00:27:48,197
cousin's fiancé.

624
00:27:50,677 --> 00:27:53,556
Investigate his employment status
and social connections.

625
00:27:54,516 --> 00:27:54,996
Understood.

626
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,197
Son, all the money's been transferred.

627
00:28:04,437 --> 00:28:06,637
If there's nothing in Jingzhou,
come home immediately.

628
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:09,516
I'm not going back.
I need to stay here a few more days.

629
00:28:10,597 --> 00:28:11,556
Quit while you're ahead.

630
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,117
Her sister has quite the influence.

631
00:28:14,157 --> 00:28:15,076
Don't make enemies.

632
00:28:15,677 --> 00:28:16,157
Exactly.

633
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:16,716
Mom, Dad,

634
00:28:17,157 --> 00:28:18,117
if I don't find out

635
00:28:18,157 --> 00:28:19,917
whether Qiao Lin called off the wedding

636
00:28:19,917 --> 00:28:20,957
because she has an affair,

637
00:28:20,957 --> 00:28:21,957
I'm never going back!

638
00:28:22,677 --> 00:28:23,280
I'll hang up.

639
00:28:24,837 --> 00:28:25,397
Lin Tao,

640
00:28:26,096 --> 00:28:27,276
the reason I called you here

641
00:28:27,276 --> 00:28:29,397
is to inform you the leadership

642
00:28:29,516 --> 00:28:30,957
values your development highly.

643
00:28:31,516 --> 00:28:32,397
Keep working hard.

644
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:33,197
Understood?

645
00:28:33,556 --> 00:28:34,117
Sir,

646
00:28:35,516 --> 00:28:38,597
you dragged me back
from Jingzhou for this?

647
00:28:41,197 --> 00:28:42,796
Sir, when I asked for leave,

648
00:28:42,796 --> 00:28:44,397
I explained in Jingzhou,

649
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:45,877
I have urgent family matters.

650
00:28:45,996 --> 00:28:46,917
Why make me...?

651
00:28:46,957 --> 00:28:48,957
Isn't this about
the account reconciliation?

652
00:28:49,157 --> 00:28:50,276
We need you.

653
00:28:52,516 --> 00:28:52,957
Well,

654
00:28:54,157 --> 00:28:56,076
account reconciliation
isn't my responsibility.

655
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,157
It's the emphasis
on your career development.

656
00:28:58,637 --> 00:28:59,556
Enough. Stop arguing.

657
00:29:00,437 --> 00:29:01,837
Your leave request is denied.

658
00:29:02,316 --> 00:29:03,197
You're staying here.

659
00:29:03,597 --> 00:29:04,756
Why?

660
00:29:07,476 --> 00:29:08,476
To be honest,

661
00:29:08,877 --> 00:29:11,197
this leave request wasn't denied by me.

662
00:29:12,236 --> 00:29:13,556
Mr. Zhou rejected it.

663
00:29:14,597 --> 00:29:15,276
Mr. Zhou?

664
00:29:16,877 --> 00:29:17,837
How did my leave request

665
00:29:17,917 --> 00:29:18,996
reach the executive level?

666
00:29:19,036 --> 00:29:20,076
I don't know.

667
00:29:20,397 --> 00:29:21,877
Mr. Zhou called me this morning

668
00:29:21,957 --> 00:29:22,677
asking about you.

669
00:29:23,117 --> 00:29:24,357
I said you'd taken leave.

670
00:29:25,357 --> 00:29:27,316
Leadership showed great concern,

671
00:29:27,637 --> 00:29:29,637
telling me to recall you immediately.

672
00:29:30,197 --> 00:29:31,197
They praised you

673
00:29:31,516 --> 00:29:33,516
and told me to assign you
more responsibilities.

674
00:29:40,117 --> 00:29:40,637
Lin Tao,

675
00:29:41,756 --> 00:29:42,957
tell me the truth.

676
00:29:43,397 --> 00:29:45,756
What's your relationship with Mr. Zhou?

677
00:29:46,756 --> 00:29:47,796
Nothing's going on.

678
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:48,877
Nothing?

679
00:29:49,197 --> 00:29:50,796
But he specifically inquired about you.

680
00:29:52,837 --> 00:29:53,397
Tao,

681
00:29:54,036 --> 00:29:55,197
stop pretending with me.

682
00:29:56,716 --> 00:29:57,957
The boss cares a lot about you.

683
00:29:58,276 --> 00:30:00,117
You'll have a bright future ahead.

684
00:30:01,437 --> 00:30:01,996
From now on,

685
00:30:01,996 --> 00:30:03,312
don't take unnecessary leaves.

686
00:30:03,312 --> 00:30:04,677
It looks bad for your reputation.

687
00:30:05,677 --> 00:30:07,036
Alright. Get back to work.

688
00:30:07,637 --> 00:30:08,357
Go on.

689
00:30:18,036 --> 00:30:18,957
Honey, are you ready?

690
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:20,117
Almost there.

691
00:30:20,556 --> 00:30:21,837
I'll count down from five.

692
00:30:22,276 --> 00:30:22,796
Don't!

693
00:30:22,796 --> 00:30:23,316
Five.

694
00:30:23,677 --> 00:30:24,157
No counting.

695
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:24,677
Four.

696
00:30:24,677 --> 00:30:25,397
Stop counting.

697
00:30:25,397 --> 00:30:25,957
Three.

698
00:30:26,197 --> 00:30:26,637
Two.

699
00:30:26,957 --> 00:30:27,397
One.

700
00:30:29,397 --> 00:30:29,837
Done.

701
00:30:31,076 --> 00:30:32,516
You cheated!

702
00:30:34,476 --> 00:30:36,197
You didn't even finish the count.

703
00:30:37,076 --> 00:30:38,276
What kind of

704
00:30:39,996 --> 00:30:40,917
dish

705
00:30:42,677 --> 00:30:43,917
is this?

706
00:30:44,236 --> 00:30:45,076
Isn't it obvious?

707
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,608
Shrimp-stuffed potato chips.

708
00:30:48,036 --> 00:30:49,677
Why such a literal name?

709
00:30:50,637 --> 00:30:51,877
They're delicious, really.

710
00:30:51,996 --> 00:30:52,437
Try one.

711
00:30:54,157 --> 00:30:54,637
Well?

712
00:30:56,276 --> 00:30:56,756
Good?

713
00:30:57,437 --> 00:30:57,957
As expected,

714
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,556
the chips taste like chips.

715
00:31:01,597 --> 00:31:03,357
The shrimp tastes like shrimp.

716
00:31:04,716 --> 00:31:05,756
Say it seriously.

717
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,236
This will be the featured dish
in my next episode.

718
00:31:08,637 --> 00:31:09,712
It's really that bad?

719
00:31:11,516 --> 00:31:12,397
That's my fault.

720
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,036
Let me try another piece.

721
00:31:15,632 --> 00:31:18,464
♪To reignite♪

722
00:31:18,637 --> 00:31:19,197
Different now.

723
00:31:20,637 --> 00:31:21,837
The chips carry shrimp flavor.

724
00:31:22,637 --> 00:31:24,316
The shrimp tastes potatoey.

725
00:31:25,397 --> 00:31:26,756
Just like you and me.

726
00:31:27,076 --> 00:31:28,996
You carry traces of me.
I carry traces of you.

727
00:31:28,996 --> 00:31:29,917
Mixed together.

728
00:31:30,117 --> 00:31:30,556
Amazing.

729
00:31:31,117 --> 00:31:31,437
Okay.

730
00:31:31,597 --> 00:31:32,197
Alright.

731
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:33,397
Let me taste your dish.

732
00:31:35,357 --> 00:31:35,917
Codfish.

733
00:31:36,556 --> 00:31:37,117
Have a bite.

734
00:31:37,157 --> 00:31:37,756
Wait.

735
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:39,236
This isn't ordinary cod.

736
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:39,756
What is it?

737
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,357
It's Shen-family secret recipe cod.

738
00:31:42,397 --> 00:31:43,316
Extraordinary cod.

739
00:31:43,516 --> 00:31:43,996
Taste it.

740
00:31:47,036 --> 00:31:48,556
Let me name this cod dish. Okay?

741
00:31:48,837 --> 00:31:49,157
Fine.

742
00:31:49,556 --> 00:31:50,117
We'll call it

743
00:31:51,197 --> 00:31:52,516
Charcoal in Snowstorm?

744
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:53,957
It's completely charred.

745
00:31:56,036 --> 00:31:56,996
That's a terrible pun.

746
00:31:57,476 --> 00:31:58,316
Here, try it.

747
00:31:58,597 --> 00:31:58,917
Fine.

748
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:08,316
Perfectly preserves
the cod's natural fishiness.

749
00:32:08,476 --> 00:32:09,076
Very good.

750
00:32:24,036 --> 00:32:25,357
(Given Lin Tao's personality,)

751
00:32:26,157 --> 00:32:27,677
(I thought he'd keep pressing.)

752
00:32:28,877 --> 00:32:30,036
(But unexpectedly,)

753
00:32:30,796 --> 00:32:31,996
(he suddenly vanished.)

754
00:32:44,036 --> 00:32:45,996
I contacted Mr. Huang's office.

755
00:32:46,437 --> 00:32:49,236
They said he is going abroad
for inspection.

756
00:32:49,397 --> 00:32:50,437
His schedule's packed.

757
00:32:50,917 --> 00:32:52,076
Can't arrange a meeting now.

758
00:32:53,236 --> 00:32:54,316
I also heard...

759
00:32:54,837 --> 00:32:55,516
Heard what?

760
00:32:59,316 --> 00:33:00,157
Out with it.

761
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:00,837
Speak.

762
00:33:01,996 --> 00:33:03,516
Mr. Huang calls you the heir apparent.

763
00:33:10,677 --> 00:33:12,197
He knows my funding's limited.

764
00:33:13,008 --> 00:33:14,256
I have insufficient influence.

765
00:33:14,357 --> 00:33:15,437
He is clearly avoiding me.

766
00:33:15,796 --> 00:33:17,036
What's our next step?

767
00:33:17,677 --> 00:33:19,036
Keep pursuing him?

768
00:33:19,996 --> 00:33:21,877
Proceed as planned.

769
00:33:22,476 --> 00:33:24,516
Thoroughly study
his company's structure.

770
00:33:24,637 --> 00:33:25,157
Okay.

771
00:33:27,856 --> 00:33:30,110
(Plot Plan)

772
00:33:32,796 --> 00:33:33,556
In short,

773
00:33:33,756 --> 00:33:35,716
we shouldn't rush on this land deal.

774
00:33:35,917 --> 00:33:37,197
Listen to your father.

775
00:33:38,597 --> 00:33:39,716
If he doesn't approve,

776
00:33:39,996 --> 00:33:42,117
Mr. Huang from Shouke
won't risk partnering with you.

777
00:33:42,117 --> 00:33:42,556
Right?

778
00:33:44,917 --> 00:33:45,316
Alright.

779
00:33:45,637 --> 00:33:46,437
Don't overthink it.

780
00:33:46,796 --> 00:33:47,716
He's your father.

781
00:33:48,197 --> 00:33:49,397
Every decision he makes

782
00:33:49,476 --> 00:33:50,516
is for your benefit.

783
00:33:50,716 --> 00:33:52,917
Tonight he's hosting Shifeng people
for dinner at home.

784
00:33:53,597 --> 00:33:55,197
Don't let your emotions show.

785
00:33:57,796 --> 00:33:58,512
Give us a smile.

786
00:33:59,316 --> 00:33:59,837
Got it.

787
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:04,357
Mom.

788
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:05,036
Haoming.

789
00:34:05,236 --> 00:34:06,036
Have some fruits.

790
00:34:06,637 --> 00:34:07,516
You're back.

791
00:34:10,996 --> 00:34:13,116
You two chat first.
I'll call you when dinner's ready.

792
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:13,757
Alright.

793
00:34:17,676 --> 00:34:18,076
Sit.

794
00:34:20,797 --> 00:34:22,036
What were you talking with Mom?

795
00:34:23,556 --> 00:34:24,336
Nothing important.

796
00:34:24,837 --> 00:34:25,996
Just some minor work stuff.

797
00:34:28,917 --> 00:34:29,277
Good boy.

798
00:34:29,596 --> 00:34:30,277
Have some water.

799
00:34:30,437 --> 00:34:31,036
Pass me Bu.

800
00:34:31,917 --> 00:34:32,516
Bu!

801
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:33,957
Let's go, Bu!

802
00:34:37,437 --> 00:34:38,116
Can you sit?

803
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:39,516
Can you sit?

804
00:34:40,156 --> 00:34:40,516
Sit.

805
00:34:41,277 --> 00:34:41,636
Sit.

806
00:34:42,757 --> 00:34:43,312
Shake hands.

807
00:34:43,877 --> 00:34:44,797
Shake hands.

808
00:34:46,397 --> 00:34:46,797
Come on.

809
00:34:47,556 --> 00:34:48,556
Come on, shake hands.

810
00:34:50,516 --> 00:34:51,277
Such a good boy.

811
00:35:09,196 --> 00:35:10,128
Where are we going?

812
00:35:11,116 --> 00:35:12,036
You'll see soon.

813
00:35:13,156 --> 00:35:13,516
Let's go.

814
00:35:19,996 --> 00:35:20,797
You found it.

815
00:35:21,797 --> 00:35:23,317
I stumbled upon it accidentally.

816
00:35:24,196 --> 00:35:25,156
I asked Hui.

817
00:35:25,476 --> 00:35:27,156
She said you made this as a child.

818
00:35:28,476 --> 00:35:28,996
Yeah.

819
00:35:30,116 --> 00:35:31,516
This thing's pretty old.

820
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:33,556
When I was in elementary school,

821
00:35:34,357 --> 00:35:36,277
my dad wanted to renovate this villa.

822
00:35:36,757 --> 00:35:38,996
They made this opening
and planned to fix it,

823
00:35:39,476 --> 00:35:40,277
but I stopped them.

824
00:35:40,957 --> 00:35:42,076
Then I made this instead.

825
00:35:48,717 --> 00:35:50,757
How did you have such
good craftsmanship as a child?

826
00:35:53,676 --> 00:35:54,636
A little bear,

827
00:35:57,516 --> 00:35:58,556
a small window.

828
00:36:00,717 --> 00:36:02,237
It's gazing outside,

829
00:36:02,837 --> 00:36:03,877
hiding here,

830
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:06,596
looking so lonely.

831
00:36:07,837 --> 00:36:09,277
Maybe it wants

832
00:36:09,397 --> 00:36:11,196
to hide all the disappointments
and sadness

833
00:36:11,237 --> 00:36:12,476
here inside.

834
00:36:13,317 --> 00:36:14,877
Stay hidden and slowly process them,

835
00:36:15,636 --> 00:36:17,957
only showing the happy side to others.

836
00:36:20,717 --> 00:36:21,797
That's why I...

837
00:36:25,636 --> 00:36:27,036
I added this little lamp,

838
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:31,237
hoping

839
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:35,636
it could chase away
those gloomy feelings

840
00:36:37,277 --> 00:36:38,237
and end its loneliness.

841
00:36:46,556 --> 00:36:47,357
Haoming,

842
00:36:51,237 --> 00:36:52,476
I know you care about me,

843
00:36:54,516 --> 00:36:55,676
but I don't need you

844
00:36:56,996 --> 00:36:59,437
to shield me from all your troubles

845
00:36:59,556 --> 00:37:00,596
and worries.

846
00:37:02,516 --> 00:37:04,036
I want to share your burdens

847
00:37:04,076 --> 00:37:05,397
and anxieties with you.

848
00:37:08,516 --> 00:37:09,357
Your happiness

849
00:37:10,636 --> 00:37:11,797
makes me happier.

850
00:37:26,516 --> 00:37:27,196
Thank you.

851
00:37:48,944 --> 00:37:52,184
(Jingzhou Conrad Hotel)

852
00:37:53,596 --> 00:37:55,636
Mr. Huang from Shouke Real Estate

853
00:37:57,757 --> 00:37:59,196
is notoriously difficult.

854
00:37:59,476 --> 00:38:02,156
I'm quite social-savvy,

855
00:38:02,317 --> 00:38:03,437
but dealing with him

856
00:38:03,797 --> 00:38:05,156
is like hitting a brick wall.

857
00:38:05,797 --> 00:38:07,196
He's such an eccentric person.

858
00:38:09,277 --> 00:38:10,636
If he's eccentric,

859
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:14,317
there must be some special backstory.

860
00:38:15,036 --> 00:38:16,917
That's why you're smart, Miss Xu.

861
00:38:17,717 --> 00:38:18,797
My husband mentioned

862
00:38:19,277 --> 00:38:21,808
that Mr. Huang has an extraordinary
relationship with his wife.

863
00:38:22,516 --> 00:38:23,676
In their circle,

864
00:38:23,996 --> 00:38:25,676
he's known for being a devoted husband.

865
00:38:26,036 --> 00:38:26,636
Later,

866
00:38:26,717 --> 00:38:28,156
his wife fell seriously ill.

867
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,476
Mr. Huang abandoned
all business affairs.

868
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:31,917
He accompanied his wife,

869
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:33,957
seeking medical help
both domestically and abroad.

870
00:38:34,556 --> 00:38:35,116
In the end,

871
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:37,437
his wife still passed away.

872
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:39,877
Mr. Huang was devastated.

873
00:38:40,196 --> 00:38:41,717
His temperament changed.

874
00:38:43,277 --> 00:38:44,397
He never remarried.

875
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:47,237
From what you say,

876
00:38:48,437 --> 00:38:49,957
Mr. Huang seems decent.

877
00:38:50,357 --> 00:38:51,357
He has good character.

878
00:38:52,116 --> 00:38:52,837
Meiling,

879
00:38:53,877 --> 00:38:54,996
do you know

880
00:38:55,156 --> 00:38:56,516
if he has any living relatives?

881
00:38:57,156 --> 00:38:57,996
Even extended family?

882
00:38:58,196 --> 00:38:59,437
There's hardly anyone left.

883
00:39:00,076 --> 00:39:01,516
The couple never had children.

884
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,877
His mother-in-law is still alive.

885
00:39:04,277 --> 00:39:05,636
I've heard all these years

886
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,996
he's been caring for her diligently.

887
00:39:08,196 --> 00:39:09,717
He wants to be her caretaker for life.

888
00:39:09,957 --> 00:39:12,277
But the old lady is stubborn.

889
00:39:12,757 --> 00:39:14,076
She moved to a nursing home.

890
00:39:14,437 --> 00:39:16,476
Mr. Huang couldn't change her mind,

891
00:39:16,837 --> 00:39:18,156
so he relented.

892
00:39:22,437 --> 00:39:23,757
In these business circles,

893
00:39:24,757 --> 00:39:26,476
is there anything you don't know?

894
00:39:26,917 --> 00:39:27,596
Not much.

895
00:39:34,996 --> 00:39:35,717
Miss Xu,

896
00:39:36,076 --> 00:39:37,317
thank you so much

897
00:39:37,476 --> 00:39:39,476
for donating these supplies
to our nursing home.

898
00:39:39,996 --> 00:39:40,516
Ms. Han,

899
00:39:41,076 --> 00:39:43,556
they're just daily necessities.
No need for formalities.

900
00:39:44,596 --> 00:39:45,277
Actually,

901
00:39:45,397 --> 00:39:47,036
I should be thanking you

902
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:50,116
for letting us contribute.

903
00:39:50,397 --> 00:39:51,156
It's not easy.

904
00:39:56,357 --> 00:39:56,996
By the way,

905
00:39:57,676 --> 00:39:59,076
do you have a resident here

906
00:39:59,237 --> 00:40:00,717
named Yu Shufen?

907
00:40:01,156 --> 00:40:01,837
Yu Shufen?

908
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:03,036
You know her?

909
00:40:03,676 --> 00:40:05,392
She's someone
my husband respected deeply.

910
00:40:05,757 --> 00:40:07,156
I'd like to visit her.

911
00:40:09,317 --> 00:40:10,036
Well...

912
00:40:12,036 --> 00:40:12,757
Is there an issue?

913
00:40:13,676 --> 00:40:14,797
Not really.

914
00:40:15,237 --> 00:40:16,237
I just think

915
00:40:16,596 --> 00:40:17,877
your visit might be...

916
00:40:23,317 --> 00:40:23,957
Get out!

917
00:40:24,357 --> 00:40:25,156
Get away from me!

918
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:26,996
Don't blame me!

919
00:40:27,636 --> 00:40:28,596
It's your own fault!

920
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,476
You thief!

921
00:40:29,516 --> 00:40:30,196
Shameless!

922
00:40:30,317 --> 00:40:31,476
I told you to leave!

923
00:40:31,757 --> 00:40:32,237
You...

924
00:40:32,516 --> 00:40:33,516
I've said everything!

925
00:40:33,596 --> 00:40:34,277
Not leaving?

926
00:40:34,877 --> 00:40:35,917
Stop following me!

927
00:40:36,277 --> 00:40:37,277
Utterly shameless!

928
00:40:37,397 --> 00:40:38,476
So thick-skinned!

929
00:40:38,877 --> 00:40:40,397
How dare you steal from me!

930
00:40:40,717 --> 00:40:41,516
Back off!

931
00:40:42,036 --> 00:40:42,877
I'll beat you up!

932
00:40:43,156 --> 00:40:44,156
Utterly shameless!

933
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,797
What's left to steal?

934
00:40:46,476 --> 00:40:47,397
You're shameless!

935
00:40:47,437 --> 00:40:48,476
Stop dodging!

936
00:40:48,757 --> 00:40:50,237
Stop dodging!

937
00:40:50,556 --> 00:40:51,516
Miss Xu,

938
00:40:51,596 --> 00:40:52,877
this is Yu Shufen.

939
00:40:53,556 --> 00:40:54,596
Alzheimer's disease,

940
00:40:55,196 --> 00:40:56,476
mid-to-late stage.

941
00:40:57,397 --> 00:40:58,596
As you know,

942
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:00,596
for patients like this,

943
00:41:01,036 --> 00:41:03,917
we can only provide

944
00:41:03,917 --> 00:41:05,036
a comfortable environment.

945
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:08,437
Caregivers guide them through

946
00:41:09,397 --> 00:41:11,036
Baduanjin exercises

947
00:41:11,397 --> 00:41:12,357
and finger exercises.

948
00:41:12,917 --> 00:41:16,076
This helps slow
the disease's progression.

949
00:41:17,237 --> 00:41:17,957
I said

950
00:41:19,357 --> 00:41:20,036
leave!

951
00:41:23,116 --> 00:41:23,917
Meatballs!

952
00:41:40,116 --> 00:41:44,596
One, two, three, four...

953
00:41:45,397 --> 00:41:47,556
What's Madam Yu holding?

954
00:41:48,596 --> 00:41:49,957
Counting vegetable balls.

955
00:41:50,917 --> 00:41:51,837
Vegetable balls.

956
00:41:59,837 --> 00:42:00,917
Grandma!

957
00:42:00,957 --> 00:42:02,156
Are the vegetable balls ready?

958
00:42:02,196 --> 00:42:03,837
I'll be late for school.

959
00:42:04,996 --> 00:42:06,437
Almost done.

960
00:42:07,156 --> 00:42:08,196
You insisted

961
00:42:08,277 --> 00:42:09,996
on having fried vegetable balls.

962
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:13,476
This dish requires a lot of effort.

963
00:42:13,516 --> 00:42:14,556
We have to take it slow.

964
00:42:15,676 --> 00:42:16,437
It's ready.

965
00:42:17,717 --> 00:42:18,717
One.

966
00:42:19,237 --> 00:42:20,357
Two.

967
00:42:20,877 --> 00:42:21,797
Three.

968
00:42:22,357 --> 00:42:23,357
Four.

969
00:42:23,437 --> 00:42:24,437
Five.

970
00:42:24,636 --> 00:42:26,076
Lately, we don't know why,

971
00:42:26,596 --> 00:42:28,837
but the old lady keeps using
soil from flowerpots

972
00:42:28,877 --> 00:42:29,877
to make mud balls.

973
00:42:30,357 --> 00:42:32,277
She claims they're her vegetable balls.

974
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:35,556
Flowerpot soil.

975
00:42:36,277 --> 00:42:38,516
If accidentally eaten, isn't it unsafe?

976
00:42:38,596 --> 00:42:39,957
At first, we were worried too.

977
00:42:40,317 --> 00:42:41,877
We tried taking the mud balls

978
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:43,036
while she was asleep.

979
00:42:43,437 --> 00:42:44,717
But after waking up

980
00:42:44,877 --> 00:42:46,156
and finding them missing,

981
00:42:46,277 --> 00:42:47,237
she threw a tantrum.

982
00:42:47,676 --> 00:42:48,996
Said they were for her daughter.

983
00:42:49,036 --> 00:42:49,676
In the end,

984
00:42:49,917 --> 00:42:52,116
his wife still passed away.

985
00:42:52,196 --> 00:42:53,076
We realized

986
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:54,397
she never actually ate them.

987
00:42:54,877 --> 00:42:56,277
So we let her be.

988
00:43:00,196 --> 00:43:01,357
Making vegetable balls?

989
00:43:01,757 --> 00:43:03,837
Why this sudden craving?

990
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:04,957
Just felt like eating

991
00:43:05,556 --> 00:43:06,957
your homemade vegetable balls.

992
00:43:07,076 --> 00:43:08,317
Missing your cooking.

993
00:43:09,596 --> 00:43:09,996
Alright.

994
00:43:10,757 --> 00:43:11,317
Take a look.

995
00:43:12,277 --> 00:43:12,717
Enough?

996
00:43:13,476 --> 00:43:14,797
With this big bowl of yours,

997
00:43:15,116 --> 00:43:16,437
you could make five platters!

998
00:43:16,877 --> 00:43:17,556
First step,

999
00:43:17,757 --> 00:43:18,837
add white sugar.

1000
00:43:19,437 --> 00:43:20,036
Adding sugar.

1001
00:43:20,076 --> 00:43:21,596
To draw out moisture.

1002
00:43:25,917 --> 00:43:26,797
Mix evenly, right?

1003
00:43:27,116 --> 00:43:28,036
Of course!

1004
00:43:28,116 --> 00:43:29,196
Need to repeat?

1005
00:43:29,237 --> 00:43:30,676
Mix it.

1006
00:43:31,357 --> 00:43:32,036
See?

1007
00:43:32,516 --> 00:43:34,437
Told you to come to Jingzhou.

1008
00:43:34,717 --> 00:43:36,156
I've said it many times.

1009
00:43:36,797 --> 00:43:37,516
If you're here,

1010
00:43:37,556 --> 00:43:38,996
you'd be sitting here with me,

1011
00:43:39,076 --> 00:43:40,156
teaching me directly.

1012
00:43:40,237 --> 00:43:41,317
I learn fast!

1013
00:43:43,476 --> 00:43:44,516
You stay put.

1014
00:43:44,556 --> 00:43:45,317
I'm not going.

1015
00:43:45,397 --> 00:43:46,757
I'm busy now.

1016
00:43:47,797 --> 00:43:48,957
These days,

1017
00:43:49,156 --> 00:43:50,237
I'm busy playing mahjong.

1018
00:43:51,156 --> 00:43:53,116
The neighborhood ladies say,

1019
00:43:53,437 --> 00:43:54,636
"Madam, at your age,

1020
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,277
you should exercise your mind."

1021
00:43:56,996 --> 00:43:57,917
Alright.

1022
00:43:58,837 --> 00:43:59,957
I know

1023
00:44:00,757 --> 00:44:03,156
you have an exciting senior life.

1024
00:44:03,996 --> 00:44:05,996
I won't keep you

1025
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:07,437
from your joyful golden years.

1026
00:44:08,237 --> 00:44:09,357
After mixing,

1027
00:44:09,596 --> 00:44:10,676
drain the water.

1028
00:44:10,797 --> 00:44:11,476
Then chop.

1029
00:44:11,596 --> 00:44:13,116
After chopping, add seasoning.

1030
00:44:13,357 --> 00:44:14,957
Chinese five-spice, allspice.

1031
00:44:15,036 --> 00:44:16,116
And some salt.

1032
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:17,076
Also add eggs.

1033
00:44:17,357 --> 00:44:18,676
Don't over-salt!

1034
00:44:19,036 --> 00:44:19,676
Wait!

1035
00:44:19,676 --> 00:44:20,516
Slow down!

1036
00:44:20,596 --> 00:44:21,516
Speak slower.

1037
00:44:21,596 --> 00:44:23,556
Slow down.

1038
00:44:23,636 --> 00:44:25,237
My brain can't keep up with yours.

1039
00:44:25,317 --> 00:44:27,277
You play Go and chess daily.

1040
00:44:29,437 --> 00:44:31,717
So you forget things too?

1041
00:44:32,757 --> 00:44:34,397
You used to complain about me.

1042
00:44:34,757 --> 00:44:36,516
"You never remember what I tell you!"

1043
00:44:37,196 --> 00:44:38,556
Now it's your turn.

1044
00:44:39,837 --> 00:44:40,556
