Boss Jiang Chen

8
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The guests are here

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Haoming

10
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Uncle Qu

11
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Long time no see

12
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Here, hug

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You didn't cheat

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,200
I don't care where I go.

15
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,320
You've changed.

16
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,960
You're getting more handsome.

17
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,160
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

18
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,280
I asked Chen Lin to pick you up at the airport.

19
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,280
I asked the driver to send me here.

20
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,160
Okay, please sit.

21
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,840
You have a big office.

22
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,320
You're quite ambitious.

23
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,760
I'm not ambitious. It's Jin Da.

24
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,440
Have you seen him at my dad's place?

25
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,800
I've been to your dad's place a long time ago.

26
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,360
He said there's a meeting.

27
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,600
He asked me to go there. I'm not interested.

28
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,720
I'll come over and see you.

29
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,920
It's so nice to see you.

30
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,960
Wuyi Mountain, Da Hong Pao.

31
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,080
I'm here to work.

32
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,920
You still remember my hobby.

33
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,600
Do you remember when I was young, my dad took me to Guangdong.

34
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,680
He took me to Suning to play,

35
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,480
tea at the teahouse, and drink Da Hong Pao.

36
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,880
How is it?

37
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,080
It's good.

38
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,640
He Meng,

39
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,760
Uncle Qu has been handed over to Jin Da for the rest of his life.

40
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,320
I'm not afraid of you laughing.

41
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,880
Our family isn't doing well.

42
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,240
We're still alone.

43
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,360
I've seen you grow up.

44
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,680
To Uncle Qu,

45
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,720
you're like my own son.

46
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,200
Uncle Qu, you're my dad's best brother.

47
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,520
We all know how much you've done for Jin Da.

48
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,600
If you weren't the one who took care of the Yue Gang area,

49
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,720
you wouldn't have the results you have now.

50
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,920
As a junior, I must learn from you.

51
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,640
That's what you should do.

52
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,480
He Meng, I came here

53
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,760
just for one thing.

54
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,360
I heard you're going to the board of directors.

55
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,000
I wanted to vote for you.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,080
I've been supporting your dad for so many years.

57
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,880
I'm sure I can support you unconditionally.

58
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,600
Don't be so hard on yourself.

59
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,480
Thank you, Uncle Qu.

60
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,560
Here, my nephew.

61
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,280
Let's get fat.

62
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,600
How's the factory in the area?

63
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,160
We've been making some stocks for Jin Da's retail.

64
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,080
But the numbers aren't enough.

65
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,800
Some of the big shareholders are afraid to give up.

66
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,480
I have to think of a way.

67
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,600
If you can find out the relationship between that kid and Shen Hao Ming,

68
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,920
it'll be easier.

69
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,240
I've been investigating with Wei Ping.

70
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,560
I want the results.

71
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,120
Got it, Uncle Qu.

72
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,920
I've found out that

73
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,440
Shen Hao Ming and Fang Yu did have a kid when they were in England.

74
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,440
Shen Hao Ming was with them during the pregnancy.

75
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,800
But after Shen Hao Ming returned, he was single.

76
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,080
Where did the kid go?

77
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,960
Shen Jing Song and Yu Lan announced that

78
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,840
they had a second child abroad not long after Shen Hao Ming returned.

79
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,520
Guess who the father of this kid is.

80
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,480
Do you think it's possible that

81
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,560
Shen Hao Chen isn't Shen Hao Ming's brother,

82
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,080
but his son?

83
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,520
If this gets out,

84
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,000
boom!

85
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,040
Chen Li.

86
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,120
I didn't expect that the board meeting with Shen Hao Ming went so smoothly.

87
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,160
That's because our Shen Hao Ming is a real man.

88
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,560
Thanks.

89
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,440
The board wants to have dinner with him.

90
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,680
We have to stay with him tonight.

91
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,680
Why are you still here?

92
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,080
I have to pick up Shen Hao Ming home.

93
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,920
But it's my girlfriend's birthday tonight.

94
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,520
She's a perfect match for me.

95
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,400
If she doesn't show up,

96
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
I'll use a nickname.

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,040
You're really not meant to be with love.

98
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,760
I'm so worried, Brother.

99
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,880
Don't worry. It's not easy for you.

100
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,640
After the party, I'll take Shen Hao Ming home.

101
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,000
You're so worried.

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,800
It's nothing.

103
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Leave this to me.

104
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,200
Really? I'll get a driver and send you home.

105
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,200
I'll go find Shen Hao Ming.

106
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,000
Thanks, Brother.

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,960
It's your fault. I'll treat you to dinner.

108
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,700

109
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,760

112
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,280
You match this heart's healthcare.

113
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,280
Thank you.

114
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,340
Oh dear, it's too late.

115
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,880
Think hard about your own group.

116
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,000
Shen Haoming's son

117
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,720
was placed at London as a physical键 directed downtown corpse.

118
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,840
What is the information?

119
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,440
No.

120
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,000
The confirmation failed. Please re-enter.

121
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,080
It's not her birthday.

122
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,160
The confirmation failed. Please re-enter.

123
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,560

The number of the car is also wrong.

125
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,520
No.

126
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,920
The phone has been dialed three times within five minutes.

127
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,160
If we make another mistake, the alarm will ring.

Although the house is full,

157
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,520
this building is our company.

158
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,520
A son is born without a wife.

159
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,520
And the whole family is helping him.

160
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,520
Our company has such a high-class company.

161
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,520
It's been so long.

162
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,520
Why did it suddenly come out?

163
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,520
And it's the important result

164
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,520
of the gambling meeting of Hao Ming.

165
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,520
Hello?

166
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,520
Chairman,

167
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,520
the shareholders asked to hold the board meeting urgently.

168
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,520
Please go to the company immediately with Mr. Shen.

169
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,520
I got it.

170
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,520
Mom,

171
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,520
I got it.

172
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,520
Liu, where is Hao Chen?

173
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
Mr. Shen has gone to school.

174
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,520
I saw him enter the school ten minutes ago.

175
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,520
Call him immediately and take him home.

176
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,520
Chen Lin,

177
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,520
find someone

178
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,520
to withdraw all the related information immediately.

179
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,520
Tell them

180
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,520
that this is about an unadulterated person.

181
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,520
I can call the police at any time.

182
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,520
Sister Ning,

183
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,520
Yan Yan,

184
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,520
did you see this?

185
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,520
What?

186
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,520
I'm going out.

187
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,520
Today he arranged to cancel my school.

188
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,520
Okay, be careful.

189
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,520
My dad just sent me a message

190
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,520
on the way.

191
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,520
My dad even knows his brother.

192
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,520
No,

193
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,520
he is his dad now.

194
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,520
My mom saw it too.

195
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,520
Now the news has spread.

196
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,520
There is a famous person in our class.

197
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
What are you talking about?

198
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,520
Shen Hao Chen,

199
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,520
you are famous today.

200
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,520
You are a big star.

201
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,520
What do you mean?

202
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,520
Your brother is actually your dad.

203
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,520
You don't know that, do you?

204
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
If you keep talking nonsense,

205
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,520
I will beat you to death.

206
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,520
Stop fighting.

207
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,520
Shen Hao Chen,

208
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,520
don't fight.

209
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,520
My family called today.

210
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,520
They asked you to take a day off.

211
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,520
You should go home with Uncle Liu.

212
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,520
Thank you, teacher.

213
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,520
Hua Chen, come with me.

214
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,520
Thank you, teacher.

215
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,520
Uncle Liu,

216
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,520
give me your phone.

217
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,520
Mr. Xu,

218
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,520
Shen Hao Chen is Shen Hao Ming's illegitimate son.

219
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,520
After the news of the illegitimate son

220
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,520
was exposed,

221
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,520
Jinda Group's stock fell by 5.63 percent.

222
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,520
The market value is at least 20 billion.

223
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,520
The investment team's suggestion is

224
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,520
to officially lower the price.

225
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,520
Let them start.

226
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,520
Okay.

227
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,520
Today,

228
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,520
Mr. Qu also came from abroad.

229
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,520
Not easy.

230
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,520
Okay.

231
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,520
Today is a day of falling into the trap.

232
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,520
Let's start.

233
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,520
Let's start.

234
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,520
On behalf of everyone,

235
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,520
I want to ask you something, chairman.

236
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,520
The news on the Internet said

237
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,520
Hao Chen is not your son.

238
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,520
He is Hao Ming's illegitimate son.

239
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,520
Is this a fact

240
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,520
or a fact?

241
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,520
From the news on the Internet,

242
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,520
in just three hours,

243
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,520
our stock price has been falling.

244
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,520
This will cause a great loss

245
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,520
to Jinda Group.

246
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,520
If this is fake,

247
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,520
we must immediately respond.

248
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,520
The statement of the statement

249
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,520
must control the potential of loss.

250
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,520
How could this be fake?

251
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,520
It's already been confirmed by the son.

252
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,520
I think this is a long story.

253
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,520
It can't be wrong.

254
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,520
What's the truth?

255
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
Chairman,

256
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,520
at this time,

257
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,520
we shouldn't hide it.

258
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,520
We should give an explanation.

259
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,520
We should find out the truth.

260
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,520
Shen,

261
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,520
back then,

262
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,520
so many brothers followed you,

263
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,520
and fought for the world.

264
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,520
How many brothers did you eat

265
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,520
to build Jinda Group?

266
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,520
After the company grew,

267
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,520
everyone agreed

268
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,520
to let you lead.

269
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,520
It's because you're a reliable brother.

270
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,520
You can lead everyone

271
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,520
to get this ship

272
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,520
to go smoothly.

273
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,520
After this incident,

274
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,520
we don't dare to believe our own eyes.

275
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,520
But we have already

276
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,520
confirmed it.

277
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,520
The evidence is clear.

278
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,520
We don't need to believe it.

279
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,520
As an old-fashioned construction company,

280
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,520
it doesn't even have the most basic

281
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,520
principles.

282
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,520
How can we face the public?

283
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,520
What business can we do?

284
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,520
What business can we do?

285
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,520
It's too much of an impact

286
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,520
on the image of our company.

287
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,520
I think we have a wrong client.

288
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,520
Are you my father?

289
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,520
We're in a meeting.

290
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,520
You can leave first.

291
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,520
Answer me.

292
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,520
Are you my father?

293
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,520
We're in a meeting.

294
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,520
You can leave first.

295
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,520
No.

296
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,520
You can leave now.

297
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,520
No.

298
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,520
You can leave first.

299
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,520
No.

300
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,520
Are you my father?

301
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,520
Let's go.

302
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,520
Answer me.

303
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,520
Are you my father?

304
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,520
Let me down.

305
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,520
Let me down.

306
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,520
Let me down.

307
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,520
Answer me.

308
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,520
Are you my father?

309
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,520
Who's son am I?

310
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,520
Let me down.

311
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,520
Let me down.

312
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
I'm looking at you.

313
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,520
Are you my father?

314
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,520
Who's son am I?

315
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,520
I just want to know

316
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,520
if what my son said

317
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,520
is true.

318
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,520
Are you my father?

319
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,520
Answer me.

320
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,520
Mom.

321
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,520
I went to Chenchen's school.

322
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,520
The teacher said the driver had taken her away.

323
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,520
Chenchen came to the company by herself.

324
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,520
Don't worry.

325
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,520
She's fine.

326
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,520
Okay.

327
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,520
I'll ask the driver to send her home.

328
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,520
If you're my father,

329
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,520
why did you let me save your brother?

330
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,520
Where's my mother?

331
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,520
Who is she?

332
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,520
Why did you lie to me?

333
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,520
Do you not want me at all?

334
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,520
I know you have a lot of questions.

335
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
Send her home.

336
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
Take your time.

337
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,520
Cheng Lin.

338
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,520
Drive Chenchen home.

339
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,520
I know, Mr. Shen.

340
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,520
The board of directors

341
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,520
wants you to go back to the meeting room now.

342
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,520
And now

343
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,520
many reporters are waiting on the first floor.

344
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,520
Drive my car to the underground parking lot.

345
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,520
Don't let any reporter

346
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,520
get close to Chenchen.

347
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,520
I understand.

348
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,520
Okay.

349
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,520
Don't think about anything.

350
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,520
Don't think about what you saw online.

351
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,520
Wait for me to come back.

352
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,520
The board of directors' family business

353
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,520
is not our business.

354
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,520
But you two

355
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,520
are the core leaders of the group.

356
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,520
Your words and actions

357
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
and actions

358
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,520
are all about the image of the group.

359
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,520
Your reputation and integrity.

360
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
Mr. Shen.

361
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,520
If you have any ideas,

362
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,520
just tell me.

363
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,520
I'll do it.

364
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,520
I'll do it.

365
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,520
I'll do it.

366
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,520
I'll do it.

367
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,520
I'll do it.

368
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,520
Just tell me.

369
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,520
I'll be open to everyone.

370
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,520
Let us have a bottom.

371
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,520
It's not a way to make mistakes.

372
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,520
Yes.

373
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,520
We have to

374
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,520
put this on the stage

375
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,520
and tell us.

376
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,520
You put so much pressure on us.

377
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,520
We can't do it.

378
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,520
We can't do it.

379
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,520
We can't do it.

380
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,520
Yes.

381
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,520
Don't talk.

382
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,520
We have to explain it.

383
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,520
You don't have to explain it to us.

384
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,520
I don't have to.

385
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,520
Wang Ming.

386
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,520
Wang Ming.

387
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,520
Let's talk about it.

388
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,520
Let's talk about it.

389
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,520
This is a matter of the heart.

390
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,520
There is no explanation.

391
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,520
I don't have to explain it to you.

392
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,520
Dad.

393
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,520
That's the study.

394
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,520
The chairman is not feeling well.

395
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,520
The meeting will end here.

396
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,520
Everyone, listen to me.

397
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,520
The chairman is not feeling well.

398
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,520
We can't stop him

399
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,520
from being honest.

400
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,520
Anyway,

401
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520
it's impossible to get worse.

402
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,520
It's even worse.

403
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,520
We can't wait.

404
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,520
Let's see how long

405
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,520
this old man can hold on.

406
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,520
Dad.

407
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
Take the medicine first.

408
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,520
Put it there.

409
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
I'll go get it.

410
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,520
Chairman, President Shen.

411
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
What is it?

412
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,520
At present,

413
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,520
several companies

414
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,520
are buying

415
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,520
and increasing their stocks.

416
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,520
The most is

417
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,520
Stor Building.

418
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,520
Stor Building

419
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,520
is the company

420
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,520
that is competing with us

421
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,520
for the Balencian project.

422
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,520
How much is it?

423
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,520
3.7%

424
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,520
is still growing.

425
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
Huang Ming.

426
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,520
Answer it.

427
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,520
Immediately repurchase.

428
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,520
This is also an active attitude

429
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,520
to show the market

430
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,520
that we are active.

431
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,520
LOL

432
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,520
Shen Angchen.

433
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,520
Y anf Shen Marg gathered.

434
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,520
Zhong Aufre inhabitants

435
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,520
came to the station

436
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,520
3 hours ago.

437
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,160
Hello?

438
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,480
Hello?

439
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,360
Mr. Chen,

440
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,120
when Chenchen was waiting for the red light,

441
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,760
she opened the door and ran away.

442
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,640
When I chased her,

443
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,480
I couldn't find her.

444
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,240
Chenchen,

445
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,080
why are you here?

446
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,840
Mr. Chen.

447
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,480
I know what happened today.

448
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,920
I know you must be

449
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,880
feeling very bad.

450
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,360
Come on, let's go home.

451
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,360
I'm not going home.

452
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,440
Do you want to know

453
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,240
who your mother is?

454
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:29,640
Yes.

455
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,240
Then I'll take you to see her.

456
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,160
Okay.

457
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,560
We're here.

458
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,680
Didn't you say you'd take me to see my mother?

459
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,040
Why did you bring me here?

460
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,800
To protect your mother's identity.

461
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,840
No one else knows.

462
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,800
I see.

463
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,040
Now,

464
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,280
I'll take you to a place to rest.

465
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,240
Wait for me there.

466
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,280
Don't run away.

467
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,520
I'll go get your mother.

468
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,000
Okay?

469
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,120
What did the police say?

470
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,720
The police station has taken over the case.

471
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,680
They're investigating the missing footage.

472
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,000
They also went out to the place

473
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,160
where Chenchen often appears.

474
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,120
They're looking for people.

475
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:34,960
Yan Yan

476
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,240
has gone to the place

477
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,600
where Chenchen often appears.

478
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,720
If Yan Yan finds her,

479
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,480
she'll tell me.

480
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,840
Hengbin.

481
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,600
Don't worry.

482
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,800
How's your father?

483
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,520
I didn't dare to tell him about Chenchen.

484
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,360
Let him rest upstairs for a while.

485
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,760
I'll think of a way

486
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,720
to tell him.

487
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,520
Okay.

488
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,480
Mom,

489
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,440
Chenchen will be fine.

490
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,840
Don't worry too much.

491
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,280
Now, all the reporters are outside.

492
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,080
During this time,

493
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,720
don't go out.

494
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,760
Stay at my house.

495
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,520
I'll go out again

496
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,800
to find Chenchen.

497
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:09,960
Okay.

498
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,920
Chenchen's bag.

499
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,760
It's like her.

500
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,080
It's like her.

501
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,400
Officer Liu.

502
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,400
I just received a picture.

503
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,040
It's Chenchen's bag.

504
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,400
The address is Yongxiang Building.

505
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,600
Please.

506
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,040
Please go out quickly.

507
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,320
Thank you.

508
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,480
Yan Yan.

509
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,600
Where are you?

510
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,440
Yan Yan.

511
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,400
Heng Weiping.

512
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,200
Look out!

513
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,160
Go, go, go.

514
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,560
Wait up!

515
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,080
Where is Chen Chen?

516
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,440
Qin Meng,

517
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,240
what are you doing?

518
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,720
I didn't hurt Chen Chen.

519
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,360
You hurt her.

520
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,760
She wants to know

521
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,800
who her real mother is.

522
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,680
Is there anything wrong with that?

523
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,200
You lied to her

524
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,840
about her.

525
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,720
It's not me.

526
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,000
Where is Chen Chen?

527
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,520
I don't know.

528
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,120
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

529
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,080
Chen Chen!

530
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,600
Haoming.

531
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,080
Are you okay?

532
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,880
Thank you, Officer.

533
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,520
It's okay.

534
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,400
We should do it.

535
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,200
The child is safe.

536
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,840
After we go back,

537
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,200
please help us to make a record.

538
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,480
No problem.

539
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,440
Thank you.

540
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,120
Thank you.

541
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,880
Thank you.

542
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,640
Thank you.

543
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,280
Thank you.

544
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,000
Thank you.

545
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,640
Thank you.

546
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,320
Thank you.

547
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,160
Thank you.

548
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,840
Thank you.

549
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,800
Be careful.

550
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,000
I'm fine.

551
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,080
He's out!

552
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,880
He's out!

553
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,040
Mr. Chen!

554
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,960
Mr. Chen!

555
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,880
Mr. Chen!

556
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,080
Mr. Chen!

557
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,840
Mr. Chen!

558
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
Please tell us

559
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,760
if Chen Haocheng is your son.

560
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,760
Mr. Chen!

561
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,160
Mr. Chen!

562
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,080
Mr. Chen!

563
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,920
Mr. Chen!

564
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,560
Mr. Chen!

565
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,720
Please make way.

566
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,360
Mr. Chen,

567
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,160
please don't take the interview.

568
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,880
We're here to ask you

569
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,080
if Chen Haocheng is your son.

570
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,880
If he isn't,

571
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,800
how can you tell us

572
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,800
if he's your son?

573
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,800
If it's true,

574
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,760
why can't you admit

575
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,240
he's your biological son?

576
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,200
You don't want

577
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,880
Chen Haocheng to be your son.

578
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,800
Don't touch me.

579
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,080
Haocheng, let me down.

580
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,920
I don't want you to touch me.

581
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,280
Let me down!

582
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,600
Let me down!

583
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,800
It's all right now.

584
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,240
It seems that Chen Haocheng

585
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,440
wants to know the truth.

586
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,120
Can you tell us

587
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,000
what the truth is?

588
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,880
You're my son.

589
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:07,680
Mr. Chen,

590
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,600
you just admitted

591
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,720
that you're not his biological son.

592
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,000
Who is his biological mother?

593
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Where is she?

594
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,320
The foreign media

595
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,600
is looking for a divorce.

596
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,360
Is Shen Haocheng

597
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,320
the one who divorced you?

598
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,240
What's your marriage relationship

599
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,240
like?

600
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,280
Shen Haocheng's biological mother

601
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,240
died because of the water.

602
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,520
Do you know about this?

603
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,320
How are you going to face

604
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:22,960
this child in the future?

605
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,800
This child is my son.

606
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,400
I'm sorry.

607
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,400
I'm sorry.

608
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,400
I'm sorry.

609
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,400
I'm sorry.

610
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,400
I'm sorry.

611
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,400
I'm sorry.

612
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,400
I'm sorry.

613
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,400
I'm sorry.

614
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,920
I'm Shen Haocheng's mother.

615
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,720
You've seen it.

616
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,720
My son is in a very bad state.

617
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,720
I hope you

618
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,000
have a basic professional skills.

619
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,480
Don't hurt an

620
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,480
underage person.

621
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,080
Our family is all good.

622
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,360
Don't worry about us.

623
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,160
But if you keep doing this,

624
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,560
we'll have to go to the police station.

625
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,560
Please excuse us.

626
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
Impossible.

627
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,560
Move!

628
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,720
Find the police station we're going to.

629
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,040
Then we'll go to the police station.

630
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,360
Zhenzhen.

631
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,480
Look at you.

632
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,480
You haven't eaten a day.

633
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,040
There's rice balls and little pumpkins.

634
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,080
They're your favorite.

635
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,040
They smell so good.

636
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,840
Let's have some, okay?

637
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,240
Smell it.

638
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,880
Who's so smart?

639
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,240
They know Chenchen likes to drink coke.

640
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,440
It's cold.

641
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,640
Chenchen.

642
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,160
Chenchen, have some.

643
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,440
Have some, okay?

644
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,680
We're so worried about you.

645
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,800
Chenchen, please.

646
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,040
Chenchen, don't be like this.

647
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,680
Don't scare me, okay?

648
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,680
Say something.

649
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,560
Let's go out and play.

650
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,600
You can do whatever you want.

651
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,360
Say something, Chenchen.

652
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,080
Please.

653
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,880
We're so worried about you.

654
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,720
Chenchen.

655
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,360
Yes.

656
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,120
The shareholder's called again.

657
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,600
Dad has arrived at the company.

658
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,480
I have to go.

659
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,480
I'm leaving him to you.

660
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,000
Don't worry. I'm here.

661
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,600
You and Dad must be careful.

662
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,000
You're at home?

663
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,840
I bought flowers for you.

664
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,420
Do you really have a festive mood?

665
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,920
Go pee there.

666
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,760
Four-color drink, five-color-ражin wine,

667
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,420
if you wish.

668
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,260
I'm happy when I'm with you.

669
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,960
No art does it themselves.

670
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,480
Round city is good for audiences,

671
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,420
maar through art do they have to find one another.

672
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,580
I was told it,

673
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,340
that on day when you see things,

674
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:11,700
still,

675
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,160
well,

676
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,240
at the speed of light,

677
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,040
some stars that can't be studied,

678
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,940
may be a nutritious snack.

679
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,620
When I'm about to go with you,

680
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:27,100
Only you! Only you keep asking about my sister and Cheng Haoming!

681
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,420
That's right. It's me.

682
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,660
Please leave.

683
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:37,620
We don't have any contact between us anymore.

684
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,220
Shen Jin Song.

685
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,020
The enterprise price.

686
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,820
Old Qu,

687
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:13,020
you're at a 10%...

688
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,020
2% share in Jin Da's shares, right?

689
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,220
Now it's 16.3%.

690
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,420
You're buying back.

691
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:29,420
Situo's stock is under 5% of Jin Da's.

692
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,420
I'm also a gentleman.

693
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:37,420
Situo can predict Jin Da's future.

694
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,620
Haoming.

695
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:47,220
Jin Da's internal affairs are suspicious.

696
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:53,820
Otherwise, Situo wouldn't have saved a lot of money to buy the shares.

697
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,420
And this ghost

698
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:02,620
is the only one who betrayed Chen Zhen's life.

699
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:08,620
I just didn't expect it to be you.

700
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:14,020
You should have thought that I was excluded by you for so many years.

701
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:18,620
I don't think I've attended the board meeting many times, right?

702
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:24,220
Sometimes, I'm the shadow in the phone call.

703
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:28,020
Did you forget me when you hired me?

704
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:32,220
You're so arrogant.

705
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,220
It's hard for you.

706
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:46,220
You've been acting so fierce in front of everyone.

707
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:54,620
Back then, we were in a family.

708
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,020
We were close.

709
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:02,220
You told me to listen to you.

710
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:06,820
Back then, the brothers we started the business together,

711
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:10,620
which one of them was sent to a place far away from Jinzhou?

712
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:13,420
Which one? Think about it.

713
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,020
Let's say I

714
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:21,220
stayed in Guangdong for 30 years.

715
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:25,420
If I hadn't been sent to Hong Kong market

716
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,820
and worked hard to get my one-meter three-cent-cent-meter land,

717
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,420
I would have been expelled by you.

718
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:34,420
You're so naive.

719
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:42,020
Okay, you've been in this position for decades.

720
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,420
Let's change a person.

721
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,820
Your beard is white.

722
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,220
You're going to kill a child.

723
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,220
You're so sinister.

724
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,420
There's an old saying.

725
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,820
A snake is seven inches long.

726
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,420
A tree is a root.

727
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,020
Since you're so sinister,

728
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,820
what kind of moral ethics is that?

729
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,420
Big nephew.

730
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:21,620
Han Weiping is your lawyer, right?

731
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,620
He's my godson.

732
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,420
So let's change a person.

733
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:44,420
First, let's send people to Guangdong market.

734
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,820
Where is the analyser?

735
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,820
I don't think so.

736
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,020
Do we need a counsel center?

737
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,420
That person stole the rent on your behalf.

738
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,440
Speed up the operation!

739
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,440
What should we do lo?

740
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:14,840
Doctor.

741
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,540
How is it acceptable?

742
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:20,340
Seph cukat is...

743
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,940
The patient's Pattern Ad gouvernement is broken place.

744
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,520
The jumped imp п tire and ended up bleeding after cla hiong.

745
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,560
Though recycle is done,

746
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,360
you must be mentally prepared.

747
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,960
Mom, it's fine.

748
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,560
Let's talk about the details when Dad wakes up, okay?

749
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,560
Don't worry too much.

750
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,560
All these years,

751
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,760
your father managed the company.

752
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,560
We've been through a lot together.

753
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,560
This bar,

754
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,560
can it be lifted?

755
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,560
It will definitely be lifted.

756
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,560
You look so tired.

757
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,560
Leave the hospital to me.

758
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,560
Go home and rest, okay?

759
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,560
No.

760
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,560
Okay.

761
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,560
I'll be here with him.

762
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,960
Watching him wake up.

763
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,760
Qu Mingcheng is a very secretive person.

764
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,560
He will never let him go.

765
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,240
Of course.

766
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,900
Make an winners' vote for Wan Melong Tobacco abundant

767
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,560
and loss your money.

768
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,520
Who will this tropic be?

769
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:05,960
Hansheng?

770
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,040
What were you thinking?

771
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,800
You're right.

772
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,020
I might have to take a dig in this project.

773
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,080
But genuine hard work

774
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,120
has no competition at all.

775
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,840
It requires

776
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,280
trust from both sides

777
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,560
Come.

778
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,200
I don't believe you.

779
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,320
You broke a bonfire last night at the house.

780
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,560
That's so terrible!

781
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:37,960
Have you eaten?

782
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,640
No.

783
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,800
You close your room alone.

784
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,240
Why don't you shut up?

785
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,720
Usually,

786
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,120
your child activated so quickly.

787
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,800
Now...

788
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,400
I go out for a walk first.

789
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,600
Chen Chen,

790
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,580
I get in.

791
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,080
Chenchen,

792
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,680
if you don't eat anything,

793
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,080
you'll be tired.

794
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,280
How about this?

795
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:48,920
Look.

796
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,760
I'll put a pen and a notebook here

797
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,480
for you to read.

798
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,920
Write down what you want to eat.

799
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,360
Okay?

800
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,720
The weather is good today.

801
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,720
The sun is not too strong.

802
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,640
It's perfect for skateboarding.

803
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,760
Do you want to go?

804
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,760
You don't want to go out?

805
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,240
You don't want to talk either?

806
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,000
You don't want to talk to me?

807
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,680
Okay.

808
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,680
I'll stay here and stay with you, okay?

809
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,480
Chenchen is so good.

810
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,600
Jin Song.

811
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,080
I'll stay with you and my son.

812
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,000
You must wake up.

813
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,440
We'll wait for you.

814
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,800
You must wake up.

815
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,960
You must wake up.

816
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,760
Wake up.

817
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,640
Uncle Lin.

818
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,720
Let me see my uncle.

819
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:40,880
Here.

820
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,200
Mom, let me introduce you.

821
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,640
Yu Yiming, Dr. Yu.

822
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,080
He's Xu Yan's boyfriend.

823
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,480
Hello.

824
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,280
Hello, aunt.

825
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,640
How is your uncle?

826
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,680
He's stable.

827
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,400
He's conscious.

828
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,480
But he's not fully awake.

829
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,040
It's good that he's stable.

830
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,200
He must take it slowly.

831
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,640
After all, he just had surgery.

832
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,160
He needs to recover slowly.

833
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:13,520
Aunt.

834
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,640
Uncle's doctor

835
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,960
is my mentor's classmate.

836
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,240
He's also the authority of our department.

837
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,440
I just went to see him.

838
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,080
Please take care of him.

839
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,560
Thank you, Yu.

840
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,000
It's okay.

841
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:27,760
You're welcome.

842
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,800
We're family.

843
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,720
You even went to see him yourself.

844
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,280
Uncle needs to rest.

845
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,560
I won't bother you then.

846
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,200
I came to say

847
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,760
if there's any problem at the hospital,

848
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:40,800
you can contact me anytime.

849
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,120
I'll be okay with company and shift.

850
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:44,960
Thank you.

851
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,720
Don't worry.

852
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:47,720
Thank you.

853
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:48,840
I'll go back first.

854
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,520
Where's the baby?

855
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,760
In the room.

856
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,920
He didn't eat or drink.

857
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,760
He didn't say a word.

858
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,440
I don't know what to do.

859
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,360
But

860
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,800
I'll stay with him.

861
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,160
Okay.

862
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:16,760
You need to take care of yourself

863
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,360
when you take care of him.

864
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,800
Yu Yiming went to the hospital.

865
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,440
Okay.

866
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,640
Thank you and Yiming.

867
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,480
I'm really not feeling well recently.

868
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,880
So the company

869
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,520
will have to work hard on you.

870
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,320
What hard work?

871
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,280
It's such a big deal.

872
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,000
The brother-in-law and the manager

873
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,080
must be having a hard time.

874
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,000
The old and the young

875
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,040
need to be taken care of.

876
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,080
It's okay.

877
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,840
You can help him with the distribution.

878
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,280
We'll take care of the company.

879
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,960
The Gubei Town Grass and Wood Enzyme Project

880
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,520
and the rest of the physical stores

881
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,880
are recommended.

882
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,400
If you have any problems,

883
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,760
call me.

884
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,680
I know. Don't worry.

885
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,080
Have some water.

886
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,080
Okay.

887
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:19,800
Hello, Lian Lian.

888
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,240
Yiming,

889
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,240
I just left Yan Yan's office.

890
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:23,840
I've already called everyone

891
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:24,800
at the hospital.

892
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:25,840
I've also told Haoming

893
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,200
not to be polite to us.

894
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,320
If you need anything,

895
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,280
you can come to us anytime.

896
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,240
I've told him.

897
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:32,960
Yiming,

898
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,120
Yan Yan can't be away from work recently.

899
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,080
I must take good care of Yan Yifang.

900
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,720
Can you wait until this is over?

901
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,640
When this is over,

902
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,440
I'll be with you and rely on you.

903
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,680
I know the times are very long.

904
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,320
We can help them

905
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,360
to share more.

906
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,720
But don't work so hard.

907
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,040
You're the best.

908
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,560
I'll hang up now.

909
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,040
Okay.

910
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:55,960
Bye.

911
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,160
Thank you.

912
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:16,520
Lian Lian.

913
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:48,520
I just want to take my time tonight

914
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,520
And do all the things that I said

915
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,960
I want to do

916
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,960
I just want to take my time tonight

917
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:03,360
And do all the things that I said

918
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,360
I just want to take my time tonight

919
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,520
And do all the things that I said

920
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,440
I just want to take my time tonight

921
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:31,960
And do all the things that I said

922
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:37,160
I just want to take my time tonight

923
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:43,240
And do all the things that I said

924
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:47,640
I'll talk to her to even see

925
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,440
See the world how it flows

926
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:53,440
What is yours will never let go

927
00:49:55,240 --> 00:50:01,640
So I'll take my time to reunite

928
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:06,440
The love that I should deserve

929
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,840
When the time is right

930
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:14,240
And you realize

931
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,840
That it will be alright

932
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:25,240
Cause I just happened her too many times

933
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:31,840
I'm giving it all just getting nothing back

934
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:39,240
I was lost in the dark and too hurt to even see

935
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,240
See the world how it flows

936
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:44,240
What is yours will never let go

937
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:52,240
So I'll take my time to reunite

938
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:57,240
The love that I should deserve

939
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,640
When the time is right

940
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,640
And you realize

941
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:09,640
