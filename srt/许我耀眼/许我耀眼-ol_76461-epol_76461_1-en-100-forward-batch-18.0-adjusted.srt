38
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:47,419
(The apple of their eye.)

39
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:50,060
I'll take her

40
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:52,780
if you don't want her.

41
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,859
If you won't raise her,

42
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,859
I will.

43
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,699
Mom.

44
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:02,220
She has congenital heart disease.

45
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,900
We can't afford her treatment.

46
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,539

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:39,979
Xu Yan.

61
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,220
What a lovely name.

62
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:43,979
Does it have a meaning?

63
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,139
Xu stands for "promise"
as in a promise of gold.

64
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:50,979
Yan stands for beauty inside and out.

65
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,859
It represents our expectations

66
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:53,819
for our daughter.

67
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:57,460
Thank you

68
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,379
for entrusting Yan to me.

69
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:01,020
I'm lucky to be able

70
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,099
to marry her.

71
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,460
Haoming,

72
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,780
you're outstanding in every way.

73
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,139
Top schools.

74
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,579
Good-looking.

75
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,819
And you're already

76
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:11,940
helping your father

77
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:12,659
at this age.

78
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,699
That's impressive.

79
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,419
Syracuse University's
architecture program

80
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,500
is prestigious.

81
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,740
With you two here,

82
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:20,699
we'll surely need

83
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,060
your insights on future trends

84
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:23,699
in architecture.

85
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:24,699
I'll definitely

86
00:04:24,859 --> 00:04:26,460
seek your guidance.

87
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:28,900
You're too modest.

88
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,460
Jinda Group is a top player

89
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,699
in the industry.

90
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:33,340
In the past few years,

91
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:34,620
you've led several

92
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,060
national landmark projects.

93
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,180
No matter what,

94
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,500
our practice still needs

95
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,579
theoretical guidance.

96
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,060
What are you working on these days?

97
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:49,699

103
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:03,060
Environmental building.

104
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:04,060
Yeah, that.

105
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:04,940
Yeah.

106
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,060
I sent you the files last week.

107
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,060
Please memorize everything

108
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,779
to avoid any slip-ups.

109
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:11,819
Rest assured,

110
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,420
we'll definitely...

111
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,899
I'll try another shampoo.

112
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,019
This perfume is for you.

113
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:23,899
Cheap perfumes have

114
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,579
a harsh alcohol smell.

115
00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:28,259
Start using this tomorrow.

116
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:29,819
Miss Xu, don't worry.

117
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,699
We'll memorize all the materials

118
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,660
and professional terms.

119
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:34,660
We'll memorize them

120
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:37,339
by heart and be flawless.

121
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,300
You specialize in...

122
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,540
Environmental building.

123
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,540
This has been my focus

124
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:46,339
at the research studio.

125
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:48,420
Zero-carbon buildings

126
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,860
have been and will remain

127
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,819
a major research field worldwide.

128
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:55,860
Only highly educated parents

129
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:57,339
like you could raise

130
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:58,660
their daughter so well.

131
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:03,980
Syracuse University.

132
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,980
I visited this university last year.

133
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:08,740
The campus diners are awful.

134
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,819
Typical Western food.

135
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:11,860
There's a Chinese restaurant

136
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,100
on Marshall Street nearby

137
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:14,899
with authentic Peking duck.

138
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:16,620
Have you tried it?

139
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:31,579
(Three.)

140
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:32,540
(Two.)

141
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:33,620
(One.)

142
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,699
Smile.

143
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:36,339
Stop.

144
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,180
You're not here sightseeing.

145
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:40,540
We will visit

146
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,219
the campus and local communities

147
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,420
to enhance your memory

148
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,060
as if you've genuinely

149
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,540
lived and worked here.

150
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:47,459
Understand?

151
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:48,379
Got it.

152
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,540
Behind you

153
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,060
is the Ernest Bird Library.

154
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,660
(Ernest Bird Library)

155
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,259
To the right is the law school.

156
00:06:54,464 --> 00:06:55,219
(Law School)

157
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:57,100
The campus has two canteens

158
00:06:57,139 --> 00:06:58,300
and 14 coffee shops.

159
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:00,540
We usually go to Schine Diner.

160
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:02,139
The only Chinese restaurant

161
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,259
has three signature dishes.

162
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:04,620
Sichuan boiled fish, mapo tofu,

163
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:05,540
and spicy chicken.

164
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:06,740
What's it called?

165
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,259
P.F. Chang's, right?

166
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:11,540
My husband and I are regulars there.

167
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,300
But it's a Sichuan restaurant.

168
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:16,019
They don't serve Peking duck.

169
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:18,980
Their specialty is actually mapo tofu.

170
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,819
Dad loves their boiled fish.

171
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,459
What a pity.

172
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:27,100
They run out in the winter,

173
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,420
unlike how things are back at home.

174
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:29,899
Exactly.

175
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,339
Sorry, I got confused.

176
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,139
I visited too many places last time.

177
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,899
Actually, I met several

178
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:40,259
Chinese-American professors.

179
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:42,219
Why haven't I seen you there?

180
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,579
I've searched on Baidu

181
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:48,899
but found no information about you.

182
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:57,259
Why is that?

183
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:05,940
(Xu Jiajia.)

184
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,139
(You're really immigrating?)

185
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,420
This university?

186
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,660
It looks amazing.

187
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,660
My paperwork's done.
I'm leaving next month.

188
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,219
I really envy you.

189
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:16,579
(Directory)
Your parents are professors.

190
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:17,379
And you attend

191
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,819
the university where they work.

192
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,660
They're not professors.

193
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:23,300
They are just research staff.

194
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,660
You might find
their names listed abroad.

195
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,740
But on Baidu,

196
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:28,100
you can't find anything.

197
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:32,899
Ms. Yu.

198
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:36,779
My father doesn't teach.

199
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,579
He only serves
as a researcher at the institute.

200
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,620
Therefore,

201
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,300
you probably won't find him on Baidu.

202
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:57,900
Here you are.

203
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,660
We researchers may not enjoy

204
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:09,260
the wealth of industrialists.

205
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:11,540
But we possess our own value.

206
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,699
I'm not after fame and fortune.

207
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,099
Absolutely.

208
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,900
You dedicate yourselves to research,

209
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,339
right?

210
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,420
Without seeking glory.

211
00:09:21,739 --> 00:09:24,699
That's true intellectual nobility.

212
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,619
Sorry.

213
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,260
I've been quite forward.

214
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,140
Oh.

215
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,699
Here is

216
00:09:40,099 --> 00:09:41,660
my recently published work.

217
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,619
You are professionals.

218
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,579
I'd appreciate your opinion. Thank you.

219
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:47,260
Thank you.

220
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,459
Nice handwriting.

221
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,819
Educated people have
beautiful handwriting.

222
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,900
Why don't I get a signature?

223
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,660
Perhaps you forgot.

224
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,819
Please sign it.

225
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,219
Or it'd be a shame.

226
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:06,099
My apologies.

227
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,459
I must have forgotten.

228
00:10:26,619 --> 00:10:28,300
Thank you for the book, Mr. Xu.

229
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,499
Thank you for bringing me gifts

230
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,459
all the way.

231
00:10:32,859 --> 00:10:33,420
What a pity.

232
00:10:33,979 --> 00:10:35,699
Jiajia has gone to Paris.

233
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,420
I've spoken to her.

234
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:38,979
It's fine.

235
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,060
We can meet next time.

236
00:10:40,979 --> 00:10:42,540
Could you sign this for me?

237
00:10:43,739 --> 00:10:44,060
Well...

238
00:10:44,619 --> 00:10:46,540
I didn't write this book alone.

239
00:10:46,739 --> 00:10:47,660
All our researchers

240
00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:48,579
put in their efforts.

241
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,420
But you're the only one I know.

242
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:52,140
Alright then.

243
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:24,859
There.

244
00:11:24,979 --> 00:11:25,619
Thank you.

245
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,940
Excellent handwriting.

246
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,180
I can feel the cultural refinement.

247
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,300
Mr. Xu and Mrs. Xu.

248
00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:47,619
You must be hungry now.

249
00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:49,300
Let's discuss the wedding

250
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,940
in the dining room.

251
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:54,339
You should decide on the wedding.

252
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:57,420
Our opinions are just suggestions.

253
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,339
This way.

254
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,979
The main advantage

255
00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:05,540
of this area is
its prime location, maybe.

256
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:07,180
The only drawback

257
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,540
I can think of is that

258
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:09,739
it's under a flight path.

259
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:10,540
Sometimes,

260
00:12:10,619 --> 00:12:11,619
planes pass overhead.

261
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,660
It's alright.

262
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,060
It's not so loud.

263
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,020
Yan,

264
00:12:22,219 --> 00:12:23,900
do you like the cooking

265
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,180
of our family chef?

266
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,020
Great food.

267
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:27,979
Thank you.

268
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:29,499
I'm glad you like it.

269
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,420
You don't like eggs?

270
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:44,260
Are they your biological parents?

271
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:51,180
You don't seem so close to them.

272
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,020
How could a mother

273
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,739
not know her own daughter

274
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,540
doesn't eat eggs?

275
00:13:06,499 --> 00:13:07,459
Yan, here.

276
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,660
Thanks, Mom.

277
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:12,979
Yan,

278
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,099
dig in.

279
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,739
What's true can't be faked.

280
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,540
What's fake can't be real.

281
00:13:42,219 --> 00:13:43,339
I want the truth.

282
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:53,499
Have some fruit.

283
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,660
Okay, thank you.

284
00:13:54,859 --> 00:13:55,619
Don't be shy.

285
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:01,819
I'm sorry.

286
00:14:04,859 --> 00:14:05,739
What for?

287
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:10,780
I lied.

288
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,739
About what?

289
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,540
They want a spare cue.

290
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,300
I said,

291
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:20,979
"Keep learning.

292
00:14:20,979 --> 00:14:21,979
We won't make it."

293
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:23,180
Actually,

294
00:14:23,219 --> 00:14:24,979
I grew up living with my grandma.

295
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,219
My parents left me behind

296
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:32,499
and went to work overseas early on.

297
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,540
So I've barely

298
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,420
seen them at all.

299
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,180
I don't know what it's like to be loved

300
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,339
by my father or mother.

301
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,219
I've fought

302
00:14:57,979 --> 00:14:58,900
and protested.

303
00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:01,979
But it didn't do anything.

304
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,540
I even wanted to cut ties with them.

305
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,900
If it weren't

306
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,420
for the fact that we were

307
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:14,579
getting married,

308
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,060
I wouldn't have contacted them.

309
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,660
When I said that

310
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,780
I have a loving family

311
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:27,499
earlier today,

312
00:15:29,819 --> 00:15:30,900
that was a lie.

313
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,540
I'm sorry, Ms. Yu.

314
00:15:34,979 --> 00:15:35,859
I just wanted

315
00:15:35,859 --> 00:15:36,859
to do my best

316
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,940
to make you

317
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,579
think highly of me.

318
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,499
I wanted you to believe

319
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,780
that I grew up

320
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,099
in a loving household,

321
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:50,099
which was not true.

322
00:15:52,739 --> 00:15:53,940
I wanted you

323
00:15:54,739 --> 00:15:56,380
and Haoming to feel assured, so...

324
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,060
I'm sorry.

325
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,380
Your parents had their reasons.

326
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:12,459
Everyone tries to balance

327
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:13,900
work and family life.

328
00:16:15,819 --> 00:16:16,940
But achieving that balance

329
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,859
isn't easy.

330
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:21,819
Haoming's been studying abroad

331
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,339
alone since childhood.

332
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,459
We rarely saw him.

333
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,940
I've always felt sorry about that.

334
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:40,940
Ms. Yu.

335
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,499
Haochen is back from school.

336
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:44,940
I see.

337
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:47,499
Excuse me.

338
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,900
Ms. Yu.

339
00:16:51,499 --> 00:16:52,260
Thank you.

340
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:25,216
(Huanhuan)

341
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,259
What's wrong?

342
00:17:29,699 --> 00:17:30,219
Yan.

343
00:17:30,499 --> 00:17:32,100
You didn't make it as the host

344
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,900
of Family Feast.

345
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:34,580
Sun Siwei heard you applied

346
00:17:34,699 --> 00:17:36,259
and shouted at the director.

347
00:17:36,499 --> 00:17:37,459
Watch your back.

348
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,739
This is just the beginning.

349
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:44,180
The matter

350
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:47,739
isn't settled yet.

351
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,180
Yan,

352
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:50,620
come have some fruit.

353
00:17:58,219 --> 00:17:58,739
Coming.

354
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,180
Come on.

355
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,580
Miss Xu,

356
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,299
everything went smoothly.

357
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,019
I will help you

358
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,100
check out tomorrow.

359
00:18:14,739 --> 00:18:15,739
Just leave your key cards

360
00:18:15,979 --> 00:18:17,259
at the front desk.

361
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,340
Lay low until the wedding.

362
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,340
I'll contact you.

363
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,580
Your job will be done after the wedding.

364
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:24,940
I won't bother you

365
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,340
with anything afterward.

366
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:28,860
Okay.

367
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,539
Got it.

368
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,779
Rest assured.

369
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,299
We're character actors.

370
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:33,900
If you see us on the street

371
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:34,539
one day,

372
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,660
you won't recognize us.

373
00:18:35,979 --> 00:18:36,620
Yeah.

374
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,499
Since we've taken on this job,

375
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,420
we won't cause you any trouble.

376
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,180
Rest assured.

377
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,180
Yeah.

378
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:44,739
Alright.

379
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,380
Right.

380
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,499
Miss Xu.

381
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,779
I've pre-screened these extras

382
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,979
for the wedding.

383
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,499
See if they qualify as wedding guests.

384
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,459
I will settle the payment.

385
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,100
The rest is none of your business.

386
00:19:01,499 --> 00:19:01,979
Got it.

387
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:02,820
Got it.

388
00:19:07,219 --> 00:19:08,380
Check out before 7:00 AM.

389
00:19:09,219 --> 00:19:09,860
I'm leaving.

390
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,259
Well...

391
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:12,259
Miss Xu, take care.

392
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,140
Take care.

393
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,459
(It's a life built on lies.)

394
00:19:28,699 --> 00:19:29,620
(I did my best)

395
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,820
(to make a fortress.)

396
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,620
(But how can there be)

397
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,979
(fortresses built on sand?)

398
00:19:52,948 --> 00:19:54,660
(Family Feast)

399
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,420
Everything needs to be categorized.

400
00:19:58,019 --> 00:19:58,860
The salad ingredients

401
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,059
and the recipes

402
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,299
for today's show

403
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:02,539
should all be sorted.

404
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,299
Here.

405
00:20:04,699 --> 00:20:05,380
Wash this.

406
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,100
Huanhuan.

407
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,900
The guest has been waiting for an hour.

408
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,259
Where is Sun Siwei?

409
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,940
Yan. I've urged her twice.

410
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:19,580
Try to fetch her, okay?

411
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,019
I...

412
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,900
How dare you call me by my name?

413
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:26,860
Sorry, Siwei.

414
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,420
Why don't we first...

415
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:30,620
Do you know why you can't replace me

416
00:20:30,699 --> 00:20:31,900
as the host?

417
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:34,779
Because you only scheme

418
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,180
behind the scenes.

419
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:38,059
It's just too low-class.

420
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,140
A mere planner like you
wants to become a host?

421
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,380
Are you even qualified?

422
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,820
Besides,

423
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,620
you can't even do your job right.

424
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,059
What is this script?

425
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,539
(Script)
The lines are so convoluted.

426
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,620
Every time we record this show,

427
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,420
I can't use your scripts

428
00:20:56,459 --> 00:20:57,699
and have to improvise.

429
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,140
The guests you book

430
00:20:59,219 --> 00:21:00,219
keep getting worse.

431
00:21:00,499 --> 00:21:02,259
The topics get increasingly boring.

432
00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:02,900
And you think

433
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,340
you can be a host?

434
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:09,699
Siwei,

435
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,100
if you don't like the script,

436
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,739
I can revise it right now.

437
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,900
But some guests have mentioned

438
00:21:17,979 --> 00:21:19,380
that the interview

439
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,620
doesn't match the script.

440
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:21,539
What's going on?

441
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,219
Are you blaming this on me?

442
00:21:24,499 --> 00:21:25,420
What now?

443
00:21:25,699 --> 00:21:27,100
You're dating some rich guy.

444
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,059
So you think you can be in charge?

445
00:21:33,699 --> 00:21:36,259
You'd better know your place.

446
00:21:37,739 --> 00:21:39,019
Those rich guys

447
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:40,699
have relationships that last

448
00:21:40,739 --> 00:21:42,059
a month or two at most.

449
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,299
Instead of wasting time there,

450
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,259
you should focus on pleasing me.

451
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,900
I call the shots here.

452
00:21:50,699 --> 00:21:52,820
I can kick you out with just one word.

453
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,820
Where is the guest?

454
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,100
(Weekly Ratings)
The weekly ratings are out.

455
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,340
See for yourself.

456
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:06,979
Mr. Zhou,

457
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:09,979
the low ratings for this episode

458
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:10,979
are my responsibility.

459
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,539
I tried communicating

460
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,739
with the host about the guests.

461
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,140
But she...

462
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,820
Could you please

463
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,779
talk to her?

464
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,539
Xu,

465
00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:23,420
I know it's challenging.

466
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,860
But a successful show

467
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,940
requires great teamwork.

468
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,140
As the planner, you need to
consider the bigger picture.

469
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,100
Do you agree?

470
00:22:32,459 --> 00:22:33,699
Found a guest for next week?

471
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,180
Yes.

472
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,259
We're contacting Mr. Sanmu,

473
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:39,820
founder of Sanmu Art Museum,

474
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:41,459
to appear on our show.

475
00:22:43,699 --> 00:22:44,420
He said he'd come?

476
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,380
He's interested

477
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,699
and has to check

478
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,539
his schedule.

479
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:49,739
So it's not confirmed yet.

480
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,259
Xu Yan,

481
00:22:51,979 --> 00:22:53,299
you've worked here long enough.

482
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,860
You should know

483
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,140
that as the planner of the Family Feast,

484
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,180
your job is to make a great show

485
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,059
and invite popular guests.

486
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:05,019
Don't rush

487
00:23:05,739 --> 00:23:07,259
to apply to be a host.

488
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,499
Let me remind you.

489
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:13,299
If the ratings keep dropping next week,

490
00:23:15,739 --> 00:23:17,100
management will reconsider

491
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,900
your position here.

492
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,180
Still working?

493
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,340
I haven't secured guests

494
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,420
for the next episode.

495
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:41,180
So, we need backup scripts.

496
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:52,192
(Mr. Sanmu)

497
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,019
I've been reaching out for so long.

498
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,739
Mr. Sanmu is a friend I made in London.

499
00:24:02,219 --> 00:24:03,072
This museum contains

500
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,180
(Sanmu Art Museum)
his private collection.

501
00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:06,259
I've set up a meeting.

502
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,499
He'll contact you.

503
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:09,900
Thank you.

504
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,620
No problem.

505
00:24:11,739 --> 00:24:12,739
Let me note down

506
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:13,660
his phone number.

507
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:20,660
How do you know about my work?

508
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,979
Because I have

509
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,699
my informants there.

510
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,019
Oh.

511
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,820
I meant to ask you.

512
00:24:51,219 --> 00:24:53,580

Hello, sir.

589
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:25,580
I'm here for the interview.

590
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,499
I'm Amy.

591
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,299
Prune and repot that agave.

592
00:29:33,979 --> 00:29:34,580
Got it.

593
00:29:39,499 --> 00:29:40,539
Your resume says

594
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:42,459
you've worked on agaves for ages.

595
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,739
It hasn't been that long.

596
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,459
Compared to you,

597
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:48,420
I'm just a beginner.

598
00:29:48,979 --> 00:29:50,779
Very few girls like agaves.

599
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,660
Why are you interested?

600
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,180
Because of its extraordinary resilience.

601
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,019
It was crafted by Earth

602
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,420
100 million years ago.

603
00:30:09,739 --> 00:30:11,100
They coexisted with dinosaurs,

604
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,180
thriving in rocky terrains,

605
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,059
enduring harsh elements.

606
00:30:15,979 --> 00:30:17,059
Their shape

607
00:30:17,499 --> 00:30:19,580
resembles dragon tongues,

608
00:30:19,739 --> 00:30:20,539
as legends say.

609
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,299
But most importantly,

610
00:30:25,219 --> 00:30:26,380
I can shape them

611
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,499
as I desire.

612
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:40,140
Every plant cultivator

613
00:30:40,779 --> 00:30:42,340
has a unique perspective.

614
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:44,420
Some people prefer

615
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,820
natural growth.

616
00:30:46,739 --> 00:30:47,860
Others, however,

617
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:50,140
favor controlled cultivation.

618
00:30:50,699 --> 00:30:52,180
But my philosophy is

619
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,860
I must shape it into

620
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,140
the form I envision.

621
00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:12,940
So I will use intense lighting

622
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,459
to suppress leaf expansion,

623
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,420
precisely regulate
fertilizer and watering,

624
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,860
and monitor soil and ventilation.

625
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,499
Every minute change

626
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,779
must remain

627
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,140
under my supervision.

628
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:26,580
Only through this

629
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,580
can it achieve its full potential.

630
00:31:29,499 --> 00:31:30,660
Start working tomorrow.

631
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,019
Okay.

632
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,860
But what about your current job

633
00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:42,779
if you come to work here,

634
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,459
Miss Xu?

635
00:31:53,299 --> 00:31:54,180
Miss Xu Yan.

636
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,019
You're very smart.

637
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,259
You're a great show planner

638
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:01,699
and a superb actress.

639
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,459
To approach me,

640
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,940
you studied so much

641
00:32:07,019 --> 00:32:08,100
about agave cultivation

642
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:09,860
and practiced

643
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:11,539
gardening techniques.

644
00:32:12,699 --> 00:32:14,459
And you disguised yourself well.

645
00:32:16,299 --> 00:32:18,539
Judging from your clothing and resume,

646
00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:20,979
average people

647
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:23,499
won't be able to spot the lies.

648
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,459
Unfortunately,

649
00:32:30,259 --> 00:32:31,019
your assistant

650
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:32,420
who's been contacting me

651
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,100
once posted

652
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,180
(Weibo)
your photo on Weibo.

653
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,459
But your philosophy

654
00:32:48,459 --> 00:32:49,299
impressed me.

655
00:32:50,499 --> 00:32:51,459
I stand by what I said.

656
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,100
No interviews.

657
00:32:55,259 --> 00:32:56,059
You may leave now.

658
00:33:02,059 --> 00:33:03,539
I'm sorry, Mr. Shen.

659
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,660
This isn't

660
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,059
how I wanted to make your acquaintance.

661
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,259
I respect

662
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,860
your decision

663
00:33:16,499 --> 00:33:17,660
regarding the interview.

664
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,820
However,

665
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,420
I did prepare a gift

666
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:24,620
for you.

667
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,420
It's a pruning shear crafted

668
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,299
by Mr. Yiding,

669
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,739
the renowned botanist.

670
00:33:35,459 --> 00:33:36,580
I believe

671
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,059
you will like this.

672
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,059
Miss,

673
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:42,580
you've come many times.

674
00:33:42,699 --> 00:33:44,459
Haven't you found anything you like?

675
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:47,180
Let me look around.

676
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,219
I'm indecisive.

677
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:49,059
No rush.

678
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:49,940
Take your time.

679
00:33:49,979 --> 00:33:50,979
Tell me if you need me.

680
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:51,499
Thanks.

681
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,739
Careful there.

682
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,459
Take this to the back.

683
00:34:00,259 --> 00:34:00,860
That...

684
00:34:02,219 --> 00:34:02,860
Let me help you.

685
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,420
Yeah.

686
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:03,779
Here.

687
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,820
If I lose this,

688
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,580
I'd get fired.

689
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,340
It's so valuable?

690
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,580
It's my boss's personal garden fork,

691
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,016
crafted by Mr. Yiding.

692
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,140
It's precious.

693
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,380
Seems you've thoroughly

694
00:34:28,059 --> 00:34:29,340
researched my preferences.

695
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,659
However,

696
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:33,220
it's quite pointless.

697
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,979
That's not true.

698
00:34:36,979 --> 00:34:39,340
You found this limited-edition.

699
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,820
It shows your dedication.

700
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,340
I have something for you too.

701
00:34:50,499 --> 00:34:51,700
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

702
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,659
Open it.

703
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,499
Is it a coincidence?

704
00:35:04,979 --> 00:35:05,780
Of course not.

705
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,380
Every move I made

706
00:35:18,139 --> 00:35:20,139
was under your surveillance.

707
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,260
A pretty lady like you

708
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,340
visits my shop so often.

709
00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:25,979
How could I not notice you?

710
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,420
I thought I was being subtle.

711
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:33,139
So you knew it all along.

712
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:38,579
You enjoy taking the initiative, right?

713
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,420
I've read your articles online.

714
00:35:44,979 --> 00:35:46,420
"My grandma's eyesight was failing,

715
00:35:47,059 --> 00:35:48,059
but she collected

716
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,979
osmanthus flowers early in the morning.

717
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,900
I would come home from school

718
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:54,619
and see her

719
00:35:55,139 --> 00:35:57,619
through the window.

720
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,940
(Wearing reading glasses,)

721
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,139
(she was baking the petals.)

722
00:36:05,619 --> 00:36:06,579
(She told me that)

723
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:09,499
(the osmanthus jam won't be sweet)

724
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:11,900
(if we miss the blooming season.)

725
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,300
(If your grandmother)

726
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:18,340
(had also made osmanthus jam for you,)

727
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,300
I don't believe

728
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,780
you could be filled with loneliness."

729
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,979
Your writing is full of emotion.

730
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,940
It deeply moved me.

731
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,740
I believe

732
00:36:39,459 --> 00:36:41,139
you love osmanthus jam very much.

733
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,220
What?

734
00:36:55,659 --> 00:36:56,900
He recognized you.

735
00:36:58,539 --> 00:36:59,860
Did he give you a hard time?

736
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:02,820
Not exactly.

737
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:06,300
But he still refused the interview.

738
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:08,820
What a stubborn guy.

739
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:13,260
Let's not judge him.

740
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,820
Maybe

741
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,059
he has his reasons.

742
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:17,940
Or...

743
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:18,940
