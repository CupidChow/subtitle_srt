I liked you

30
00:02:10,003 --> 00:02:11,162
and trusted you so much.

31
00:02:15,808 --> 00:02:17,760
How could you have been lying
to us for so long?

32
00:02:18,923 --> 00:02:19,802
I'm sorry, Mom.

33
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:25,042
I'll take all the consequences.

34
00:02:28,843 --> 00:02:30,442
If this gets out,

35
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:31,683
it'll affect Haoming

36
00:02:31,683 --> 00:02:33,042
and the company's reputation.

37
00:02:34,162 --> 00:02:35,403
You can't handle the result.

38
00:02:36,642 --> 00:02:38,243
I'll comply with your wishes.

39
00:02:38,882 --> 00:02:40,642
I won't make any excuses.

40
00:02:43,442 --> 00:02:44,322
I'm sorry, Dad.

41
00:02:45,202 --> 00:02:47,003
I know apologies aren't enough

42
00:02:47,283 --> 00:02:48,882
to make up for my mistakes.

43
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:51,602
I'll bear all legal responsibilities.

44
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:53,602
Now,

45
00:02:55,602 --> 00:02:57,442
the New District project
is just starting.

46
00:02:57,683 --> 00:02:58,843
It's the most critical phase.

47
00:02:59,283 --> 00:03:00,123
As for how you two

48
00:03:00,243 --> 00:03:01,642
handle personal matters,

49
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:02,922
I won't interfere.

50
00:03:03,123 --> 00:03:04,482
But you must understand this:

51
00:03:05,963 --> 00:03:07,162
it absolutely cannot affect

52
00:03:07,162 --> 00:03:09,003
the company's prestige and reputation.

53
00:03:09,283 --> 00:03:09,922
I understand.

54
00:03:11,803 --> 00:03:14,482
Until the paperwork is finalized,

55
00:03:14,722 --> 00:03:16,523
I'll publicly claim
I'm starting a business.

56
00:03:25,722 --> 00:03:26,283
Mom, Dad,

57
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:30,283
if Haochen returns and asks about me,

58
00:03:31,803 --> 00:03:33,922
just say I'm too busy to come back.

59
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:40,243
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:52,803 --> 00:03:53,442

What brings you out today, Haoming?

78
00:05:09,202 --> 00:05:11,563
I mainly wanted to update you on work.

79
00:05:12,882 --> 00:05:13,923
Don't mention that.

80
00:05:14,563 --> 00:05:15,642
Our New District project

81
00:05:15,642 --> 00:05:16,723
is progressing smoothly.

82
00:05:17,003 --> 00:05:19,282
The planning permit
has been officially approved.

83
00:05:20,163 --> 00:05:21,163

84
00:05:21,282 --> 00:05:22,762
I have no worries at all.

85
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:25,322
Haoming,

86
00:05:27,123 --> 00:05:28,202
there's a personal matter

87
00:05:28,563 --> 00:05:30,003
that I'm hesitant to ask about.

88
00:05:31,282 --> 00:05:31,842
Go ahead.

89
00:05:32,522 --> 00:05:33,243
Lately,

90
00:05:33,483 --> 00:05:34,923
I've heard some rumors

91
00:05:35,363 --> 00:05:37,202
about your wife, Xu Yan, resigning.

92
00:05:38,043 --> 00:05:39,043
What's going on?

93
00:05:40,363 --> 00:05:41,683
She's starting her own business.

94
00:05:45,603 --> 00:05:47,483
There are things you might not know.

95
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:49,123
Even now,

96
00:05:49,402 --> 00:05:51,522
Xu Yan regularly
visits my mother-in-law.

97
00:05:52,123 --> 00:05:53,762
Every time my mother-in-law sees her,

98
00:05:53,762 --> 00:05:55,603
she's overjoyed.

99
00:05:56,642 --> 00:05:57,803
I always thought

100
00:05:58,003 --> 00:05:59,923
once we established cooperation,

101
00:06:00,762 --> 00:06:03,123
she'd stop putting effort into her.

102
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:08,282
I didn't expect
she'd be truly remarkable.

103
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:12,123
You two are well-matched.

104
00:06:12,683 --> 00:06:14,842
I can see that as family,

105
00:06:15,163 --> 00:06:16,563
she genuinely cares for you.

106
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:19,723
Thank you.

107
00:06:20,483 --> 00:06:22,243
Forgive my bluntness.

108
00:06:42,762 --> 00:06:44,243
(You're a typical boss.)

109
00:06:44,683 --> 00:06:46,003
Your expression of emotions

110
00:06:46,003 --> 00:06:47,040
has become transactional.

111
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:48,962
I just want to give you

112
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:50,842
the life you want.

113
00:06:51,402 --> 00:06:52,923
You are all I want.

114
00:06:54,522 --> 00:06:56,723
Convincing them wasn't easy.

115
00:06:57,243 --> 00:06:59,363
Luckily, I have a capable wife.

116
00:06:59,842 --> 00:07:01,202
This deal couldn't have been done

117
00:07:01,603 --> 00:07:02,522
without you.

118
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:04,402
Are you okay?

119
00:07:23,522 --> 00:07:25,842
Hello?

120
00:07:26,163 --> 00:07:26,522
Hello.

121
00:07:26,522 --> 00:07:28,202
I called earlier.

122
00:07:28,202 --> 00:07:29,202
It's over half an hour.

123
00:07:29,202 --> 00:07:30,642
When will you come to fix the pipe?

124
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:32,762
Soon. I've sent someone.

125
00:07:33,762 --> 00:07:35,363
Give me a specific time.

126
00:07:37,043 --> 00:07:37,803
I'll hurry.

127
00:07:56,803 --> 00:07:57,642
So fast?

128
00:07:59,402 --> 00:08:01,282
Coming. Please...

129
00:08:06,043 --> 00:08:07,363
Wh-Why are you here?

130
00:08:08,402 --> 00:08:08,962
I...

131
00:08:10,762 --> 00:08:11,723
What are you...

132
00:08:14,442 --> 00:08:16,803
Maybe we should wait for maintenance.

133
00:08:17,723 --> 00:08:18,603
Take a break.

134
00:08:18,842 --> 00:08:20,442
Done. Try it now.

135
00:08:21,003 --> 00:08:21,762
Turn on the tap.

136
00:08:22,762 --> 00:08:23,282
Well?

137
00:08:23,882 --> 00:08:25,123
Turn it off! Turn it off now!

138
00:08:26,163 --> 00:08:27,363
Hand me that tape.

139
00:08:28,003 --> 00:08:29,043
T-Tape?

140
00:08:29,123 --> 00:08:30,282
Use paper towels to wipe it.

141
00:08:31,243 --> 00:08:31,842
How much?

142
00:08:32,282 --> 00:08:33,202
It's okay. I can do it.

143
00:08:33,603 --> 00:08:34,043
Okay.

144
00:08:34,163 --> 00:08:34,962
Thanks.

145
00:08:35,003 --> 00:08:35,642
No problem.

146
00:08:37,723 --> 00:08:38,163
Done.

147
00:08:38,962 --> 00:08:39,683
Are you sure?

148
00:08:40,322 --> 00:08:41,003
Step back a bit.

149
00:08:41,003 --> 00:08:42,522
I'm turning the water on. Be careful.

150
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:48,843
Fixed, right?

151
00:08:49,922 --> 00:08:51,003
Thank you.

152
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:52,243
Thank you.

153
00:08:53,042 --> 00:08:53,843
It was nothing.

154
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:55,882
You should go wash up now.

155
00:08:55,922 --> 00:08:56,603
Just go.

156
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:57,723
I already washed down there.

157
00:08:58,323 --> 00:08:59,282
Then dry yourself off.

158
00:08:59,282 --> 00:08:59,642
Okay.

159
00:08:59,682 --> 00:09:00,603
I made you some tea.

160
00:09:00,642 --> 00:09:02,522
Come out and drink some warm tea first.

161
00:09:04,282 --> 00:09:05,203
Have a seat.

162
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,723
Here. Drink some tea.

163
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:10,443
Thank you.

164
00:09:14,723 --> 00:09:15,123
Here.

165
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,243
Thanks.

166
00:09:19,003 --> 00:09:19,723
Don't mention it.

167
00:09:20,682 --> 00:09:22,682
You moved out without telling anyone.

168
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:24,963
I asked your assistant to find out.

169
00:09:25,843 --> 00:09:27,042
You have your sister,

170
00:09:27,616 --> 00:09:29,344
and me, your fellow townsman
and classmate.

171
00:09:29,562 --> 00:09:31,042
You can share your troubles with us.

172
00:09:31,723 --> 00:09:33,083
We can help you find solutions.

173
00:09:34,162 --> 00:09:35,762
Be it work or personal issues.

174
00:09:36,522 --> 00:09:37,922
They are all minor issues.

175
00:09:37,963 --> 00:09:38,922
I can handle them.

176
00:09:40,123 --> 00:09:42,042
Besides, everyone has
their own life path.

177
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:43,162
I can't trouble you guys

178
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:44,203
with every little thing.

179
00:09:46,123 --> 00:09:47,443
You're always so formal with me.

180
00:09:52,203 --> 00:09:53,243
How's the job hunt going?

181
00:09:53,522 --> 00:09:54,123
Any progress?

182
00:09:54,843 --> 00:09:56,123
I haven't started looking yet.

183
00:09:58,162 --> 00:09:58,723
Right.

184
00:09:59,483 --> 00:10:00,922
Jobs are scarce these days.

185
00:10:01,762 --> 00:10:02,922
But don't stress about it.

186
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,603
Take this time to relax
and get organized.

187
00:10:14,003 --> 00:10:15,762
When we have time, your sister and I

188
00:10:16,762 --> 00:10:18,243
will cook you some home-style dishes.

189
00:10:19,762 --> 00:10:22,243
Eating instant noodles
and frozen dumplings every day

190
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:23,762
isn't healthy.

191
00:10:25,603 --> 00:10:29,083
You've been busy in the hospital,

192
00:10:29,323 --> 00:10:30,882
and you need to take care of Qiao Lin.

193
00:10:32,402 --> 00:10:34,003
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

194
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,042
I can handle anything. Really.

195
00:10:38,802 --> 00:10:39,402
Xu Yan,

196
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:44,843
actually, I came today
because I wanted to...

197
00:10:44,843 --> 00:10:45,402
Yiming,

198
00:10:48,963 --> 00:10:50,843
I know you used to like me.

199
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,802
But in my heart, I've always seen you

200
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:54,682
as a fellow townsman and classmate.

201
00:10:55,243 --> 00:10:56,483
Nothing more. Okay?

202
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:57,762
You're misunderstanding.

203
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:00,483
Yes.

204
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:02,323
I had feelings for you.

205
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,123
And I confessed to you.

206
00:11:04,922 --> 00:11:06,323
It's my most innocent

207
00:11:06,323 --> 00:11:07,642
and beautiful memory from 18.

208
00:11:08,003 --> 00:11:09,282
Besides, it's been so long now.

209
00:11:10,243 --> 00:11:11,083
I've moved on.

210
00:11:12,323 --> 00:11:14,042
No matter what happens,

211
00:11:14,402 --> 00:11:15,123
if you're in need,

212
00:11:15,802 --> 00:11:16,522
I'll help you,

213
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:17,282
no reason needed.

214
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,083
Just like today, I'm just here
to check on you.

215
00:11:20,843 --> 00:11:22,042
So don't feel burdened.

216
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:23,882
If you need anything,

217
00:11:24,402 --> 00:11:26,042
just tell me or your sister.

218
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:26,922
It's the same.

219
00:11:28,603 --> 00:11:29,963
After all, your sister and I...

220
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,203
Qiao Lin...

221
00:11:38,922 --> 00:11:41,323
Qiao Lin is actually wonderful.

222
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:46,363
Behave well.

223
00:11:48,003 --> 00:11:49,963
I'll dry my clothes and leave now.

224
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,042
Well,

225
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:52,363
the hairdryer's in the bathroom.

226
00:12:18,243 --> 00:12:18,723
What...

227
00:12:20,123 --> 00:12:20,963
What brings you here?

228
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:24,123
Divorce Supplementary Agreement.

229
00:12:24,562 --> 00:12:25,243
(Divorce Supplementary Agreement)
Here you are.

230
00:12:28,723 --> 00:12:29,443
Got it.

231
00:12:31,203 --> 00:12:32,723
I'll have it delivered after signing.

232
00:12:40,162 --> 00:12:41,282
Since I'm free today,

233
00:12:42,203 --> 00:12:43,802
let's go through each clause.

234
00:12:51,723 --> 00:12:52,922
- You have a visitor?
- Yes.

235
00:12:54,802 --> 00:12:55,402
May I start?

236
00:12:57,922 --> 00:12:58,922
Sure.

237
00:13:02,162 --> 00:13:03,162
Let's review each clause.

238
00:13:03,522 --> 00:13:04,642
Any additions you want?

239
00:13:05,682 --> 00:13:06,363
No rush.

240
00:13:07,123 --> 00:13:07,802
Take the time.

241
00:13:16,443 --> 00:13:17,562
Xu Yan, I'm done drying.

242
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:24,882
And this is?

243
00:13:25,963 --> 00:13:27,723
My high school classmate, Yu Yiming.

244
00:13:33,762 --> 00:13:34,483
Shen Haoming.

245
00:13:36,203 --> 00:13:37,243
So he's your...

246
00:13:37,603 --> 00:13:38,162
Husband.

247
00:13:39,642 --> 00:13:40,162
Hello.

248
00:13:41,203 --> 00:13:41,723
Hello.

249
00:13:42,802 --> 00:13:43,922
I'll leave you two alone.

250
00:13:44,003 --> 00:13:45,402
I'll head back now.

251
00:13:45,802 --> 00:13:46,922
- I'll walk you out.
- No need.

252
00:13:48,282 --> 00:13:48,843
Thanks.

253
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:49,642
My pleasure.

254
00:13:49,723 --> 00:13:50,162
Take care.

255
00:13:51,203 --> 00:13:52,203
Thanks, Yiming.

256
00:13:52,402 --> 00:13:52,882
Anytime.

257
00:13:58,682 --> 00:13:59,562
Shall we start?

258
00:14:00,922 --> 00:14:03,042
There's a clause
in the supplementary agreement:

259
00:14:03,723 --> 00:14:05,042
even if we do divorce,

260
00:14:05,443 --> 00:14:06,723
you need my approval

261
00:14:07,162 --> 00:14:08,762
before making any public announcements.

262
00:14:09,922 --> 00:14:11,402
Considering my company's reputation,

263
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,562
mind your words and actions.

264
00:14:16,443 --> 00:14:18,123
Have I been inappropriate?

265
00:14:18,802 --> 00:14:19,363
No.

266
00:14:20,162 --> 00:14:21,483
I know Yu Yiming

267
00:14:21,682 --> 00:14:23,003
is your sister's boyfriend.

268
00:14:29,882 --> 00:14:31,323
You shouldn't be in business.

269
00:14:32,443 --> 00:14:34,003
You should be a spy.

270
00:14:35,123 --> 00:14:36,562
Just friendly advice.

271
00:14:37,363 --> 00:14:38,363
Let me remind you too:

272
00:14:39,642 --> 00:14:42,882
Tomorrow's the 8th.
See you at the Civil Affairs Bureau.

273
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:43,562
Fine.

274
00:14:45,762 --> 00:14:46,723
And I'll remind you:

275
00:14:47,882 --> 00:14:48,723
Sign this.

You don't know?

Agreement divorces now

280
00:14:58,162 --> 00:14:59,402
have a cooling-off period.

281
00:14:59,603 --> 00:15:00,562
As the name suggests,

282
00:15:00,562 --> 00:15:01,603
it gives couples time

283
00:15:01,642 --> 00:15:04,003
to reconsider it
and avoid rash decisions.

284
00:15:04,483 --> 00:15:05,723
Your divorce application

285
00:15:05,723 --> 00:15:06,762
will be processed first.

286
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:08,562
Your cooling-off period lasts a month.

287
00:15:08,723 --> 00:15:09,402
During this time,

288
00:15:09,522 --> 00:15:11,042
if you cancel the divorce,

289
00:15:11,483 --> 00:15:12,483
don't come back.

290
00:15:12,522 --> 00:15:13,922
The application will be revoked.

291
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,882
If you still can't reconcile,

292
00:15:15,922 --> 00:15:16,723
return then.

293
00:15:17,642 --> 00:15:18,323
Next couple.

294
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,282
I'm done.

295
00:15:38,483 --> 00:15:39,522
This tastes awful.

296
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,723
What's wrong? Why the sudden temper?

297
00:15:43,323 --> 00:15:46,162
Aren't these all your usual favorites?

298
00:15:46,443 --> 00:15:48,483
I want my sis-in-law's
Longjing Tea Shrimp.

299
00:15:51,363 --> 00:15:52,448
She's starting a business

300
00:15:52,642 --> 00:15:53,802
and works long hours daily.

301
00:15:54,243 --> 00:15:55,483
She can't cook for you.

302
00:15:56,483 --> 00:15:58,522
Can't she live here
while building her business?

303
00:15:59,203 --> 00:16:00,682
You must have upset her

304
00:16:00,682 --> 00:16:01,562
and won't admit it.

305
00:16:01,642 --> 00:16:02,443
Haochen.

306
00:16:05,443 --> 00:16:06,963
Mind your tone with your brother.

307
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:18,363
What's wrong now?

308
00:16:19,843 --> 00:16:20,642
Have more fish.

309
00:16:20,922 --> 00:16:22,762
You love steamed fish, don't you?

310
00:16:24,323 --> 00:16:25,323
My fault.

311
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:27,483
Ms. Yu prefers Yan's steamed fish.

312
00:16:27,603 --> 00:16:29,443
I never get the technique right.

313
00:16:29,562 --> 00:16:30,642
The flavor's not the same.

314
00:16:31,483 --> 00:16:32,483
It's fine. It's good.

(People say)

317
00:18:03,842 --> 00:18:07,443
a happy childhood
can heal you for a lifetime.

318
00:18:09,883 --> 00:18:11,042
But an unhappy one

319
00:18:14,322 --> 00:18:15,683
takes a lifetime to heal.

320
00:18:20,963 --> 00:18:22,042
That's why I believe

321
00:18:23,122 --> 00:18:24,963
no material comforts

322
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:28,723
can replace family love and presence.

323
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:31,963
Haochen's too young.

324
00:18:34,122 --> 00:18:36,883
Can't we ask your parents to reconsider?

(Xu Yan's Resume)
Gezi,

326
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:50,362
I'm willing to reduce my salary by 20%,

327
00:18:50,432 --> 00:18:52,128
the probation period
can be negotiated too,

328
00:18:52,322 --> 00:18:54,368
and I'll follow your scheduling
for show timeslots.

329
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,122
Just give me a chance,

330
00:18:56,362 --> 00:18:58,282
and I'll prove myself worthy.

331
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,042
Xu, I'm truly sorry,

332
00:19:01,483 --> 00:19:03,322
but we don't have
suitable jobs for you now.

333
00:19:04,762 --> 00:19:05,802
You know that

334
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:07,203
the positions are all occupied.

335
00:19:07,483 --> 00:19:09,203
Unless someone quits,
takes medical leave,

336
00:19:09,203 --> 00:19:10,443
or has other emergencies,

337
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,762
our lead hosts
could stay until retirement.

338
00:19:13,122 --> 00:19:15,602
Once you are out of the structure,

339
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:18,762
it's hard to get another opportunity.

340
00:19:23,122 --> 00:19:23,923
Thank you.

341
00:19:35,643 --> 00:19:36,842

342
00:19:37,562 --> 00:19:38,282
Alright.

343
00:19:38,602 --> 00:19:39,403
Let's begin.

regarding board election

346
00:19:45,203 --> 00:19:46,522
states that to ensure validity,

347
00:19:46,802 --> 00:19:48,322
over 90% of board members

348
00:19:48,362 --> 00:19:49,802
must attend.

349
00:19:50,003 --> 00:19:52,802
Those absent will be
considered abstentions.

350
00:19:53,203 --> 00:19:55,163
We have 13 present members

351
00:19:55,322 --> 00:19:56,243
and 1 absence,

352
00:19:56,322 --> 00:19:57,403
meeting the requirements.

353
00:19:57,643 --> 00:19:58,562
The election is valid.

354
00:19:59,362 --> 00:20:01,282
Now we'll vote on Shen Haoming's

355
00:20:01,282 --> 00:20:04,082
admission to the board.

356

six in favor and six against.

Shen Haoming's wife quit her job

369
00:20:54,403 --> 00:20:56,802
and moved out.

374
00:21:05,322 --> 00:21:07,562
he was wild in England,

375
00:21:08,243 --> 00:21:09,883
living a messy personal life

376
00:21:10,122 --> 00:21:12,003

377
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:15,122

That board seat isn't meant for him.

379
00:21:20,602 --> 00:21:21,963
As you know,

380
00:21:22,362 --> 00:21:26,203
he's the heir backed by his father.

381
00:21:27,042 --> 00:21:28,243
What can we say?

382
00:21:28,522 --> 00:21:30,562
We built Jinda Group together

383
00:21:30,562 --> 00:21:31,762
for years.

384
00:21:32,243 --> 00:21:34,042
We can't let his father dictate all.

385
00:21:34,322 --> 00:21:35,443
(Anyway, at the meeting,)

386
00:21:35,562 --> 00:21:36,403
(I'll object.)

387
00:21:38,483 --> 00:21:39,163
I object.

388
00:21:40,443 --> 00:21:42,282
Seven against, six in favor.

389
00:21:45,562 --> 00:21:47,562
Shen Haoming fails to join the board.

390
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:49,243
Alright.

391
00:21:49,362 --> 00:21:50,203
Meeting adjourned.

392
00:21:57,802 --> 00:21:59,362
I thought we had an agreement.

393
00:21:59,683 --> 00:22:01,163
I'd resolve the company crisis

394
00:22:01,522 --> 00:22:02,923
and develop new projects

395
00:22:03,403 --> 00:22:04,723
for a board seat.

396
00:22:06,082 --> 00:22:06,522
Yes,

397
00:22:08,163 --> 00:22:10,042
but I reconsidered.

398
00:22:11,003 --> 00:22:11,762
You're unfit.

399
00:22:12,403 --> 00:22:13,122
Reasons?

400
00:22:13,883 --> 00:22:15,282
I question your self-control,

401
00:22:15,362 --> 00:22:17,802
decision-making skills, and maturity.

402
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,282
Are you bringing that up again?

403
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:21,483
Have a seat.

404
00:22:24,122 --> 00:22:24,923
Sit down.

405
00:22:29,243 --> 00:22:29,762
Haoming,

406
00:22:30,403 --> 00:22:31,163
you need to know

407
00:22:31,923 --> 00:22:33,602
that since childhood,

408
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:34,562
you've always been

409
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:35,562
a good kid in my eyes

410
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,883
who excelled in studies.

411
00:22:37,003 --> 00:22:38,842
That's why I gave you freedom

412
00:22:39,322 --> 00:22:40,362
and space.

413
00:22:40,362 --> 00:22:41,403
I had you study abroad.

414
00:22:43,082 --> 00:22:43,802
At nineteen,

415
00:22:44,522 --> 00:22:46,403
life was just beginning.

416
00:22:46,403 --> 00:22:47,643
Dating was fine.

417
00:22:47,683 --> 00:22:49,122
You were free to date girls.

418
00:22:49,282 --> 00:22:50,883
Why did you insist on keeping that baby?

419
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,643
Did you even listen

420
00:22:52,723 --> 00:22:54,122
to your mom and my advice?

421
00:22:54,522 --> 00:22:55,322
Did you consider

422
00:22:55,403 --> 00:22:56,802
what future that child would have?

423
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,163
Did you consider your own future?

424
00:22:59,403 --> 00:23:00,203
Did you consider

425
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:02,122
it could stain your reputation?

426
00:23:02,122 --> 00:23:03,723
I never saw Haochen's birth as a stain.

427
00:23:03,723 --> 00:23:04,602
How is it not?

428
00:23:08,163 --> 00:23:10,602
We've been covering this up
for you all along.

429
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:12,042
If your rivals find out,

430
00:23:12,322 --> 00:23:14,042
if your competitors learn about this,

431
00:23:14,322 --> 00:23:15,483
they'll exploit it

432
00:23:15,643 --> 00:23:17,723
and destroy you. Understand?

433
00:23:18,602 --> 00:23:19,963
If they see you

434
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:22,322
as a reckless playboy,

435
00:23:22,362 --> 00:23:25,082
irresponsible and impulsive,

436
00:23:26,082 --> 00:23:27,282
who'd trust you?

437
00:23:27,562 --> 00:23:28,683
Would the board

438
00:23:29,122 --> 00:23:30,403
or the shareholders believe you?

439
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:31,362
Never.

440
00:23:31,683 --> 00:23:32,602
As for your marriage,

441
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,443
we let you make the decision

442
00:23:36,042 --> 00:23:37,802
and choose your own wife.

443
00:23:38,403 --> 00:23:39,562
But what did you do?

444
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:41,762
You picked a fraud.

445
00:23:42,883 --> 00:23:44,483
Her background,

446
00:23:44,483 --> 00:23:45,923
education, life history,

447
00:23:45,923 --> 00:23:48,282
you knew everything about her,

448
00:23:48,643 --> 00:23:50,122
yet you hid the truth.

449
00:23:50,683 --> 00:23:51,883
You lied to us.

450
00:23:52,842 --> 00:23:54,723
I can't tolerate this.
Do you understand?

451
00:23:57,362 --> 00:23:58,802
Lying was my mistake.

452
00:24:00,602 --> 00:24:02,163
But between Xu Yan and me,

453
00:24:02,762 --> 00:24:04,322
our relationship was equal.

454
00:24:05,562 --> 00:24:07,003
I accepted everything about her.

455
00:24:07,003 --> 00:24:08,483
We wouldn't have divorced

456
00:24:08,483 --> 00:24:09,322
if she hadn't asked.

457
00:24:09,403 --> 00:24:11,562
She quit her news anchor career

458
00:24:11,762 --> 00:24:13,322
and caused quite a stir.

459
00:24:14,403 --> 00:24:15,443
No more excuses.

460
00:24:16,443 --> 00:24:17,403
Go to Cheng'an County.

461
00:24:17,842 --> 00:24:20,762
Handle the delayed project
at our branch there.

462
00:24:21,762 --> 00:24:22,963
Resolve it before you return.

463
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:31,443
Mr. Shen,

464
00:24:32,602 --> 00:24:34,243
are you sure you don't want me with you?

465
00:24:36,122 --> 00:24:37,762
The email specified

466
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,403
that only I will be transferred.

467
00:24:40,963 --> 00:24:43,282
Taking you violates company policy.

468
00:24:43,522 --> 00:24:45,602
But that branch is
in such a remote area.

469
00:24:46,082 --> 00:24:47,683
I worry about you going alone.

470
00:24:50,403 --> 00:24:51,443
You'll be more useful

471
00:24:51,842 --> 00:24:53,042
staying at the headquarters.

472
00:24:53,643 --> 00:24:54,883
If anything happens,

473
00:24:55,362 --> 00:24:56,403
keep me informed.

474
00:24:59,562 --> 00:25:00,122
I'm leaving.

475
00:25:00,122 --> 00:25:02,443
(Mailbox: Interview Rejected)

476
00:25:02,443 --> 00:25:04,163
If no positions open up...

477
00:25:06,003 --> 00:25:06,443
Alright.

478
00:25:07,443 --> 00:25:08,802
If new opportunities arise,

479
00:25:09,003 --> 00:25:10,842
please notify me.

480
00:25:12,403 --> 00:25:13,122
Okay, thanks.

481
00:25:25,114 --> 00:25:28,416
(Makeup Artist Liao's Call)

482
00:25:29,122 --> 00:25:29,963
Hello, Liao?

483
00:25:29,963 --> 00:25:30,643
Any news?

484
00:25:31,842 --> 00:25:32,643
Good news.

485
00:25:37,883 --> 00:25:40,082
What's wrong with you people?

486
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,243
I told you to recruit hosts,

487
00:25:42,322 --> 00:25:43,282
but after all this time,

488
00:25:43,322 --> 00:25:44,883
you've found none.

489
00:25:45,522 --> 00:25:46,082
Mr. Qiu,

490
00:25:46,082 --> 00:25:47,243
you know our challenges here:

491
00:25:47,483 --> 00:25:49,163
other hosts complain about

492
00:25:49,163 --> 00:25:50,203
low profit sharing

493
00:25:50,243 --> 00:25:51,403
or our schedule demands...

494
00:25:51,403 --> 00:25:52,522
Alright, cut that.

495
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:53,522
All nonsense.

496
00:25:54,403 --> 00:25:55,003
Mr. Qiu.

497
00:25:55,923 --> 00:25:57,122
This is Xu Yan.

498
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:59,243
The hottest anchor

499
00:25:59,243 --> 00:26:00,483
I mentioned to you before.

500
00:26:01,203 --> 00:26:02,923
You've seen Family Feast, right?

501
00:26:03,243 --> 00:26:05,282
She even hosted financial news before.

502
00:26:11,842 --> 00:26:12,483
Glad to see you.

503
00:26:14,483 --> 00:26:15,562
Hello, Mr. Qiu.

504
00:26:16,762 --> 00:26:17,963
I'm terribly sorry

505
00:26:18,003 --> 00:26:19,802
for bringing you in
for the sudden audition.

506
00:26:19,883 --> 00:26:20,522
Not at all.

507
00:26:21,003 --> 00:26:22,282
Thank you for the opportunity.

508
00:26:22,483 --> 00:26:23,282
Thank you, Liao.

509
00:26:25,003 --> 00:26:25,802
You read the script?

510
00:26:26,163 --> 00:26:26,842
Yes.

511
00:26:27,883 --> 00:26:29,003
But, Mr. Qiu,

512
00:26:29,522 --> 00:26:31,282
I adjusted it

513
00:26:31,282 --> 00:26:32,403
based on my interpretation.

514
00:26:32,522 --> 00:26:33,522
Would that be acceptable?

515
00:26:33,723 --> 00:26:35,762
No need to check. It's excellent.

516
00:26:36,282 --> 00:26:37,483
Actually, every host

517
00:26:37,643 --> 00:26:39,042
needs their own distinctive style.

518
00:26:39,562 --> 00:26:40,762
Shall we do the audition now?

519
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:42,282
No problem.

520
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:44,322
Hello, audience.

521
00:26:44,683 --> 00:26:46,122

00:26:51,163 --> 00:26:52,483
has earned worldwide fame

525
00:26:52,483 --> 00:26:53,963

This 100% cotton bedding set

533
00:27:07,203 --> 00:27:08,362

537
00:27:15,362 --> 00:27:15,842
Stop.

538
00:27:19,602 --> 00:27:20,362
Ms. Xu,

539
00:27:20,683 --> 00:27:22,723
are you reporting news
or selling products?

540
00:27:23,203 --> 00:27:24,762
This won't work.

541
00:27:24,762 --> 00:27:26,163
To keep viewers engaged,

542
00:27:26,282 --> 00:27:27,643
you need vocal projection.

543
00:27:27,923 --> 00:27:29,643
You need explosive energy in your words

544
00:27:29,842 --> 00:27:31,362
and make the viewers feel urgent,

545
00:27:31,643 --> 00:27:32,762
like they'll miss out.

546
00:27:33,203 --> 00:27:34,963
Create that vibe that not buying now

547
00:27:34,963 --> 00:27:36,443
means losing a fortune.

548
00:27:36,443 --> 00:27:36,923
Got it?

549
00:27:38,762 --> 00:27:40,003
Got it, Mr. Qiu.

550
00:27:40,322 --> 00:27:41,602
But I believe

551
00:27:41,602 --> 00:27:43,522
my natural strength lies in

552
00:27:44,723 --> 00:27:46,203
a more composed hosting style.

553
00:27:46,562 --> 00:27:47,282
Like...

554
00:27:49,443 --> 00:27:51,562
Professor Wu's lecturing style

555
00:27:51,762 --> 00:27:54,243
or Dr. Chen's lab presentations.

556
00:27:54,602 --> 00:27:56,282
That hosting approach

557
00:27:56,562 --> 00:27:57,923
might suit me better.

558
00:27:58,602 --> 00:27:59,082
True,

559
00:27:59,403 --> 00:28:00,362
those examples you gave

560
00:28:00,362 --> 00:28:02,282
are established star hosts.

561
00:28:02,643 --> 00:28:04,003
You're still new to this.

562
00:28:04,802 --> 00:28:05,923
If you keep this up,

563
00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:09,243
we'll be lucky to get twenty viewers.

564
00:28:10,003 --> 00:28:10,923
I'm sorry.

565
00:28:12,203 --> 00:28:13,122
Alright, I know

566
00:28:13,122 --> 00:28:14,322
you used to be a news anchor.

567
00:28:14,762 --> 00:28:17,163
This is indeed new to you.

568
00:28:17,522 --> 00:28:18,203
Hard to adapt.

569
00:28:18,443 --> 00:28:18,923
Well...

570
00:28:23,483 --> 00:28:24,522
I'll teach you how.

571
00:28:27,883 --> 00:28:28,483
Start!

572
00:28:28,963 --> 00:28:30,122
Break the price floor.

573
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,042
Break the price floor.

574
00:28:40,042 --> 00:28:41,042
There you go. Try harder.

575
00:28:41,163 --> 00:28:41,602
Again.

576
00:28:41,963 --> 00:28:43,282
Break the price floor!

577
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,923
Break the price floor!

578
00:28:46,042 --> 00:28:47,163
Yes, here you go.

579
00:28:47,163 --> 00:28:47,883
Repeat after me.

580
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:50,003
Don't talk like a news anchor!

581
00:28:51,243 --> 00:28:52,842
Don't talk like a news anchor!

582
00:28:53,082 --> 00:28:54,522
Open up a new world!

583
00:28:55,362 --> 00:28:56,762
Open up a new world!

584
00:28:57,163 --> 00:28:58,522
Yes! Maintain that energy.

585
00:28:58,643 --> 00:28:59,522
Follow your script.

586
00:28:59,562 --> 00:29:00,362
Come on.

587
00:29:00,923 --> 00:29:02,042
No 599.

588
00:29:02,522 --> 00:29:03,643
No 499.

589
00:29:03,883 --> 00:29:05,082
No 299!

590
00:29:09,842 --> 00:29:10,883
Sorry, I need a moment.

591
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:13,282
Alright.

592
00:29:14,163 --> 00:29:14,762
Never mind.

593
00:29:14,762 --> 00:29:16,042
I can try again. I'm sorry.

594
00:29:16,562 --> 00:29:17,362
Well, listen.

595
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:19,443
You better sit out
tonight's live stream.

596
00:29:20,362 --> 00:29:22,923
Go back and practice more

597
00:29:23,203 --> 00:29:24,883
what I taught you.

598
00:29:25,963 --> 00:29:26,923
- Well, you...
- Here!

599
00:29:27,163 --> 00:29:28,522
I'll cover tonight's live stream.

600
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,403
- Okay.
- Okay! Mr. Qiu, go!

601
00:29:57,042 --> 00:29:59,003
Welcome, Mr. Shen.

602
00:30:00,243 --> 00:30:02,963
Thank you for picking me up.
Appreciate the effort.

603
00:30:03,042 --> 00:30:04,122
Our pleasure.

604
00:30:04,522 --> 00:30:05,042
Luggage!

605
00:30:06,203 --> 00:30:07,802
Mr. Shen, let me show you around.

606
00:30:07,802 --> 00:30:08,203
Come on.

607
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,683
(General Manager's Office)

608
00:30:12,683 --> 00:30:13,243
Mr. Shen.

609
00:30:13,842 --> 00:30:14,963
This will be your office.

610
00:30:17,522 --> 00:30:18,842
Hongyun is the smallest branch

611
00:30:18,842 --> 00:30:19,802
under Jinda Group.

612
00:30:20,643 --> 00:30:21,963
Our resources here are limited.

613
00:30:22,163 --> 00:30:23,322
Bear the humble facilities.

614
00:30:23,683 --> 00:30:25,122
Mr. Shen, hope you don't mind.

615
00:30:27,643 --> 00:30:28,602
Normally,

616
00:30:28,842 --> 00:30:29,762
you'd stay in a hotel.

617
00:30:30,883 --> 00:30:32,723
But our budget can't cover that expense.

618
00:30:32,883 --> 00:30:34,443
Please stay here for now.

619
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:35,883
It's a bit cramped,

620
00:30:36,163 --> 00:30:38,842
but only managers can enjoy this.

621
00:30:40,082 --> 00:30:42,243
But the restroom is in the yard.

622
00:30:45,082 --> 00:30:45,762
Mr. Zhang.

623
00:30:46,163 --> 00:30:47,322
Please send me

624
00:30:47,403 --> 00:30:48,683
all the related files.

625
00:30:52,403 --> 00:30:53,443
Don't you want to rest?

626
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:54,562
Straight into work now?

627
00:30:56,562 --> 00:30:57,522
When is the earliest

628
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,602
you can send them to me?

629
00:31:00,683 --> 00:31:02,243
They're all here. I've prepared them.

630
00:31:14,003 --> 00:31:16,282
We've already reported
the issues to headquarters.

631
00:31:16,443 --> 00:31:16,923
Mr. Shen.

632
00:31:17,163 --> 00:31:18,602
Let me brief you again.

633
00:31:18,842 --> 00:31:19,683
Here's the thing.

634
00:31:20,322 --> 00:31:21,322
Project delay

635
00:31:21,683 --> 00:31:23,762
is due to material
and labor cost increases.

636
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:26,362
Mr. Wu from Anqiang Construction.

637
00:31:26,483 --> 00:31:27,122
I think

638
00:31:27,443 --> 00:31:28,704
he thought profits were slim,

639
00:31:28,704 --> 00:31:31,842
so secretly borrowed money
claiming it was for project funding.

640
00:31:31,842 --> 00:31:33,683
Then he took the money and fled.

641
00:31:34,203 --> 00:31:35,122
We called the police.

642
00:31:35,163 --> 00:31:36,322
But in a situation like this,

643
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:39,602
even if we catch him,
might still not recover the money.

644
00:31:40,602 --> 00:31:42,282
What's your alternative plan?

645
00:31:42,842 --> 00:31:45,042
I've activated the emergency fund

646
00:31:45,122 --> 00:31:46,362
to maintain daily operations.

647
00:31:46,562 --> 00:31:49,562
And I've applied for budget adjustment.

648
00:31:50,403 --> 00:31:51,602
If construction halts,

649
00:31:51,602 --> 00:31:52,322
fails to deliver,

650
00:31:52,562 --> 00:31:54,203
it would cause greater losses for us.

651
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:58,883
So Mr. Shen,

652
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:02,203
when can we get this budget?

653
00:32:05,203 --> 00:32:07,723
Only after I verify this.

654
00:32:09,203 --> 00:32:10,203
You'd better hurry then.

655
00:32:10,483 --> 00:32:11,883
The emergency fund can't last long.

656
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:17,963
The inspection reports,

657
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:20,384
construction logs,

658
00:32:23,243 --> 00:32:24,683
and building blueprints

659
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:26,562
are all mixed together?

660
00:32:27,163 --> 00:32:28,042
No categorization?

661
00:32:28,483 --> 00:32:30,403
We're broke, Mr. Shen.

662
00:32:30,602 --> 00:32:32,443
We can barely keep
the construction team.

663
00:32:32,562 --> 00:32:34,243
I can't even afford a secretary

664
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:37,082
or an assistant for you.

665
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:40,282
Just let me know

666
00:32:40,282 --> 00:32:41,443
if you need anything.

667
00:32:41,522 --> 00:32:43,243
I'm mostly onsite daily,

668
00:32:43,243 --> 00:32:45,762
but I'll help when possible.

669
00:32:48,003 --> 00:32:49,243
Thank you.

670
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:51,122
Mr. Zhang.

671
00:32:51,643 --> 00:32:52,602
I think we should host

672
00:32:52,602 --> 00:32:54,003
a banquet tonight

673
00:32:54,322 --> 00:32:56,483
to properly welcome Mr. Shen.

674
00:32:56,923 --> 00:32:57,883
No need.

675
00:32:58,683 --> 00:32:59,643
Trying to curry favor?

676
00:33:00,322 --> 00:33:00,842
You?

677
00:33:00,923 --> 00:33:02,403
I...

678
00:33:02,883 --> 00:33:04,282
I'm not fit for that.

679
00:33:05,403 --> 00:33:07,322
Li, I've told you many times

680
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:08,483
(Staff Cafeteria)
not to waste efforts.

681
00:33:10,723 --> 00:33:11,802
I've figured it out.

682
00:33:13,403 --> 00:33:15,483
Chairman Shen didn't even
let him into the board.

683
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:17,362
He's his biological son!

684
00:33:17,602 --> 00:33:18,403
How ruthless!

685
00:33:19,203 --> 00:33:21,483
He came back from abroad,

686
00:33:21,483 --> 00:33:22,562
but kept getting sidelined.

687
00:33:23,522 --> 00:33:24,802
Vice President sounds fancy,

688
00:33:25,163 --> 00:33:26,762
but it's just an empty title.

689
00:33:26,923 --> 00:33:29,122
Think about it.
They transferred him here

690
00:33:29,322 --> 00:33:30,723
without funding or manpower.

691
00:33:31,362 --> 00:33:32,003
For what?

692
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:33,522
Enjoying his life here?

693
00:33:34,282 --> 00:33:35,963
Obviously, he's been discarded,

694
00:33:36,403 --> 00:33:36,963
abandoned.

695
00:33:37,762 --> 00:33:38,923
What if he notices something?

696
00:33:38,923 --> 00:33:39,883
What if?

697
00:33:39,923 --> 00:33:40,923
Notice what?

698
00:33:46,362 --> 00:33:47,403
Look at him.

699
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:49,762
Does he know
construction site intricacies?

700
00:33:50,082 --> 00:33:50,802
Even I don't know.

701
00:33:52,003 --> 00:33:56,322
Plus, even I couldn't stand
such facilities and office setup.

702
00:33:56,322 --> 00:33:57,282
How long can he hold on?

703
00:33:57,362 --> 00:33:58,643

732
00:35:15,522 --> 00:35:17,242
Today I'm recommending

733
00:35:17,403 --> 00:35:19,883

776
00:37:02,722 --> 00:37:04,963
This session focuses on bedding sets.

777
00:37:05,162 --> 00:37:06,363
This session,

778
00:37:06,403 --> 00:37:07,122
(Bedding set poster)
the audience base...

779
00:37:07,122 --> 00:37:07,763
Mr. Qiu.

780
00:37:09,242 --> 00:37:11,202
You're here. How's your practicing?

781
00:37:12,003 --> 00:37:13,602
I think it's okay.

782
00:37:15,202 --> 00:37:16,682
Okay, we still have some time.

783
00:37:16,923 --> 00:37:17,562
Well,

784
00:37:17,562 --> 00:37:18,763
let's try one more time

785
00:37:18,763 --> 00:37:19,682
with Ms. Xu, okay?

786
00:37:19,722 --> 00:37:20,283
- Okay!
- Okay!

787
00:37:20,283 --> 00:37:20,682
Thanks.

788
00:37:20,763 --> 00:37:22,483
Sun, you play the manufacturer.

789
00:37:22,843 --> 00:37:24,122
- Sure, no problem.
- Come on.

790
00:37:24,682 --> 00:37:25,763
Alright, get ready.

791
00:37:32,363 --> 00:37:34,562
Okay, three, two, one.

792
00:37:34,642 --> 00:37:35,323
Start!

793
00:37:36,202 --> 00:37:37,323
Everyone!

794
00:37:37,323 --> 00:37:39,562
Welcome to Xu Yan's live stream!

795
00:37:39,602 --> 00:37:41,363
Today I'm recommending

796
00:37:41,363 --> 00:37:42,803
a hot item that's popular

797
00:37:42,803 --> 00:37:43,722
across all platforms.

798
00:37:43,763 --> 00:37:44,642
Whenever we sell it,

799
00:37:44,722 --> 00:37:45,602
it would sell out!

800
00:37:45,602 --> 00:37:45,963
Right.

801
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:47,483
It's the national brand bedding set.

802
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,923
We are bringing you the item
from the factory today!

803
00:37:50,963 --> 00:37:51,963
We've even invited

804
00:37:51,963 --> 00:37:53,042
the manufacturer, Mr. Wang!

805
00:37:53,283 --> 00:37:54,242
Mr. Wang, please.

806
00:37:54,722 --> 00:37:55,642
Please tell everyone

807
00:37:55,642 --> 00:37:56,722
what offers you'll provide.

808
00:37:56,763 --> 00:37:57,483
It's my first time

809
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:58,722
in Ms. Xu's live stream,

810
00:37:58,763 --> 00:38:00,042
so I'll give all of you

811
00:38:00,042 --> 00:38:00,963
the lowest prices!

812
00:38:01,162 --> 00:38:02,162
The lowest prices!

813
00:38:02,602 --> 00:38:04,363
Here's the quality inspection report?

814
00:38:04,363 --> 00:38:05,443
Inspection report. Right.

815
00:38:05,443 --> 00:38:06,522
Let me show you!

816
00:38:06,763 --> 00:38:08,323
All our products

817
00:38:08,403 --> 00:38:09,323
passed the inspection.

818
00:38:09,323 --> 00:38:09,763
Exactly.

819
00:38:09,803 --> 00:38:11,162
So the quality is guaranteed!

820
00:38:11,242 --> 00:38:11,843
And...

821
00:38:12,003 --> 00:38:13,443
This bedding set

822
00:38:13,642 --> 00:38:15,162
is exclusive to

823
00:38:15,162 --> 00:38:16,082
- five-star hotels!
- Yes!

824
00:38:16,082 --> 00:38:17,003
It achieves

825
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:18,363
waterproof, oil-resistant,

826
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:19,522
and super durable!

827
00:38:19,642 --> 00:38:20,602
Super durable!

828
00:38:20,843 --> 00:38:21,722
As Mr. Wang mentioned,

829
00:38:21,722 --> 00:38:22,562
it's super durable!

830
00:38:22,763 --> 00:38:23,963
But how durable exactly?

831
00:38:24,122 --> 00:38:26,242
I believe you want to know, right?

832
00:38:26,242 --> 00:38:26,682
Right.

833
00:38:26,803 --> 00:38:29,082
Today, right here,

834
00:38:29,122 --> 00:38:30,763
let's test it!

835
00:38:30,763 --> 00:38:31,122
Okay?

836
00:38:31,122 --> 00:38:31,443
Okay!

837
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:33,122
Alright, get me a steel wool!

838
00:38:33,122 --> 00:38:34,722
- Here you go.
- Got it. Thanks.

839
00:38:35,363 --> 00:38:36,403
We'll use this steel wool.

840
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:38,803
It's a real steel wool, see?

841
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:40,162
Let's try scraping it.

842
00:38:40,323 --> 00:38:40,843
Look.

843
00:38:41,843 --> 00:38:44,003
How durable it is!

844
00:38:44,003 --> 00:38:45,283
- Look!
- Super durable!

845
00:38:45,843 --> 00:38:47,082
Camera crew,

846
00:38:47,122 --> 00:38:48,522
please get a close-up!

847
00:38:49,122 --> 00:38:51,763
See? No damage at all.

848
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:53,323
Quality speaks for itself.

849
00:38:53,363 --> 00:38:55,682
For such a five-star product,

850
00:38:55,963 --> 00:38:58,122
our regular price is...

851
00:38:58,443 --> 00:39:01,323
1,999!

852
00:39:01,602 --> 00:39:03,883
But today we're breaking
the price floor!

853
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:04,602
How much?

854
00:39:04,883 --> 00:39:07,082
599, okay?

855
00:39:07,082 --> 00:39:08,803
- Not the price we agreed.
- Mr. Wang, today,

856
00:39:08,803 --> 00:39:10,323
we must offer this price!

857
00:39:10,363 --> 00:39:13,283
It's special for all our viewers!

858
00:39:13,283 --> 00:39:13,642
Exactly!

859
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:13,963
Right?

860
00:39:13,963 --> 00:39:14,323
Exactly.

861
00:39:14,323 --> 00:39:15,363
Backstage team, listen up!

862
00:39:15,443 --> 00:39:17,522
- Attach the link!
- Only 200 sets!

863
00:39:17,562 --> 00:39:19,202

864
00:39:19,202 --> 00:39:20,722

865
00:39:20,883 --> 00:39:21,803
Attach the link!

866
00:39:23,122 --> 00:39:24,682
Don't worry.

00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:26,522
The 200 lucky viewers

868
00:39:26,682 --> 00:39:29,883
will enjoy the 7-day
no-reason return policy.

869
00:39:30,082 --> 00:39:31,122
Even if you don't like it,

870
00:39:31,122 --> 00:39:32,562
contact the customer service...

871
00:39:32,642 --> 00:39:33,923
Stop!

872
00:39:36,003 --> 00:39:36,682
Xu Yan,

873
00:39:37,122 --> 00:39:38,763
is this how you plan to work later?

874
00:39:42,722 --> 00:39:44,122
Any problem, Mr. Qiu?

875
00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:46,682
You can't pitch products like this!

876
00:39:47,042 --> 00:39:48,082
If you don't like it,

877
00:39:48,122 --> 00:39:50,082
you can return within 7 days?

878
00:39:50,642 --> 00:39:51,242
Fine.

879
00:39:51,642 --> 00:39:52,562
They come in and buy,

880
00:39:52,602 --> 00:39:53,443
and then return it.

881
00:39:53,883 --> 00:39:55,283
We'll get a bunch of return orders.

882
00:39:56,082 --> 00:39:57,202
How to anti-refund?

883
00:39:58,403 --> 00:40:00,202
And what's our feature today?

884
00:40:00,483 --> 00:40:01,202
Factory.

885
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:03,122
Factory.

886
00:40:03,122 --> 00:40:04,242
Factory, right?

887
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:05,602
I've told you in this case,

888
00:40:05,763 --> 00:40:07,963
we should emphasize materials.

889
00:40:08,162 --> 00:40:09,682
The manufacturer is right here.

890
00:40:10,522 --> 00:40:11,522
You should highlight

891
00:40:11,522 --> 00:40:13,763
how exceptional the fabric quality it is

892
00:40:13,803 --> 00:40:15,522
and mention the factory scale.

893
00:40:16,003 --> 00:40:17,602
Why didn't you mention any of these?

894
00:40:22,283 --> 00:40:25,122
I-I thought we were
only following the script.

895
00:40:25,162 --> 00:40:26,522
But I'll definitely add

896
00:40:26,522 --> 00:40:28,202
more supplementary content later.

897
00:40:28,443 --> 00:40:29,803
The scripts are rigid,

898
00:40:30,082 --> 00:40:31,328
but we are flexible.

899
00:40:32,128 --> 00:40:32,642
Right?

900
00:40:32,682 --> 00:40:34,042
You're a host.

901
00:40:34,522 --> 00:40:36,162
I gave you the manual.

902
00:40:36,363 --> 00:40:38,722
The rhetoric contains
only three categories.

903
00:40:39,202 --> 00:40:41,483
Product shaping, pricing,
and product pitching.

904
00:40:42,003 --> 00:40:43,082
What did you say?

905
00:40:43,522 --> 00:40:44,602
All selling points.

906
00:40:45,403 --> 00:40:47,763
You should mix selling points
in product pitching.

907
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:49,763
Use selling points to answer

908
00:40:49,763 --> 00:40:51,283
why they should buy it

909
00:40:52,682 --> 00:40:54,003
and why to buy it today.

910
00:40:54,283 --> 00:40:55,602
What about the perks?

911
00:40:56,042 --> 00:40:58,162
Use perks to pitch the product.

912
00:40:58,522 --> 00:40:59,443
Use the feature.

913
00:40:59,602 --> 00:41:00,483
Use the endorsement.

914
00:41:00,562 --> 00:41:01,483
Use the brand.

915
00:41:01,483 --> 00:41:02,368
You missed them all!

916
00:41:05,562 --> 00:41:06,803
Sorry, Mr. Qiu.

917
00:41:08,003 --> 00:41:08,562
I...

918
00:41:09,042 --> 00:41:09,403
Enough.

919
00:41:09,403 --> 00:41:10,283
No more excuses.

920
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:11,682
Starting today,

921
00:41:12,082 --> 00:41:14,003
you'll assist Sun as co-host.

922
00:41:14,483 --> 00:41:15,162
He'll guide you.

923
00:41:16,283 --> 00:41:17,562
Okay. Thank you.

924
00:41:18,003 --> 00:41:18,642
Thank you.

925
00:41:22,923 --> 00:41:23,403
Thank you.

926
00:41:23,642 --> 00:41:25,722
All our fans and followers!

927
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:28,202
Our live stream's top-selling product,

928
00:41:28,483 --> 00:41:29,403
boneless chicken claws,

929
00:41:29,722 --> 00:41:30,682
is back today!

930
00:41:30,763 --> 00:41:31,363
Right?

931
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:33,122
Many newcomers

932
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:34,642
and loyal fans

933
00:41:34,722 --> 00:41:36,562
keep purchasing this!

934
00:41:36,763 --> 00:41:37,283
Why?

935
00:41:37,562 --> 00:41:39,923
Because it's so delicious!

936
00:41:39,923 --> 00:41:41,803
One bite and you're hooked!

937
00:41:42,483 --> 00:41:44,602
Even our team devours these!

938
00:41:45,763 --> 00:41:48,522
Our new host Yan tried one bite

939
00:41:48,562 --> 00:41:49,403
and couldn't stop!

940
00:41:49,602 --> 00:41:50,522
Couldn't stop, right?

941
00:41:50,522 --> 00:41:51,602
Let us show you

942
00:41:51,602 --> 00:41:53,443
how nice texture it has.

943
00:41:53,522 --> 00:41:54,042
See?

944
00:41:54,403 --> 00:41:55,162
Try it!

945
00:41:57,923 --> 00:42:00,082
It's so juicy,

946
00:42:00,642 --> 00:42:02,722
tender,

947
00:42:02,843 --> 00:42:04,403

precision processing!

951
00:42:09,003 --> 00:42:10,843
And we have four flavors today.

952
00:42:10,923 --> 00:42:11,682
Five-spice,

953
00:42:12,003 --> 00:42:12,803
pickled pepper,

954
00:42:12,923 --> 00:42:14,602
and lemony sweet-sour.

955
00:42:14,642 --> 00:42:15,763
Here's the deal.

956
00:42:15,923 --> 00:42:17,682
Buy one set, get four packs!

957
00:42:19,642 --> 00:42:21,403
Yan can't stop munching!

958
00:42:21,642 --> 00:42:22,323
Indeed.

959
00:42:22,682 --> 00:42:25,363
One bite, you'd be obsessed.

960
00:42:25,602 --> 00:42:27,443
And it's not really spicy, right?

961
00:42:28,483 --> 00:42:28,763
Really.

962
00:42:28,763 --> 00:42:30,363
If you can't eat spicy food at all.

963
00:42:30,363 --> 00:42:31,162
Choose link 1!

964
00:42:31,162 --> 00:42:32,883
(Top left, claim coupon for discount)
The five-spice flavor isn't spicy at all.

965
00:42:33,082 --> 00:42:35,082
Click link 2
if you can handle mild spice.

966
00:42:35,202 --> 00:42:36,242
(Money rolling in)
The host chats with you,

967
00:42:36,242 --> 00:42:37,443
and you should interact!

968
00:42:38,443 --> 00:42:39,363
All you do is eat.

969
00:42:40,082 --> 00:42:40,963
You can eat,

970
00:42:41,323 --> 00:42:42,803
(Wealth pouring in)
but don't stuff your mouth.

971
00:42:43,202 --> 00:42:43,883
Table manners!

972
00:42:44,443 --> 00:42:46,963
You need to eat
with charm and enthusiasm!

973
00:42:47,162 --> 00:42:48,042
Only that can spark

974
00:42:48,042 --> 00:42:49,242
viewers' purchasing desire.

975
00:42:51,923 --> 00:42:53,562
Can't you handle such simple tasks?

976
00:42:54,082 --> 00:42:55,122
I don't understand

977
00:42:55,363 --> 00:42:56,403
how you became that...

978
00:42:56,403 --> 00:42:57,242
What's that?

979
00:42:57,403 --> 00:42:58,562
A news anchor.

980
00:42:59,642 --> 00:43:01,283
Next one is selling
spicy oil beef tripe.

981
00:43:01,363 --> 00:43:02,323
Can you handle this?

982
00:43:04,483 --> 00:43:04,923
Yes.

983
00:43:05,242 --> 00:43:06,763
Can you eat with charm?

984
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:07,483
Yes.

985
00:43:07,923 --> 00:43:10,082
Can you interact?

986
00:43:11,202 --> 00:43:11,682
Yes.

987
00:43:13,522 --> 00:43:15,003
(Crispy beef tripe)
Our next product

988
00:43:15,122 --> 00:43:17,602
is delicious beef tripe!

989
00:43:17,722 --> 00:43:18,883
It's our new female host

990
00:43:18,883 --> 00:43:19,963
Yan's favorite, right?

991
00:43:20,162 --> 00:43:22,042
Today we'll prepare

992
00:43:22,122 --> 00:43:23,803
her favorite combo.

993
00:43:23,883 --> 00:43:24,682
How much?

994
00:43:24,803 --> 00:43:26,242
Good, more.

995
00:43:26,242 --> 00:43:27,082
A bit more, okay?

996
00:43:27,082 --> 00:43:28,003
Okay, thanks.

997
00:43:28,003 --> 00:43:29,803
Our sauce contains sesame paste.

998
00:43:29,803 --> 00:43:31,082
I'll mix it.

999
00:43:31,202 --> 00:43:33,202
Want some cilantro and scallions?

1000
00:43:33,242 --> 00:43:33,843
Yes.

1001
00:43:34,122 --> 00:43:34,602
No problem.

1002
00:43:34,682 --> 00:43:36,963
You can make this at home, right?

1003
00:43:37,003 --> 00:43:38,363
Right, customize to your taste.

1004
00:43:38,363 --> 00:43:41,403
This is compatible with everything.

1005
00:43:41,403 --> 00:43:41,843
Come on.

1006
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,722
Let's taste it. Okay?

1007
00:43:44,883 --> 00:43:45,403
Let me try.

1008
00:43:45,403 --> 00:43:46,162
More sesame sauce.

1009
00:43:46,162 --> 00:43:47,122
Okay, more sauce.

1010
00:43:47,122 --> 00:43:47,602
Right.

1011
00:43:48,283 --> 00:43:49,722
Yan knows it!

1012
00:43:52,698 --> 00:43:55,008
(Live Stream)

1013
00:43:59,283 --> 00:44:00,682
Delicious.

1014
00:44:01,602 --> 00:44:03,283
Super crispy!

1015
00:44:04,242 --> 00:44:05,562
Feels so good...

1016
00:44:07,642 --> 00:44:08,682
So chewy!

1017
00:44:08,883 --> 00:44:09,483
Right?

1018
00:44:09,682 --> 00:44:10,883
Don't miss out!

1019
00:44:10,883 --> 00:44:12,722
Today's special deal is hard-won

1020
00:44:12,722 --> 00:44:13,803
after tough negotiations.

1021
00:44:13,803 --> 00:44:14,202
Right?

1022
00:44:14,202 --> 00:44:15,562
Our boss said...

1023
00:44:15,682 --> 00:44:16,883
It's one-time only.

1024
00:44:16,883 --> 00:44:18,763
Link will be offline after selling out.

1025
00:44:19,082 --> 00:44:19,803
And now...

1026
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:28,923
The number you dialed is powered off.

1027
00:44:57,602 --> 00:44:58,122
Xu Yan!

1028
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:00,963
Xu Yan!

1029
00:45:05,923 --> 00:45:06,602
Xu Yan!

1030
00:45:15,202 --> 00:45:15,803
What's wrong?

1031
00:45:17,803 --> 00:45:19,042
How do you know I am here?

1032
00:45:19,323 --> 00:45:20,403
Yu Yiming told me.

1033
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,403
Why are you doing live streams now?

1034
00:45:22,642 --> 00:45:23,616
Where's Shen Haoming?

1035
00:45:25,483 --> 00:45:26,122
What's going on?

1036
00:45:26,642 --> 00:45:27,642
Go take a seat!

1037
00:45:27,963 --> 00:45:28,403
Come on.

1038
00:45:30,042 --> 00:45:32,443
That guy is so scheming.

1039
00:45:34,042 --> 00:45:35,202
He's quite cunning.

1040
00:45:35,923 --> 00:45:36,682
Have warm water.

1041
00:45:36,963 --> 00:45:37,803
Good for you.

1042
00:45:38,082 --> 00:45:38,642
Thanks.

1043
00:45:39,923 --> 00:45:41,283
I thought he was

1044
00:45:41,403 --> 00:45:42,682
some one-in-a-million good guy.

1045
00:45:42,763 --> 00:45:43,562
Trash!

1046
00:45:44,162 --> 00:45:45,283
You loved him,

1047
00:45:45,363 --> 00:45:46,403
married him,

1048
00:45:46,843 --> 00:45:48,082
helped his career,

1049
00:45:48,082 --> 00:45:50,122
took care of his entire family!

1050
00:45:50,242 --> 00:45:52,283
Yet he showed no mercy at all.

1051
00:45:55,763 --> 00:45:56,562
But at first,

1052
00:45:56,562 --> 00:45:57,923
I did wrong.

1053
00:46:00,602 --> 00:46:01,602
In this world,

1054
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:03,202
apologizing doesn't guarantee

1055
00:46:03,363 --> 00:46:05,722
forgiveness for wrongs.

1056
00:46:10,923 --> 00:46:12,363
But luckily, I've realized

1057
00:46:13,363 --> 00:46:15,642
Shen Haoming isn't the person
I imagined him to be.

1058
00:46:17,642 --> 00:46:18,562
I also understand

1059
00:46:19,682 --> 00:46:20,722
his love for me

1060
00:46:20,722 --> 00:46:22,283
isn't what I thought it was.

1061
00:46:24,722 --> 00:46:25,483
That's good.

1062
00:46:30,803 --> 00:46:33,162
Once the divorce
cooling-off period ends,

1063
00:46:33,283 --> 00:46:34,363
we'll finalize the divorce

1064
00:46:36,562 --> 00:46:38,483
and we'll have no more ties,

1065
00:46:39,202 --> 00:46:40,803
or mutual deception.

1066
00:46:46,843 --> 00:46:49,242
Then why did you quit your job?

1067
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:50,763
Wasn't that something

1068
00:46:50,763 --> 00:46:51,642
you worked hard for?

1069
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:53,963
I thought so.

1070
00:46:58,122 --> 00:46:59,642
Shen Haoming was involved in this too.

1071
00:47:04,042 --> 00:47:05,522
But I heard the live streams

1072
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:07,883
require 12 hours daily.

1073
00:47:08,323 --> 00:47:09,602
In peak season,

1074
00:47:09,682 --> 00:47:11,283
you might have no time to sleep.

1075
00:47:11,283 --> 00:47:12,923
Several hours of sleep at best.

1076
00:47:13,403 --> 00:47:14,363
That's too harsh.

1077
00:47:14,363 --> 00:47:15,923
Look at you now.

1078
00:47:16,443 --> 00:47:17,283
I'm perfectly fine.

1079
00:47:17,562 --> 00:47:18,923
Stop forcing yourself.

1080
00:47:21,803 --> 00:47:23,122
There are many more tougher jobs

1081
00:47:23,122 --> 00:47:23,963
than livestreaming.

1082
00:47:24,042 --> 00:47:25,483
I'm just getting started.

1083
00:47:25,803 --> 00:47:26,682
Besides,

1084
00:47:27,883 --> 00:47:29,283
as a newcomer,

1085
00:47:29,323 --> 00:47:31,242
I need to learn the ropes.

1086
00:47:31,642 --> 00:47:33,003
It won't last long like this.

1087
00:47:34,283 --> 00:47:34,803
Okay.

1088
00:47:38,843 --> 00:47:40,883
Besides, I feel relaxed now.

1089
00:47:42,562 --> 00:47:44,202
Unlike before,

1090
00:47:44,202 --> 00:47:45,602
I always feared to be revealed,

1091
00:47:46,162 --> 00:47:47,843
living in perpetual anxiety.

1092
00:47:52,082 --> 00:47:53,483
Anyway, don't eat like this again.

1093
00:47:53,803 --> 00:47:55,323
Your body can't handle this.

1094
00:47:57,883 --> 00:47:58,522
