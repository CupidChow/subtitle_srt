00:09:19,104 --> 00:09:22,264
After I finally saved up and entered,
I realized

194
00:09:23,703 --> 00:09:26,463
the costs would keep ballooning.

195
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:31,224
Soon

196
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,463
I can't even afford fabric.

197
00:09:38,624 --> 00:09:39,423
It's the truth.

198
00:09:39,984 --> 00:09:41,504
With my salary,

199
00:09:42,504 --> 00:09:43,583
after rent

200
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,144
and basics,

201
00:09:45,303 --> 00:09:46,943
nothing's left.

202
00:09:47,224 --> 00:09:49,423
Earn and spend right away.

203
00:09:49,543 --> 00:09:50,943
Not a cent saved.

204
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,864
People like us,

205
00:09:53,904 --> 00:09:55,224
shouldn't dream too big.

206
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:58,183
Well... Just

207
00:09:58,423 --> 00:09:59,183
making ends meet

208
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:00,423
is hard.

209
00:10:00,943 --> 00:10:01,463
Yao.

210
00:10:01,783 --> 00:10:04,543
Not everyone's dreams can come true.

211
00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:06,243
You can still design.

212
00:10:06,243 --> 00:10:07,224
Take it as a hobby.

213
00:10:07,823 --> 00:10:09,543
Don't push yourself so hard.

214
00:10:12,864 --> 00:10:13,423
No.

215
00:10:13,663 --> 00:10:14,744
No. No way.

216
00:10:14,984 --> 00:10:16,063
Like the movie says,

217
00:10:16,104 --> 00:10:18,344
without dreams, we're just salted fish.

218
00:10:20,183 --> 00:10:21,823
If 500 orders aren't enough,

219
00:10:22,104 --> 00:10:24,303
let's push for 600.

220
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,183
We'll save enough.

221
00:10:26,264 --> 00:10:28,104
Just try it.

222
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,423
It's so kind of you saying that.

223
00:10:34,423 --> 00:10:35,144
Alright.

224
00:10:35,783 --> 00:10:36,703
I've calculated.

225
00:10:37,224 --> 00:10:41,543
By the time I'm 120,
I'll have saved enough.

226
00:10:58,663 --> 00:10:59,984
Something on your mind?

227
00:11:05,144 --> 00:11:07,463
Seeing Guan just now

228
00:11:09,063 --> 00:11:11,864
reminded me
of my first years in Jingzhou.

229
00:11:12,663 --> 00:11:13,744
Just like them,

230
00:11:14,984 --> 00:11:16,904
I run around

231
00:11:18,463 --> 00:11:19,463
for survive.

232
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,504
I was terrified

233
00:11:22,904 --> 00:11:25,783
one wrong move would cost me the city.

234
00:11:27,783 --> 00:11:33,823
So I desperately sought security.

235
00:11:40,264 --> 00:11:40,943
I know

236
00:11:43,264 --> 00:11:44,984
my way was wrong.

237
00:11:47,943 --> 00:11:49,943
But my goal wasn't.

238
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:53,543
Wanting a quality life,

239
00:11:55,703 --> 00:11:57,943
creating better material condition
for my family,

240
00:12:02,183 --> 00:12:03,783
and changing my fate

241
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:08,423
are not vanity.

242
00:12:10,703 --> 00:12:11,423
Of course.

243
00:12:12,104 --> 00:12:13,144
You're right.

244
00:12:14,224 --> 00:12:17,224
So we've got to work hard

245
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:18,423
and to earn money.

246
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,823
Living really costs.

247
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,144
I want to try.

248
00:12:34,104 --> 00:12:34,583
What?

249
00:12:35,183 --> 00:12:35,864
You want to try?

250
00:12:36,463 --> 00:12:37,144
Try what?

251
00:12:43,543 --> 00:12:44,423
Paper copy's here.

252
00:12:44,703 --> 00:12:46,104
E-copy has been sent to your email.

253
00:12:47,024 --> 00:12:47,583
Thanks.

254
00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:08,703
Mr. Zhang.

255
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:12,823
What's the plan now?

256
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,024
Since I dared give it to him,

257
00:13:18,344 --> 00:13:20,104
there's nothing he can find.

258
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,183
When Wang Defu comes back,

259
00:13:26,463 --> 00:13:29,624
inform him
about the headquarters' inspection team.

260
00:13:29,904 --> 00:13:30,543
Clever.

261
00:13:31,224 --> 00:13:33,044
Mr. Wu from Anqiang
ran off with his money.

262
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:34,583
He's been trying to get it back.

263
00:13:35,144 --> 00:13:36,063
Let me tell you.

264
00:13:36,344 --> 00:13:38,104
That guy's trouble.

265
00:13:38,504 --> 00:13:39,063
Right.

266
00:13:39,624 --> 00:13:41,744
This is how we'll force him out.

267
00:13:46,063 --> 00:13:46,583
Mr. Shen.

268
00:13:46,864 --> 00:13:48,752
We just started
and they came causing trouble,

269
00:13:48,752 --> 00:13:49,840
preventing us from working.

270
00:13:50,024 --> 00:13:50,904
We tried reasoning,

271
00:13:50,984 --> 00:13:51,984
but they turned violent.

272
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,264
Stop! Stop!

273
00:13:56,024 --> 00:13:56,583
Stop!

274
00:13:58,344 --> 00:13:59,144
What's going on?

275
00:13:59,904 --> 00:14:01,063
You're Mr. Shen, right?

276
00:14:05,943 --> 00:14:07,144
Let me introduce myself.

277
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:07,904
I'm

278
00:14:08,183 --> 00:14:08,864
Wang Defu.

279
00:14:09,063 --> 00:14:10,583
Defu, as in 'virtue wins'.

280
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,224
I heard you're here
to solve our problems.

281
00:14:14,303 --> 00:14:14,984
That's perfect.

282
00:14:15,303 --> 00:14:17,063
Jinda Group owes me six million.

283
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:18,303
Pay up now.

284
00:14:18,823 --> 00:14:20,583
If I'm not mistaken,

285
00:14:21,024 --> 00:14:24,584
it was Wu Chengming from Anqiang

286
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,423
who pulled you into this project, right?

287
00:14:27,744 --> 00:14:28,344
Exactly.

288
00:14:29,024 --> 00:14:30,624
It was a personal loan.

289
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:32,543
Your loan agreement

290
00:14:32,984 --> 00:14:36,703
is between Anqiang Group and you.

291
00:14:36,904 --> 00:14:37,984
If you want repayment,

292
00:14:38,663 --> 00:14:40,904
go to Wu Chengming,

293
00:14:41,063 --> 00:14:42,063
not Jinda Group.

294
00:14:42,823 --> 00:14:45,663
Besides, police are already involved.

295
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:50,303
He conned me using your project.

296
00:14:50,744 --> 00:14:52,423
Without Jinda Group's backing,

297
00:14:52,663 --> 00:14:54,104
he'd never dare make such claims.

298
00:14:54,224 --> 00:14:56,624
Would I have lent six million so easily?

299
00:14:57,024 --> 00:14:59,504
Now Wu's vanished,

300
00:14:59,663 --> 00:15:01,183
and you want to deny responsibility?

301
00:15:01,543 --> 00:15:02,783
The police?

302
00:15:03,224 --> 00:15:04,744
Even the courts

303
00:15:04,984 --> 00:15:06,104
won't side with you.

304
00:15:06,344 --> 00:15:06,943
Pay up.

305
00:15:07,104 --> 00:15:08,783
By law,

306
00:15:09,663 --> 00:15:12,943
Jinda Group is not
on the hook, jointly or otherwise.

307
00:15:13,303 --> 00:15:14,423
Similar cases

308
00:15:14,703 --> 00:15:17,104
with identical circumstances

309
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:18,943
have already been ruled that way.

310
00:15:19,144 --> 00:15:20,183
You can check

311
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:21,943
or consult your lawyer.

312
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:23,543
Lawyer?

313
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:25,423
Debts must be paid.

314
00:15:26,264 --> 00:15:27,144
That's natural law.

315
00:15:27,864 --> 00:15:28,703
Right, guys?

316
00:15:28,744 --> 00:15:29,663
Yes.

317
00:15:29,744 --> 00:15:30,583
- Right!
- Pay up!

318
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:31,792
What are you doing?

319
00:15:35,183 --> 00:15:35,783
Don't move!

320
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,264
Pay up!

321
00:15:37,783 --> 00:15:38,303
Pay up!

322
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:41,583
I've told you.

323
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:43,823
Don't be so rude.

324
00:15:44,384 --> 00:15:45,423
Rule with virtue.

325
00:15:46,783 --> 00:15:47,423
(Get well soon)
This is a lesson.

326
00:15:47,663 --> 00:15:49,024
Yes, indeed!

327
00:15:50,024 --> 00:15:50,744
Mr. Shen,

328
00:15:51,264 --> 00:15:52,583
you're so rich,

329
00:15:52,624 --> 00:15:53,783
swimming in cash.

330
00:15:54,024 --> 00:15:56,624
But we ordinary folks
have to work hard to earn.

331
00:15:56,984 --> 00:15:58,144
If you want to bully us,

332
00:15:58,423 --> 00:15:59,224
that won't be easy.

333
00:15:59,904 --> 00:16:00,984
We're locals here.

334
00:16:01,463 --> 00:16:02,904
We have plenty of time.

335
00:16:03,823 --> 00:16:04,624
No money today?

336
00:16:05,303 --> 00:16:06,423
We'll be back tomorrow.

337
00:16:06,703 --> 00:16:08,224
No tomorrow? Then the day after.

338
00:16:08,504 --> 00:16:09,823
We'll see who cracks first.

339
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,744
I'll give you some face today.

340
00:16:11,943 --> 00:16:12,744
We're leaving.

341
00:16:12,984 --> 00:16:13,423
Let's go.

342
00:16:14,344 --> 00:16:14,783
Go away.

343
00:16:24,624 --> 00:16:25,463
Clean up.

344
00:16:25,624 --> 00:16:26,264
Get to work.

345
00:16:26,423 --> 00:16:26,943
- Back to work.
- Yes.

346
00:16:26,984 --> 00:16:27,744
Time to work.

347
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:28,504
Begin!

348
00:16:33,624 --> 00:16:35,024
Let's see

349
00:16:35,144 --> 00:16:36,744
how a rich guy fights thugs.

350
00:16:37,744 --> 00:16:38,423
Right.

351
00:16:38,783 --> 00:16:39,984
Let him learn

352
00:16:40,183 --> 00:16:42,024
this water runs deeper than it looks.

353
00:16:42,183 --> 00:16:43,224
Wherever he came from,

354
00:16:43,344 --> 00:16:44,504
he'd better go back.

355
00:16:47,663 --> 00:16:48,144
Xu Yan.

356
00:16:48,543 --> 00:16:50,344
Why'd you call us here?

357
00:16:52,463 --> 00:16:54,183
My sister's got a startup idea,

358
00:16:54,543 --> 00:16:55,864
and you're all part of it.

359
00:16:57,543 --> 00:16:58,183
Startup?

360
00:17:02,624 --> 00:17:03,144
Yes.

361
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:05,423
I've been thinking.

362
00:17:05,663 --> 00:17:08,823
We can combine our strengths.

363
00:17:09,543 --> 00:17:13,543
Yao can handle design
with an ethnic focus,

364
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:16,104
Guan can be our brand ambassador,

365
00:17:16,663 --> 00:17:19,784
and my sister handles styling.

366
00:17:20,463 --> 00:17:22,703
Let's launch a clothing brand together.

367
00:17:23,423 --> 00:17:24,824
In the initial phase,

368
00:17:24,904 --> 00:17:29,904
we'll build exposure and our image

369
00:17:29,904 --> 00:17:31,344
with short videos.

370
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,544
Later, we'll open stores

371
00:17:34,904 --> 00:17:36,703
and sell ready-to-wear.

372
00:17:39,864 --> 00:17:40,943
What do you think?

373
00:17:44,144 --> 00:17:44,864
Yan.

374
00:17:45,423 --> 00:17:47,223
It sounds great,

375
00:17:48,463 --> 00:17:51,943
but starting a business is tough.

376
00:17:52,743 --> 00:17:53,983
Take me.

377
00:17:54,344 --> 00:17:56,624
I poured everything
into that competition.

378
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:57,423
And now?

379
00:17:58,023 --> 00:17:59,344
I got nothing back.

380
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:00,344
Exactly.

381
00:18:00,624 --> 00:18:02,743
My job doesn't pay much now,

382
00:18:03,023 --> 00:18:03,983
but it's steady.

383
00:18:05,503 --> 00:18:07,064
If our business plan failed,

384
00:18:07,423 --> 00:18:08,344
how do we live?

385
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:11,983
Besides, we lack startup fund.

386
00:18:12,344 --> 00:18:13,023
True.

387
00:18:16,584 --> 00:18:17,943
Here's my savings,

388
00:18:18,544 --> 00:18:19,584
150,000 yuan.

389
00:18:19,943 --> 00:18:21,544
This'll be our startup fund.

390
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:25,183
And I'll bring in investors later.

391
00:18:25,223 --> 00:18:26,663
Our funds will be more than this.

392
00:18:28,344 --> 00:18:28,663
If...

393
00:18:29,304 --> 00:18:31,503
If this fails,

394
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:32,743
all your money will go.

395
00:18:33,104 --> 00:18:34,223
Are you sure about this?

396
00:18:34,304 --> 00:18:35,663
I'm quite sure.

397
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,703
This isn't impulsive.

398
00:18:41,423 --> 00:18:42,544
Trust me.

399
00:18:45,784 --> 00:18:47,223
Now I just want to ask.

400
00:18:47,344 --> 00:18:51,104
Are you confident in your skills?

401
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:52,743
Absolutely.

402
00:18:53,104 --> 00:18:53,703
I've always

403
00:18:53,784 --> 00:18:56,904
wanted to show our ethnic clothes
to more.

404
00:18:57,064 --> 00:18:58,663
Mixing it with modern fashion

405
00:18:59,183 --> 00:18:59,904
excites me.

406
00:19:00,064 --> 00:19:02,023
This could be huge.

407
00:19:02,743 --> 00:19:04,344
My makeup skills speak for themselves.

408
00:19:04,784 --> 00:19:07,064
My clients posted my makeups online,

409
00:19:07,183 --> 00:19:08,703
and people are still copying them!

410
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:13,384

411
00:19:13,784 --> 00:19:14,943

and photogenic.

416
00:19:23,544 --> 00:19:24,864
Picking me as the model?

417
00:19:25,144 --> 00:19:26,344
You are smart.

418
00:19:26,743 --> 00:19:28,423

Any other questions?

423
00:19:46,384 --> 00:19:50,304
Do you need more time to consider it?

424
00:19:51,584 --> 00:19:52,183
Yes. I need.

425
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:59,864
I need to quit my job first.

If hitting me brings us lasting peace,

575
00:25:13,023 --> 00:25:14,384
I'll endure it all.

576
00:25:16,703 --> 00:25:17,584
You're insane.

577
00:25:17,943 --> 00:25:18,904
Lin, come back with me.

578
00:25:18,904 --> 00:25:19,544
Let me go!

579
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:19,983
Let go!

580
00:25:20,624 --> 00:25:21,183
What's wrong?

581
00:25:23,144 --> 00:25:24,064
Yu Yiming.

582
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:27,064
Why are you everywhere?

583
00:25:29,824 --> 00:25:30,503
Perfect timing.

584
00:25:31,703 --> 00:25:32,663
I'm informing you here.

585
00:25:33,703 --> 00:25:34,344
I

586
00:25:34,864 --> 00:25:36,743
officially get back together
with Qiao Lin.

587
00:25:39,463 --> 00:25:40,023
He's insane.

588
00:25:41,983 --> 00:25:42,423
Lin.

589
00:25:42,904 --> 00:25:44,584
I'll tell you one last time.

590
00:25:44,824 --> 00:25:46,384
There's no future for us.

591
00:25:47,104 --> 00:25:47,584
Lin Tao.

592
00:25:48,584 --> 00:25:49,784
Qiao Lin has made up her mind.

593
00:25:49,864 --> 00:25:50,624
And you've seen it.

594
00:25:51,503 --> 00:25:51,983
Go back.

595
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:53,463
Stop bothering her.

596
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:54,943
Yu Yiming,

597
00:25:55,784 --> 00:25:57,223
you stop it.

598
00:25:57,943 --> 00:25:59,344
Dare you say you love Qiao Lin?

599
00:25:59,503 --> 00:26:01,423
Right here, right now,
in front of us both?

600
00:26:06,864 --> 00:26:07,663
I love her.

601
00:26:15,152 --> 00:26:16,208
- What did you say?
- What did you say?

602
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:19,663
Say that again?

603
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:21,943
You heard me clearly.

604
00:26:52,503 --> 00:26:53,784
Feels like ages since I saw you.

605
00:26:54,544 --> 00:26:55,183
Yes.

606
00:26:55,943 --> 00:26:58,304
Now I mainly work at my sister's place,

607
00:26:58,463 --> 00:26:59,943
so I have to go attend meetings.

608
00:27:00,624 --> 00:27:02,904
And I need to accompany
Guan to film videos.

609
00:27:04,104 --> 00:27:05,144
We start it from scratch,

610
00:27:05,463 --> 00:27:06,344
so we are quite busy.

611
00:27:07,223 --> 00:27:08,463
But I quite enjoy it.

612
00:27:09,864 --> 00:27:10,703
Good then.

613
00:27:11,824 --> 00:27:13,104
Whatever you do, just enjoy it.

614
00:27:19,503 --> 00:27:20,904
Your teacher told me

615
00:27:22,064 --> 00:27:23,423
you've kept up with school.

616
00:27:24,304 --> 00:27:25,503
Be attentive in class.

617
00:27:26,584 --> 00:27:27,624
Done your homework well.

618
00:27:29,584 --> 00:27:32,144
You've been contacting my teacher?

619
00:27:42,223 --> 00:27:43,304
Don't you think

620
00:27:43,423 --> 00:27:47,144
this outfit's pattern is too formal?

621
00:27:47,983 --> 00:27:48,824
The overall vibe

622
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,263
looks so rigid.

623
00:27:50,784 --> 00:27:53,144
Dr. Yu brought you yogurt.

624
00:27:59,624 --> 00:28:00,104
Drink up.

625
00:28:09,544 --> 00:28:10,304
What...

626
00:28:10,423 --> 00:28:11,144
What's wrong?

627
00:28:11,183 --> 00:28:12,344
Why so gloomy?

628
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,104
Followers increased.

629
00:28:15,144 --> 00:28:15,784
Increased?

630
00:28:15,824 --> 00:28:16,663
Let me check.

631
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,183
We have

632
00:28:20,663 --> 00:28:21,503
eleven more.

633
00:28:26,624 --> 00:28:27,503
That's something!

634
00:28:27,743 --> 00:28:29,023
Better than nothing.

635
00:28:29,064 --> 00:28:29,463
Right?

636
00:28:30,144 --> 00:28:30,743
It's okay.

637
00:28:32,904 --> 00:28:36,144
We must admit Yan Studio has a problem.

638
00:28:40,743 --> 00:28:43,223
There's a British brand,

639
00:28:43,784 --> 00:28:45,463
Ladysee, ever heard of it?

640
00:28:47,423 --> 00:28:48,423
This brand

641
00:28:48,784 --> 00:28:52,064
focuses on medieval maiden style.

642
00:28:53,624 --> 00:28:57,703
The tone of the brand is elegant,

643
00:28:57,824 --> 00:28:58,624
exquisite,

644
00:28:58,943 --> 00:28:59,743
and fantasy-like.

645
00:29:00,784 --> 00:29:01,703
My research shows

646
00:29:03,423 --> 00:29:04,864
(Welcome to Ladysee's fashion realm)
the brand is niche,

647
00:29:05,064 --> 00:29:06,584
so the early sales were poor.

648
00:29:07,584 --> 00:29:09,983
But why did it later sweep Europe?

649
00:29:10,904 --> 00:29:13,183
During the London Olympics,

650
00:29:13,463 --> 00:29:15,423
it merged with a sports brand,

651
00:29:15,584 --> 00:29:17,904
blending classical elements

652
00:29:18,584 --> 00:29:21,503
and making athletic wear elegant,

653
00:29:21,743 --> 00:29:23,703
with girlish charm and unique style.

654
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:28,144
It skyrocketed
local girls' purchasing desire.

655
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:33,223
So, I was thinking

656
00:29:34,663 --> 00:29:36,223
if our current videos

657
00:29:36,263 --> 00:29:39,023
are overemphasizing ethnic styles.

658
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:45,904
Our brand philosophy aims
to preserve and develop traditions.

659
00:29:46,344 --> 00:29:51,463
Therefore, we should make
ethnic-style clothing more appealing.

660
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:58,023
We should highlight functionality
and mass appeal in our products.

661
00:29:58,423 --> 00:29:59,423
For example.

662
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:01,344
When going on an outing,

663
00:30:02,864 --> 00:30:04,503
I could wear Yan Studio's clothes,

664
00:30:05,183 --> 00:30:07,104
feeling free and joyful.

665
00:30:07,584 --> 00:30:09,864
When going to work,

666
00:30:10,064 --> 00:30:11,983
I could also choose
Yan Studio's clothes.

667
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:13,624
When going to wedding,

668
00:30:14,423 --> 00:30:15,023
or parties...

669
00:30:17,584 --> 00:30:18,544
Do you understand me?

670
00:30:19,624 --> 00:30:21,304
I think this direction is spot-on.

671
00:30:21,584 --> 00:30:23,423
If we follow Yan's suggestions,

672
00:30:23,743 --> 00:30:25,144
I have a preliminary concept.

673
00:30:25,463 --> 00:30:27,183
For our next video,

674
00:30:27,223 --> 00:30:31,304
could we include topics
like Normal Outfit of the Day?

675
00:30:31,584 --> 00:30:32,624
Normal Outfit of the Day?

676
00:30:33,904 --> 00:30:37,463
Then we can dial
everything down to real-life mode.

677
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,824
So as the makeup style.

678
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:44,423
Then I'll appear
more relaxed and natural

679
00:30:44,663 --> 00:30:45,423
during filming.

680
00:30:47,584 --> 00:30:48,824
No problem. Let's do this.

681
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:50,743
We'll adjust and integrate it

682
00:30:51,104 --> 00:30:52,584
into our next collection.

683
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:53,663
- Sure.
- Agreed.

684
00:30:54,824 --> 00:30:55,983
I'll send you the plan later.

685
00:30:56,144 --> 00:30:56,503
Okay.

686
00:30:56,584 --> 00:30:57,784
I'm going back.

687
00:30:57,864 --> 00:30:58,864
I'll revise the schedule.

688
00:30:59,743 --> 00:31:00,183
Go ahead.

689
00:31:01,144 --> 00:31:01,864
I'll take this.

690
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,104
I'll see your video.

691
00:31:08,703 --> 00:31:09,423
(Hello, everyone!)

692
00:31:09,503 --> 00:31:11,503
(Welcome to today's live stream!)

693
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:13,943
(Don't miss out, everyone!)

694
00:31:14,023 --> 00:31:15,703
(Please stay with us!)

695
00:31:15,784 --> 00:31:16,983
(Today, we have prepared)

696
00:31:17,023 --> 00:31:19,104
(amazing benefits for you.)

697
00:31:19,263 --> 00:31:21,423
(Including the...)

698
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,202
(Xu Yan)

699
00:31:32,364 --> 00:31:35,448
(Don't forget. 8th next month
at Civil Affairs Bureau.)

700
00:31:44,624 --> 00:31:45,263
Mr. Shen!

701
00:31:48,304 --> 00:31:49,304
A batch of pipes is here.

702
00:31:49,304 --> 00:31:50,423
Come to inspect.

703
00:31:51,304 --> 00:31:51,784
Okay.

704
00:31:55,864 --> 00:31:57,183
You did wrong in this position.

705
00:31:57,743 --> 00:31:58,983
Tighten quality control here

706
00:31:59,463 --> 00:32:00,864
and correct this.

707
00:32:00,904 --> 00:32:01,263
Got it.

708
00:32:01,463 --> 00:32:01,824
Okay?

709
00:32:02,864 --> 00:32:03,544
You can leave.

710
00:32:03,624 --> 00:32:03,983
Okay.

711
00:32:06,544 --> 00:32:07,064
Hello.

712
00:32:07,784 --> 00:32:09,703
Mr. Shen, update you.

713
00:32:10,064 --> 00:32:11,423
Operations are running smoothly.

714
00:32:11,703 --> 00:32:12,904
How's Xu Yan doing?

715
00:32:13,584 --> 00:32:15,304
Yan is busy starting her business.

716
00:32:15,423 --> 00:32:17,064
Doesn't she livestream?

717
00:32:17,983 --> 00:32:19,423
She quit.

718
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:23,023
Now she runs an ethnic fashion account

719
00:32:23,304 --> 00:32:25,023
with her sister and two others girls.

720
00:32:25,023 --> 00:32:25,904
How's it?

721
00:32:27,304 --> 00:32:28,064
Not great.

722
00:32:28,544 --> 00:32:29,624
A few hundred followers

723
00:32:30,304 --> 00:32:31,743
and under thousand likes per post.

724
00:32:32,423 --> 00:32:33,144
Right, Mr. Shen,

725
00:32:33,663 --> 00:32:35,144
Wang Defu's profile you requested

726
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:37,344
was sent to your email.

727
00:32:37,344 --> 00:32:37,864
Got it.

728
00:32:43,144 --> 00:32:43,784
Bro,

729
00:32:44,064 --> 00:32:46,544
will Mr. Shen give us the money?

730
00:32:47,663 --> 00:32:48,743
If he refuses,

731
00:32:48,983 --> 00:32:50,144
I'll go to his father.

732
00:32:50,864 --> 00:32:51,423
Right.

733
00:33:28,663 --> 00:33:29,423
May I sit here?

734
00:33:33,223 --> 00:33:33,703
Sit.

735
00:33:46,864 --> 00:33:47,544
Shen Haoming.

736
00:33:48,023 --> 00:33:49,263
You're interesting.

737
00:33:50,864 --> 00:33:52,423
I didn't come to you today,

738
00:33:53,183 --> 00:33:54,503
yet you came to me.

739
00:33:55,864 --> 00:33:56,503
What's wrong?

740
00:33:57,104 --> 00:33:58,023
Can't handle it?

741
00:33:58,943 --> 00:34:00,023
Pay up now,

742
00:34:00,423 --> 00:34:01,463
principal plus interest.

743
00:34:01,663 --> 00:34:02,223
Make it quick.

744
00:34:03,423 --> 00:34:06,223
I came to you to discuss repayment.

745
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:08,064
Look!

746
00:34:10,183 --> 00:34:10,864
Figured it out.

747
00:34:16,223 --> 00:34:16,784
Go ahead.

748
00:34:18,824 --> 00:34:20,184
We need more investment.

749
00:34:27,423 --> 00:34:28,344
Excuse me?

750
00:34:29,463 --> 00:34:31,103
We need more funds.

751
00:34:39,423 --> 00:34:40,423
Are you insane?

752
00:34:40,744 --> 00:34:43,184
You still owe me money,

753
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:44,824
now you want more from me?

754
00:34:45,143 --> 00:34:46,463
Have you lost your mind?

755
00:34:47,304 --> 00:34:48,423
You want me

756
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:49,904
to fall in the same trap twice?

757
00:34:50,543 --> 00:34:51,943
Are you taking me for a fool?

758
00:34:52,063 --> 00:34:53,344
Are you fooling me around?

759
00:34:57,583 --> 00:34:58,904
Lovely night tonight.

760
00:34:59,344 --> 00:35:00,143
Let's take a walk.

761
00:35:06,664 --> 00:35:07,304
Walk?

762
00:35:10,143 --> 00:35:10,623
Fine.

763
00:35:13,503 --> 00:35:15,543
Should we hold hands?

764
00:35:16,224 --> 00:35:19,103
Why don't you suggest to date?

765
00:35:26,264 --> 00:35:27,503
What I offer

766
00:35:28,904 --> 00:35:30,184
will not disappoint you.

767
00:35:32,503 --> 00:35:33,143
Well,

768
00:35:33,864 --> 00:35:35,103
people from big cities

769
00:35:35,184 --> 00:35:35,824
are so special.

770
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:39,543
Alright.

771
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:40,864
Where to?

772
00:35:50,704 --> 00:35:51,423
Shen Haoming.

773
00:35:53,224 --> 00:35:53,983
What are you doing?

774
00:35:55,063 --> 00:35:56,463
We're almost at my place.

775
00:36:02,704 --> 00:36:04,744
You said to walk with you,

776
00:36:05,344 --> 00:36:06,864
and I've walked with you this long.

777
00:36:07,543 --> 00:36:08,704
Say something.

778
00:36:11,304 --> 00:36:12,503
Say something!

779
00:36:12,664 --> 00:36:13,224
Almost there.

780
00:36:14,143 --> 00:36:14,664
Almost there?

781
00:36:15,824 --> 00:36:16,744
Let me tell you.

782
00:36:17,224 --> 00:36:18,143
This is my place.

783
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,623
If you try any tricks,

784
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:20,824
I'll beat you up!

785
00:36:22,103 --> 00:36:22,864
Ms. Wang.

786
00:36:26,344 --> 00:36:27,423
Haoming.

787
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:28,423
What brings you here?

788
00:36:28,423 --> 00:36:28,943
I...

789
00:36:29,904 --> 00:36:30,503
Haoming.

790
00:36:30,864 --> 00:36:32,344
Why didn't you tell me you'd come?

791
00:36:32,344 --> 00:36:33,143
To surprise you.

792
00:36:33,344 --> 00:36:34,264
Whose car is this?

793
00:36:35,103 --> 00:36:35,503
Go.

794
00:36:36,423 --> 00:36:37,344
Go!

795
00:36:37,423 --> 00:36:37,943
Go.

796
00:36:38,143 --> 00:36:38,943
- Go.
- Go.

797
00:36:39,143 --> 00:36:40,023
Go.

798
00:36:40,103 --> 00:36:40,664
- Go.
- Go.

799
00:36:41,023 --> 00:36:42,583
One, two, one.

800
00:36:45,864 --> 00:36:46,264
Mom.

801
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:48,423
Why are you here?

802
00:36:48,704 --> 00:36:49,344
I...

803
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:52,583
Haoming.

804
00:36:53,063 --> 00:36:54,583
Did he cause trouble again?

805
00:36:55,103 --> 00:36:55,704
Tell me,

806
00:36:55,983 --> 00:36:56,983
I'll beat him hard!

807
00:36:57,503 --> 00:36:57,824
Hey.

808
00:36:57,983 --> 00:36:58,943
Ms. Wang.

809
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,063
He didn't.

810
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:02,583
We're discussing business nearby,

811
00:37:02,784 --> 00:37:03,543
so I came to you.

812
00:37:03,904 --> 00:37:04,943
Discussing business?

813
00:37:05,784 --> 00:37:06,904
Legitimate business?

814
00:37:07,543 --> 00:37:08,623
Of course, it's legitimate.

815
00:37:09,264 --> 00:37:11,623
Defu is partnering with Jinda Group.

816
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:14,623
Really?

817
00:37:15,543 --> 00:37:16,943
Wonderful!

818
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,304
Please come in.

819
00:37:18,344 --> 00:37:18,904
Please.

820
00:37:19,184 --> 00:37:20,143
Alright.

821
00:37:22,023 --> 00:37:22,864
Mind your words.

822
00:37:24,423 --> 00:37:26,184
Come in, Haoming.

823
00:37:26,304 --> 00:37:26,983
Come on in.

824
00:37:27,143 --> 00:37:27,623
No need.

825
00:37:27,864 --> 00:37:29,423
We can talk here.

826
00:37:30,704 --> 00:37:31,664
Alright, have a seat.

827
00:37:31,664 --> 00:37:32,103
Alright.

828
00:37:32,103 --> 00:37:33,103
I'll make some tea.

829
00:37:33,103 --> 00:37:33,463
No need.

830
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:34,543
I'll leave soon.

831
00:37:34,744 --> 00:37:35,304
Don't bother.

832
00:37:35,744 --> 00:37:36,864
Alright, sit then.

833
00:37:38,103 --> 00:37:38,704
You!

834
00:37:39,384 --> 00:37:40,023
Talk properly.

835
00:37:46,344 --> 00:37:47,023
Shen Haoming.

836
00:37:48,543 --> 00:37:49,623
How do you know my mom?

837
00:37:50,824 --> 00:37:52,463
Don't be nervous.

838
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:56,264
I met your mom days ago

839
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,943
at the senior care event.

840
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:02,103
You disappeared for days,

841
00:38:02,463 --> 00:38:03,463
so you found my mom.

842
00:38:05,463 --> 00:38:06,423
Listen.

843
00:38:07,344 --> 00:38:09,304
If you threaten me using my mom,

844
00:38:09,543 --> 00:38:10,784
you're asking for death.

845
00:38:12,344 --> 00:38:13,184
Mr. Wang,

846
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,583
these years you've traded stocks,

847
00:38:17,184 --> 00:38:18,463
and run private loans,

848
00:38:19,983 --> 00:38:23,264
earning good money smoothly.

849
00:38:23,864 --> 00:38:25,864
And you got many lackeys under you.

850
00:38:27,623 --> 00:38:29,023
But you people

851
00:38:29,704 --> 00:38:32,344
are always domineering.

852
00:38:33,143 --> 00:38:34,744
In the neighbors' eyes,

853
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:36,943
you're definitely no good people.

854
00:38:37,423 --> 00:38:38,824
None of your business.

855
00:38:40,704 --> 00:38:41,943
Despite your bad reputation,

856
00:38:42,543 --> 00:38:43,704
you're filial.

857
00:38:46,304 --> 00:38:48,184
Every year on your mom's birthday,

858
00:38:48,224 --> 00:38:49,784
you'd kneel to wash her feet,

859
00:38:50,543 --> 00:38:51,664
yet she rejects it.

860
00:38:52,304 --> 00:38:54,864
She would kick over the basin.

861
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:59,704
Our residential project
is near the bus terminal.

862
00:39:01,184 --> 00:39:04,304
But the access road is still unpaved,

863
00:39:04,784 --> 00:39:05,864
highly inconvenient.

864
00:39:07,063 --> 00:39:09,224
If we can repair this road,

865
00:39:10,184 --> 00:39:12,664
the residents will benefit.

866
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:14,864
All villagers along the road

867
00:39:14,864 --> 00:39:16,864
will have improved livelihoods.

868
00:39:17,304 --> 00:39:19,744
The town government
supports this too, right?

869
00:39:21,023 --> 00:39:22,184
What do you mean?

870
00:39:23,423 --> 00:39:26,143
Your previous investments
became bad debts.

871
00:39:27,503 --> 00:39:28,583
They are unrecoverable.

872
00:39:28,904 --> 00:39:31,264
If you invest more money

873
00:39:31,583 --> 00:39:32,623
for the road construction,

874
00:39:33,423 --> 00:39:35,583
the group will reevaluate

875
00:39:36,824 --> 00:39:37,744
and set up new budgets.

876
00:39:38,503 --> 00:39:42,304
Your lost money would
become legitimate investments.

877
00:39:42,904 --> 00:39:45,224
Then you can retrieve your funds.

878
00:39:45,423 --> 00:39:45,864
Understand?

879
00:39:46,744 --> 00:39:48,063
Are you fooling me around?

880
00:39:50,704 --> 00:39:52,224
Let's sign an agreement then.

881
00:39:53,543 --> 00:39:55,224
When the apartments have been completed,

882
00:39:56,264 --> 00:39:57,423
you can choose one first.

883
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:04,184
You run a landscaping company, right?

884
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:07,344
You can get

885
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:10,344
all the landscaping of our project.

886
00:40:12,023 --> 00:40:12,864
Seriously?

887
00:40:13,224 --> 00:40:13,983
You know

888
00:40:15,143 --> 00:40:16,384
who I am, right?

889
00:40:17,304 --> 00:40:19,423
I keep my promise.

890
00:40:19,824 --> 00:40:20,744
As a native here,

891
00:40:21,023 --> 00:40:22,423
if you invest in road construction,

892
00:40:22,824 --> 00:40:24,503
it would truly

893
00:40:26,423 --> 00:40:29,103
benefit villagers
and bring honor to your family.

894
00:40:29,824 --> 00:40:31,583
Everyone will remember your name.

895
00:40:32,143 --> 00:40:33,864
Wang Defu.

896
00:40:35,184 --> 00:40:36,304
And I believe your mom

897
00:40:37,344 --> 00:40:39,824
will be very proud of you.

898
00:40:41,983 --> 00:40:45,744
I've sent all road reconstruction
contracts to your company.

899
00:40:46,543 --> 00:40:48,744
They include
official town government approvals.

900
00:40:50,023 --> 00:40:51,224
Think it over.

901
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,983
And we'll discuss after that.

902
00:40:55,664 --> 00:40:56,423
It's getting late.

903
00:40:56,744 --> 00:40:57,543
I'm leaving.

904
00:41:01,943 --> 00:41:02,983
Pleasure to meet you.

905
00:41:07,704 --> 00:41:08,983
What did I say?

906
00:41:15,063 --> 00:41:16,543
Lovely night tonight.

907
00:41:18,983 --> 00:41:19,864
Indeed.

908
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:21,943
We even held hands.

909
00:41:24,543 --> 00:41:25,063
You're here.

910
00:41:28,184 --> 00:41:28,904
Mr. Shen.

911
00:41:29,824 --> 00:41:30,704
What a feast!

912
00:41:31,423 --> 00:41:32,423
You've been here so long,

913
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:33,744
yet I never hosted you properly.

914
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:34,943
Now you're treating me.

915
00:41:34,983 --> 00:41:35,784
This makes me...

916
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:36,304
Have a seat.

917
00:41:36,423 --> 00:41:37,423
I'm so embarrassed.

918
00:41:38,824 --> 00:41:39,824
I brought fine wine.

919
00:41:41,184 --> 00:41:42,784
We can have a drink later.

920
00:41:46,824 --> 00:41:48,184
Mr. Shen.

921
00:41:48,983 --> 00:41:51,103
After working together all this time,

922
00:41:51,264 --> 00:41:55,784
I see you have genuine
construction expertise.

923
00:41:56,224 --> 00:41:57,744
You even

924
00:41:57,904 --> 00:41:59,704
tamed that Wang Defu.

925
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:01,623
You're young and capable.

926
00:42:02,463 --> 00:42:03,143
Impressive!

927
00:42:03,503 --> 00:42:03,943
Here.

928
00:42:04,664 --> 00:42:06,423
Let's have a drink.

929
00:42:07,503 --> 00:42:08,184
Let me toast you.

930
00:42:08,664 --> 00:42:09,344
Thank you.

931
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:14,583
Let's eat.

932
00:42:21,304 --> 00:42:23,304
The group approved the budget?

933
00:42:24,344 --> 00:42:24,983
Yes.

934
00:42:25,784 --> 00:42:26,583
Really?

935
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,864
Fantastic!

936
00:42:28,103 --> 00:42:28,824
Let me tell you,

937
00:42:28,864 --> 00:42:30,143
I've been waiting

938
00:42:30,184 --> 00:42:32,423
for this project to get back on track.

939
00:42:32,623 --> 00:42:32,983
Here.

940
00:42:33,304 --> 00:42:34,583
Let's celebrate. Come on.

941
00:42:36,503 --> 00:42:37,583
A new general manager will

942
00:42:38,063 --> 00:42:38,784
come tomorrow.

943
00:42:39,784 --> 00:42:40,423
What?

944
00:42:52,184 --> 00:42:55,503
This is a farewell banquet?

945
00:43:02,103 --> 00:43:02,983
Fire me?

946
00:43:08,543 --> 00:43:09,423
I can leave.

947
00:43:09,664 --> 00:43:10,864
I won't stay a minute longer.

948
00:43:11,344 --> 00:43:12,704
But remember,

949
00:43:13,143 --> 00:43:13,983
with me here,

950
00:43:14,664 --> 00:43:16,423
this mess remains contained.

951
00:43:16,704 --> 00:43:20,103
If I leave,
this will collapse instantly.

952
00:43:21,063 --> 00:43:22,184
You can't leave now.

953
00:43:22,904 --> 00:43:24,423
Wait until I audit the deficits,

954
00:43:24,816 --> 00:43:25,746
and then you can leave.

955
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:27,143
What?

956
00:43:28,023 --> 00:43:28,824
Audit on me?

957
00:43:29,583 --> 00:43:30,063
Go!

958
00:43:30,224 --> 00:43:31,423
Let's go to the office now!

959
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,983
I will hand over every password,

960
00:43:33,023 --> 00:43:33,943
every account!

961
00:43:34,543 --> 00:43:35,304
Let me tell you.

962
00:43:35,384 --> 00:43:37,023
I am completely clean.

963
00:43:37,503 --> 00:43:38,184
All these years,

964
00:43:38,543 --> 00:43:40,664
I never took an extra cent
from the company!

965
00:43:41,904 --> 00:43:42,904
Shen Haoming.

966
00:43:43,744 --> 00:43:44,664
You are outrageous.

967
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:54,224
Does your brother-in-law
run a jade shop in town,

968
00:43:54,824 --> 00:43:55,744
selling antiques?

969
00:43:55,983 --> 00:43:56,503
Yes.

970
00:43:57,184 --> 00:43:58,904
A legitimate business
with proper licenses.

971
00:43:59,023 --> 00:43:59,583
What's wrong?

972
00:44:00,623 --> 00:44:01,143
Moreover,

973
00:44:01,184 --> 00:44:02,423
my brother-in-law

974
00:44:02,463 --> 00:44:03,503
has nothing to do with me.

975
00:44:04,623 --> 00:44:05,623
Including stone gambles?

976
00:44:07,463 --> 00:44:08,423
A stone

977
00:44:08,543 --> 00:44:09,704
costs tens of thousands,

978
00:44:10,464 --> 00:44:11,664
or even hundreds of thousands.

979
00:44:11,784 --> 00:44:12,344
Man!

980
00:44:12,463 --> 00:44:13,824
That's the gamble!

981
00:44:14,023 --> 00:44:14,664
Take all

982
00:44:14,704 --> 00:44:15,664
or lose all.

983
00:44:15,744 --> 00:44:16,423
What's wrong?

984
00:44:25,304 --> 00:44:26,983
Are they really involving
gamble on stones

985
00:44:28,023 --> 00:44:30,744
or transferring the kickback to you?

986
00:44:45,744 --> 00:44:49,824
You contracted the project
to suspicious Anqiang.

987
00:44:51,423 --> 00:44:54,128
Mr. Wu transferred huge kickbacks

988
00:44:54,416 --> 00:44:57,423
through stone gambling.

989
00:45:00,143 --> 00:45:02,904
You committed seriously derelict

990
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:07,423
and embezzled company assets.

991
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:11,023
For major embezzlement, you'll get 3

992
00:45:11,784 --> 00:45:13,904
to 10 years imprisonment.

993
00:45:15,943 --> 00:45:20,224
Massive amounts,
you'll get over 10 years imprisonment

994
00:45:20,943 --> 00:45:22,063
or life sentence.

995
00:45:23,704 --> 00:45:24,983
You know it, right?

996
00:45:28,784 --> 00:45:30,344
Stop racking your brains.

997
00:45:31,864 --> 00:45:33,184
One last chance for you.

998
00:45:34,623 --> 00:45:35,543
Tell me,

999
00:45:36,023 --> 00:45:39,704
who's protecting you in Jinda Group?

1000
00:45:42,224 --> 00:45:45,264
You handled
the Hongyun project delay well.

1001
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:47,423
Chairman,

1002
00:45:47,664 --> 00:45:50,943
all connections between
our staff and Mr. Zhang

1003
00:45:52,023 --> 00:45:53,224
are listed here.

1004
00:45:53,664 --> 00:45:55,583
Should I handle the follow-up?

1005
00:45:56,063 --> 00:45:57,184
No, I'll handle it.

1006
00:45:57,664 --> 00:46:00,720
Your divorce cooling-off period
with Xu Yan should end soon, right?

1007
00:46:00,943 --> 00:46:02,423
When will you finalize it?

1008
00:46:03,784 --> 00:46:04,664
8th next month.

1009
00:46:05,224 --> 00:46:06,143
Keep it low-key.

1010
00:46:06,824 --> 00:46:07,463
Stay discreet.

1011
00:46:08,543 --> 00:46:09,063
Got it.

1012
00:46:09,784 --> 00:46:10,344
I'm leaving.

1013
00:46:16,847 --> 00:46:17,447

of the project delay)

00:46:22,066 --> 00:46:24,528

linked to Zhang Youcai, Qu Mingcheng)

1016
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,304
Qu hasn't arrived yet?

1017
00:46:28,904 --> 00:46:29,423
Alright.

1018
00:46:29,503 --> 00:46:30,184
Let's begin.

1019
00:46:30,828 --> 00:46:33,851
(Persons linked to Zhang Youcai,
Qu Mingcheng)

1020
00:46:44,423 --> 00:46:45,864
The Hongyun incident was exposed.

1021
00:46:46,623 --> 00:46:48,463
Mr. Shen must be on high alert.

1022
00:46:50,744 --> 00:46:54,423
Shen Haoming's marriage
is their weakness now.

1023
00:46:55,904 --> 00:46:58,423
I heard he is getting divorced
from his wife.

1024
00:46:59,023 --> 00:47:00,063
Investigate this.

1025
00:47:00,503 --> 00:47:03,023
