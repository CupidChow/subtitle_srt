good day.

00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:18,401
(Strategic Cooperation Signing Ceremony)
This is the venue

31
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:21,080
for Jinda Group and Shifeng Group's
strategic cooperation signing.

32
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:24,281
First, let's give
a warm round of applause

33
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:26,921
to extend our most sincere welcome
to all the leaders

34
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:28,841
and guests present here today.

35
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,041
Welcome!

36
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,041
Alright,

37
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,081
now please welcome
the two representatives to the stage.

38
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,320
Mr. Shen Jinsong,
Chairman of Jinda Group,

39
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:44,200
and Mr. Zheng Yuanzhou,
Chairman of Shifeng Group,

40
00:02:44,521 --> 00:02:45,801
please come forward to sign.

41
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:46,681
Applause please.

42
00:02:55,361 --> 00:02:55,801
Very well.

43
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,640
Both representatives,
please hold the ceremonial pens.

44
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,241
Three, two, one.

45
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:02,961
Please sign the documents.

46
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,600
Hold on!

47
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,160
A moment if I may.

48
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:14,200
Zheng Yuanzhou,

49
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:16,480
during Shifeng Group's board election,

50
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,640
you unlawfully
obtained votes and benefits

51
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,801
through bribery, etc.

52
00:03:20,121 --> 00:03:21,801
Your actions
constitute suspected bribery.

53
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:24,480
Here is the warrant.

54
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:26,320
Read it.

55
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,880
Come with us for investigation.

56
00:03:29,241 --> 00:03:29,801
Cuff him.

57
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,640
Step aside.

58
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,841
Step aside.

59
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:44,561
Please make way.

60
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,509
(Shen)

61
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:51,160
Mr. Shen,

62
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,241
the news of our impending cooperation
with Shifeng was released early.

63
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,361
When Mr. Zheng's scandal broke,

64
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:58,681
our stock price started plummeting
at market open.

65
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:00,961
If there's no recovery by tomorrow,

66
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,920
shareholders will likely
convene an emergency board meeting.

67
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:07,320
I see.

68
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,320
Mr. Shen.

69
00:04:12,561 --> 00:04:12,920
Dad.

70
00:04:13,081 --> 00:04:13,681
Don't call me.

71
00:04:15,361 --> 00:04:15,920
Go home.

72
00:04:19,521 --> 00:04:21,640
I came to report something important.

73
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,561
Zheng Yuanzhou's
bribery-fueled chairmanship election

74
00:04:26,241 --> 00:04:28,640
has destroyed his reputation.

75
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:31,160
Shifeng Group
can't escape the fallout either.

76
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,920
Several agreed-upon projects

77
00:04:33,561 --> 00:04:36,040
are now facing withdrawal
from key partners.

78
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,920
I've decided to collaborate with Shouke

79
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,681
to reclaim those projects.

80
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:42,081
That's preposterous!

81
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:43,841
What's the point of that?

82
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:44,960
We have no land.

83
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,200
Shouke and I secured it

84
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,400
through bidding.

85
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:52,801
Land acquisition requires funds.

86
00:04:53,121 --> 00:04:54,320
Where's your money?

87
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,001
Yuanhang Fund.

88
00:04:56,801 --> 00:04:57,520
Yuanhang?

89
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:03,041
These people and affairs

90
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:06,280
couldn't have been achieved overnight.

91
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:10,681
Unless you had a long-term,
meticulous plan

92
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,241
already in motion.

93
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,601
Even with such a plan,

94
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,080
if Zheng hadn't imploded,

95
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,840
it couldn't have been executed.

96
00:05:25,921 --> 00:05:27,440
You knew Zheng's downfall?

97
00:05:30,001 --> 00:05:31,320
Dad, I warned you before.

98
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:32,161
You forgot.

99
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,161
Zheng Yuanzhou has three confidants.

100
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,200
The last-ranked one is the most capable.

101
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:39,601
He overworked

102
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,200
but didn't gain enough credit
for a long time.

103
00:05:42,681 --> 00:05:43,840
Resentment was inevitable.

104
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:48,520
Wait.

105
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,640
Let me confirm.

106
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,361
You're implying

107
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,840
that you orchestrated Zheng's downfall?

108
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:58,121
Certain truths should remain
between father and son.

109
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,880
Hold on.

110
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,681
Move over there.

111
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,481
Tell me.

112
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:07,241
How did you secure that man's loyalty?

113
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,440
During my London internship,

114
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,041
I flew back five times.

115
00:06:13,481 --> 00:06:14,520
He avoided me each time.

116
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,161
On the sixth attempt, he met me.

117
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,161
We immediately aligned.

118
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:20,960
All terms were agreed upon.

119
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,640
I emphasized three points:

120
00:06:25,921 --> 00:06:26,640
recognition,

121
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,280
sincerity,

122
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,601
and benefits.

123
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:33,241
I showed him my character
and convinced him

124
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,960
that when I pursue goals,

125
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,400
I spare no effort to achieve them.

126
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,041
Dad,

127
00:06:52,721 --> 00:06:55,520
I know you've never wanted me
involved in the projects.

128
00:06:56,361 --> 00:07:00,520
I can now publicly announce the news
about our cooperation with Shouke

129
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,640
and use the company's
stock price recovery

130
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,400
to reassure shareholders.

131
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,121
Or I can leave Jinda

132
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:09,200
and work with Shouke alone.

133
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,001
Tell me your conditions.

134
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:17,200
First,

135
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,200
I need to bring my own people
into the company.

136
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,640
Whatever department they go,

137
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,561
I want your decisive vote
supporting my choices.

138
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,320
Second,

139
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,280
I need to establish
my own independent department

140
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,200
with full authority
over personnel and financial matters,

141
00:07:31,361 --> 00:07:33,041
free from any interference.

142
00:07:34,241 --> 00:07:35,801
I hope to gain your support.

143
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:46,440
All departments, get ready.

144
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:47,320
Host, get ready.

145
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,400
Counting down.

146
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:53,520
Five, four, three, two, one.

147
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,400
(Host: Xu Yan)
The city's renowned real estate firms,

148
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,001
Jinda Group and Shouke Real Estate,
have established strategic cooperation

149
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,601
in jointly developing Plot 178.

150
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,400
Both companies stated

151
00:08:03,481 --> 00:08:05,640
this marks a milestone collaboration,

152
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,161
signifying that both companies

153
00:08:07,241 --> 00:08:10,400
have taken solid steps
in diversified development strategies

154
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,440
while creating new opportunities
and growth potential for the industry.

155
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,520
Jinda Group will adopt Shouke's
technology and management expertise

156
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:21,721
to further enhance project quality
and service standards

157
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,320
to provide consumers with quality,
convenient residential and commercial

158
00:08:25,361 --> 00:08:26,320
experiences.

159
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,320
(Reportedly, this cooperation
was spearheaded by Shen Haoming,)

160
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,921
(Jinda Group's Vice President
and head of the Plot 178 task force.)

161
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:36,880
(He stated
that the successful agreement signing)

162
00:08:37,121 --> 00:08:39,921
(resulted from the company's
long-term commitment to innovation)

163
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,520
(and deepened cooperation.)

164
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,520
(That concludes
the latest city updates.)

165
00:08:44,561 --> 00:08:47,121
(We'll continue
monitoring follow-up developments)

166
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:50,561
(to bring you
more comprehensive coverage.)

167
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,681
Shen Jinsong

168
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,161
dares not face me.

169
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:58,880
Shen Haoming,

170
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,760
you just rose to power

171
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,640
and are finding ways to sabotage me.

172
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:05,280
First you promoted me sideways,

173
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,201
pushing me out of core departments

174
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:08,560
and marginalizing me.

175
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,520
You really are something.

176
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,680
I watched you grow up.

177
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:19,400
Is this how you
treat your father's key contributor?

178
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,601
There's no denying

179
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,880
you've brought the company
significant profits.

180
00:09:26,121 --> 00:09:27,760
But while generating revenue,

181
00:09:29,241 --> 00:09:30,880
plenty found its way into your pockets.

182
00:09:34,121 --> 00:09:35,201
You earn 3 million annually

183
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:37,361
and own two villas,

184
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:39,400
one with a 200-square-meter garden.

185
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,560
You also have

186
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,001
properties in America and Australia.

187
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,760
Over these years,

188
00:09:44,841 --> 00:09:46,680
you helped my father build this empire

189
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,121
as one of the founding pioneers.

190
00:09:49,241 --> 00:09:50,520
I've always respected you

191
00:09:51,081 --> 00:09:52,841
for your decades of dedication

192
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:53,601
and hard work.

193
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,001
But your pay has been the highest
in the industry.

194
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,680
We haven't wronged you.

195
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,160
What I can do is

196
00:10:03,081 --> 00:10:05,040
when legal authorities prosecute you,

197
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:09,361
I'll demonstrate to the court
about your cooperative attitude

198
00:10:09,361 --> 00:10:10,640
and your voluntary compensation.

199
00:10:13,241 --> 00:10:14,001
Stop thinking.

200
00:10:17,441 --> 00:10:18,841
This is your only option.

201
00:10:21,008 --> 00:10:22,512
(Resignation Agreement)

202
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:38,520
What brings you?

203
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:41,520
I knew you were working late.

204
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,361
So I wanted to ask you out
for late-night snacks.

205
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:46,481
Since you mention it,

206
00:10:46,481 --> 00:10:47,520
I am actually hungry.

207
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,880
I just need to send an email.

208
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:50,520
No problem, I'll wait.

209
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,640
Okay.

210
00:10:53,241 --> 00:10:53,841
Let's go.

211
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:56,280
What to eat?

212
00:10:59,001 --> 00:11:00,081
That place from before?

213
00:11:00,321 --> 00:11:00,760
Okay.

214
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,441
Haoming.

215
00:11:04,441 --> 00:11:05,121
Mr. Wu.

216
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,201
Still working this late?

217
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,640
I need to talk with you.

218
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,001
Haoming, perhaps...

219
00:11:16,601 --> 00:11:17,201
Go ahead.

220
00:11:17,841 --> 00:11:19,400
I acknowledge my mistakes.

221
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,601
I accept the company's punishment.

222
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,201
But could you
consider my years of service

223
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,361
and give me one more chance?

224
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,001
I don't want to leave.

225
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,241
Mr. Wu,

226
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,920
you should've anticipated consequences
before acting.

227
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,280
Staying with the company is impossible.

228
00:11:41,961 --> 00:11:42,560
Let's go.

229
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:44,760
Haoming,

230
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,361
my wife left me
and took the kids with her.

231
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,961
I got nothing in the divorce.

232
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,920
Being fired at my age,

233
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:53,400
if this gets out,

234
00:11:54,321 --> 00:11:55,321
I will be ruined

235
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:57,160
and no company would ever hire me again.

236
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,121
Even my own wife and kids
look down on me.

237
00:12:02,481 --> 00:12:03,201
I'm sorry.

238
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,760
Haoming,

239
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,760
I've truly lost everything.

240
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,721
Please have some mercy

241
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,201
and let me stay in the company.

242
00:12:12,841 --> 00:12:15,920
Even a meaningless position would do.

243
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,961
I've truly lost everything.

244
00:12:21,201 --> 00:12:21,841
Mr. Wu,

245
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,680
consider it early retirement.

246
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,601
The company
can't make exceptions for this.

247
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,640
Let's go.

248
00:12:33,841 --> 00:12:34,481
Haoming.

249
00:12:36,241 --> 00:12:36,880
Haoming!

250
00:12:42,841 --> 00:12:43,481
Are you okay?

251
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,201
I'm fine.

252
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,241
Seems you really need to retire.

253
00:12:54,601 --> 00:12:55,481
Let me go!

254
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:57,321
You alright?

255
00:13:15,344 --> 00:13:16,436
(Fang Lei)

256
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:44,441
Back so early?

257
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,760
How's your injury?

258
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,040
I'm fine. Don't worry.

259
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:52,800
Let me see.

260
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:55,841
Haoming.

261
00:13:56,001 --> 00:14:00,201
I got you a supplementary card.

262
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,001
No spending limit. Use it freely.

263
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:07,481
What's this reward for?

264
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:10,081
Go shopping after you recover.

265
00:14:10,321 --> 00:14:11,481
Buy whatever you like.

266
00:14:13,481 --> 00:14:14,560
I don't want this.

267
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:16,760
You must keep the card.

268
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:17,400
Here.

269
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,560
There are more to come.

270
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,920
That's not what I meant.

271
00:14:26,841 --> 00:14:27,321
Hello?

272
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,321
I see.

273
00:14:30,841 --> 00:14:31,640
I'm coming over now.

274
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:35,201
It's about Wu Deliang.

275
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,721
I need to go to the office.

276
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:41,361
Will you be back for dinner?

277
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,280
Sure.

278
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,400
Order takeout.

279
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,601
Don't cook yourself.

280
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:47,961
I'll wait for you.

281
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:12,601
Mr. Fang,

282
00:15:12,601 --> 00:15:13,680
long time no see.

283
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,961
How have you been in America?

284
00:15:16,481 --> 00:15:17,121
Pretty well.

285
00:15:18,841 --> 00:15:19,880
I came back this time

286
00:15:20,081 --> 00:15:22,321
mainly for the New District project
you're handling.

287
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,680
Lei told me everything.

288
00:15:24,481 --> 00:15:27,121
Your return
couldn't have come at a better time.

289
00:15:27,841 --> 00:15:31,160
The New District project's funding
relies entirely on you now.

290
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,601
Haoming,

291
00:15:34,081 --> 00:15:35,321
I know your capabilities.

292
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:37,280
For the final signing phase,

293
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,201
I'll lend my support.

294
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,441
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

295
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,201
Has Lei been any trouble at Jinda Group?

296
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,241
Not at all.

297
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,640
Lei's the only daughter I have left.

298
00:15:50,081 --> 00:15:52,081
Please continue looking after her.

299
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:55,760
Fang Lei's been calling me 'brother'
since her teens.

300
00:15:56,241 --> 00:15:57,201
Now that she's back,

301
00:15:57,361 --> 00:15:58,880
it's right that I

302
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,160
care for her.

303
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,920
Shame Fang Yu left us too soon.

304
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,081
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

305
00:16:18,081 --> 00:16:19,001
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

306
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,961
Goodbye.

307
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,361
Son, over here.

308
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,880
- Bye.
- Bye.

309
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,560
Haoming!

310
00:16:26,081 --> 00:16:27,400
What brings you here?

311
00:16:28,961 --> 00:16:30,760
Since when
do you have time to pick me up?

312
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,560
Thought I was seeing things.

313
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,400
What do you want?

314
00:16:33,441 --> 00:16:34,121
I'll take you.

315
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,560
Burgers, fried chicken, and fries.

316
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,201
Where to after eating?

317
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,201
Are you free today?

318
00:16:41,441 --> 00:16:42,680
I'm all yours today.

319
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,280
Really?

320
00:16:45,241 --> 00:16:47,361
It's not my birthday, is it?

321
00:16:50,721 --> 00:16:51,952
- Seatbelt.
- Okay.

322
00:16:57,961 --> 00:16:59,920
Let's play a game.

323
00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:01,121
What game?

324
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,361
I want to create
a fantasy football team.

325
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,721
You have two options each time

326
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:06,640
and need to pick one.

327
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,280
Deal.

328
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,001
First, the goalkeeper.

329
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:15,841
Buffon or Kahn?

330
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:18,880
Isn't Kahn

331
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:19,961
the captain?

332
00:17:20,361 --> 00:17:21,001
What?

333
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,081
Well...

334
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:23,400
Right, he's Germany's captain.

335
00:17:23,721 --> 00:17:26,721
No, Kahn is English.

336
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,001
I confused him with that striker.

337
00:17:32,681 --> 00:17:33,840
Exactly. What's funny?

338
00:17:34,161 --> 00:17:35,040
The striker,

339
00:17:35,161 --> 00:17:35,681
Messi,

340
00:17:36,161 --> 00:17:36,681
right?

341
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:37,360
Okay.

342
00:17:37,961 --> 00:17:38,840
Let's do it tomorrow.

343
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,161
Okay.

344
00:17:39,681 --> 00:17:41,001
- Sleep. It's late.
- Haoming.

345
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,320
Let's do this often from now on, okay?

346
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:45,320
Deal.

347
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,120
Sleep.

348
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,840
Let's team up every night.

349
00:17:50,921 --> 00:17:52,560
First decide between Ronaldo and Messi.

350
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,280
Then tell me.

351
00:17:54,201 --> 00:17:55,320
Think carefully.

352
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,881
It's the ultimate dilemma.

353
00:17:57,481 --> 00:17:57,921
True.

354
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,120
Bedtime.

355
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,928
(Yan)

356
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,600
Are you leaving again?

357
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,641
No.

358
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,360
I'm staying.

359
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,456
(Yan)

360
00:18:26,032 --> 00:18:28,112
(Haoming)

361
00:18:30,982 --> 00:18:33,552
(Haoming)

362
00:18:40,721 --> 00:18:43,320
(A woman's sixth sense tells me
there's a crisis approaching.)

363
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,080
(I sense that sandcastle we built)

364
00:18:48,201 --> 00:18:49,881
(is gradually collapsing)

365
00:18:51,161 --> 00:18:52,120
(and crumbling.)

366
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:58,600
Dear viewers,

367
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,840
we've finally located
this hidden noodle shop in the alley.

368
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:04,921
Let's find out together what makes

369
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:06,681
this 30-year-old noodle shop so special.

370
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,560
I'll be your taste tester today.

371
00:19:13,641 --> 00:19:17,080
The noodles have a wonderfully chewy
and springy texture.

372
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:17,881
Siwei,

373
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,800
take another bite.

374
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,961
A big mouthful.

375
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,120
I can't resist

376
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,641
wanting another big bite.

377
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,560
Cut! Stop!

378
00:19:34,401 --> 00:19:37,641
Mom, I'm begging you.

379
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,201
Get me a different job, please?

380
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,600
I...

381
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:47,280
I can't take this anymore.

382
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,161
I'm filming outdoor segments daily,

383
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:50,721
eating at 7 to 8 restaurants per day.

384
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:52,001
I'm gonna puke!

385
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,721
Sun Siwei,

386
00:19:53,921 --> 00:19:54,800
listen to me.

387
00:19:54,921 --> 00:19:55,881
No way.

388
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:56,961
We can't support you.

389
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,161
What's more important? Me or money?

390
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,560
Money!

391
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,320
Mom?

392
00:20:09,401 --> 00:20:10,441
Siwei, hurry up.

393
00:20:10,721 --> 00:20:11,721
Next shop's waiting.

394
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:12,800
Coming.

395
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,001
Forget anniversaries.

396
00:20:23,161 --> 00:20:23,840
Not even gifts

397
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:25,080
for birthdays.

398
00:20:25,201 --> 00:20:26,401
Always 'forgot' when asked.

399
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:28,600
Oh god, same with mine.

400
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,681
He literally doesn't see me at all.

401
00:20:30,681 --> 00:20:31,721
He only cares about work.

402
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,481
Oh my.

403
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,481
It's not worth it at all.

404
00:20:34,481 --> 00:20:35,040
Exactly.

405
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,881
Can you believe it?

406
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:37,280
Same thing last night.

407
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:37,921
Morning, Yan.

408
00:20:38,201 --> 00:20:38,721
Morning, Yan.

409
00:20:38,721 --> 00:20:39,201
Morning.

410
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,881
Your guy's the best.

411
00:20:40,881 --> 00:20:41,320
Yan,

412
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,201
- the files you wanted.
- Every day

413
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,520
he picks you up after work.

414
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,001
Don't get me started on him.

415
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,520
He has no sense of style

416
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,681
and no career ambition.

417
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,241
A total clueless big man,

418
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,401
immune to romance.

419
00:20:50,721 --> 00:20:51,881
After coming home,

420
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,600
he doesn't say a word to me.

421
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:54,441
Really?

422
00:20:54,441 --> 00:20:55,241
He's useless.

423
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,401
Yan, you're the real champion.

424
00:20:57,921 --> 00:20:59,040
With privileged background,

425
00:20:59,161 --> 00:20:59,840
you work hard

426
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:01,600
and have earned your top spot.

427
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:03,560
You even married an amazing husband.

428
00:21:04,161 --> 00:21:05,560
You live a charmed life.

429
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,481
No kidding.

430
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,241
Your husband keeps sending gifts.

431
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,001
Is the proposal for
our planning meeting ready?

432
00:21:13,641 --> 00:21:14,641
Right away.

433
00:21:14,721 --> 00:21:15,881
We're working on it now.

434
00:21:17,481 --> 00:21:18,280
Jiang Lai,

435
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,600
is this the script you wrote?

436
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,441
Have you read it yourself?

437
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,681
Is it human language?

438
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,840
Sorry. I'll revise it.

439
00:21:45,401 --> 00:21:47,001
I've reviewed your field recording.

440
00:21:48,401 --> 00:21:49,401
You seemed uneasy eating.

441
00:21:50,681 --> 00:21:51,721
What'd the audience think?

442
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,280
Will they find it interesting?

443
00:21:57,001 --> 00:21:57,800
I tried my best.

444
00:21:58,921 --> 00:22:01,241
I've never eaten cheap noodles
since childhood.

445
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,921
How happy did you expect me to look?

446
00:22:03,401 --> 00:22:04,520
The audience is smart

447
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,481
and sensitive.

448
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,201
So don't patronize them
with your half-hearted efforts.

449
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,641
For the next episode's video,

450
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,201
I need you

451
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,401
to show sincerity in every single frame.

452
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,961
Stop wearing heels
during field recordings.

453
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,481
Wear sneakers.

454
00:22:30,721 --> 00:22:31,520
They're convenient.

455
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,800
Heels slow down filming

456
00:22:33,921 --> 00:22:35,280
and are safety hazards.

457
00:22:35,481 --> 00:22:37,241
You're part of my team now.

458
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,120
I need to ensure both safety
and work quality for all my team.

459
00:22:42,441 --> 00:22:43,600
Understood?

460
00:22:47,921 --> 00:22:49,760
Earlier, people were praising you,

461
00:22:49,881 --> 00:22:51,241
calling you the 'female lead'.

462
00:22:52,161 --> 00:22:54,600
But that image doesn't match

463
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,120
your actual mindset or taste.

464
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,161
I choose shoes by their looks,

465
00:22:59,481 --> 00:23:01,360
not convenience.

466
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,280
That's nouveau riche mentality.

467
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,760
Sun Siwei.

468
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,881
Siwei means thinking.

469
00:23:12,161 --> 00:23:13,241
With a name like that,

470
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,560
you never use your brain.

471
00:23:17,881 --> 00:23:19,800
Your husband is a great catch.

472
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:21,320
With so many options,

473
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:24,201
why does he obey you blindly?

474
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,800
Could there be something fishy?

475
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,560
Could it be guilt compensation

476
00:23:35,961 --> 00:23:37,360
or creating smokescreens?

477
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,560
You better watch out.

478
00:23:42,641 --> 00:23:43,401
Siwei,

479
00:23:44,001 --> 00:23:47,280
you know scumbag tactics so well.

480
00:23:48,161 --> 00:23:50,241
Is your boyfriend one?

481
00:23:50,921 --> 00:23:51,481
Yan,

482
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,520
we're ready

483
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,280
to film.

484
00:23:54,241 --> 00:23:55,080
Let's go.

485
00:24:01,241 --> 00:24:02,681
Dear viewers,

486
00:24:02,681 --> 00:24:03,320
hello.

487
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,921
Welcome to Financial News.

488
00:24:04,961 --> 00:24:06,001
I'm your host, Xu Yan.

489
00:24:06,001 --> 00:24:07,201
(Jinda And Shouke
Build a Smart New District)

490
00:24:07,201 --> 00:24:10,520
After Jinda Group
and Shouke Real Estate's partnership,

491
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,001
public attention remains high.

492
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:16,161
Today, on behalf of both companies,
Mr. Shen Haoming,

493
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,401
Jinda's representative,

494
00:24:17,681 --> 00:24:21,721
announced the development theme
and plan for Plot 178.

495
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:26,280
Haoming.

496
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,881
It's the cooperation agreement
my father drafted for the New District.

497
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:32,760
Qualifications,

498
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:33,961
responsibility division,

499
00:24:34,161 --> 00:24:35,040
collaboration model,

500
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:36,120
construction plans,

501
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,320
and risk sharing.

502
00:24:37,441 --> 00:24:39,560
I've highlighted key sections for you.

503
00:24:39,921 --> 00:24:40,560
Take a look.

504
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,241
You're new to the industry,

505
00:24:48,161 --> 00:24:51,280
but your competence surprises me.

506
00:24:52,681 --> 00:24:55,201
Your approval means everything.

507
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,481
To help you

508
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,681
and this project

509
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,961
is my goal.

510
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,201
Next,

511
00:25:00,481 --> 00:25:01,600
I'll strive to do better.

512
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,001
It's getting late.

513
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,568
I'll drive you home.

514
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,520
No need.

515
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,192
I'm heading the other way.

516
00:25:11,921 --> 00:25:12,921
I'll get a ride-hail.

517
00:25:12,921 --> 00:25:13,721
It's convenient.

518
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,681
And after making you
miss Xu Yan's birthday,

519
00:25:19,161 --> 00:25:21,840
I still feel guilty.

520
00:25:22,961 --> 00:25:23,721
I'm sorry.

521
00:25:24,001 --> 00:25:25,600
It's fine. It's all in the past now.

522
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,360
Let's go.

523
00:25:34,401 --> 00:25:35,001
You okay?

524
00:25:35,241 --> 00:25:35,721
I'm fine.

525
00:25:35,721 --> 00:25:37,481
I skipped dinner.

526
00:25:37,481 --> 00:25:38,201
I'm feeling dizzy.

527
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,201
Sit down.

528
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,080
Thanks.

529
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,800
Eat this.

530
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,520
Take the whole box.

531
00:26:06,161 --> 00:26:07,241
You work late often.

532
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,104
It's easy to get low blood sugar.

533
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,721
Keep some sweets handy.

534
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:12,560
Thank you.

535
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:18,721
Take your time eating.

536
00:26:19,001 --> 00:26:20,001
I'll drive you home.

537
00:27:06,241 --> 00:27:06,921
Haoming,

538
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,120
thanks for the ride.

539
00:27:10,201 --> 00:27:10,881
Don't mention it.

540
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,241
Go up.

541
00:27:18,481 --> 00:27:20,241
After this project wraps up,

542
00:27:20,961 --> 00:27:22,641
can we go see a movie together?

543
00:27:25,681 --> 00:27:27,681
I just want a reward for myself.

544
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,881
The approval from my superior.

545
00:27:33,001 --> 00:27:33,641
Okay.

546
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,201
Pick a movie.

547
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,161
Great.

548
00:27:39,641 --> 00:27:40,560
Bye, Haoming.

549
00:27:52,641 --> 00:27:53,840
Why do you have this?

550
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,760
I've been looking everywhere for it.

551
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,760
I found it.

552
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:10,360
The reward.

553
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,721
Bye, Haoming.

554
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:42,840
Haoming.

555
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,760
You're here.

556
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,641
Yeah.

557
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,360
Yan, you're here too.

558
00:28:49,721 --> 00:28:51,280
Feels like ages since I last saw you.

559
00:28:51,881 --> 00:28:53,201
I've been busy lately.

560
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,201
I'm free today.

561
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,520
I came to accompany Haoming.

562
00:28:59,201 --> 00:28:59,921
Are you alone?

563
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,520
Let's play.

564
00:29:03,721 --> 00:29:04,560
Is that okay?

565
00:29:04,681 --> 00:29:06,161
Yan rarely gets to accompany you.

566
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:07,840
Aren't you worried I'll crash your date?

567
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,120
It's fine.

568
00:29:09,921 --> 00:29:11,520
Haoming wanted me to join him,

569
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,481
but I can't grasp it.

570
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:13,681
Perfect you came.

571
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:15,040
Haoming,

572
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,441
go easy on your sister.

573
00:29:17,681 --> 00:29:18,280
No need.

574
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,840
We'll keep it fair since it's a match.

575
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,001
No advantages taken.

576
00:29:24,401 --> 00:29:25,441
Which club first?

577
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,120
Iron club.

578
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,441
That suits me better.

579
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,320
I'll go first.

580
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:45,800
Nice shot.

581
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:47,800
Haoming,

582
00:29:48,201 --> 00:29:49,161
are you free tonight?

583
00:29:49,881 --> 00:29:52,001
Let me treat you and Yan to dinner.

584
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,641
I have a dinner
with Yuanhang Fund tonight.

585
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,560
Why don't you join us?

586
00:29:58,441 --> 00:29:59,881
Mr. Yun, Mr. Liang,

587
00:30:00,001 --> 00:30:01,712
and their executive team
will be there too.

588
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,921
They might ask technical questions.

589
00:30:04,241 --> 00:30:05,320
We can play off each other.

590
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,481
I'll follow your lead.

591
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:13,840
Let's have dinner together tonight.

592
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,001
I'll skip the work dinner.

593
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:17,840
Actually,

594
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,441
I'm having dinner with my cousin.

595
00:30:19,481 --> 00:30:19,921
Okay.

596
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:21,120
Careful, it's hot.

597
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,641
How's the temperature?

598
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:23,681
Just right.

599
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,241
You've practiced a lot.

600
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,280
Not really.

601
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,040
Didn't you teach me everything I know?

602
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,401
I never liked golfing in London.

603
00:30:38,201 --> 00:30:39,600
If you hadn't kept inviting me,

604
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:40,800
I would've quit long ago.

605
00:30:41,001 --> 00:30:42,360
So thank you.

606
00:30:51,961 --> 00:30:52,760
No way.

607
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,280
They could never be together.

608
00:30:54,961 --> 00:30:55,800
Keep your voice down.

609
00:30:57,961 --> 00:30:59,520
No matter what happens,

610
00:30:59,641 --> 00:31:01,800
he'd never fall for another woman.

611
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,241
Even if every man cheated,

612
00:31:03,241 --> 00:31:04,241
he wouldn't. Understand?

613
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,001
You've only met him a few times.

614
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,201
Why trust him so much?

615
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,721
True, I haven't seen him often,

616
00:31:12,241 --> 00:31:14,080
but I observe carefully each time

617
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:15,481
and see it clearly.

618
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,280
Every second, he only has eyes for you.

619
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,001
But we used to share everything.

620
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:35,721
Now it feels like glass separates us.

621
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,040
We can see each other,

622
00:31:39,681 --> 00:31:41,080
but can't get closer.

623
00:31:43,161 --> 00:31:45,161
Maybe you're overthinking?

624
00:31:45,481 --> 00:31:47,721
Look, he's a businessman

625
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,360
working around clock.

626
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,161
Maybe he's just tired.

627
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,401
Right?

628
00:31:53,921 --> 00:31:55,760
We finally got together today.

629
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,280
Forget him.

630
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:56,840
Let's drink.

631
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,921
Haoming,

632
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,520
don't you think I'm great?

633
00:32:13,201 --> 00:32:17,641
Today I finally got Jiang Yun
and Jiang Liang into signing for you.

634
00:32:18,441 --> 00:32:20,560
Our efforts finally paid off.

635
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:22,120
You did great.

636
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,840
You acted very professionally.

637
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,320
Well done.

638
00:32:26,881 --> 00:32:27,840
I'll get you some water.

639
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,161
Haoming,

640
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:38,201
take a good look at me.

641
00:32:43,241 --> 00:32:44,481
I grew up long ago.

642
00:32:50,896 --> 00:32:52,336
(Yan)

643
00:33:09,264 --> 00:33:10,288
(Chen Lin)

644
00:33:15,481 --> 00:33:16,760
Can you not answer that?

645
00:33:17,721 --> 00:33:18,320
It's Chen Lin.

646
00:33:20,401 --> 00:33:21,280
Then answer it.

647
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,401
Hello?

648
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,441
It's done.

649
00:33:28,201 --> 00:33:28,681
The photo

650
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,560
is sent to you.

651
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,201
Okay.

652
00:33:44,181 --> 00:33:45,680
(Signatures)

653
00:33:47,921 --> 00:33:49,360
Why show me this?

654
00:33:49,721 --> 00:33:50,961
Mr. Huang and your father

655
00:33:51,441 --> 00:33:52,840
just signed the contract in the US.

656
00:33:53,721 --> 00:33:55,481
Good thing your father is on my side.

657
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,441
Or the New District project
wouldn't materialize.

658
00:34:00,961 --> 00:34:03,241
Well he's my father.

659
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:04,721
Naturally he supports

660
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,840
the person I like.

661
00:34:12,641 --> 00:34:13,961
Thank him for me.

662
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,840
Get some rest early.

663
00:34:16,961 --> 00:34:17,881
Shen Haoming,

664
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,481
what are you doing?

665
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,201
Now it's truly settled.

666
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,280
You performed excellently.

667
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,080
You'll be very pleased
with this year's bonus.

668
00:34:31,721 --> 00:34:32,360
Stop.

669
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,420
Were you nice to me

670
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,200
just to win over my father

671
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,281
and keep me in check?

672
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,600
You've been putting on an act with me.

673
00:34:52,001 --> 00:34:53,321
Can't call it an act.

674
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,801
Just to keep you stable

675
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:58,881
and prevent your occasional outbursts.

676
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,841
Shen Haoming!

677
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,040
I love you so much.

678
00:35:02,481 --> 00:35:03,720
You think I'm a lunatic?

679
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,321
I'll tell Xu Yan

680
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,441
and my father

681
00:35:06,441 --> 00:35:07,361
about what you've done.

682
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,401
Suit yourself.

683
00:35:10,801 --> 00:35:12,040
If you dare walk out that door,

684
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,520
I won't let you off.

685
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,841
I'm begging you, Haoming.

686
00:35:17,001 --> 00:35:18,080
I didn't mean to.

687
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,240
Don't be angry.

688
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,080
Mr. Shen.

689
00:35:24,841 --> 00:35:25,321
Han Weiping,

690
00:35:25,321 --> 00:35:26,200
why are you here?

691
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,881
Let me reintroduce you.

692
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,520
Han Weiping,

693
00:35:30,441 --> 00:35:33,441
former senior corporate lawyer
at Jinda Group,

694
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,520
now my private attorney.

695
00:35:36,921 --> 00:35:38,001
You've worked hard lately.

696
00:35:38,361 --> 00:35:39,881
Take your time with the follow-ups.

697
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:40,801
Don't worry.

698
00:35:40,881 --> 00:35:41,841
I'll handle it properly.

699
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:43,040
What do you mean?

700
00:35:43,481 --> 00:35:44,600
Why did you lie to me?

701
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,080
Explain yourself.

702
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,200
Go away.

703
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,401
Go!

704
00:35:51,881 --> 00:35:52,761
Had enough drama?

705
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,160
You...

706
00:35:55,841 --> 00:35:57,481
All of you are liars.

707
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,720
It was all a setup from the beginning.

708
00:36:00,761 --> 00:36:01,801
You trapped me.

709
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,720
You think signing means victory?

710
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,761
I won't forgive any of you.

711
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,640
Especially you, Han Weiping.

712
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:10,680
Miss Fang,

713
00:36:11,401 --> 00:36:12,801
as a professional lawyer,

714
00:36:13,321 --> 00:36:14,881
I advise against escalating conflicts.

715
00:36:15,881 --> 00:36:16,680
What?

716
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,640
Scared now?

717
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,080
I'm not scared.

718
00:36:20,801 --> 00:36:21,921
I want to tell you.

719
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:23,801
You tried to wreck Mr. Shen's family.

720
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,200
For every thing you did

721
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,160
and every word you said,

722
00:36:26,881 --> 00:36:29,600
I have all evidence and recordings.

723
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,600
So I advise you.

724
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:37,001
You're still young.

725
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,120
You need reputation
for future endeavors.

726
00:36:51,921 --> 00:36:53,240
You were my client after all.

727
00:36:53,841 --> 00:36:54,961
I'll let it slide this time.

728
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,520
If there's a next time,

729
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,441
you'll face legal consequences.

730
00:36:58,761 --> 00:36:59,640
Get some rest.

731
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,481
It's late.

732
00:37:43,921 --> 00:37:44,680
Still awake?

733
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:53,841
I'm expecting you.

734
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:57,720
Why didn't you answer your phone?

735
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:00,961
I had something important to handle.

736
00:38:01,761 --> 00:38:03,120
So I didn't call back. Sorry.

737
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,160
Haoming,

738
00:38:14,841 --> 00:38:16,281
I need to tell you something.

739
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:22,240
If it's something that'll make me happy,

740
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:23,560
go ahead and say it.

741
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,361
If it'll upset me,

742
00:38:33,321 --> 00:38:34,640
don't say a single word.

743
00:38:39,801 --> 00:38:40,761
I'm a bit tired.

744
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,441
I need to rest.

745
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,401
Yan.

746
00:39:45,881 --> 00:39:46,680
Why are you here?

747
00:39:48,921 --> 00:39:50,160
I'm here to pick up Haochen.

748
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:51,801
Why are you picking up Haochen?

749
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,600
Does this need a reason?

750
00:39:56,921 --> 00:39:58,200
I'm his biological aunt.

751
00:40:04,441 --> 00:40:05,801
What scheme are you plotting now?

752
00:40:07,761 --> 00:40:08,680
This is a school.

753
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:11,640
Control yourself and leave.

754
00:40:12,361 --> 00:40:13,040
Yan,

755
00:40:15,361 --> 00:40:17,001
actually, every time I face you,

756
00:40:18,281 --> 00:40:20,080
I feel really guilty inside.

757
00:40:21,401 --> 00:40:22,520
Also, I found out

758
00:40:23,001 --> 00:40:24,600
you've been kept in the dark.

759
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,001
I think this situation

760
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,560
is very unfair to you.

761
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:34,881
Actually, Haoming and Haochen
aren't brothers at all.

762
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,401
They're father and son.

763
00:40:48,801 --> 00:40:50,881
When Haoming was studying in London,

764
00:40:51,401 --> 00:40:52,520
he dated my sister.

765
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,640
My sister got accidentally pregnant
and gave birth to Haochen.

766
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,441
But they were still young back then,

767
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
only twenty years old.

768
00:41:00,281 --> 00:41:02,401
My sister made me keep it
from our father.

769
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,560
So the baby was taken
by the Shens immediately after birth.

770
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:13,321
Shen Jinsong and Yu Lan were worried
about an illegitimate child scandal.

771
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,961
Fortunately, not many people
knew about it.

772
00:41:16,481 --> 00:41:18,641
To the public, they said

773
00:41:19,664 --> 00:41:21,321
(it's Haoming's younger brother.)

774
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,961
Later, my sister died
in a diving accident.

775
00:41:28,961 --> 00:41:32,441
That made this matter
a permanent secret.

776
00:41:40,841 --> 00:41:43,881
The three of us are blood-related.

777
00:41:44,321 --> 00:41:45,600
No one can change that

778
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,961
or sever that bond.

779
00:41:47,481 --> 00:41:48,560
In this world,

780
00:41:48,761 --> 00:41:52,040
no one could accept Haochen
more sincerely than me.

781
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:58,640
You probably didn't know this.

782
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,281
On your birthday,

783
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,321
Haoming was at my place.

784
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,321
You didn't answer my call.

785
00:42:07,321 --> 00:42:08,640
I feared something happened.

786
00:42:08,841 --> 00:42:09,361
I'm fine.

787
00:42:09,921 --> 00:42:11,881
Shifeng and Jinda
are signing an agreement.

788
00:42:11,961 --> 00:42:12,921
We had a meeting.

789
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:14,680
So I put my phone on silent.

790
00:42:16,761 --> 00:42:18,281
He probably didn't tell you

791
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,520
what we did together, did he?

792
00:42:35,481 --> 00:42:37,481
Unless Shen Haoming tells me himself,

793
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,680
I won't believe anything you say.

794
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,841
You... you don't think

795
00:42:45,921 --> 00:42:51,040
your relationship with Haoming
is some pure romance, do you?

796
00:42:59,441 --> 00:43:01,600
From the start,
he wasn't looking for a wife.

797
00:43:01,801 --> 00:43:05,640
He wanted a name
to put on a marriage certificate.

798
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,130
You just happened to appear

799
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:11,001
(in his sight at that time.)

800
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,080
But my philosophy is

801
00:43:14,921 --> 00:43:17,321
I must shape it into what I like.

802
00:43:22,801 --> 00:43:24,441
You're not from matching social status,

803
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,401
but you're fairly clever

804
00:43:27,961 --> 00:43:28,921
and ambitious.

805
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,080
You've become a host lately,

806
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:33,761
which perfectly serves
to promote his business

807
00:43:33,921 --> 00:43:34,761
and his character.

808
00:43:35,361 --> 00:43:38,600
I wonder if we could have the honor
of Xu Yan interviewing you.

809
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,921
Consider it
giving the new host a chance.

810
00:43:49,321 --> 00:43:51,200
A seemingly perfect family

811
00:43:51,761 --> 00:43:54,841
can gain him much trust
from business partners.

812
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,401
Plus you're obedient and sensible.

813
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,281
Even knowing he has a child,

814
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,881
you'd still let him control you.

815
00:44:05,001 --> 00:44:08,361
It'd be a perfect
and rational choice for him.

816
00:44:10,401 --> 00:44:11,040
By the way,

817
00:44:12,361 --> 00:44:16,921
you actually thought you became a host
through your own ability?

818
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,001
He put in great effort

819
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,921
to get you that host position.

820
00:44:33,489 --> 00:44:34,896
Bye bye!

821
00:44:34,896 --> 00:44:36,987
- Bye.
- Bye, sir!

822
00:44:41,961 --> 00:44:42,640
Sis-in-law?

823
00:44:44,361 --> 00:44:45,321
Sis-in-law.

824
00:44:53,761 --> 00:44:55,001
(Haochen is your brother.)

825
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,361
(We're family.)

826
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,520
(It's only natural for us
to care for each other.)

827
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,961
(You've done well.)

828
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,401
Thank you, sis-in-law.

829
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,801
(Haochen has been spoiled
ever since he was born.)

830
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,040
(His temper grew worse and worse.)

831
00:45:13,281 --> 00:45:16,720
(I never expected
you'd get along so well with him.)

832
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,961
(I think he genuinely likes you.)
