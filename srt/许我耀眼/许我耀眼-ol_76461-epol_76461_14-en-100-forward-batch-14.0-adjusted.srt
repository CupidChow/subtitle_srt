30
00:02:29,395 --> 00:02:32,075
Fang Lei picked up Haochen
after school today.

31
00:02:37,955 --> 00:02:39,034
She told me

32
00:02:39,154 --> 00:02:40,795
that Shen Haochen is your son.

33
00:02:46,355 --> 00:02:47,395
Is this true?

34
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:08,675
Yes.

35
00:03:10,474 --> 00:03:11,795
He's my illegitimate son.

36
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:15,795
Why did you hide this from me?

37
00:03:16,314 --> 00:03:17,434
Didn't I tell you

38
00:03:17,474 --> 00:03:19,434
that do not say anything

39
00:03:19,434 --> 00:03:20,675
affecting our relationship?

40
00:03:20,714 --> 00:03:22,115
When do you want to tell me?

41
00:03:22,754 --> 00:03:23,675
Never?

42
00:03:25,995 --> 00:03:27,314
I always thought

43
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:31,235
you loved and understood me,

44
00:03:33,275 --> 00:03:35,154
so you've silently supported me

45
00:03:35,154 --> 00:03:36,474
in pursuing my career.

46
00:03:36,795 --> 00:03:38,314
Only today did I realize

47
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:40,634
that you just wanted to use me

48
00:03:40,634 --> 00:03:41,634
and my career

49
00:03:41,634 --> 00:03:43,594
as your tools.

50
00:03:44,235 --> 00:03:45,075
You just want to use

51
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:48,355
my profession to win over Jiang Yun

52
00:03:48,955 --> 00:03:50,515
and every business partner

53
00:03:50,515 --> 00:03:51,995
you needed for your career.

54
00:03:53,955 --> 00:03:55,594
You're just trying to use me.

55
00:03:56,675 --> 00:03:57,714
But I don't understand.

56
00:04:00,194 --> 00:04:01,634
Why did you lie to me?

57
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:25,754
Speaking of it,

58
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:27,795
you're in no position

59
00:04:28,395 --> 00:04:31,074
(Xu Yan's Profile)
to question me.

60
00:04:45,115 --> 00:04:46,235
When I first met you,

61
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:50,155
you possess the charm I like.

62
00:04:51,475 --> 00:04:53,035
You are interesting enough.

63
00:04:56,155 --> 00:04:57,715
My mom is extremely particular,

64
00:04:57,795 --> 00:04:59,754
and few women could win her favor,

65
00:05:00,394 --> 00:05:01,475
but you could.

66
00:05:01,555 --> 00:05:02,595
You get along with her.

67
00:05:03,394 --> 00:05:05,035
I prefer smart women.

68
00:05:06,915 --> 00:05:07,555
Second,

69
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,434
you have the qualities I admire

70
00:05:10,035 --> 00:05:11,074
and the ability to endure.

71
00:05:12,954 --> 00:05:13,834
If I find a woman

72
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:15,514
from a prestigious background,

73
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,834
they might not tolerate

74
00:05:20,314 --> 00:05:21,874
the mistakes of my youth

75
00:05:23,634 --> 00:05:25,035
or accept my son.

76
00:05:29,274 --> 00:05:33,155
You look like a proper noble lady,

77
00:05:33,194 --> 00:05:35,074
but without their arrogance

78
00:05:35,874 --> 00:05:37,595
and unpleasant temper.

79
00:05:39,595 --> 00:05:40,355
Third,

80
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:42,394
your ambition.

81
00:05:44,314 --> 00:05:45,074
From the start,

82
00:05:45,074 --> 00:05:46,634
you wanted to host a Family Feast,

83
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:48,035
and then you aimed

84
00:05:48,035 --> 00:05:50,715
to be a news anchor.

85
00:05:55,115 --> 00:05:56,595
It actually benefits my career.

86
00:05:57,475 --> 00:05:58,394
Yes, I lied to you.

87
00:05:59,274 --> 00:06:00,874
But didn't I generously provide

88
00:06:00,874 --> 00:06:02,194
full support to you?

89
00:06:08,355 --> 00:06:09,274
Lin Tao.

90
00:06:11,274 --> 00:06:12,115
(I put pressure)

91
00:06:12,115 --> 00:06:13,995
(on the bank where he was working.)

92
00:06:15,954 --> 00:06:16,795
Zhou Zeyuan.

93
00:06:18,274 --> 00:06:20,274
He blackmailed and threatened you.

94
00:06:24,915 --> 00:06:26,795
When he was at his wit's end,

95
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:28,035
I gave him funding.

96
00:06:28,274 --> 00:06:30,595
When a gambler is at his wit's end,

97
00:06:30,595 --> 00:06:31,715
he won't turn back.

98
00:06:32,035 --> 00:06:33,355
He would only take a big gamble.

99
00:06:33,555 --> 00:06:35,595
Then, I put him to prison.

100
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,355
Zhou Zeyuan was arrested.

101
00:06:43,355 --> 00:06:44,715
Because I lied to you,

102
00:06:45,675 --> 00:06:47,434
I'm willing to spend money

103
00:06:48,155 --> 00:06:49,834
to maintain your lies unrevealed.

104
00:06:50,475 --> 00:06:51,915
All you need to do

105
00:06:52,355 --> 00:06:53,834
is being a perfect wife

106
00:06:53,874 --> 00:06:55,194
with a respectable job,

107
00:06:55,274 --> 00:06:56,834
keeping my family pleased.

108
00:06:56,995 --> 00:06:57,634
And me?

109
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:58,954
As your husband,

110
00:06:59,314 --> 00:07:00,634
I'll fulfill my duty

111
00:07:01,314 --> 00:07:02,514
to boost your career.

112
00:07:05,314 --> 00:07:07,155
Stop looking at me so pitifully.

113
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:09,514
Didn't you approach me

114
00:07:10,194 --> 00:07:11,475
with ulterior motives?

115
00:07:12,795 --> 00:07:14,074
You tried every mean

116
00:07:14,274 --> 00:07:15,595
to become my wife,

117
00:07:15,715 --> 00:07:17,595
just wanting my wealth, my connections

118
00:07:17,675 --> 00:07:18,795
and all my resources.

119
00:07:20,194 --> 00:07:22,634
You used me to build your credibility,

120
00:07:23,155 --> 00:07:24,475
winning the public trust.

121
00:07:24,754 --> 00:07:26,555
Do you think this is absolutely safe?

122
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,834
They come back to me
once you turn around.

123
00:07:30,194 --> 00:07:31,394
My generosity

124
00:07:31,995 --> 00:07:33,434
made your sweet dreams come true.

125
00:07:33,434 --> 00:07:34,274
Do you know that?

126
00:07:37,675 --> 00:07:39,514
So everything you did to me

127
00:07:39,514 --> 00:07:40,475
was all lies.

128
00:07:43,834 --> 00:07:45,155
I just have one question.

129
00:07:50,274 --> 00:07:51,074
Have you ever...

130
00:07:58,874 --> 00:08:00,475
Have you ever truly loved me?

131
00:08:02,874 --> 00:08:04,954
From the moment I knew you were a fraud,

132
00:08:07,915 --> 00:08:09,355
I would never fall in love with you.

133
00:08:15,675 --> 00:08:16,795
I lied to you too.

134
00:08:19,035 --> 00:08:20,074
I didn't expect you

135
00:08:20,115 --> 00:08:21,074
to genuinely love me.

136
00:08:22,475 --> 00:08:23,715
Just take what we need.

137
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:38,314
I understand now.

138
00:08:46,554 --> 00:08:48,634
I finally understand everything now.

139
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:53,315
So,

140
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,914
when I made your mom happy,

141
00:09:00,715 --> 00:09:02,154
when I treated Haochen well,

142
00:09:04,674 --> 00:09:06,394
when I pleased you,

143
00:09:06,394 --> 00:09:09,195

cars, and jewelry you gave me

144
00:09:11,514 --> 00:09:13,315
were out of love.

145
00:09:18,034 --> 00:09:19,034
But to you,

146
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:23,554
they were just bonus to me, right?

147
00:09:26,475 --> 00:09:29,355
It's kind of my recognition to you

148
00:09:29,794 --> 00:09:31,514

00:12:10,034 --> 00:12:11,394
(And we won't meet again.")

193
00:12:18,595 --> 00:12:19,355
Have you decided?

194
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,394
If you want a divorce,

195
00:12:30,235 --> 00:12:30,914
I'll agree.

196
00:12:32,715 --> 00:12:34,315
The New District project just launched.

197
00:12:35,315 --> 00:12:37,075
My career and family

198
00:12:37,955 --> 00:12:39,715
can't tolerate any disruptions.

199
00:12:40,955 --> 00:12:41,914
My upcoming schedule

200
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,195
requires your presence.

201
00:12:43,914 --> 00:12:46,674
The New District project
launch ceremony is in two days.

202
00:12:47,075 --> 00:12:49,514
As my wife, you must attend.

203
00:12:50,955 --> 00:12:52,235
I don't want anyone

204
00:12:53,115 --> 00:12:55,595
to notice any changes between us.

205
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:08,514
What if I say...

206
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:16,355
I can't do it?

207
00:13:17,075 --> 00:13:19,835
You aren't officially part
of the News Department.

208
00:13:22,355 --> 00:13:23,595
I assume you don't want

209
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:25,075
any mistakes in this process.

210
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:33,856
(Huanhuan's Call)

211
00:14:46,195 --> 00:14:46,874
What's wrong?

212
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,075
Yan, the editing

213
00:14:49,075 --> 00:14:50,715
for the last recording is all done.

214
00:14:50,914 --> 00:14:51,874
When will you come?

215
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:54,274
Hello?

216
00:14:55,235 --> 00:14:56,514
Yan, are you listening?

217
00:14:57,514 --> 00:14:58,115
Hello?

218
00:15:01,715 --> 00:15:02,715
I am coming.

219
00:15:07,435 --> 00:15:09,754
That's all the news for today.

220
00:15:09,955 --> 00:15:11,034
Thank you for watching.

221
00:15:11,075 --> 00:15:12,394
See you.

222
00:15:13,634 --> 00:15:14,715
Great job. Wrap it up.

223
00:15:18,674 --> 00:15:19,235
Thank you.

224
00:15:21,794 --> 00:15:22,435
Xu Yan!

225
00:15:32,995 --> 00:15:33,955
Elegant and composed.

226
00:15:34,794 --> 00:15:35,554
Performed well.

227
00:15:35,955 --> 00:15:37,355
I knew I was right about you.

228
00:15:39,554 --> 00:15:40,355
In today's meeting,

229
00:15:41,154 --> 00:15:43,034
the leaders publicly praised you.

230
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:47,355
They decided to have you host
the next Financial Forum.

231
00:15:48,274 --> 00:15:49,075
As you know,

232
00:15:49,274 --> 00:15:50,835
hosting the Financial Forum

233
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,595
is the ultimate recognition
from the leaders.

234
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:57,674
Thank you.

235
00:15:57,914 --> 00:15:59,115
Don't mention it.

236
00:15:59,715 --> 00:16:00,835
Get some rest.

237
00:16:01,154 --> 00:16:03,634
You're the backbone now.
Your health comes first.

238
00:16:04,075 --> 00:16:06,274
Poor rest affects your performance.

239
00:16:06,435 --> 00:16:07,874
Alright, I'm leaving.

240
00:16:12,674 --> 00:16:13,674
Goodbye, Ms. Xu.

241
00:16:14,715 --> 00:16:15,674
See you, Ms. Xu.

242
00:16:39,674 --> 00:16:41,554
(I can't refute)

243
00:16:43,315 --> 00:16:44,995
(anything that Shen Haoming said.)

244
00:16:48,514 --> 00:16:50,475
(I can't tell if my career's success)

245
00:16:52,235 --> 00:16:53,634
(is due to the support)

246
00:16:55,154 --> 00:16:56,355
(he provided to me.)

247
00:17:00,435 --> 00:17:01,595
(If I quit being)

248
00:17:01,595 --> 00:17:02,435
(as Mr. Shen's wife,)

249
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,914
(will all this enthusiasm)

250
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:10,154
(and smiles to me remain?)

251
00:18:05,146 --> 00:18:10,560
(Fang Lei's Call)

252
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:24,354
You're back.

253
00:18:27,635 --> 00:18:28,915
Wash up. Dinner is ready.

254
00:18:30,314 --> 00:18:31,594
I made Western food for you.

255
00:18:31,995 --> 00:18:33,274
Haven't cooked this in ages.

256
00:18:35,074 --> 00:18:36,395
Wonder if I've gotten rusty.

257
00:18:50,915 --> 00:18:51,794
Get to the point.

258
00:18:54,114 --> 00:18:54,754
Haoming.

259
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,034
I've been thinking a lot.

260
00:18:59,675 --> 00:19:01,235
You said I married you for wealth

261
00:19:02,594 --> 00:19:05,074
and Shen family's
resources and connections.

262
00:19:09,675 --> 00:19:11,395
As someone benefiting from all this,

263
00:19:12,435 --> 00:19:13,235
I admit

264
00:19:15,675 --> 00:19:17,475
everything I've achieved now

265
00:19:18,235 --> 00:19:19,435
can't be separated from you

266
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:22,354
and the Shen family.

267
00:19:24,195 --> 00:19:25,514
So I won't deny

268
00:19:26,955 --> 00:19:28,274
I made the mistake first.

269
00:19:30,514 --> 00:19:32,354
I sincerely apologize to you.

270
00:19:34,955 --> 00:19:35,635
Besides,

271
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:39,834
I'll genuinely accept Haochen

272
00:19:40,395 --> 00:19:41,875
just as you wanted.

273
00:19:42,794 --> 00:19:44,754
I'll properly take care of this family

274
00:19:46,034 --> 00:19:47,754
and manage my career well.

275
00:19:51,074 --> 00:19:52,435
I just want to tell you

276
00:19:53,955 --> 00:19:57,514
my love for you have been genuine,

277
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:01,274
and I truly love you.

278
00:20:01,915 --> 00:20:04,235
After everything we've been through,

279
00:20:04,554 --> 00:20:05,834
how could all of it be fake?

280
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,235
I know I was wrong.

281
00:20:13,235 --> 00:20:14,635
I truly understand now.

282
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,274
Can we please...

283
00:20:21,274 --> 00:20:22,395
start over?

284
00:20:27,715 --> 00:20:28,715
I love you.

285
00:20:33,635 --> 00:20:34,834
I truly do.

286
00:21:02,675 --> 00:21:04,435
Just go for the fame or wealth.

287
00:21:06,675 --> 00:21:08,554
That way, I would think
you're being sincere.

288
00:21:14,754 --> 00:21:15,794
Like you said,

289
00:21:18,395 --> 00:21:19,594
we agreed

290
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,274
whether at work

291
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,074
or at home,

292
00:21:26,675 --> 00:21:28,155
we stick to our roles

293
00:21:28,915 --> 00:21:30,074
and maintain mutual benefit.

294
00:21:31,235 --> 00:21:32,395
Isn't this perfect?

295
00:21:32,995 --> 00:21:34,834
I recognize your value as a partner.

296
00:21:35,354 --> 00:21:37,635
After you've become
an official news anchor,

297
00:21:38,114 --> 00:21:39,794
I'll throw you a grand

298
00:21:40,514 --> 00:21:41,955
celebration party.

299
00:21:46,475 --> 00:21:47,754
Wish you have a success.

300
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,274
So you still don't believe

301
00:22:00,834 --> 00:22:02,514
that I truly love you.

302
00:22:03,074 --> 00:22:03,715
Right.

303
00:22:08,314 --> 00:22:08,754
By the way,

304
00:22:09,754 --> 00:22:11,794
there's no need for such efforts.

305
00:22:13,955 --> 00:22:15,715
I admit your acting is superb,

306
00:22:16,715 --> 00:22:17,875
but you can only

307
00:22:19,235 --> 00:22:20,155
fool me once,

308
00:22:20,274 --> 00:22:21,794
not again.

309
00:22:27,395 --> 00:22:28,995
Delicious. Have a seat.

who cried "the wolf is coming",)

(told too many lies.)

314
00:23:33,395 --> 00:23:34,794
(So when I tell the truth,)

315
00:23:35,274 --> 00:23:36,675

the concept of architecture in nature.

This project

329
00:24:33,114 --> 00:24:35,274

(Groundbreaking)
(We're reporters from Entertainment Frontline.)

350
00:25:47,594 --> 00:25:48,554
Mr. Shen.

351
00:25:48,675 --> 00:25:50,594
Regarding the New District project,

352
00:25:50,594 --> 00:25:51,995
you've put your wife's creative

353
00:25:52,155 --> 00:25:53,995
in the interior design concepts.

354
00:25:54,155 --> 00:25:55,635
Is that true?

355
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:56,875
Right.

356
00:25:58,034 --> 00:26:00,114
Her dedication
and professional competence

357
00:26:00,235 --> 00:26:03,715
demonstrate remarkable wisdom.

358
00:26:05,155 --> 00:26:06,635
I deeply respect her capabilities

359
00:26:07,235 --> 00:26:09,314
and I'm always open to her insights.

360
00:26:10,354 --> 00:26:12,594
What's the secret

361
00:26:12,715 --> 00:26:13,635
to your strong bond?

362
00:26:13,715 --> 00:26:15,034
Can you share some tips?

363
00:26:24,435 --> 00:26:25,675
No secret at all.

364
00:26:26,594 --> 00:26:29,235
Luck comes first.

365
00:26:30,034 --> 00:26:30,794
Then,

366
00:26:31,195 --> 00:26:32,635
mutual admiration

367
00:26:32,955 --> 00:26:34,915
between spouses is crucial.

368
00:26:35,475 --> 00:26:36,915
I admire her capabilities so much.

369
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:38,794
But what moves me most

370
00:26:39,314 --> 00:26:42,834
is that she can choose an easy job,

371
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:45,435
even to be a housewife,

372
00:26:46,435 --> 00:26:47,675
yet she chose

373
00:26:48,034 --> 00:26:49,435
to pursue her childhood dreams

374
00:26:51,915 --> 00:26:53,195
without pause,

375
00:26:53,754 --> 00:26:55,314
striving tirelessly till today.

376
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:59,594
This deeply moves me.

377
00:27:04,195 --> 00:27:05,675
So I want to cherish her more.

378
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:12,235
How would you describe your husband now?

379
00:27:12,354 --> 00:27:15,235
What drew you to Mr. Shen?

380
00:27:15,274 --> 00:27:16,834
Could you share with us?

381
00:27:31,635 --> 00:27:32,635
My husband...

382
00:27:35,114 --> 00:27:37,074
is exceptional in every way,

383
00:27:38,594 --> 00:27:40,554
truly impeccable.

384
00:27:41,514 --> 00:27:43,675
So I'm lucky to meet him.

385
00:27:45,114 --> 00:27:46,794
But most importantly,

386
00:27:48,314 --> 00:27:49,274
he respects me,

387
00:27:49,882 --> 00:27:50,656
(Xu Yan's Profile)

388
00:27:52,435 --> 00:27:53,195
trusts me,

389
00:27:56,995 --> 00:27:57,715
and supports me.

390
00:27:58,995 --> 00:28:00,314
They say

391
00:28:00,794 --> 00:28:01,955
when choosing a husband,

392
00:28:02,594 --> 00:28:05,155
we should choose someone

393
00:28:05,235 --> 00:28:06,915
who truly cherishes us.

394
00:28:07,915 --> 00:28:09,195
My husband not only does this,

395
00:28:10,195 --> 00:28:10,955
but

396
00:28:12,514 --> 00:28:15,594
exceeds my expectations.

397
00:28:17,635 --> 00:28:18,715
I have to do better.

398
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:21,554
Thank you.

399
00:28:21,635 --> 00:28:23,635
That's all for today's interview.

400
00:28:23,715 --> 00:28:26,354
Please prepare for
the group photo later.

401
00:28:26,395 --> 00:28:27,354
Thank you.

402
00:28:29,995 --> 00:28:30,915
Have a big smile.

403
00:28:32,195 --> 00:28:34,155
Here we go. Smile!

404
00:28:35,995 --> 00:28:36,594
Perfect.

405
00:28:49,235 --> 00:28:51,475
You performed terribly today.

406
00:28:52,435 --> 00:28:54,074
Especially during the press conference.

407
00:28:54,715 --> 00:28:56,715
You remained cold

408
00:28:57,514 --> 00:28:58,514
and unsmiling

409
00:28:59,594 --> 00:29:00,675
throughout.

410
00:29:02,034 --> 00:29:03,675
Tomorrow is a charity gala.

411
00:29:04,475 --> 00:29:06,715
I hope the same won't happen again.

412
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:09,594
As long as you perform well,

413
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:14,074
I guarantee you'll obtain the permanent

414
00:29:14,395 --> 00:29:15,554
news anchor position.

415
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,034

421
00:30:11,395 --> 00:30:12,514
Fang Lei said

422
00:30:13,274 --> 00:30:14,915
she'd kill herself if you don't show up.

423
00:30:15,754 --> 00:30:16,314
Where is she?

424
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:17,514
At her home.

425
00:30:18,635 --> 00:30:19,235
Got it.

426
00:30:23,314 --> 00:30:25,635
If I'm to keep playing
the role of a good wife,

427
00:30:26,995 --> 00:30:28,235
should I ask my husband

428
00:30:31,114 --> 00:30:32,915
about things like this?

429
00:30:33,754 --> 00:30:34,715
Unless I choose

430
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:37,155
to tell you myself,

431
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,715
don't ask any question.

432
00:30:51,395 --> 00:30:52,235
- Mr. Shen.
- Where is she?

433
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:53,034
Living room.

434
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:58,314
You finally showed up?

435
00:31:17,395 --> 00:31:18,635
You wanted to kill yourself?

436
00:31:19,114 --> 00:31:20,435
Go ahead. I'm waiting.

437
00:31:21,435 --> 00:31:22,395
Think I don't dare to?

438
00:31:24,235 --> 00:31:26,144
Didn't answer my calls
or reply to my messages,

439
00:31:27,074 --> 00:31:28,274
yet you showed up now?

440
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:31,354
So you do get scared.

441
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:32,915
You told Xu Yan about Haochen.

442
00:31:33,195 --> 00:31:35,955
You deserve to die.

443
00:31:47,554 --> 00:31:49,274
You still came here at this hour.

444
00:31:49,715 --> 00:31:50,915
You were already in bed,

445
00:31:51,155 --> 00:31:52,675
yet came to another woman.

446
00:31:52,794 --> 00:31:53,875
This just proves

447
00:31:53,915 --> 00:31:55,794
she only wants your wealth.

448
00:31:58,235 --> 00:32:00,274
You're off the New District project.

449
00:32:00,955 --> 00:32:01,794
What do you mean?

450
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:04,915
Used me and then kicked me out?

451
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:06,354
Never!

00:32:06,715 --> 00:32:07,675
I'm not leaving!

00:32:09,834 --> 00:32:11,675
Your bonus and compensation

454
00:32:12,475 --> 00:32:13,475
will be paid in full.

455
00:32:16,594 --> 00:32:18,794
Come to the office
and hand over your duties.

456
00:32:20,114 --> 00:32:21,354
I won't let you off!

I'll! Really!

461
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,554
Why are you still here?

462
00:32:33,435 --> 00:32:34,635
Get out now!

463
00:32:36,034 --> 00:32:37,675
I suggest you stop escalating it.

464
00:32:39,354 --> 00:32:40,675
I've accepted Mr. Shen's money,

465
00:32:41,195 --> 00:32:43,074
and our cooperation will only end

466
00:32:43,675 --> 00:32:45,475
until you stop making a mess.

467
00:32:48,594 --> 00:32:50,354
It turns out all these dramas

468
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:51,395
get you nowhere.

469
00:32:51,915 --> 00:32:53,155
Why keep going

470
00:32:54,754 --> 00:32:56,034
and making me work overtime?

471
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:57,314
Well,

472
00:32:58,034 --> 00:32:59,715
let me introduce you to some decent men.

473
00:33:00,114 --> 00:33:01,314
They are my former clients.

474
00:33:01,554 --> 00:33:02,995
Good guys, recently divorced.

475
00:33:03,074 --> 00:33:04,155
Good for you to kill time.

476
00:33:07,554 --> 00:33:08,834
Are you insane?

477
00:33:09,274 --> 00:33:10,955

has Dr. Yu finished his surgery?

485
00:33:32,114 --> 00:33:33,074
Just finished,

486
00:33:33,114 --> 00:33:35,235
debriefing the family now.

487
00:33:36,074 --> 00:33:36,794
Thank you.

488
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:41,475
Dr. Yu.

489
00:33:42,235 --> 00:33:44,314
Before the operation, you told me that

490
00:33:44,794 --> 00:33:45,794
the first operation

491
00:33:45,794 --> 00:33:47,235
would take three to four hours.

492
00:33:47,475 --> 00:33:48,354
But in reality,

493
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:50,675
six full hours!

494
00:33:51,715 --> 00:33:53,074
My child is so young.

495
00:33:53,635 --> 00:33:55,475
He suffered so much!

496
00:33:55,715 --> 00:33:58,114
Please calm down.

497
00:33:58,715 --> 00:33:59,594
We inform families

498
00:33:59,594 --> 00:34:01,314
about estimated surgery duration.

499
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:02,955
But we also clarify

500
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:04,475
times vary between patients.

501
00:34:04,754 --> 00:34:06,074
It's only an estimate.

502
00:34:07,034 --> 00:34:08,155
Our priority is to ensure

503
00:34:08,155 --> 00:34:09,274
patient safety

504
00:34:09,635 --> 00:34:10,635
and prevent severe

505
00:34:10,635 --> 00:34:12,554
lung damage during procedures.

506
00:34:12,955 --> 00:34:14,034
It often takes three hours,

507
00:34:14,195 --> 00:34:15,074
six at maximum.

508
00:34:15,114 --> 00:34:16,155
This is normal.

509
00:34:16,314 --> 00:34:18,354
I wonder if it's because
of your incompetence.

510
00:34:18,635 --> 00:34:20,834
We're canceling the surgery.

511
00:34:23,514 --> 00:34:23,915

Hello.

515
00:34:44,554 --> 00:34:46,714
You might not know Dr. Yu well.

516
00:34:47,074 --> 00:34:49,114
He's exceptionally skilled

517
00:34:49,315 --> 00:34:51,194
and dedicated.

518
00:34:51,554 --> 00:34:54,074
He sees 60 to 70 patients
daily in clinic.

519
00:34:54,315 --> 00:34:56,234
After that, he has
to go perform surgery.

520
00:34:56,475 --> 00:34:58,154
Standing over 10 hours.

521
00:34:58,395 --> 00:34:59,395
He can't even get meals,

522
00:34:59,475 --> 00:35:01,315
and sometimes can't even drink water.

523
00:35:01,674 --> 00:35:04,395
You could ask around to verify.

524
00:35:04,594 --> 00:35:05,835
Many of his patients

525
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:07,554
speak highly of him.

526
00:35:08,154 --> 00:35:10,114
You brought me here

527
00:35:10,435 --> 00:35:11,315
just to tell me

528
00:35:11,315 --> 00:35:12,674
how hard-working Dr. Yu is?

529
00:35:13,074 --> 00:35:14,234
What does this have to do

530
00:35:14,234 --> 00:35:14,995
with my child?

531
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:16,714
Well, I'm sorry.

532
00:35:16,755 --> 00:35:18,114
Not only that.

533
00:35:18,194 --> 00:35:20,074
I just wonder

534
00:35:20,194 --> 00:35:22,475
if you could show some understanding.

535
00:35:23,114 --> 00:35:24,034
Of course, I understand

536
00:35:24,034 --> 00:35:25,315
how you're feeling.

537
00:35:25,435 --> 00:35:26,435
When a child gets sick,

538
00:35:26,475 --> 00:35:27,835
no parent stays calm.

539
00:35:28,034 --> 00:35:29,875
And the expenses are huge.

540
00:35:30,114 --> 00:35:31,154
I just wonder

541
00:35:31,154 --> 00:35:32,475
if I can help ease

542
00:35:32,594 --> 00:35:33,955
your burden somehow

543
00:35:34,395 --> 00:35:35,875
and give you proper assurance.

544
00:35:36,315 --> 00:35:37,034
What?

545
00:35:37,234 --> 00:35:37,714
Yes.

546
00:35:38,475 --> 00:35:38,995
Here.

547
00:35:41,355 --> 00:35:42,154
Please take this.

548
00:35:48,795 --> 00:35:49,634
Who are you?

549
00:35:50,795 --> 00:35:52,355
What's this with you?

550
00:35:56,835 --> 00:35:59,034
I'm Dr. Yu's wife.

551
00:36:00,435 --> 00:36:01,074
Absurd!

552
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:03,875
Bribing families to gain sympathy

553
00:36:04,154 --> 00:36:05,554
for medical staff?

554
00:36:05,674 --> 00:36:07,915
The complaint reached my office!

555
00:36:08,795 --> 00:36:09,795
What?

556
00:36:13,514 --> 00:36:14,795
Who bribed the families?

557
00:36:14,835 --> 00:36:15,795
Your wife.

558
00:36:17,594 --> 00:36:18,275
Yu Yiming.

559
00:36:18,435 --> 00:36:19,915
When did you get married?

560
00:36:20,114 --> 00:36:21,114
Why didn't I know it?

561
00:36:21,634 --> 00:36:22,554
My wife?

562
00:36:23,594 --> 00:36:24,674
I'm single.

563
00:36:25,275 --> 00:36:25,674
Wait,

564
00:36:25,674 --> 00:36:26,714
are you mistaken?

565
00:36:27,475 --> 00:36:29,194
The girl who keeps visiting you.

566
00:36:31,275 --> 00:36:32,194
I'm sorry.

567
00:36:32,435 --> 00:36:33,315
So sorry

568
00:36:33,435 --> 00:36:34,475
I caused you trouble.

569
00:36:34,955 --> 00:36:36,034
I gave her money

570
00:36:36,034 --> 00:36:38,594
just to help relieve
her financial pressure,

571
00:36:38,795 --> 00:36:40,634
so you can do your surgery smoothly.

572
00:36:40,915 --> 00:36:42,594
I didn't think that much.

573
00:36:43,154 --> 00:36:44,315
I truly realize my mistake.

574
00:36:44,315 --> 00:36:45,835
I'm sorry. So sorry.

575
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:47,714
I was so careless.

576
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:48,755
This is my fault.

577
00:36:48,835 --> 00:36:49,355
I swear

578
00:36:49,395 --> 00:36:50,594
it'll never happen again.

579
00:36:53,194 --> 00:36:55,154
Did the hospital punish you?

580
00:36:58,234 --> 00:37:00,074
I'll go explain it.

581
00:37:01,315 --> 00:37:03,355
I'll apologize to the family personally,

582
00:37:03,514 --> 00:37:05,114
and then clarify with hospital admin

583
00:37:05,154 --> 00:37:06,674
that you had nothing to do with this.

584
00:37:06,835 --> 00:37:07,995
It's all my fault.

585
00:37:08,275 --> 00:37:09,114
I'll go do it.

586
00:37:09,355 --> 00:37:10,275
Want to apologize?

587
00:37:14,514 --> 00:37:15,114
Come with me.

588
00:37:16,795 --> 00:37:17,755
Hold on.

589
00:37:18,594 --> 00:37:19,355
Take them.

590
00:37:21,594 --> 00:37:24,937
(I Miss You in China)

591
00:37:28,634 --> 00:37:30,194
Is this enough?

592
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:33,915
You bought me ice cream.

593
00:37:34,355 --> 00:37:35,034
I forgive you.

594
00:37:38,355 --> 00:37:39,355
Not just that,

595
00:37:40,435 --> 00:37:41,234
I should thank you.

596
00:37:43,034 --> 00:37:45,475
After our communication
and explanations,

597
00:37:45,594 --> 00:37:46,514
she understands

598
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,674
the surgery's complexity

599
00:37:47,915 --> 00:37:49,920
and multiple procedures needed.

600
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,395
She's willing to cooperate with us
to continue the treatment.

601
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,034
Regarding your wife's actions,

602
00:37:54,315 --> 00:37:55,275
she forgave her.

603
00:37:55,995 --> 00:37:56,955
Yes! Fantastic!

604
00:38:06,594 --> 00:38:07,234
I'm sorry.

605
00:38:08,154 --> 00:38:08,755
What?

606
00:38:10,795 --> 00:38:13,154
She kept asking me

607
00:38:13,554 --> 00:38:14,955
about our relationship.

608
00:38:15,315 --> 00:38:16,435
I didn't know how to answer

609
00:38:16,435 --> 00:38:18,315
and said I'm your wife.

610
00:38:19,074 --> 00:38:19,955
Sorry.

611
00:38:42,435 --> 00:38:43,955
- Hello.
- Hello.

612
00:38:44,154 --> 00:38:44,674
Hello.

613
00:38:45,514 --> 00:38:46,234
Long time no see.

614
00:38:46,795 --> 00:38:48,034
Today makes a difference.

615
00:38:48,955 --> 00:38:49,554
See you.

616
00:38:51,674 --> 00:38:52,355
Lei.

617
00:38:57,554 --> 00:38:59,395
- You're here too.
- Yes.

618
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:01,714
Where are you sitting?

619
00:39:02,315 --> 00:39:03,234
Over there.

620
00:39:05,674 --> 00:39:07,234
So far away?

621
00:39:08,634 --> 00:39:10,154
Can you even see the auction items?

622
00:39:11,475 --> 00:39:11,915
Come here.

623
00:39:15,554 --> 00:39:16,234
Sit here.

624
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:18,915
Have you been tired?

625
00:39:19,355 --> 00:39:20,154
Not really.

626
00:39:20,315 --> 00:39:21,074
Exhausted?

627
00:39:21,435 --> 00:39:22,234
No.

628
00:39:23,714 --> 00:39:24,475
Good then.

629
00:39:24,594 --> 00:39:25,475
Working all day,

630
00:39:25,835 --> 00:39:27,114
you must take care.

631
00:39:32,355 --> 00:39:32,875
Lei.

632
00:39:55,915 --> 00:39:56,475
Lei.

633
00:39:58,074 --> 00:39:59,315
I just noticed

634
00:39:59,435 --> 00:40:00,755
your complexion looks dull.

635
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:01,915
Been staying up late?

636
00:40:02,674 --> 00:40:04,154
No, my complexion has been great.

637
00:40:04,594 --> 00:40:05,315
Good then.

638
00:40:07,995 --> 00:40:09,275
I wanted to tell you

639
00:40:10,355 --> 00:40:11,594
I've been really busy,

640
00:40:12,194 --> 00:40:13,755
working overtime.

641
00:40:14,475 --> 00:40:15,915
If you are available,

642
00:40:16,034 --> 00:40:17,074
could you help

643
00:40:17,074 --> 00:40:18,355
look after Haoming more?

644
00:40:21,315 --> 00:40:22,835
I know you two

645
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:24,074
studied abroad together,

646
00:40:24,315 --> 00:40:25,315
so you know him well.

Sure.

652
00:40:42,514 --> 00:40:44,194
Don't tell her to do so.

653
00:40:45,795 --> 00:40:46,995
She's seated here.

654
00:40:47,154 --> 00:40:48,674
Just give her a break.

655
00:40:52,755 --> 00:40:55,395
They can always chat another time.

656
00:40:56,355 --> 00:40:58,435
Listen to me, stay here.

657
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:03,795
Look, it's starting.
