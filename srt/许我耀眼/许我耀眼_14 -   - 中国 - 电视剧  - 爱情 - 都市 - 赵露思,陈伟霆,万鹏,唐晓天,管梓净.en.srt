30
00:02:15,395 --> 00:02:18,075
Fang Lei picked up Haochen
after school today.

31
00:02:23,955 --> 00:02:25,034
She told me

32
00:02:25,154 --> 00:02:26,795
that Shen Haochen is your son.

33
00:02:32,355 --> 00:02:33,395
Is this true?

34
00:02:54,154 --> 00:02:54,675
Yes.

35
00:02:56,474 --> 00:02:57,795
He's my illegitimate son.

36
00:03:00,434 --> 00:03:01,795
Why did you hide this from me?

37
00:03:02,314 --> 00:03:03,434
Didn't I tell you

38
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,434
that do not say anything

39
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:06,675
affecting our relationship?

40
00:03:06,714 --> 00:03:08,115
When do you want to tell me?

41
00:03:08,754 --> 00:03:09,675
Never?

42
00:03:11,995 --> 00:03:13,314
I always thought

43
00:03:15,034 --> 00:03:17,235
you loved and understood me,

44
00:03:19,275 --> 00:03:21,154
so you've silently supported me

45
00:03:21,154 --> 00:03:22,474
in pursuing my career.

46
00:03:22,795 --> 00:03:24,314
Only today did I realize

47
00:03:25,275 --> 00:03:26,634
that you just wanted to use me

48
00:03:26,634 --> 00:03:27,634
and my career

49
00:03:27,634 --> 00:03:29,594
as your tools.

50
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:31,075
You just want to use

51
00:03:31,075 --> 00:03:34,355
my profession to win over Jiang Yun

52
00:03:34,955 --> 00:03:36,515
and every business partner

53
00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:37,995
you needed for your career.

54
00:03:39,955 --> 00:03:41,594
You're just trying to use me.

55
00:03:42,675 --> 00:03:43,714
But I don't understand.

56
00:03:46,194 --> 00:03:47,634
Why did you lie to me?

57
00:04:10,515 --> 00:04:11,754
Speaking of it,

58
00:04:12,434 --> 00:04:13,795
you're in no position

59
00:04:14,395 --> 00:04:17,074
(Xu Yan's Profile)
to question me.

60
00:04:31,115 --> 00:04:32,235
When I first met you,

61
00:04:34,434 --> 00:04:36,155
you possess the charm I like.

62
00:04:37,475 --> 00:04:39,035
You are interesting enough.

63
00:04:42,155 --> 00:04:43,715
My mom is extremely particular,

64
00:04:43,795 --> 00:04:45,754
and few women could win her favor,

65
00:04:46,394 --> 00:04:47,475
but you could.

66
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:48,595
You get along with her.

67
00:04:49,394 --> 00:04:51,035
I prefer smart women.

68
00:04:52,915 --> 00:04:53,555
Second,

69
00:04:53,874 --> 00:04:55,434
you have the qualities I admire

70
00:04:56,035 --> 00:04:57,074
and the ability to endure.

71
00:04:58,954 --> 00:04:59,834
If I find a woman

72
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:01,514
from a prestigious background,

73
00:05:04,235 --> 00:05:05,834
they might not tolerate

74
00:05:06,314 --> 00:05:07,874
the mistakes of my youth

75
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:11,035
or accept my son.

76
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:19,155
You look like a proper noble lady,

77
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,074
but without their arrogance

78
00:05:21,874 --> 00:05:23,595
and unpleasant temper.

79
00:05:25,595 --> 00:05:26,355
Third,

80
00:05:27,434 --> 00:05:28,394
your ambition.

81
00:05:30,314 --> 00:05:31,074
From the start,

82
00:05:31,074 --> 00:05:32,634
you wanted to host a Family Feast,

83
00:05:32,795 --> 00:05:34,035
and then you aimed

84
00:05:34,035 --> 00:05:36,715
to be a news anchor.

85
00:05:41,115 --> 00:05:42,595
It actually benefits my career.

86
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:44,394
Yes, I lied to you.

87
00:05:45,274 --> 00:05:46,874
But didn't I generously provide

88
00:05:46,874 --> 00:05:48,194
full support to you?

89
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:55,274
Lin Tao.

90
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,115
(I put pressure)

91
00:05:58,115 --> 00:05:59,995
(on the bank where he was working.)

92
00:06:01,954 --> 00:06:02,795
Zhou Zeyuan.

93
00:06:04,274 --> 00:06:06,274
He blackmailed and threatened you.

94
00:06:10,915 --> 00:06:12,795
When he was at his wit's end,

95
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:14,035
I gave him funding.

96
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:16,595
When a gambler is at his wit's end,

97
00:06:16,595 --> 00:06:17,715
he won't turn back.

98
00:06:18,035 --> 00:06:19,355
He would only take a big gamble.

99
00:06:19,555 --> 00:06:21,595
Then, I put him to prison.

100
00:06:21,795 --> 00:06:23,355
Zhou Zeyuan was arrested.

101
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:30,715
Because I lied to you,

102
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:33,434
I'm willing to spend money

103
00:06:34,155 --> 00:06:35,834
to maintain your lies unrevealed.

104
00:06:36,475 --> 00:06:37,915
All you need to do

105
00:06:38,355 --> 00:06:39,834
is being a perfect wife

106
00:06:39,874 --> 00:06:41,194
with a respectable job,

107
00:06:41,274 --> 00:06:42,834
keeping my family pleased.

108
00:06:42,995 --> 00:06:43,634
And me?

109
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:44,954
As your husband,

110
00:06:45,314 --> 00:06:46,634
I'll fulfill my duty

111
00:06:47,314 --> 00:06:48,514
to boost your career.

112
00:06:51,314 --> 00:06:53,155
Stop looking at me so pitifully.

113
00:06:53,874 --> 00:06:55,514
Didn't you approach me

114
00:06:56,194 --> 00:06:57,475
with ulterior motives?

115
00:06:58,795 --> 00:07:00,074
You tried every mean

116
00:07:00,274 --> 00:07:01,595
to become my wife,

117
00:07:01,715 --> 00:07:03,595
just wanting my wealth, my connections

118
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:04,795
and all my resources.

119
00:07:06,194 --> 00:07:08,634
You used me to build your credibility,

120
00:07:09,155 --> 00:07:10,475
winning the public trust.

121
00:07:10,754 --> 00:07:12,555
Do you think this is absolutely safe?

122
00:07:13,155 --> 00:07:14,834
They come back to me
once you turn around.

123
00:07:16,194 --> 00:07:17,394
My generosity

124
00:07:17,995 --> 00:07:19,434
made your sweet dreams come true.

125
00:07:19,434 --> 00:07:20,274
Do you know that?

126
00:07:23,675 --> 00:07:25,514
So everything you did to me

127
00:07:25,514 --> 00:07:26,475
was all lies.

128
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:31,155
I just have one question.

129
00:07:36,274 --> 00:07:37,074
Have you ever...

130
00:07:44,874 --> 00:07:46,475
Have you ever truly loved me?

131
00:07:48,874 --> 00:07:50,954
From the moment I knew you were a fraud,

132
00:07:53,915 --> 00:07:55,355
I would never fall in love with you.

133
00:08:01,675 --> 00:08:02,795
I lied to you too.

134
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:06,074
I didn't expect you

135
00:08:06,115 --> 00:08:07,074
to genuinely love me.

136
00:08:08,475 --> 00:08:09,715
Just take what we need.

137
00:08:23,434 --> 00:08:24,314
I understand now.

138
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,634
I finally understand everything now.

139
00:08:38,315 --> 00:08:39,315
So,

140
00:08:42,235 --> 00:08:43,914
when I made your mom happy,

141
00:08:46,715 --> 00:08:48,154
when I treated Haochen well,

142
00:08:50,674 --> 00:08:52,394
when I pleased you,

143
00:08:52,394 --> 00:08:55,195

cars, and jewelry you gave me

144
00:08:57,514 --> 00:08:59,315
were out of love.

145
00:09:04,034 --> 00:09:05,034
But to you,

146
00:09:08,195 --> 00:09:09,554
they were just bonus to me, right?

147
00:09:12,475 --> 00:09:15,355
It's kind of my recognition to you

148

00:11:56,034 --> 00:11:57,394
(And we won't meet again.")

193
00:12:04,595 --> 00:12:05,355
Have you decided?

194
00:12:12,955 --> 00:12:14,394
If you want a divorce,

195
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:16,914
I'll agree.

196
00:12:18,715 --> 00:12:20,315
The New District project just launched.

197
00:12:21,315 --> 00:12:23,075
My career and family

198
00:12:23,955 --> 00:12:25,715
can't tolerate any disruptions.

199
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:27,914
My upcoming schedule

200
00:12:28,195 --> 00:12:29,195
requires your presence.

201
00:12:29,914 --> 00:12:32,674
The New District project
launch ceremony is in two days.

202
00:12:33,075 --> 00:12:35,514
As my wife, you must attend.

203
00:12:36,955 --> 00:12:38,235
I don't want anyone

204
00:12:39,115 --> 00:12:41,595
to notice any changes between us.

205
00:12:53,554 --> 00:12:54,514
What if I say...

206
00:13:01,394 --> 00:13:02,355
I can't do it?

207
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:05,835
You aren't officially part
of the News Department.

208
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:09,595
I assume you don't want

209
00:13:09,595 --> 00:13:11,075
any mistakes in this process.

210
00:14:13,834 --> 00:14:19,856
(Huanhuan's Call)

211
00:14:32,195 --> 00:14:32,874
What's wrong?

212
00:14:33,595 --> 00:14:35,075
Yan, the editing

213
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,715
for the last recording is all done.

214
00:14:36,914 --> 00:14:37,874
When will you come?

215
00:14:39,634 --> 00:14:40,274
Hello?

216
00:14:41,235 --> 00:14:42,514
Yan, are you listening?

217
00:14:43,514 --> 00:14:44,115
Hello?

218
00:14:47,715 --> 00:14:48,715
I am coming.

219
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:55,754
That's all the news for today.

220
00:14:55,955 --> 00:14:57,034
Thank you for watching.

221
00:14:57,075 --> 00:14:58,394
See you.

222
00:14:59,634 --> 00:15:00,715
Great job. Wrap it up.

223
00:15:04,674 --> 00:15:05,235
Thank you.

224
00:15:07,794 --> 00:15:08,435
Xu Yan!

225
00:15:18,995 --> 00:15:19,955
Elegant and composed.

226
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:21,554
Performed well.

227
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:23,355
I knew I was right about you.

228
00:15:25,554 --> 00:15:26,355
In today's meeting,

229
00:15:27,154 --> 00:15:29,034
the leaders publicly praised you.

230
00:15:30,075 --> 00:15:33,355
They decided to have you host
the next Financial Forum.

231
00:15:34,274 --> 00:15:35,075
As you know,

232
00:15:35,274 --> 00:15:36,835
hosting the Financial Forum

233
00:15:37,034 --> 00:15:39,595
is the ultimate recognition
from the leaders.

234
00:15:42,914 --> 00:15:43,674
Thank you.

235
00:15:43,914 --> 00:15:45,115
Don't mention it.

236
00:15:45,715 --> 00:15:46,835
Get some rest.

237
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,634
You're the backbone now.
Your health comes first.

238
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:52,274
Poor rest affects your performance.

239
00:15:52,435 --> 00:15:53,874
Alright, I'm leaving.

240
00:15:58,674 --> 00:15:59,674
Goodbye, Ms. Xu.

241
00:16:00,715 --> 00:16:01,674
See you, Ms. Xu.

242
00:16:25,674 --> 00:16:27,554
(I can't refute)

243
00:16:29,315 --> 00:16:30,995
(anything that Shen Haoming said.)

244
00:16:34,514 --> 00:16:36,475
(I can't tell if my career's success)

245
00:16:38,235 --> 00:16:39,634
(is due to the support)

246
00:16:41,154 --> 00:16:42,355
(he provided to me.)

247
00:16:46,435 --> 00:16:47,595
(If I quit being)

248
00:16:47,595 --> 00:16:48,435
(as Mr. Shen's wife,)

249
00:16:51,315 --> 00:16:52,914
(will all this enthusiasm)

250
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:56,154
(and smiles to me remain?)

251
00:17:51,146 --> 00:17:56,560
(Fang Lei's Call)

252
00:18:09,635 --> 00:18:10,354
You're back.

253
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:14,915
Wash up. Dinner is ready.

254
00:18:16,314 --> 00:18:17,594
I made Western food for you.

255
00:18:17,995 --> 00:18:19,274
Haven't cooked this in ages.

256
00:18:21,074 --> 00:18:22,395
Wonder if I've gotten rusty.

257
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:37,794
Get to the point.

258
00:18:40,114 --> 00:18:40,754
Haoming.

259
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,034
I've been thinking a lot.

260
00:18:45,675 --> 00:18:47,235
You said I married you for wealth

261
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,074
and Shen family's
resources and connections.

262
00:18:55,675 --> 00:18:57,395
As someone benefiting from all this,

263
00:18:58,435 --> 00:18:59,235
I admit

264
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:03,475
everything I've achieved now

265
00:19:04,235 --> 00:19:05,435
can't be separated from you

266
00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:08,354
and the Shen family.

267
00:19:10,195 --> 00:19:11,514
So I won't deny

268
00:19:12,955 --> 00:19:14,274
I made the mistake first.

269
00:19:16,514 --> 00:19:18,354
I sincerely apologize to you.

270
00:19:20,955 --> 00:19:21,635
Besides,

271
00:19:23,834 --> 00:19:25,834
I'll genuinely accept Haochen

272
00:19:26,395 --> 00:19:27,875
just as you wanted.

273
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:30,754
I'll properly take care of this family

274
00:19:32,034 --> 00:19:33,754
and manage my career well.

275
00:19:37,074 --> 00:19:38,435
I just want to tell you

276
00:19:39,955 --> 00:19:43,514
my love for you have been genuine,

277
00:19:46,034 --> 00:19:47,274
and I truly love you.

278
00:19:47,915 --> 00:19:50,235
After everything we've been through,

279
00:19:50,554 --> 00:19:51,834
how could all of it be fake?

280
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,235
I know I was wrong.

281
00:19:59,235 --> 00:20:00,635
I truly understand now.

282
00:20:02,715 --> 00:20:04,274
Can we please...

283
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:08,395
start over?

284
00:20:13,715 --> 00:20:14,715
I love you.

285
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,834
I truly do.

286
00:20:48,675 --> 00:20:50,435
Just go for the fame or wealth.

287
00:20:52,675 --> 00:20:54,554
That way, I would think
you're being sincere.

288
00:21:00,754 --> 00:21:01,794
Like you said,

289
00:21:04,395 --> 00:21:05,594
we agreed

290
00:21:07,114 --> 00:21:08,274
whether at work

291
00:21:10,074 --> 00:21:11,074
or at home,

292
00:21:12,675 --> 00:21:14,155
we stick to our roles

293
00:21:14,915 --> 00:21:16,074
and maintain mutual benefit.

294
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:18,395
Isn't this perfect?

295
00:21:18,995 --> 00:21:20,834
I recognize your value as a partner.

296
00:21:21,354 --> 00:21:23,635
After you've become
an official news anchor,

297
00:21:24,114 --> 00:21:25,794
I'll throw you a grand

298
00:21:26,514 --> 00:21:27,955
celebration party.

299
00:21:32,475 --> 00:21:33,754
Wish you have a success.

300
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:44,274
So you still don't believe

301
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:48,514
that I truly love you.

302
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:49,715
Right.

303
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:54,754
By the way,

304
00:21:55,754 --> 00:21:57,794
there's no need for such efforts.

305
00:21:59,955 --> 00:22:01,715
I admit your acting is superb,

306
00:22:02,715 --> 00:22:03,875
but you can only

307
00:22:05,235 --> 00:22:06,155
fool me once,

308
00:22:06,274 --> 00:22:07,794
not again.

309
00:22:13,395 --> 00:22:14,995
Delicious. Have a seat.

who cried "the wolf is coming",)

(told too many lies.)

314
00:23:19,395 --> 00:23:20,794
(So when I tell the truth,)

315
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,675

the concept of architecture in nature.

This project

329
00:24:19,114 --> 00:24:21,274

(Groundbreaking)
(We're reporters from Entertainment Frontline.)

350
00:25:33,594 --> 00:25:34,554
Mr. Shen.

351
00:25:34,675 --> 00:25:36,594
Regarding the New District project,

352
00:25:36,594 --> 00:25:37,995
you've put your wife's creative

353
00:25:38,155 --> 00:25:39,995
in the interior design concepts.

354
00:25:40,155 --> 00:25:41,635
Is that true?

355
00:25:42,155 --> 00:25:42,875
Right.

356
00:25:44,034 --> 00:25:46,114
Her dedication
and professional competence

357
00:25:46,235 --> 00:25:49,715
demonstrate remarkable wisdom.

358
00:25:51,155 --> 00:25:52,635
I deeply respect her capabilities

359
00:25:53,235 --> 00:25:55,314
and I'm always open to her insights.

360
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:58,594
What's the secret

361
00:25:58,715 --> 00:25:59,635
to your strong bond?

362
00:25:59,715 --> 00:26:01,034
Can you share some tips?

363
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:11,675
No secret at all.

364
00:26:12,594 --> 00:26:15,235
Luck comes first.

365
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:16,794
Then,

366
00:26:17,195 --> 00:26:18,635
mutual admiration

367
00:26:18,955 --> 00:26:20,915
between spouses is crucial.

368
00:26:21,475 --> 00:26:22,915
I admire her capabilities so much.

369
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:24,794
But what moves me most

370
00:26:25,314 --> 00:26:28,834
is that she can choose an easy job,

371
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:31,435
even to be a housewife,

372
00:26:32,435 --> 00:26:33,675
yet she chose

373
00:26:34,034 --> 00:26:35,435
to pursue her childhood dreams

374
00:26:37,915 --> 00:26:39,195
without pause,

375
00:26:39,754 --> 00:26:41,314
striving tirelessly till today.

376
00:26:42,915 --> 00:26:45,594
This deeply moves me.

377
00:26:50,195 --> 00:26:51,675
So I want to cherish her more.

378
00:26:55,195 --> 00:26:58,235
How would you describe your husband now?

379
00:26:58,354 --> 00:27:01,235
What drew you to Mr. Shen?

380
00:27:01,274 --> 00:27:02,834
Could you share with us?

381
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:18,635
My husband...

382
00:27:21,114 --> 00:27:23,074
is exceptional in every way,

383
00:27:24,594 --> 00:27:26,554
truly impeccable.

384
00:27:27,514 --> 00:27:29,675
So I'm lucky to meet him.

385
00:27:31,114 --> 00:27:32,794
But most importantly,

386
00:27:34,314 --> 00:27:35,274
he respects me,

387
00:27:35,882 --> 00:27:36,656
(Xu Yan's Profile)

388
00:27:38,435 --> 00:27:39,195
trusts me,

389
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:43,715
and supports me.

390
00:27:44,995 --> 00:27:46,314
They say

391
00:27:46,794 --> 00:27:47,955
when choosing a husband,

392
00:27:48,594 --> 00:27:51,155
we should choose someone

393
00:27:51,235 --> 00:27:52,915
who truly cherishes us.

394
00:27:53,915 --> 00:27:55,195
My husband not only does this,

395
00:27:56,195 --> 00:27:56,955
but

396
00:27:58,514 --> 00:28:01,594
exceeds my expectations.

397
00:28:03,635 --> 00:28:04,715
I have to do better.

398
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:07,554
Thank you.

399
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:09,635
That's all for today's interview.

400
00:28:09,715 --> 00:28:12,354
Please prepare for
the group photo later.

401
00:28:12,395 --> 00:28:13,354
Thank you.

402
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:16,915
Have a big smile.

403
00:28:18,195 --> 00:28:20,155
Here we go. Smile!

404
00:28:21,995 --> 00:28:22,594
Perfect.

405
00:28:35,235 --> 00:28:37,475
You performed terribly today.

406
00:28:38,435 --> 00:28:40,074
Especially during the press conference.

407
00:28:40,715 --> 00:28:42,715
You remained cold

408
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:44,514
and unsmiling

409
00:28:45,594 --> 00:28:46,675
throughout.

410
00:28:48,034 --> 00:28:49,675
Tomorrow is a charity gala.

411
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:52,715
I hope the same won't happen again.

412
00:28:54,114 --> 00:28:55,594
As long as you perform well,

413
00:28:56,715 --> 00:29:00,074
I guarantee you'll obtain the permanent

414
00:29:00,395 --> 00:29:01,554
news anchor position.

415
00:29:03,155 --> 00:29:04,034
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

What's wrong?

421
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:58,514
Fang Lei said

422
00:29:59,274 --> 00:30:00,915
she'd kill herself if you don't show up.

423
00:30:01,754 --> 00:30:02,314
Where is she?

424
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:03,514
At her home.

425
00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:05,235
Got it.

426
00:30:09,314 --> 00:30:11,635
If I'm to keep playing
the role of a good wife,

427
00:30:12,995 --> 00:30:14,235
should I ask my husband

428
00:30:17,114 --> 00:30:18,915
about things like this?

429
00:30:19,754 --> 00:30:20,715
Unless I choose

430
00:30:21,794 --> 00:30:23,155
to tell you myself,

431
00:30:23,794 --> 00:30:25,715
don't ask any question.

432
00:30:37,395 --> 00:30:38,235
- Mr. Shen.
- Where is she?

433
00:30:38,435 --> 00:30:39,034
Living room.

434
00:30:43,155 --> 00:30:44,314
You finally showed up?

435
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:04,635
You wanted to kill yourself?

436
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:06,435
Go ahead. I'm waiting.

437
00:31:07,435 --> 00:31:08,395
Think I don't dare to?

438
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,144
Didn't answer my calls
or reply to my messages,

439
00:31:13,074 --> 00:31:14,274
yet you showed up now?

440
00:31:16,155 --> 00:31:17,354
So you do get scared.

441
00:31:17,514 --> 00:31:18,915
You told Xu Yan about Haochen.

442
00:31:19,195 --> 00:31:21,955
You deserve to die.

443
00:31:33,554 --> 00:31:35,274
You still came here at this hour.

444
00:31:35,715 --> 00:31:36,915
You were already in bed,

445
00:31:37,155 --> 00:31:38,675
yet came to another woman.

446
00:31:38,794 --> 00:31:39,875
This just proves

447
00:31:39,915 --> 00:31:41,794
she only wants your wealth.

448
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,274
You're off the New District project.

449
00:31:46,955 --> 00:31:47,794
What do you mean?

450
00:31:49,155 --> 00:31:50,915
Used me and then kicked me out?

451
00:31:51,675 --> 00:31:52,354
Never!

452
00:31:52,715 --> 00:31:53,675
I'm not leaving!

453
00:31:55,834 --> 00:31:57,675
Your bonus and compensation

454
00:31:58,475 --> 00:31:59,475
will be paid in full.

455
00:32:02,594 --> 00:32:04,794
Come to the office
and hand over your duties.

456
00:32:06,114 --> 00:32:07,354
I won't let you off!

457

I'll! Really!

00:32:11,834 --> 00:32:13,314
Miss Fang, have a seat.

461
00:32:17,074 --> 00:32:18,554
Why are you still here?

462
00:32:19,435 --> 00:32:20,635
Get out now!

463
00:32:22,034 --> 00:32:23,675
I suggest you stop escalating it.

464
00:32:25,354 --> 00:32:26,675
I've accepted Mr. Shen's money,

465
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,074
and our cooperation will only end

466
00:32:29,675 --> 00:32:31,475
until you stop making a mess.

467
00:32:34,594 --> 00:32:36,354
It turns out all these dramas

468
00:32:36,594 --> 00:32:37,395
get you nowhere.

469
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:39,155
Why keep going

470
00:32:40,754 --> 00:32:42,034
and making me work overtime?

471
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:43,314
Well,

472
00:32:44,034 --> 00:32:45,715
let me introduce you to some decent men.

473
00:32:46,114 --> 00:32:47,314
They are my former clients.

474
00:32:47,554 --> 00:32:48,995
Good guys, recently divorced.

475
00:32:49,074 --> 00:32:50,155
Good for you to kill time.

476
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:54,834
Are you insane?

477
00:32:55,274 --> 00:32:56,955
Why always keep an eye on me?

00:33:16,475 --> 00:33:17,834
has Dr. Yu finished his surgery?

485
00:33:18,114 --> 00:33:19,074
Just finished,

486
00:33:19,114 --> 00:33:21,235
debriefing the family now.

487
00:33:22,074 --> 00:33:22,794
Thank you.

488
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:27,475
Dr. Yu.

489
00:33:28,235 --> 00:33:30,314
Before the operation, you told me that

490
00:33:30,794 --> 00:33:31,794
the first operation

491
00:33:31,794 --> 00:33:33,235
would take three to four hours.

492
00:33:33,475 --> 00:33:34,354
But in reality,

493
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:36,675
six full hours!

494
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:39,074
My child is so young.

495
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:41,475
He suffered so much!

496
00:33:41,715 --> 00:33:44,114
Please calm down.

497
00:33:44,715 --> 00:33:45,594
We inform families

498
00:33:45,594 --> 00:33:47,314
about estimated surgery duration.

499
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:48,955
But we also clarify

500
00:33:49,274 --> 00:33:50,475
times vary between patients.

501
00:33:50,754 --> 00:33:52,074
It's only an estimate.

502
00:33:53,034 --> 00:33:54,155
Our priority is to ensure

503
00:33:54,155 --> 00:33:55,274
patient safety

504
00:33:55,635 --> 00:33:56,635
and prevent severe

505
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:58,554
lung damage during procedures.

506
00:33:58,955 --> 00:34:00,034
It often takes three hours,

507
00:34:00,195 --> 00:34:01,074
six at maximum.

508
00:34:01,114 --> 00:34:02,155
This is normal.

509
00:34:02,314 --> 00:34:04,354
I wonder if it's because
of your incompetence.

510
00:34:04,635 --> 00:34:06,834
We're canceling the surgery.

511
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:09,915

512
00:34:10,795 --> 00:34:12,034
Get your supervisor now!

00:34:12,154 --> 00:34:14,355
I want a satisfied explanation today!

514
00:34:20,955 --> 00:34:22,154
Hello.

515
00:34:30,554 --> 00:34:32,714
You might not know Dr. Yu well.

516
00:34:33,074 --> 00:34:35,114
He's exceptionally skilled

517
00:34:35,315 --> 00:34:37,194
and dedicated.

518
00:34:37,554 --> 00:34:40,074
He sees 60 to 70 patients
daily in clinic.

519
00:34:40,315 --> 00:34:42,234
After that, he has
to go perform surgery.

520
00:34:42,475 --> 00:34:44,154
Standing over 10 hours.

521
00:34:44,395 --> 00:34:45,395
He can't even get meals,

522
00:34:45,475 --> 00:34:47,315
and sometimes can't even drink water.

523
00:34:47,674 --> 00:34:50,395
You could ask around to verify.

524
00:34:50,594 --> 00:34:51,835
Many of his patients

525
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:53,554
speak highly of him.

526
00:34:54,154 --> 00:34:56,114
You brought me here

527
00:34:56,435 --> 00:34:57,315
just to tell me

528
00:34:57,315 --> 00:34:58,674
how hard-working Dr. Yu is?

529
00:34:59,074 --> 00:35:00,234
What does this have to do

530
00:35:00,234 --> 00:35:00,995
with my child?

531
00:35:01,114 --> 00:35:02,714
Well, I'm sorry.

532
00:35:02,755 --> 00:35:04,114
Not only that.

533
00:35:04,194 --> 00:35:06,074
I just wonder

534
00:35:06,194 --> 00:35:08,475
if you could show some understanding.

535
00:35:09,114 --> 00:35:10,034
Of course, I understand

536
00:35:10,034 --> 00:35:11,315
how you're feeling.

537
00:35:11,435 --> 00:35:12,435
When a child gets sick,

538
00:35:12,475 --> 00:35:13,835
no parent stays calm.

539
00:35:14,034 --> 00:35:15,875
And the expenses are huge.

540
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,154
I just wonder

541
00:35:17,154 --> 00:35:18,475
if I can help ease

542
00:35:18,594 --> 00:35:19,955
your burden somehow

543
00:35:20,395 --> 00:35:21,875
and give you proper assurance.

544
00:35:22,315 --> 00:35:23,034
What?

545
00:35:23,234 --> 00:35:23,714
Yes.

546
00:35:24,475 --> 00:35:24,995
Here.

547
00:35:27,355 --> 00:35:28,154
Please take this.

548
00:35:34,795 --> 00:35:35,634
Who are you?

549
00:35:36,795 --> 00:35:38,355
What's this with you?

550
00:35:42,835 --> 00:35:45,034
I'm Dr. Yu's wife.

551
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,074
Absurd!

552
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:49,875
Bribing families to gain sympathy

553
00:35:50,154 --> 00:35:51,554
for medical staff?

554
00:35:51,674 --> 00:35:53,915
The complaint reached my office!

555
00:35:54,795 --> 00:35:55,795
What?

556
00:35:59,514 --> 00:36:00,795
Who bribed the families?

557
00:36:00,835 --> 00:36:01,795
Your wife.

558
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:04,275
Yu Yiming.

559
00:36:04,435 --> 00:36:05,915
When did you get married?

560
00:36:06,114 --> 00:36:07,114
Why didn't I know it?

561
00:36:07,634 --> 00:36:08,554
My wife?

562
00:36:09,594 --> 00:36:10,674
I'm single.

563
00:36:11,275 --> 00:36:11,674
Wait,

564
00:36:11,674 --> 00:36:12,714
are you mistaken?

565
00:36:13,475 --> 00:36:15,194
The girl who keeps visiting you.

566
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,194
I'm sorry.

567
00:36:18,435 --> 00:36:19,315
So sorry

568
00:36:19,435 --> 00:36:20,475
I caused you trouble.

569
00:36:20,955 --> 00:36:22,034
I gave her money

570
00:36:22,034 --> 00:36:24,594
just to help relieve
her financial pressure,

571
00:36:24,795 --> 00:36:26,634
so you can do your surgery smoothly.

572
00:36:26,915 --> 00:36:28,594
I didn't think that much.

573
00:36:29,154 --> 00:36:30,315
I truly realize my mistake.

574
00:36:30,315 --> 00:36:31,835
I'm sorry. So sorry.

575
00:36:31,955 --> 00:36:33,714
I was so careless.

576
00:36:33,955 --> 00:36:34,755
This is my fault.

577
00:36:34,835 --> 00:36:35,355
I swear

578
00:36:35,395 --> 00:36:36,594
it'll never happen again.

579
00:36:39,194 --> 00:36:41,154
Did the hospital punish you?

580
00:36:44,234 --> 00:36:46,074
I'll go explain it.

581
00:36:47,315 --> 00:36:49,355
I'll apologize to the family personally,

582
00:36:49,514 --> 00:36:51,114
and then clarify with hospital admin

583
00:36:51,154 --> 00:36:52,674
that you had nothing to do with this.

584
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:53,995
It's all my fault.

585
00:36:54,275 --> 00:36:55,114
I'll go do it.

586
00:36:55,355 --> 00:36:56,275
Want to apologize?

587
00:37:00,514 --> 00:37:01,114
Come with me.

588
00:37:02,795 --> 00:37:03,755
Hold on.

589
00:37:04,594 --> 00:37:05,355
Take them.

590
00:37:07,594 --> 00:37:10,937
(I Miss You in China)

591
00:37:14,634 --> 00:37:16,194
Is this enough?

592
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:19,915
You bought me ice cream.

593
00:37:20,355 --> 00:37:21,034
I forgive you.

594
00:37:24,355 --> 00:37:25,355
Not just that,

595
00:37:26,435 --> 00:37:27,234
I should thank you.

596
00:37:29,034 --> 00:37:31,475
After our communication
and explanations,

597
00:37:31,594 --> 00:37:32,514
she understands

598
00:37:32,514 --> 00:37:33,674
the surgery's complexity

599
00:37:33,915 --> 00:37:35,920
and multiple procedures needed.

600
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,395
She's willing to cooperate with us
to continue the treatment.

601
00:37:38,395 --> 00:37:40,034
Regarding your wife's actions,

602
00:37:40,315 --> 00:37:41,275
she forgave her.

603
00:37:41,995 --> 00:37:42,955
Yes! Fantastic!

604
00:37:52,594 --> 00:37:53,234
I'm sorry.

605
00:37:54,154 --> 00:37:54,755
What?

606
00:37:56,795 --> 00:37:59,154
She kept asking me

607
00:37:59,554 --> 00:38:00,955
about our relationship.

608
00:38:01,315 --> 00:38:02,435
I didn't know how to answer

609
00:38:02,435 --> 00:38:04,315
and said I'm your wife.

610
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:05,955
Sorry.

611
00:38:28,435 --> 00:38:29,955
- Hello.
- Hello.

612
00:38:30,154 --> 00:38:30,674
Hello.

613
00:38:31,514 --> 00:38:32,234
Long time no see.

614
00:38:32,795 --> 00:38:34,034
Today makes a difference.

615
00:38:34,955 --> 00:38:35,554
See you.

616
00:38:37,674 --> 00:38:38,355
Lei.

617
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:45,395
- You're here too.
- Yes.

618
00:38:46,714 --> 00:38:47,714
Where are you sitting?

619
00:38:48,315 --> 00:38:49,234
Over there.

620
00:38:51,674 --> 00:38:53,234
So far away?

621
00:38:54,634 --> 00:38:56,154
Can you even see the auction items?

622
00:38:57,475 --> 00:38:57,915
Come here.

623
00:39:01,554 --> 00:39:02,234
Sit here.

624
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:04,915
Have you been tired?

625
00:39:05,355 --> 00:39:06,154
Not really.

626
00:39:06,315 --> 00:39:07,074
Exhausted?

627
00:39:07,435 --> 00:39:08,234
No.

628
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:10,475
Good then.

629
00:39:10,594 --> 00:39:11,475
Working all day,

630
00:39:11,835 --> 00:39:13,114
you must take care.

631
00:39:18,355 --> 00:39:18,875
Lei.

632
00:39:41,915 --> 00:39:42,475
Lei.

633
00:39:44,074 --> 00:39:45,315
I just noticed

634
00:39:45,435 --> 00:39:46,755
your complexion looks dull.

635
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:47,915
Been staying up late?

636
00:39:48,674 --> 00:39:50,154
No, my complexion has been great.

637
00:39:50,594 --> 00:39:51,315
Good then.

638
00:39:53,995 --> 00:39:55,275
I wanted to tell you

639
00:39:56,355 --> 00:39:57,594
I've been really busy,

640
00:39:58,194 --> 00:39:59,755
working overtime.

641
00:40:00,475 --> 00:40:01,915
If you are available,

642
00:40:02,034 --> 00:40:03,074
could you help

643
00:40:03,074 --> 00:40:04,355
look after Haoming more?

644
00:40:07,315 --> 00:40:08,835
I know you two

645
00:40:08,875 --> 00:40:10,074
studied abroad together,

646
00:40:10,315 --> 00:40:11,315
so you know him well.

Sure.

652
00:40:28,514 --> 00:40:30,194
Don't tell her to do so.

653
00:40:31,795 --> 00:40:32,995
She's seated here.

654
00:40:33,154 --> 00:40:34,674
Just give her a break.

655
00:40:38,755 --> 00:40:41,395
They can always chat another time.

656
00:40:42,355 --> 00:40:44,435
Listen to me, stay here.

657
00:40:47,835 --> 00:40:49,795
Look, it's starting.
