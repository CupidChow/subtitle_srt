is wearing the pair available in Link 2.

These Barbie pants

Dear viewers,

50
00:03:09,807 --> 00:03:11,168
look at what Yan is holding.

51
00:03:11,288 --> 00:03:12,807
These are expired instant noodles,

52
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:14,008
expired coffee,

53
00:03:14,008 --> 00:03:15,207
and some stubborn stains

00:03:15,207 --> 00:03:16,647
like expired milk.

55
00:03:16,807 --> 00:03:17,728
To clean them,

56
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:19,728
we'd need to sweep first
and then mop, right?

57
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:20,967
But today is different

58
00:03:21,247 --> 00:03:24,008
because we have this high-end
intelligent floor washer.

59
00:03:24,527 --> 00:03:26,728
Effortlessly, without manual work,

60
00:03:26,888 --> 00:03:30,128

61
00:03:30,288 --> 00:03:31,247

When it rains

105
00:04:49,887 --> 00:04:51,088
and then the sun bakes them,

106
00:04:51,288 --> 00:04:52,807
they'll completely rust.

107
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,687
They'll rust overnight,

108
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:55,608
totally oxidized.

109
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,247
So these bars will oxidize?

110
00:04:57,648 --> 00:04:58,127

114
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:03,768
all the steel bars rust.

115
00:05:03,927 --> 00:05:05,247
So there's lots of steel inside?

116
00:05:05,288 --> 00:05:05,807
Right.

117
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:06,687

00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,048
Now it's all wasted?

119
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,327
Rust makes them unusable.

120
00:05:09,327 --> 00:05:10,240

121
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:11,528

for two matters.

135
00:05:31,528 --> 00:05:32,088
First,

136
00:05:32,247 --> 00:05:34,432
allow me to formally introduce

137
00:05:35,397 --> 00:05:39,088
Mr. Shen, who was dispatched
by the group's headquarters.

138
00:05:39,487 --> 00:05:40,367
Let's welcome him.

139
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:44,968
Alright.

140
00:05:45,447 --> 00:05:46,447
Second,

141
00:05:47,048 --> 00:05:50,768
Mr. Shen has some instructions
for everyone.

142
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:51,968
Please.

143
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:56,007
I'll skip the formalities.

144
00:05:56,968 --> 00:05:58,168
My purpose here

145
00:05:59,048 --> 00:06:02,208
is to investigate the project delays.

146
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:07,408
Of course there are issues.

147
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,848
All the problems
are laid out plain as day.

148
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:13,848
Investor Mr. Wu ran off with the money

149
00:06:14,088 --> 00:06:17,048
and wronged all my workers, right?

150
00:06:17,048 --> 00:06:17,487
Right.

151
00:06:17,487 --> 00:06:18,807
Funds were depleted after he ran.

152
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:19,608
Right?

153
00:06:19,648 --> 00:06:20,088
Right.

154
00:06:20,168 --> 00:06:21,168
As for those funds...

155
00:06:21,807 --> 00:06:22,807
Quiet down! Quiet!

156
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:24,768
Let Mr. Shen finish speaking.

157
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,327
Regarding Wu Chengming's case,

158
00:06:28,528 --> 00:06:29,608
I'll handle it for sure.

159
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:32,048
What I need to emphasize today is

160
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:33,848
these days,

161
00:06:34,447 --> 00:06:35,528
I've discovered

162
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:37,247
that at this site,

163
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:40,088
major construction issues have surfaced.

164
00:06:40,807 --> 00:06:43,528
The steel reinforcement has been exposed
to the elements too long,

165
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:44,648
causing oxidation.

166
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:49,088
Delayed window installations

167
00:06:50,048 --> 00:06:52,032
left walls and ground waterlogged

168
00:06:52,448 --> 00:06:54,327
and all pipelines moldy.

169
00:06:55,088 --> 00:06:57,408
Missing wire mesh reinforcement

170
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,327
has resulted in slab cracks.

171
00:07:00,567 --> 00:07:01,927
Due to these failures,

172
00:07:01,927 --> 00:07:03,288
immediate rectification and rework

173
00:07:03,327 --> 00:07:03,927
are required.

174
00:07:04,487 --> 00:07:06,048
Rework? With no pay?

175
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,247
Show us the money first.

176
00:07:09,007 --> 00:07:10,007
Why is rework needed?

177
00:07:10,127 --> 00:07:11,887
Mr. Shen is demanding wildly.

178
00:07:12,327 --> 00:07:14,048
Even from your office,

179
00:07:14,288 --> 00:07:16,487
you know the construction site
inside and out.

180
00:07:18,048 --> 00:07:19,567
Did you hear him, department heads?

181
00:07:19,848 --> 00:07:20,848
Okay. Rework.

182
00:07:21,048 --> 00:07:22,367
You need money for that.

183
00:07:22,927 --> 00:07:23,608
Mr. Shen,

184
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:26,168
the group has no allocated budget.

185
00:07:26,327 --> 00:07:28,247
What can we proceed

186
00:07:28,528 --> 00:07:29,408
and rework with?

187
00:07:29,447 --> 00:07:29,848
Right.

188
00:07:29,887 --> 00:07:30,327
Am I right?

189
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:30,848
Exactly.

190
00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:31,848
There's no money.

191
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:33,807
It's mainly about money.

192
00:07:33,968 --> 00:07:35,327
No money, no rework.

193
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:35,807
Right.

194
00:07:35,848 --> 00:07:36,528
Right?

195
00:07:36,648 --> 00:07:37,768
Without money...

196
00:07:37,807 --> 00:07:39,127
Quiet! Quiet!

197
00:07:39,768 --> 00:07:40,807
Quiet! Quiet!

198
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:45,367
Lost control, have we?

199
00:07:47,127 --> 00:07:47,768
Everyone,

200
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,687
we've collaborated for years.

201
00:07:49,807 --> 00:07:51,088
Challenges exist,

202
00:07:51,247 --> 00:07:53,127
but Mr. Shen's new here.

203
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:54,768
He needs time to understand.

204
00:07:54,848 --> 00:07:57,088
How about this? Do me a favor.

205
00:07:57,288 --> 00:07:57,807
Let's...

206
00:07:57,848 --> 00:08:02,048
We followed
the company's guidelines, right?

207
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:04,757
Now you are accusing us
of non-compliance baselessly.

208
00:08:04,757 --> 00:08:05,728
That's not fair!

209
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,048
That's not fair!

210
00:08:07,088 --> 00:08:07,528
Exactly!

211
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:08,168
Right?

212
00:08:08,848 --> 00:08:11,288
Produce your individual contracts.

213
00:08:12,168 --> 00:08:14,288
We'll verify construction quality

214
00:08:14,487 --> 00:08:17,648
against initial specifications.

215
00:08:18,048 --> 00:08:20,968
No individual contracts.
We're just subcontractors.

216
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:24,447
Then we'll sign
new individual contracts today.

217
00:08:25,447 --> 00:08:27,048
How to sign that?

218
00:08:27,408 --> 00:08:28,007
Exactly.

219
00:08:28,088 --> 00:08:31,447
The contracts specify
construction standards.

220
00:08:32,608 --> 00:08:37,367
(Labor Contract)
Compliant ones receive timely payments.

221
00:08:38,247 --> 00:08:40,648
Non-compliant work gets rectified

222
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:43,968
with penalties for poor execution.

223
00:08:44,887 --> 00:08:46,648
All is clearly stipulated.

224
00:08:49,888 --> 00:08:50,727
Mr. Shen,

225
00:08:50,888 --> 00:08:52,447
this approach is unreasonable.

226
00:08:53,288 --> 00:08:56,368
I've managed projects for decades.

227
00:08:56,807 --> 00:08:58,768
These workers answer to me.

228
00:08:59,368 --> 00:09:01,847
We work under master contracts.
No individual contracts.

229
00:09:02,447 --> 00:09:04,168
You're breaking industry norms.

230
00:09:04,447 --> 00:09:05,847
It undermines my authority.

231
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,248
No one will respect me.

232
00:09:07,368 --> 00:09:10,807
Our contracts
only govern construction standards

233
00:09:11,288 --> 00:09:12,447
and payment terms.

234
00:09:13,368 --> 00:09:15,048
No management authority is included.

235
00:09:15,727 --> 00:09:19,648
But from now on, all workers' salaries
won't go through your hands.

236
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:26,048
And future financial audits
won't be a burden anymore.

237
00:09:26,727 --> 00:09:27,528
Isn't that good?

238
00:09:28,408 --> 00:09:29,168
Yes.

239
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:30,648
It's great.

240
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:32,408
It's great.

241
00:09:39,128 --> 00:09:41,128
- So much money?
- It's a lot!

242
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,408
Starting today,

243
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:48,368
report to my office
after work every day.

244
00:09:49,087 --> 00:09:50,768
Wages will be paid daily.

245
00:09:51,248 --> 00:09:52,087
Does your word count?

246
00:09:52,128 --> 00:09:53,528
Can we trust your word?

247
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:54,768
Do you mean it?

248
00:09:54,847 --> 00:09:57,087
Those who agree can sign the contract.

249
00:09:57,528 --> 00:09:58,128
I'll sign it!

250
00:09:59,368 --> 00:10:00,168
No pushing.

251
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:02,087
Stop shoving! Wait your turn.

252
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:02,727
Mr. Shen,

253
00:10:03,128 --> 00:10:04,207
if you insist on this,

254
00:10:04,327 --> 00:10:05,768
we're walking out.

255
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:07,168
We won't work today.

256
00:10:07,368 --> 00:10:08,008
Brothers,

257
00:10:08,288 --> 00:10:09,288
- let's go!
- Let's go!

258
00:10:09,288 --> 00:10:09,847
Let's go home.

259
00:10:10,008 --> 00:10:11,927
Li! Li, don't leave!

260
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:13,087
Li, don't leave!

261
00:10:13,168 --> 00:10:13,727
Nobody leaves!

262
00:10:13,727 --> 00:10:14,368
I'm leaving.

263
00:10:14,368 --> 00:10:15,927
Mr. Shen, these are all key personnel.

264
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:16,888
If they leave,

265
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:18,288
the project will collapse.

266
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:19,087
Move aside.

267
00:10:19,248 --> 00:10:20,008
Don't go.

268
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,207
Hello, Mr. Zhang?

269
00:10:24,087 --> 00:10:25,248
Come report

270
00:10:25,528 --> 00:10:26,967
at 11 as agreed yesterday.

271
00:10:27,408 --> 00:10:28,087
Okay, Mr. Shen.

272
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:29,927
I'll bring the whole tech team with me.

273
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:34,648
Good.

274
00:10:35,408 --> 00:10:36,607
Don't regret this.

275
00:10:36,888 --> 00:10:37,488
Let's go!

276
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:38,927
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

277
00:10:38,967 --> 00:10:39,687
Let's go.

278
00:10:39,687 --> 00:10:44,055
♪Cause I just have been hurt
too many times♪

279
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:49,008
♪I'm giving it all,
just getting nothing back♪

280
00:10:49,008 --> 00:10:51,048
The money came at the perfect time.

281
00:10:54,327 --> 00:10:55,128
Sign here.

282
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:55,847
Okay.

283
00:10:56,128 --> 00:10:56,648
Here?

284
00:10:56,807 --> 00:10:58,368
I'll keep this copy. You take that one.

285
00:10:58,488 --> 00:10:59,607
Great, thanks.

286
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:01,207
Okay. This one's yours.

287
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:03,128
Right, okay.

288
00:11:03,327 --> 00:11:03,847
Thanks.

289
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:04,288
Sign here.

290
00:11:05,727 --> 00:11:06,128
Okay.

291
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:08,807
Perfect.

292
00:11:09,248 --> 00:11:09,847
Sign here.

293
00:11:10,288 --> 00:11:11,567
(Labor Contract)
Sign your name here.

294
00:11:11,687 --> 00:11:12,207
Right.

295
00:11:13,168 --> 00:11:13,727
Here.

296
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:14,447
Come on.

297
00:11:17,048 --> 00:11:19,048
Mr. Shen, you wanted to see me?

298
00:11:19,967 --> 00:11:20,248
Sit.

299
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,048
Let's discuss

300
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,648
the specifics of the project delays.

301
00:11:31,327 --> 00:11:32,207
No problem.

302
00:11:32,607 --> 00:11:33,288
Mr. Shen,

303
00:11:33,368 --> 00:11:35,847
I genuinely admire your work ethic.

304
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,087
Ask anything you need.

305
00:11:37,168 --> 00:11:37,888
I'll cooperate.

306
00:11:40,048 --> 00:11:41,447
Your report to headquarters

307
00:11:41,447 --> 00:11:44,687
stated material and labor cost increases

308
00:11:45,128 --> 00:11:47,447
made the project unprofitable
for the contractor,

309
00:11:47,927 --> 00:11:49,607
leading to his unauthorized loans

310
00:11:50,048 --> 00:11:51,687
and eventual absconding with funds.

311
00:11:52,207 --> 00:11:52,768
Yes.

312
00:11:53,248 --> 00:11:54,567
That's the whole story.

313
00:11:55,168 --> 00:11:58,528
Material and labor costs did rise.

314
00:11:59,048 --> 00:12:02,087
But there is a sequence problem.

315
00:12:03,248 --> 00:12:05,447
Repeated rework delayed our progress,

316
00:12:06,248 --> 00:12:07,567
squandering labor

317
00:12:08,288 --> 00:12:10,008
and materials.

318
00:12:10,447 --> 00:12:11,648
We had to restock

319
00:12:12,087 --> 00:12:13,207
and reconstruct.

320
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:14,888
Over time,

321
00:12:15,528 --> 00:12:18,528
it resulted in increases
in material and labor costs.

322
00:12:24,727 --> 00:12:28,567
Every rework cycle meant new purchases

323
00:12:29,288 --> 00:12:32,008
and recalculated labor expenses.

324
00:12:32,248 --> 00:12:34,727
There were plenty of opportunities
for manipulation.

325
00:12:38,087 --> 00:12:40,927
In other words, embezzlement.

326
00:12:43,488 --> 00:12:46,447
You're saying the contractors
sabotaged work?

327
00:12:48,687 --> 00:12:50,008
Those scoundrels.

328
00:12:51,847 --> 00:12:53,807
As branch head,

329
00:12:54,248 --> 00:12:57,368
you failed to supervise contractors

330
00:12:58,768 --> 00:13:00,008
and repeatedly pled ignorance.

331
00:13:00,648 --> 00:13:01,888
Mr. Shen,

332
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:03,607
you don't understand.

333
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:06,368
After Wu from
Anqiang Construction absconded,

334
00:13:07,528 --> 00:13:08,847
I have been fully occupied.

335
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,327
Hundreds of workers mean
hundreds of mouths to feed.

336
00:13:11,447 --> 00:13:12,687
They need to eat and get paid.

337
00:13:12,687 --> 00:13:14,368
I also need to report back to the group.

338
00:13:14,607 --> 00:13:15,128
I...

339
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:16,607
Three days.

340
00:13:18,648 --> 00:13:19,687
You have only three days.

341
00:13:21,248 --> 00:13:25,408
From project initiation till now,
all procurement quotes,

342
00:13:26,008 --> 00:13:27,008
actual expenditures,

343
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:28,528
and employee salaries,

344
00:13:28,847 --> 00:13:29,727
compile them for me.

345
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:30,727
No way.

346
00:13:31,248 --> 00:13:32,288
Three days aren't enough.

347
00:13:32,727 --> 00:13:33,687
Even a week won't work.

348
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:35,207
Three days.

349
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:49,327
Come in.

350
00:13:53,087 --> 00:13:53,768
Mr. Qiu,

351
00:13:54,727 --> 00:13:57,687
I'd like to request
doing a solo live stream.

352
00:13:59,368 --> 00:14:00,168
Are you sure?

353
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:03,648
Hello, everyone.

354
00:14:03,648 --> 00:14:04,687
Hello.

355
00:14:04,687 --> 00:14:05,327
Hey, everyone.

356
00:14:05,327 --> 00:14:07,327
Welcome to Yan's live stream.

357
00:14:07,687 --> 00:14:10,408
Today, we're still selling
our top-selling product:

358
00:14:10,447 --> 00:14:11,488
boneless chicken feet.

359
00:14:11,488 --> 00:14:12,128
Right.

360
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:13,327
Today...

361
00:14:13,888 --> 00:14:15,687
(Yes, people are asking
for chicken feet.)

362
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:16,368
Yes.

363
00:14:16,368 --> 00:14:18,408
Today's deal is even more explosive.

364
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,008
Here's how today's promotion works.

365
00:14:20,048 --> 00:14:22,207
Let me explain
our benefits mechanism, okay?

366
00:14:27,008 --> 00:14:29,528
(For one regular 500g pack
of chicken feet,)

367
00:14:29,528 --> 00:14:32,768
(we'll give you a 250g pack)

368
00:14:33,128 --> 00:14:35,248
(plus another 250g pack.)

369
00:14:35,528 --> 00:14:38,048
(So you get three packs
for the price of one.)

370
00:14:38,607 --> 00:14:39,648
(Buy one, get two free.)

371
00:14:39,648 --> 00:14:40,727
(Buy one, get two free.)

372
00:14:40,727 --> 00:14:42,447
(Today's deal
is incredibly cost-effective.)

373
00:14:42,807 --> 00:14:43,488
- (Right?)
- (Exactly.)

374
00:14:45,768 --> 00:14:47,248
Take a closer look.

375
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:49,327
141.

376
00:14:49,408 --> 00:14:50,447
141. This isn't right.

377
00:14:50,607 --> 00:14:51,207
This one?

378
00:14:51,207 --> 00:14:52,008
There's an issue.

379
00:14:52,008 --> 00:14:53,087
You need to verify this.

380
00:14:53,128 --> 00:14:53,687
Okay.

381
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:54,488
Take a look.

382
00:14:55,087 --> 00:14:55,768
You guys check.

383
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:56,607
No problem.

384
00:14:56,607 --> 00:14:57,368
It's good here.

385
00:14:57,408 --> 00:14:57,967
Look here.

386
00:14:58,248 --> 00:14:58,847
Check here.

387
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,168
You guys continue.

388
00:15:00,168 --> 00:15:01,168
(For Resting)
Okay, you go ahead, Mr. Shen.

389
00:15:03,368 --> 00:15:04,408
What we just reviewed...

390
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:05,248
Hello, Chen.

391
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:06,327
Mr. Shen,

392
00:15:07,128 --> 00:15:09,847
there's something you need to check.

393
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:11,648
I've sent the link to your phone.

394
00:15:11,888 --> 00:15:12,408
Okay.

395
00:15:13,852 --> 00:15:15,351
(Chen Lin: Link)

396
00:15:16,607 --> 00:15:18,048
(We're selling at such a low price.)

397
00:15:18,048 --> 00:15:20,168
(So viewers who love chicken feet,)

398
00:15:20,408 --> 00:15:21,408
(place your orders now.)

399
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:22,447
(It's delicious.)

400
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:24,327
(Warm Harbor placed 20 orders!)

401
00:15:24,528 --> 00:15:25,984
(20 orders! Thanks for the support.)

402
00:15:27,447 --> 00:15:28,488
(Thank you, Warm Harbor.)

403
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:29,888
(Thank you so much.)

404
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:30,447
(Thank you.)

405
00:15:30,447 --> 00:15:31,927
(You love chicken feet, right?)

406
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,207
(I super like you.)

407
00:15:34,288 --> 00:15:35,368
(Ms. Xu, you're so pretty.)

408
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:37,567
(Warm Harbor sent a carnival gift.)

409
00:15:38,008 --> 00:15:39,888
(Thanks for the carnival gift,
Warm Harbor.)

410
00:15:40,248 --> 00:15:41,447
(Thanks for liking me.)

411
00:15:41,528 --> 00:15:42,567
(Thank you, Warm Harbor,)

412
00:15:42,727 --> 00:15:43,567
(for supporting me.)

413
00:15:43,607 --> 00:15:45,807
(If I select better products later,)

414
00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:47,168
(I'll share them with you, okay?)

415
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:48,927
(Thank you, Warm Harbor.)

416
00:15:49,087 --> 00:15:49,807
(Now,)

417
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:51,687
(we'll continue
selling our hot product:)

418
00:15:51,888 --> 00:15:52,927
(boneless chicken feet.)

419
00:15:53,008 --> 00:15:53,648
(That's right.)

420
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,338
(Do not imitate)

421
00:15:57,668 --> 00:15:59,644
(Confirm order.)

422
00:15:59,768 --> 00:16:01,927
PromiseKeeper placed 50 orders!

423
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:03,488
(PromiseKeeper: 50 orders)
Thanks for placing 50 orders!

424
00:16:04,768 --> 00:16:06,048
They really love chicken feet.

425
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:06,528
Exactly.

426
00:16:06,607 --> 00:16:07,207
Right?

427
00:16:07,488 --> 00:16:09,248
Thank you, PromiseKeeper.

428
00:16:09,248 --> 00:16:10,168
(Your chicken feet...)

429
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:11,888
(Backend team, listen up.)

430
00:16:12,128 --> 00:16:15,207
(For the orders from PromiseKeeper
and Warm Harbor,)

431
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:15,727
(well,)

432
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,087
(expedite shipping, okay?)

433
00:16:17,087 --> 00:16:17,967
(Copy that. Expedite!)

434
00:16:19,248 --> 00:16:20,768
(Ms. Xu, I bought some too.)

435
00:16:20,807 --> 00:16:21,967
(I like Sichuan cuisine,)

436
00:16:22,087 --> 00:16:23,207
(and I like you more.)

437
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:24,488
(Thank you.)

438
00:16:24,727 --> 00:16:26,888
Warm Harbor placed 70 orders!

439
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:28,687
(Thanks for placing 70 orders!)

440
00:16:29,008 --> 00:16:30,128
(Thank you for liking me.)

441
00:16:30,168 --> 00:16:31,248
(Thank you, Warm Harbor,)

442
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:32,528
(for supporting me.)

443
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:33,248
(Now,)

444
00:16:33,248 --> 00:16:36,128
(we'll continue selling
our hot product: boneless chicken feet.)

445
00:16:36,224 --> 00:16:36,888
(That's right.)

446
00:16:36,888 --> 00:16:39,248
(PromiseKeeper: 100 orders)
PromiseKeeper placed 100 orders!

447
00:16:39,408 --> 00:16:41,727
(Warm Harbor: 150 orders)
Warm Harbor placed 150 orders!

448
00:16:41,888 --> 00:16:43,488
Thanks for supporting us
with 150 orders!

449
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:45,648
(Thanks for your support!)

450
00:16:46,687 --> 00:16:47,888
(Thanks for your support!)

451
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:49,807
Warm Harbor?

452
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:51,008
It's him again?

453
00:16:51,327 --> 00:16:52,567
All the 50, 70, and 100 orders.

454
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:54,288
Can they really consume
hundreds of orders?

455
00:16:54,607 --> 00:16:55,368
Is he a wholesaler?

456
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:58,128
Why care if he's a wholesaler?

457
00:16:58,408 --> 00:17:00,447
This is the biggest spender
from her live stream.

458
00:17:00,847 --> 00:17:02,408
Undoubtedly the top contributor.

459
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:05,528
Well... Uh...

460
00:17:06,207 --> 00:17:08,128
Do we have enough stock? Check now.

461
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:09,288
- Check stock.
- Roger that!

462
00:17:09,327 --> 00:17:10,128
If possible,

463
00:17:10,168 --> 00:17:11,927
(Do not imitate)
(expedite shipping for them, okay?)

464
00:17:12,128 --> 00:17:12,847
- (Okay.)
- (Alright.)

465
00:17:12,967 --> 00:17:13,847
(Let's move on.)

466
00:17:13,927 --> 00:17:15,607
(We don't have much stock left.)

467
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,567
Mr. Shen, come here please.

468
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,087
(Thank you.)

469
00:17:18,087 --> 00:17:18,528
(Thanks.)

470
00:17:18,607 --> 00:17:19,607
(Thanks for the support.)

471
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:20,248
(Thank you.)

472
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:23,488
That's childish.

473
00:17:30,728 --> 00:17:31,647
Ms. Xu.

474
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:35,887
I've talked so much my lips are chapped.

475
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:42,248
Hosting live streams
is like being a celebrity.

476
00:17:42,847 --> 00:17:44,488
You need to pamper and retain your fans.

477
00:17:45,087 --> 00:17:48,607
Warm Harbor's massive orders
in your stream

478
00:17:48,688 --> 00:17:51,167
could stock a small supermarket.

479
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:53,448
They just want to meet you offline

480
00:17:53,528 --> 00:17:54,847
and have coffee with you.

481
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:57,607
That's not unreasonable, right?

482
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:13,208
Understood, Mr. Qiu.

483
00:18:14,048 --> 00:18:14,768
I'll go.

484
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:16,847
You finally came around.

485
00:18:42,528 --> 00:18:43,887
Excuse me.

486
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,448
Are you Warm Harbor?

487
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:49,728
No.

488
00:18:49,847 --> 00:18:50,607
Wrong person.

489
00:18:51,288 --> 00:18:52,288
Sorry about that.

490
00:18:54,807 --> 00:18:55,647
Sis-in-law.

491
00:19:13,807 --> 00:19:14,887
Top contributor?

492
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:18,567
Warm Harbor?

493
00:19:19,887 --> 00:19:21,167
My teacher taught me:

494
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,807
Home is the warm harbor.

495
00:19:26,607 --> 00:19:27,768
Your teacher was right.

496
00:19:29,248 --> 00:19:29,968
Haochen,

497
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:32,768
where'd you get money
for the stream orders?

498
00:19:33,968 --> 00:19:35,688
I used Ms. Hui's phone.

499
00:19:36,847 --> 00:19:37,688
Ms. Hui,

500
00:19:38,127 --> 00:19:39,127
did you top up?

501
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:40,807
It's done.

502
00:19:41,127 --> 00:19:41,567
Here.

503
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:42,127
Thanks.

504
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:46,127
Can I repay you in cash later?

505
00:19:46,288 --> 00:19:47,008
Okay.

506
00:19:47,807 --> 00:19:49,008
I'm happy to do anything

507
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:49,768
to help Xu Yan.

508
00:19:55,008 --> 00:19:56,048
What's wrong?

509
00:19:56,327 --> 00:19:58,048
I'll transfer the money to Ms. Hui.

510
00:19:58,167 --> 00:19:59,008
Tell her later...

511
00:19:59,327 --> 00:20:00,367
Don't bother.

512
00:20:00,488 --> 00:20:02,048
I'll repay her with my gift money.

513
00:20:02,048 --> 00:20:02,728
It's done.

514
00:20:03,087 --> 00:20:03,728
Wait.

515
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:05,567
Shen Haochen,

516
00:20:07,887 --> 00:20:10,728
remember two things from now on.

517
00:20:11,807 --> 00:20:12,448
First,

518
00:20:13,248 --> 00:20:16,367
no more ordering from live streams.

519
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:17,327
And second?

520
00:20:19,847 --> 00:20:20,488
Second,

521
00:20:22,807 --> 00:20:24,327
remember what I just said.

522
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:29,968
Wait.

523
00:20:31,407 --> 00:20:32,008
By the way,

524
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:34,087
all the stuff you bought

525
00:20:35,327 --> 00:20:37,127
wasn't shipped to your home.

526
00:20:37,607 --> 00:20:38,407
Where did it go?

527
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:41,288
My brother supports an orphanage.

528
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:42,928
I donated everything there.

529
00:20:50,087 --> 00:20:51,167
You're quite smart.

530
00:20:53,448 --> 00:20:54,688
Not that you did right.

531
00:20:58,288 --> 00:20:59,167
Sis-in-law,

532
00:20:59,807 --> 00:21:01,768
I really miss you.

533
00:21:02,008 --> 00:21:03,528
Mom misses you too.

534
00:21:04,248 --> 00:21:05,968
We've all lost weight lately.

535
00:21:06,528 --> 00:21:08,008
I miss your cooking.

536
00:21:11,127 --> 00:21:12,327
Let me show you something.

537
00:21:17,647 --> 00:21:18,288
Look.

538
00:21:19,407 --> 00:21:21,208
You don't have to move out
for your business.

539
00:21:21,567 --> 00:21:24,048
Look how unhappy my brother is.

540
00:21:24,127 --> 00:21:25,327
He often zones out.

541
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:31,807
Tell me.

542
00:21:31,887 --> 00:21:33,048
What did my brother do?

543
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,288
I'll have my mom beat him.

544
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,208
No.

545
00:21:40,847 --> 00:21:43,567
Your brother is just overwhelmed
with work.

546
00:21:43,847 --> 00:21:45,488
So don't bother him all the time.

547
00:21:45,728 --> 00:21:46,768
That's not like that.

548
00:21:46,768 --> 00:21:49,688
I can tell he's just missing you.

549
00:21:50,127 --> 00:21:51,208
Can you forgive him

550
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,567
and come home with me?

551
00:21:53,887 --> 00:21:56,248
I'm begging you.

552
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,887
Can't you really come home?

553
00:22:11,327 --> 00:22:12,167
Now look.

554
00:22:13,048 --> 00:22:14,288
Both of you left home.

555
00:22:15,448 --> 00:22:16,768
The house feels completely empty.

556
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:26,567
Where is your brother?

557
00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:29,248
My dad sent him
to a branch office out of town.

558
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:30,928
He might not return for months.

559
00:22:37,087 --> 00:22:37,688
Haochen.

560
00:22:39,488 --> 00:22:41,327
Do you remember my phone number?

561
00:22:43,607 --> 00:22:45,048
Call me anytime if you do.

562
00:22:45,768 --> 00:22:46,887
If you miss me,

563
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:48,087
just call me.

564
00:22:48,288 --> 00:22:49,087
I'll come see you.

565
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:52,087
We can go wherever you want. Okay?

566
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:55,928
Really?

567
00:22:56,367 --> 00:22:57,448
Did I ever lie to you?

568
00:22:58,327 --> 00:22:59,327
Promise?

569
00:22:59,448 --> 00:23:00,127
Promise.

570
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:03,887
Slow down.

571
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:05,688
I can go anywhere I want?

572
00:23:05,807 --> 00:23:06,807
Anywhere...

573
00:23:08,192 --> 00:23:09,216
Where do you like to go?

574
00:23:09,567 --> 00:23:10,567
I was just saying.

575
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:23,768
(Is it heavy?)

576
00:23:23,928 --> 00:23:24,448
(Not heavy.)

577
00:23:24,968 --> 00:23:25,928
(Five kilos.)

578
00:23:26,607 --> 00:23:27,607
(Five kilos of water.)

579
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:28,488
(Five kilos of water.)

580
00:23:28,488 --> 00:23:29,887
(Come on, show our friends.)

581
00:23:31,647 --> 00:23:33,208
(Look, five kilos of water.)

582
00:23:33,607 --> 00:23:34,887
(How's the trash bag quality?)

583
00:23:34,968 --> 00:23:36,288
(Pretty good, right?)

584
00:23:36,327 --> 00:23:37,407
(We're not lying to you.)

585
00:23:37,968 --> 00:23:41,288
(These bags come in extra-thick
and thin versions.)

586
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:43,528
(But they're equally durable.)

587
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,367
(Braley joined the live stream)

588
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:47,728
How much for four packs?

589
00:23:47,887 --> 00:23:49,208
9.9 yuan.

590
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:50,208
Get ready to go on.

591
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:51,127
Three, two, one.

592
00:23:51,127 --> 00:23:51,887
Attach the link!

593
00:23:51,928 --> 00:23:52,448
(Great.)

594
00:23:52,728 --> 00:23:53,847
(Thank you, guys.)

595
00:23:55,008 --> 00:23:56,288
(She's a notorious gold-digger,)

596
00:23:56,688 --> 00:23:57,807
(trying to marry the rich.)

597
00:24:01,728 --> 00:24:03,647
(That gold-digger streamer)

598
00:24:03,688 --> 00:24:04,887
(wants to marry a rich man.)

599
00:24:04,928 --> 00:24:05,728
(For real?)

600
00:24:07,688 --> 00:24:09,688
Some of you haven't followed yet?

601
00:24:09,968 --> 00:24:11,087
Just touch here to follow.

602
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:12,008
See it?

603
00:24:12,008 --> 00:24:13,127
Just touch here.

604
00:24:13,248 --> 00:24:15,688
We'll send out a gift next, okay?

605
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:16,248
Here it is.

606
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:18,208
Thanks to our new viewers today.

607
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,008
Thank you.

608
00:24:19,008 --> 00:24:20,448
(Got kicked out by the rich family?)

609
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:22,008
(Interesting.)

610
00:24:22,167 --> 00:24:23,367
(Do a sad housewife act.)

611
00:24:23,448 --> 00:24:24,208
(No need to act.)

612
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:25,728
(She is already selling trash bags.)

613
00:24:25,807 --> 00:24:26,928
(She is practically sad.)

614
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:28,607
(She is an abandoned housewife.)

615
00:24:33,528 --> 00:24:35,248
(Why silent? Dance or we cancel orders.)
(Sing, and we'll buy 20.)

616
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,087
(Sing and dance for 30 orders.)

617
00:24:37,087 --> 00:24:39,048
(Get yourself in the bag,
and we'll buy 40.)

618
00:24:39,448 --> 00:24:40,607
(Why isn't she talking?)

619
00:24:41,327 --> 00:24:42,248
(Even got thrown out.)

620
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:43,327
(Watch your attitude!)

621
00:24:43,327 --> 00:24:44,647
(Dance, or we'll cancel orders.)

622
00:24:44,647 --> 00:24:45,847
(Gold-digger can't handle it.)

623
00:24:45,928 --> 00:24:46,567
(Return!)

624
00:24:49,127 --> 00:24:50,048
(Viewer Analytics)
(How come she's mute?)

625
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:51,208
(She left.)
(Streamer froze.)

626
00:24:51,528 --> 00:24:52,248
(Gender, Age)
(She is over.)

627
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,327
(Still silent?)

628
00:24:53,807 --> 00:24:54,887
Speak.

629
00:24:55,688 --> 00:24:56,607
Say something.

630
00:24:56,847 --> 00:24:57,607
What's wrong?

631
00:24:58,407 --> 00:25:00,087
Speak!

632
00:25:01,248 --> 00:25:02,087
(No one cheers.)

633
00:25:02,087 --> 00:25:02,528
Speak.

634
00:25:09,847 --> 00:25:11,968
Turn the AC low, please.

635
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:12,807
It's sweltering.

636
00:25:13,607 --> 00:25:14,208
Got it.

637
00:25:14,448 --> 00:25:15,887
I just saw some viewers asking

638
00:25:16,327 --> 00:25:18,167
if this is big enough to fit a person.

639
00:25:18,407 --> 00:25:20,407
Type one
if you think it can fit someone.

640
00:25:20,688 --> 00:25:22,288
Type two if you disagree. Okay?

641
00:25:22,847 --> 00:25:23,847
Let's test out

642
00:25:23,847 --> 00:25:25,688
if this big trash bag can hold a person.

643
00:25:25,887 --> 00:25:26,847
Luo, help me.

644
00:25:27,688 --> 00:25:28,248
Okay.

645
00:25:29,367 --> 00:25:30,728
(Yes, some are typing one.)

646
00:25:30,728 --> 00:25:31,887
(There's quite a crowd.)

647
00:25:32,087 --> 00:25:33,887
Don't forget to follow us.

648
00:25:33,887 --> 00:25:34,968
Thank you.

649
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:36,768
Alright.

650
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,647
Let's check it out.

651
00:25:39,728 --> 00:25:42,048
The trash bags are extremely good.

652
00:25:42,127 --> 00:25:43,288
I suggest you

653
00:25:43,327 --> 00:25:44,647
go for the extra-thick version.

654
00:25:44,807 --> 00:25:47,008
(Because the extra-thick ones)

655
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,167
(can handle any weight.)

656
00:25:49,008 --> 00:25:49,928
(Trust me.)

657
00:25:50,127 --> 00:25:50,847
(See?)

658
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:52,647
(Okay, thanks.)

659
00:25:52,768 --> 00:25:53,688
(Thank you.)

660
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:54,768
Guess how much damage

661
00:25:54,768 --> 00:25:56,728
you've caused me with this stream?

662
00:25:58,607 --> 00:26:00,928
Ignoring comments counts as an error.

663
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:03,647
Just standing there for so long!

664
00:26:04,008 --> 00:26:06,127
Is this how you repay my trust?

665
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:09,127
I'm sorry, Mr. Qiu.

666
00:26:09,647 --> 00:26:10,647
It won't happen again.

667
00:26:12,688 --> 00:26:14,127
And about the follower Warm Harbor,

668
00:26:14,847 --> 00:26:17,448
didn't I tell you to please
and retain any follower?

669
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:20,167
But you met him offline once

670
00:26:20,407 --> 00:26:21,768
and made his account suspended.

671
00:26:22,327 --> 00:26:23,208
One follower less.

672
00:26:25,807 --> 00:26:26,928
Mr. Qiu, here's the thing.

673
00:26:27,567 --> 00:26:30,127
The person I met was actually a minor

674
00:26:30,607 --> 00:26:32,327
using his parent's phone for shopping.

675
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:35,087
We can't profit from minors.

676
00:26:35,167 --> 00:26:36,528
So I persuaded him to...

677
00:26:37,928 --> 00:26:38,768
Enough.

678
00:26:39,607 --> 00:26:40,640
You always have reasons.

679
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,784
Don't promote this product anymore.

680
00:26:42,928 --> 00:26:44,887
I'll schedule you
for an outdoor live stream.

681
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:49,607
I'll do as you say.

682
00:26:50,768 --> 00:26:51,448
Or what?

683
00:26:52,448 --> 00:26:53,688
You're free to leave.

684
00:26:54,327 --> 00:26:55,048
I'll comply.

685
00:26:57,167 --> 00:26:58,807
Just leave if you don't.

686
00:26:59,887 --> 00:27:00,768
Thank you, Mr. Qiu.

687
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:14,087
Yes.

688
00:27:14,327 --> 00:27:15,407
It's the 5th anniversary.

689
00:27:15,528 --> 00:27:16,367
Yes.

690
00:27:16,407 --> 00:27:17,567
These items are on sale.

691
00:27:17,647 --> 00:27:21,887
Today marks the 5th anniversary

692
00:27:22,327 --> 00:27:23,367
of Daxingfa Supermarket.

693
00:27:23,647 --> 00:27:24,968
That's why we've moved products

694
00:27:25,008 --> 00:27:26,288
to our live stream!

695
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:27,488
Look at Link 1,

696
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:28,887
the rapeseed oil.

697
00:27:28,928 --> 00:27:29,728
As I said,

698
00:27:29,728 --> 00:27:30,887
it's non-GMO, cold press,

699
00:27:31,008 --> 00:27:32,528
normally priced at 89.9 yuan.

700
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:34,248
Today's special, 45.5 yuan!

701
00:27:34,248 --> 00:27:35,127
Get ready to go on.

702
00:27:35,127 --> 00:27:36,008
Three, two, one.

703
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:37,008
Attach the link!

704
00:27:37,008 --> 00:27:38,167
Listen, guys,

705
00:27:38,488 --> 00:27:40,087
our physical store is located

706
00:27:40,087 --> 00:27:43,288
at Jingzhou Cultural Park.

707
00:27:43,448 --> 00:27:44,928
Jingzhou Cultural Park.

708
00:27:45,087 --> 00:27:46,688
Right next to the ticket booth.

709
00:27:46,688 --> 00:27:49,367
It's crowded here, isn't it?

710
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:51,248
But online,

711
00:27:51,448 --> 00:27:54,008
we offer the same great deals!

♪Ready to shine♪

713
00:27:58,488 --> 00:27:59,728
Recently,

714
00:27:59,728 --> 00:28:01,008
Amy has been acting up.

715
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:01,887
Amy,

716
00:28:02,167 --> 00:28:02,607
be good.

717
00:28:02,607 --> 00:28:03,528
Maybe she's in heat?

718
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,208
Puppies need mates too.

719
00:28:05,968 --> 00:28:06,887
Find her a match.

720
00:28:07,008 --> 00:28:07,528
Sure,

721
00:28:07,768 --> 00:28:08,728
I'll arrange one.

722
00:28:09,127 --> 00:28:09,847
Forget it.

723
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:13,448
Yan just started Financial News, right?

724
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,327
She was doing well.

725
00:28:15,768 --> 00:28:17,288
Why quit suddenly?

726
00:28:18,127 --> 00:28:20,407
Yan has always been decisive.

727
00:28:20,807 --> 00:28:23,248
She wants to start a business.
Our whole family supports her.

728
00:28:25,167 --> 00:28:26,928
Being a news anchor brings fame

729
00:28:26,928 --> 00:28:27,928
and influence.

730
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,728
Why start up a business?

731
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:32,048
We've seen enough
struggling entrepreneurs.

732
00:28:32,407 --> 00:28:33,768
Sounds good,

733
00:28:33,847 --> 00:28:35,528
but they have to suffer a lot.

734
00:28:36,688 --> 00:28:38,728
It'll be hard to see Ms. Xu, right?

735
00:28:38,928 --> 00:28:40,488
I'm even starting to miss her.

736
00:28:43,087 --> 00:28:43,807
Ms. Yu.

737
00:28:46,367 --> 00:28:47,127
Ms. Meng.

738
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,248
Ms. Ma.

739
00:28:48,528 --> 00:28:49,288
Ms. Sun.

00:28:53,528 --> 00:28:54,847
There's an excellent event.

Awesome!

748
00:29:25,647 --> 00:29:26,327
Impressive!

749
00:29:27,008 --> 00:29:28,087
What is this place?

750
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,528
Why brought us here?

751
00:29:30,528 --> 00:29:31,127
Lei.

752
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:32,928
Why did you bring us here?

Let's go check it out.

755
00:29:36,887 --> 00:29:37,728
Why come here?

756
00:29:37,968 --> 00:29:38,688

768
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:04,008

769
00:30:06,048 --> 00:30:09,208
Is that what she started?

770
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:10,448

Did you bring us here to watch this?

778
00:30:26,968 --> 00:30:27,887
Of course not.

779
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:31,448
I saw online
that Yan was hosting an event here.

780
00:30:31,688 --> 00:30:33,928
Didn't you all miss her?

781
00:30:34,928 --> 00:30:37,208
I just wanted us to check it out.

782
00:30:37,607 --> 00:30:39,928
Never imagined she'd be doing this.

783
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:41,807
Choose any cookware, alright?

784
00:30:41,968 --> 00:30:43,728
Let me show you that pan.

785
00:30:43,807 --> 00:30:45,448

793
00:31:14,607 --> 00:31:15,127
Springy!

794
00:31:15,127 --> 00:31:15,728
Ms. Yu.

795
00:31:16,288 --> 00:31:18,607
What's going on here?

796
00:31:18,647 --> 00:31:20,407
Ms. Xu wants to know each step
of a business?

797
00:31:21,127 --> 00:31:22,248
Even so,

798
00:31:22,488 --> 00:31:25,208
she shouldn't toil outdoors like this.

799
00:31:25,807 --> 00:31:27,208
Look at the environment.

800
00:31:27,367 --> 00:31:28,407
It's terrible!

801
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:32,488
You should stop her.

802
00:31:33,327 --> 00:31:37,528
She is your daughter-in-law,
but now she's selling rice and eggs?

803
00:31:38,488 --> 00:31:39,887
So degrading!

804
00:31:40,488 --> 00:31:42,048
It makes people look down on her.

805
00:31:43,728 --> 00:31:45,607
Yes, the handmade beef balls

806
00:31:45,607 --> 00:31:46,807
are super springy!

807
00:31:47,647 --> 00:31:50,008
Perfect for hotpot, barbecue, or frying.

808
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,127
Very versatile, right?

809
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:52,567
Link 2! Link 2!

810
00:31:52,607 --> 00:31:53,928
Backend team, get ready.

811
00:31:54,048 --> 00:31:54,768
Link 2.

812
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,528
Get Link 2 ready.

813
00:31:56,688 --> 00:31:57,167
Got it.

814
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:58,407
Pass me the rice.

815
00:31:59,528 --> 00:32:01,127
Degrading?

816
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:05,367
Who's looking down on her?

817
00:32:10,048 --> 00:32:11,167
She is willing to work hard,

818
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:12,488
starting from the bottom.

819
00:32:12,728 --> 00:32:13,728
Nothing wrong with that.

820
00:32:14,488 --> 00:32:15,208
Ms. Meng.

821
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:19,087
Didn't you sleep in warehouses
when building your factory?

822
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,327
Ms. Ma.

823
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,248
Shouldn't entrepreneurs
endure hardships?

824
00:32:24,688 --> 00:32:25,647
Speaking of environment,

825
00:32:26,688 --> 00:32:28,847
you started with a cement plant.

826
00:32:28,887 --> 00:32:29,647
When we met you,

827
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:31,607
you were always covered in cement

828
00:32:31,607 --> 00:32:32,647
and dust.

829
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:33,928
Remember?

830
00:32:38,807 --> 00:32:40,167
Don't look at me.

831
00:32:40,367 --> 00:32:42,567
My husband and I
used to sell braised meat.

832
00:32:42,847 --> 00:32:44,087
We used demolition compensation

833
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,008
to start a business and got rich.

834
00:32:46,248 --> 00:32:47,167
We're a parvenu.

835
00:32:47,488 --> 00:32:48,647
20 years ago,

836
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:51,288
we were all ordinary people.

837
00:32:52,288 --> 00:32:54,847
Our ancestors were all farmers too.

838
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:57,407
I was just a contractor's wife.

839
00:32:58,087 --> 00:33:01,288
When my husband was understaffed,
I even cooked for his staff.

840
00:33:02,407 --> 00:33:03,167
Sounds degrading?

841
00:33:05,807 --> 00:33:07,528
We just got rich.

842
00:33:07,607 --> 00:33:08,567
You forgot your past?

843
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:11,208
Let's call it a day.

844
00:33:16,087 --> 00:33:17,488
Alright, pass me that rice too.

845
00:33:19,807 --> 00:33:20,327
Yes.

846
00:33:20,407 --> 00:33:21,847
This rice...

847
00:33:28,968 --> 00:33:31,288
It's our latest product.

848
00:33:31,807 --> 00:33:34,928
So, just purchase it if you like.

849
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:38,048
We also have flour.

850
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:39,448
Let me show you.

851
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:40,807

852

859
00:33:57,567 --> 00:33:58,087
Got it.

we're giving out cookware sets.

00:34:20,367 --> 00:34:22,528

Now look at these beef balls.

868
00:34:25,968 --> 00:34:27,567
Someone just asked about chicken feet.

869
00:34:27,687 --> 00:34:28,607
We have chicken feet.

870
00:34:28,607 --> 00:34:29,448
Yes, it's available.

100? That's a lot!

877
00:34:38,167 --> 00:34:40,687
My boss wants to give employee benefits.

878
00:34:40,888 --> 00:34:41,448
Okay.

879
00:34:41,567 --> 00:34:42,328

881
00:34:43,968 --> 00:34:44,368
Correct.

Place the order.

883
00:34:45,247 --> 00:34:46,207

I don't need it.

988
00:39:20,008 --> 00:39:20,848
We were a couple.

989
00:39:22,048 --> 00:39:23,328
This is basic compensation.

990
00:39:24,167 --> 00:39:24,968

991
00:39:35,488 --> 00:39:38,767

993
00:39:40,968 --> 00:39:42,008
and balance.

994
00:39:43,127 --> 00:39:47,448
But what I learned was
to seize every opportunity

995
00:39:47,448 --> 00:39:48,567
and climb upward.

996
00:39:56,408 --> 00:39:58,008

secretly or openly,

I was bound to lose.

999
00:40:04,687 --> 00:40:05,928
I lied in the first place,

1000
00:40:07,687 --> 00:40:09,888
so any outcome I face now

1001
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:11,328
is my own doing.

1002
