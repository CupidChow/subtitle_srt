Well done.

You're so clever.

Let's do it again!

Come on. It's inedible.

00:01:57,912 --> 00:01:58,672
You can't eat it.

41
00:01:58,791 --> 00:01:59,511
Ms. Yu.

42
00:01:59,511 --> 00:02:00,431
Come on.

43
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:01,711
Come here.

44
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:02,591
Ms. Yu.

45
00:02:03,032 --> 00:02:04,192
I bought you a scarf,

46
00:02:04,632 --> 00:02:06,112
the latest fashion.

47
00:02:06,231 --> 00:02:07,591
I hope you'll like it.

48
00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:13,431
Miss Xu.

49
00:02:13,431 --> 00:02:14,112
Next time I...

50
00:02:15,591 --> 00:02:16,911
Miss Xu, what did you buy?

51
00:02:16,952 --> 00:02:17,512
Let me see.

52
00:02:19,232 --> 00:02:20,352
A cashmere scarf?

53
00:02:21,512 --> 00:02:22,311
Miss Xu.

54
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:23,992
You're mistaken.

55
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:26,591
Your future mother-in-law

56
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:28,591
prefers a solid-colored scarf

57
00:02:29,112 --> 00:02:30,751
without printed patterns.

58
00:02:31,992 --> 00:02:33,191
Ms. Ma.

59
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:35,672
If she hasn't paid much attention,

60
00:02:35,711 --> 00:02:37,191
how would she know?

61
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:39,031
Then you should be careful.

62
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:41,272
Or you'll make a fool of yourself again.

63
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:42,311
Miss Xu.

64
00:02:42,992 --> 00:02:44,232
Cashmere scarves

65
00:02:44,272 --> 00:02:46,072
have many details to consider.

66
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:49,112
The higher the thread count,
the softer it is.

67
00:02:49,232 --> 00:02:50,871
She definitely won't

68
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:52,792
wear the scarf you bought.

69
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:53,952
Bu.

70
00:02:54,272 --> 00:02:54,952
Over here.

71
00:02:55,311 --> 00:02:55,952
Sweetheart.

72
00:02:56,471 --> 00:02:57,191
Bu.

73
00:02:57,232 --> 00:02:57,792
Here you are.

74
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:59,151
Thank you.

75
00:03:01,911 --> 00:03:02,871
Amy, come.

76
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:15,112
Miss Xu.

77
00:03:16,952 --> 00:03:18,352
The scarf Miss Xu bought

78
00:03:18,591 --> 00:03:19,392
is Italian,

79
00:03:19,392 --> 00:03:20,751
100% cashmere.

80
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:21,751
It's good stuff.

81
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:23,512
Back then,

82
00:03:23,751 --> 00:03:24,792
when I was at school,

83
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:25,911
I didn't study hard.

84
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:27,311
I always ran off to travel.

85
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:28,431
When short on money,

86
00:03:28,471 --> 00:03:29,471
I traded cashmere scarves

87
00:03:29,552 --> 00:03:30,431
for cash.

88
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:32,352
That's why it's called cashmere.

89
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:34,911
I already

90
00:03:34,911 --> 00:03:36,352
have many scarves of the same color.

91
00:03:36,672 --> 00:03:38,352
It suits your fair complexion.

92
00:03:39,072 --> 00:03:40,112
Keep it for yourself.

93
00:03:44,072 --> 00:03:44,672
I have to go.

94
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:45,552
Look, Bu.

95
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,232
Brilliant!

96
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:50,352
Come here.

97
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:51,911
Bu.

98
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:53,512
Bu.

99
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:56,232
Lan.

100
00:03:57,352 --> 00:03:58,832
I think that girl

101
00:03:59,112 --> 00:04:00,871
has poor taste in every aspect.

102
00:04:01,711 --> 00:04:02,792
Think again.

103
00:04:03,392 --> 00:04:04,711
Don't rush the engagement.

104
00:04:16,152 --> 00:04:16,792
Claire.

105
00:04:18,152 --> 00:04:18,592
Come.

106
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:34,992
All done?

107
00:04:36,672 --> 00:04:37,511
Miss Xu.

108
00:04:37,951 --> 00:04:39,191
You're so kind.

109
00:04:39,352 --> 00:04:40,552
Very easygoing.

110
00:04:40,552 --> 00:04:41,992
You're even shopping with me.

111
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:43,831
Haochen and Haoming

112
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:44,592
both love

113
00:04:44,592 --> 00:04:46,071
your cooking so much.

114
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:47,191
You master

115
00:04:47,431 --> 00:04:48,271
both Chinese

116
00:04:48,552 --> 00:04:49,751
and Western cuisine.

117
00:04:50,511 --> 00:04:50,992
Hui.

118
00:04:51,032 --> 00:04:52,511
You must teach me how to cook.

119
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:54,831
With enough practice,

120
00:04:54,951 --> 00:04:56,271
you gain experience.

121
00:04:56,992 --> 00:04:57,592
Miss Xu.

122
00:04:57,992 --> 00:04:59,071
Grab me a box of lychees.

123
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:00,032
Sure.

124
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:04,431
Is this okay?

125
00:05:05,352 --> 00:05:06,032
Yes, absolutely.

126
00:05:06,032 --> 00:05:06,792
I'll put it in.

127
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:07,431
Thanks.

128
00:05:07,592 --> 00:05:08,071
No problem.

129
00:05:08,152 --> 00:05:08,592
Here.

130
00:05:12,951 --> 00:05:13,472
Hui.

131
00:05:14,552 --> 00:05:16,352
I found another advantage of you.

132
00:05:17,311 --> 00:05:18,311
You take good care

133
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:19,191
of Ms. Yu's family.

134
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:20,792
And you also

135
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,672
care for her friends.

136
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:24,191
You're a perfect domestic worker.

137
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:26,112
Miss Xu.

138
00:05:27,112 --> 00:05:28,191
People like Ms. Meng

139
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,912
aren't as easygoing as you.

140
00:05:30,352 --> 00:05:31,712
They're all calculating.

141
00:05:32,112 --> 00:05:32,831
Ms. Yu

142
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:34,152
spends much time with them.

143
00:05:34,592 --> 00:05:36,032
If they badmouth me,

144
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:37,311
I'll lose my job.

145
00:05:39,552 --> 00:05:40,431
But from what I see,

146
00:05:40,472 --> 00:05:41,992
Ms. Yu is an independent lady.

147
00:05:42,672 --> 00:05:44,152
She actually listens to them?

148
00:05:48,631 --> 00:05:49,352
Miss Xu.

149
00:05:50,631 --> 00:05:52,271
I genuinely think you're a good girl,

150
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:53,311
so I'm telling you this.

151
00:05:55,032 --> 00:05:56,071
In the past,

152
00:05:56,472 --> 00:05:57,792
someone tried to set Haoming up

153
00:05:57,831 --> 00:05:59,032
with a girlfriend.

154
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,071
But that girl

155
00:06:01,592 --> 00:06:02,191
just couldn't

156
00:06:02,191 --> 00:06:03,592
win Ms. Yu's friends over.

157
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:05,152
They all

158
00:06:05,152 --> 00:06:06,352
chimed in

159
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:08,552
and eventually convinced Ms. Yu.

160
00:06:08,831 --> 00:06:09,751
So, Ms. Yu

161
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:11,472
rejected that girl outright.

162
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:14,431
Ms. Yu's friends

163
00:06:15,232 --> 00:06:16,672
hold significant influence, huh?

164
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:17,951
You said it.

165
00:06:18,472 --> 00:06:20,232
Those whom they dislike

166
00:06:20,311 --> 00:06:21,992
won't be accepted by Ms. Yu.

167
00:06:22,352 --> 00:06:23,032
They're critical

168
00:06:23,191 --> 00:06:24,672
of Ms. Yu's daughter-in-law.

169
00:06:30,552 --> 00:06:31,152
Hui.

170
00:06:32,152 --> 00:06:33,032
Wait a moment.

171
00:06:33,871 --> 00:06:34,871
Are two boxes enough?

172
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:39,552
In this season,

173
00:06:39,592 --> 00:06:40,472
cherries are a must.

174
00:06:40,871 --> 00:06:41,871
I remember

175
00:06:41,912 --> 00:06:42,831
you love cherries.

176
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:44,152
I'll buy them for you.

177
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:45,112
Go.

178
00:06:45,112 --> 00:06:46,751
These two boxes cost hundreds!

179
00:06:46,751 --> 00:06:47,472
This is too much.

180
00:06:47,472 --> 00:06:48,672
Take them for your children.

181
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:50,951
Thank you then.

182
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:54,352
I forgot to buy shrimp.

183
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,472
Let's buy it.

184
00:06:55,511 --> 00:06:55,951
Alright.

185
00:07:01,232 --> 00:07:01,871
(I know)

186
00:07:02,992 --> 00:07:03,951
(Yu Lan and her friends)

187
00:07:03,951 --> 00:07:05,311
(haven't truly accepted me.)

188
00:07:07,271 --> 00:07:08,391
(To marry Haoming,)

189
00:07:08,831 --> 00:07:10,592
(I must fully fit into the family)

190
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:11,631
(and the circle.)

191
00:07:13,352 --> 00:07:14,311
(My only option)

192
00:07:15,152 --> 00:07:16,631
(is to take the initiative.)

193
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:30,552
Nice shot!

194
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:31,592
Take a break.

195
00:07:35,912 --> 00:07:37,871
It feels good to sweat.

196
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:39,352
It is hot today,

197
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:40,511
right?

198
00:07:42,592 --> 00:07:43,191
Coach.

199
00:07:43,751 --> 00:07:44,951
Let's take it easy today.

200
00:07:44,951 --> 00:07:45,352
Yes.

201
00:07:45,352 --> 00:07:46,472
Wipe your sweat.

202
00:07:46,472 --> 00:07:46,792
Hurry.

203
00:07:46,951 --> 00:07:47,712
I'm sweaty.

204
00:07:48,352 --> 00:07:49,112
It's so hot.

205
00:07:49,112 --> 00:07:50,592
Ms. Yu is as energetic as ever.

206
00:07:50,831 --> 00:07:51,511
Absolutely!

207
00:07:51,552 --> 00:07:53,472
After all, I do yoga every day.

208
00:08:09,352 --> 00:08:10,191
You invited her?

209
00:08:14,191 --> 00:08:14,712
Yes.

210
00:08:14,831 --> 00:08:15,951
She's free today,

211
00:08:16,032 --> 00:08:17,431
so I asked her here.

212
00:08:17,472 --> 00:08:19,071
It's a chance to get to know her.

213
00:08:19,352 --> 00:08:20,511
Unexpectedly,

214
00:08:20,672 --> 00:08:21,792
she can't play tennis.

215
00:08:22,831 --> 00:08:23,951
Have you met her parents?

216
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:26,112
Yes.

217
00:08:26,592 --> 00:08:27,712
They're intellectuals.

218
00:08:28,672 --> 00:08:29,968
They've lived abroad for years.

219
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:31,071
Her father

220
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:32,688
is a professor at Syracuse University.

221
00:08:36,312 --> 00:08:37,791
No wonder she's so well-mannered.

222
00:08:38,472 --> 00:08:39,352
She is

223
00:08:40,031 --> 00:08:41,031
quite sensible.

224
00:08:42,671 --> 00:08:44,511
To marry into Ms. Yu's family,

225
00:08:44,712 --> 00:08:46,112
she has to be sensible.

226
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:48,551
I think

227
00:08:48,631 --> 00:08:50,192
she is low-key and unassuming.

228
00:08:50,671 --> 00:08:51,952
She is not simple, anyway.

229
00:08:57,592 --> 00:08:58,472
Miss Xu.

230
00:08:58,952 --> 00:08:59,712
No need to do this.

231
00:08:59,712 --> 00:09:00,671
The coach will

232
00:09:00,712 --> 00:09:01,551
collect these balls.

233
00:09:01,712 --> 00:09:03,232
I can do it quickly.

234
00:09:03,551 --> 00:09:04,791
So you won't have to wait long.

235
00:09:05,992 --> 00:09:06,712
Miss Xu.

236
00:09:09,112 --> 00:09:10,232
You really don't have to.

237
00:09:10,511 --> 00:09:11,472
You're doing just fine.

238
00:09:11,992 --> 00:09:12,631
Just relax.

239
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:14,312
Don't be on edge all the time.

240
00:09:14,952 --> 00:09:16,592
Sometimes, being too tense

241
00:09:16,631 --> 00:09:17,911
is not good.

242
00:09:20,631 --> 00:09:21,871
Thanks, Meiling.

243
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:26,432
Ms. Yu.

244
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,671
Ms. Meng, Ms. Ma.

245
00:09:28,871 --> 00:09:30,112
What a coincidence!

246
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:31,671
You're here too.

247
00:09:32,952 --> 00:09:33,671
Ms. Meng.

248
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:34,751
You look much slimmer

249
00:09:34,751 --> 00:09:35,832
than the last time we met.

250
00:09:37,112 --> 00:09:38,192
Not really.

251
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:39,151
Honestly,

252
00:09:39,232 --> 00:09:40,192
you've lost weight.

253
00:09:40,312 --> 00:09:41,312
I've been

254
00:09:41,391 --> 00:09:42,072
to some parties

255
00:09:42,072 --> 00:09:43,271
with my husband.

256
00:09:43,472 --> 00:09:44,511
Some late nights made me

257
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:45,312
gain weight.

258
00:09:45,312 --> 00:09:46,031
Really?

259
00:09:46,151 --> 00:09:47,352
You're not showing at all.

260
00:09:47,432 --> 00:09:48,112
- Exactly!
- You think?

261
00:09:48,112 --> 00:09:49,031
You're not showing.

262
00:09:49,352 --> 00:09:49,751
Please.

263
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:50,832
We all know

264
00:09:50,832 --> 00:09:51,832
you're a social person.

265
00:09:52,072 --> 00:09:53,511
Without you, your husband

266
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:54,832
wouldn't have met Mr. Zheng

267
00:09:54,832 --> 00:09:56,232
and secured the biggest project.

268
00:09:57,832 --> 00:09:58,592
That's just

269
00:09:58,671 --> 00:09:59,551
part of my job.

270
00:09:59,631 --> 00:10:00,551
You're luckier than me.

271
00:10:00,832 --> 00:10:02,432
You have a good husband and a good son.

272
00:10:02,712 --> 00:10:04,232
I'm just born to worry too much.

273
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:06,671
I-I've been the same lately.

274
00:10:06,952 --> 00:10:08,232
You know what?

275
00:10:08,271 --> 00:10:09,791
I've been hitting the gym daily.

276
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,112
My husband

277
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:12,551
tries to do business with the CEO

278
00:10:12,551 --> 00:10:13,232
of Boyue Group.

279
00:10:13,391 --> 00:10:14,871
His wife happens to

280
00:10:14,871 --> 00:10:16,031
be a fashion designer.

281
00:10:16,271 --> 00:10:16,992
To get closer

282
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:17,832
to her, I need

283
00:10:18,072 --> 00:10:19,072
to squeeze

284
00:10:19,072 --> 00:10:20,832
into the outfits she designs.

285
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:24,031
Going all out for your husband?

286
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:25,551
Demand a bigger bonus this year!

287
00:10:26,232 --> 00:10:28,312
Ms. Yu, stop teasing me!

288
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:30,592
I'm telling you,

289
00:10:30,712 --> 00:10:32,031
a socially adept wife

290
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:33,832
is essential to her husband's business.

291
00:10:33,911 --> 00:10:35,151
Some bachelors

292
00:10:35,192 --> 00:10:36,511
focus solely on work.

293
00:10:36,631 --> 00:10:37,472
They're competent,

294
00:10:37,631 --> 00:10:39,352
but without a wife's support,

295
00:10:39,432 --> 00:10:40,791
they're like one-legged men,

296
00:10:40,832 --> 00:10:41,712
unable to get far.

297
00:10:42,312 --> 00:10:43,712
Remember the last gathering?

298
00:10:43,832 --> 00:10:44,592
Ms. Qu is here.

299
00:10:55,472 --> 00:10:56,271
Ms. Qu is here.

300
00:10:56,352 --> 00:10:57,712
Ms. Qu, you're finally here!

301
00:10:57,751 --> 00:10:59,112
- You finally came.
- You made it!

302
00:10:59,151 --> 00:11:00,151
We haven't started yet.

303
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,192
You should've begun.

304
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:01,871
Take a seat.

305
00:11:01,871 --> 00:11:02,472
Ms. Qu.

306
00:11:02,472 --> 00:11:03,952
Your complexion looks much better

307
00:11:03,952 --> 00:11:05,232
than last time.

308
00:11:05,391 --> 00:11:06,352
Truly,

309
00:11:07,271 --> 00:11:08,352
you look so well.

310
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:10,631
By the way, Ms. Qu,

311
00:11:10,832 --> 00:11:11,712
I heard your husband

312
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:12,871
landed major projects.

313
00:11:13,992 --> 00:11:15,312
He never stays idle.

314
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:16,352
I keep telling him

315
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:17,992
health matters more than money.

316
00:11:20,072 --> 00:11:20,671
Ms. Qu,

317
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:22,312
could you have your husband

318
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,992
help my husband?

319
00:11:24,592 --> 00:11:24,952
Let's go

320
00:11:25,031 --> 00:11:25,551
and play.

321
00:11:25,592 --> 00:11:26,472
Come on.

322
00:11:26,712 --> 00:11:27,192
Let's go.

323
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:33,712
Coach, I need a break.

324
00:11:33,712 --> 00:11:34,352
- Let me help.
- I'm tired.

325
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:36,352
Thanks, Miss Xu.

326
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:36,992
No problem.

327
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:40,592
Have some water.

328
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:42,712
Thanks.

329
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,671
Who is that?

330
00:11:46,232 --> 00:11:48,072
That is the director of Lanshan Capital,

331
00:11:48,271 --> 00:11:49,671
and also Mr. Xiao's wife.

332
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:51,592
Lanshan Capital

333
00:11:51,671 --> 00:11:52,671
is hot these days.

334
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:55,151
Women want to use her connections

335
00:11:55,192 --> 00:11:56,511
to benefit their own husbands.

336
00:11:58,391 --> 00:11:59,112
Impressive.

337
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,631
Women try to please her.

338
00:12:02,751 --> 00:12:03,911
She is very proud.

339
00:12:05,151 --> 00:12:06,192
I once asked my friend

340
00:12:06,232 --> 00:12:07,432
to arrange a meeting with her.

341
00:12:08,072 --> 00:12:09,352
But she put on airs

342
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:10,352
and refused.

343
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:56,791
Go.

344
00:12:56,992 --> 00:13:01,511
Two, two, three, four.

345
00:13:02,112 --> 00:13:02,871
One.

346
00:13:03,312 --> 00:13:04,112
Two.

347
00:13:04,592 --> 00:13:05,671
Three.

348
00:13:16,271 --> 00:13:16,832
Not bad.

349
00:13:16,832 --> 00:13:18,031
You're dancing very well.

350
00:13:18,671 --> 00:13:19,592
Let's try

351
00:13:19,592 --> 00:13:20,432
one more move.

352
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:21,031
Okay.

353
00:13:21,432 --> 00:13:22,391
Watch me.

354
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:25,271
See?

355
00:13:25,391 --> 00:13:26,271
Two wrist rotations.

356
00:13:26,551 --> 00:13:27,432
One up

357
00:13:27,551 --> 00:13:28,352
and one down.

358
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,871
Combine two into one move.

359
00:13:30,072 --> 00:13:30,751
So one up,

360
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:31,391
and one down.

361
00:13:31,432 --> 00:13:32,352
Sure. Try it.

362
00:13:32,911 --> 00:13:34,871
One up, one down.

363
00:13:35,312 --> 00:13:35,871
Well?

364
00:13:36,072 --> 00:13:36,511
Like this?

365
00:13:36,511 --> 00:13:37,271
Too hard.

366
00:13:37,271 --> 00:13:38,192
Watch me again.

367
00:13:39,031 --> 00:13:39,511
Like this.

368
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:42,192
My friend told me

369
00:13:42,631 --> 00:13:43,551
that Ms. Qu

370
00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:44,911
doesn't have many hobbies,

371
00:13:45,271 --> 00:13:47,432
except being crazy about Kunqu Opera.

372
00:13:47,871 --> 00:13:48,952
She even funded

373
00:13:48,952 --> 00:13:50,072
a Kunqu Opera competition

374
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:51,151
for amateurs.

375
00:13:55,352 --> 00:13:57,232
Up, down.

376
00:13:57,232 --> 00:13:57,871
Not like that.

377
00:13:58,511 --> 00:13:59,352
Take your time.

378
00:14:03,312 --> 00:14:03,952
Let me show you.

379
00:14:03,952 --> 00:14:04,871
This is so hard.

380
00:14:04,952 --> 00:14:05,832
It is challenging.

381
00:14:06,031 --> 00:14:06,712
Here, watch.

382
00:14:07,192 --> 00:14:08,952
One, two.

383
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,472
One, two, yes.

384
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:11,391
Today

385
00:14:11,391 --> 00:14:12,631
is our first lesson.

386
00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:13,271
So,

387
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:14,671
we'll start

388
00:14:14,671 --> 00:14:15,592
with the basics.

389
00:14:15,712 --> 00:14:16,992
- The opera...
- Ma'am!

390
00:14:17,352 --> 00:14:18,031
Excuse me,

391
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:20,952
can you just teach me how to

392
00:14:21,391 --> 00:14:22,031
swing sleeves?

393
00:14:22,631 --> 00:14:23,551
Swing sleeves.

394
00:14:24,751 --> 00:14:26,192
Haste makes waste.

395
00:14:26,312 --> 00:14:27,511
You're a beginner.

396
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:28,911
I suggest we start

397
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:29,791
with the basics.

398
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,952
I have a question.

399
00:14:32,992 --> 00:14:34,751
If I practice day and night,

400
00:14:35,151 --> 00:14:36,472
how long until I master it?

401
00:14:36,832 --> 00:14:37,952
At least a month.

402
00:14:38,031 --> 00:14:38,671
So we should

403
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:40,031
start with the basics.

404
00:14:40,151 --> 00:14:40,992
You have to

405
00:14:40,992 --> 00:14:41,832
be patient.

406
00:14:42,432 --> 00:14:42,911
No.

407
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:46,192
I only learn water sleeves.

408
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:50,031
Doing water sleeves, remember

409
00:14:50,072 --> 00:14:50,832
not to use

410
00:14:51,031 --> 00:14:52,352
your upper arm.

411
00:14:52,352 --> 00:14:54,791
Use wrist and forearm.

412
00:14:55,112 --> 00:14:56,391
Switching sides,

413
00:14:56,671 --> 00:14:57,151
it's

414
00:14:57,312 --> 00:14:58,952
one up, one down.

415
00:14:58,992 --> 00:15:00,352
Up, down.

416
00:15:00,712 --> 00:15:01,072
Correct.

417
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:02,712
Keep them flat.

418
00:15:03,551 --> 00:15:04,992
Your upper arms shouldn't

419
00:15:05,192 --> 00:15:06,592
exert too much force.

420
00:15:07,112 --> 00:15:08,592
Same with both hands.

421
00:15:09,072 --> 00:15:10,992
See? The upper arms barely move.

422
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:13,232
Let your forearms and wrists lead.

423
00:15:13,952 --> 00:15:15,112
Then turn.

424
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:18,432
Up, down. Up, down.

425
00:15:19,271 --> 00:15:20,031
Give it a try.

426
00:15:22,432 --> 00:15:24,072
Use your forearm and wrist.

427
00:15:24,112 --> 00:15:24,631
Like this.

428
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,592

Tenosynovitis.

447
00:16:12,952 --> 00:16:14,192
Typing too much causes this.

448
00:16:14,352 --> 00:16:14,952

Go back and rest.

00:16:36,472 --> 00:16:37,631
That's all for today's class.

461
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:39,232
Ma'am.

462
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:40,352
Can I stay here

463
00:16:40,352 --> 00:16:40,992
and practice?

464
00:16:41,151 --> 00:16:41,671
Sure.

465
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:42,871
No one's using it later.

466
00:16:42,911 --> 00:16:43,631
Keep practicing.

467
00:16:43,832 --> 00:16:44,271

(Grandma)
It's different.

473
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,952
Kunqu Opera emphasizes posture

474
00:16:58,791 --> 00:16:59,791
and techniques.

475
00:16:59,871 --> 00:17:01,192
Practice is essential.

476
00:17:03,072 --> 00:17:03,551
By the way,

477
00:17:03,992 --> 00:17:05,751
the hospital's follow-up report

478
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,071
came back.

479
00:17:07,232 --> 00:17:09,071
Your cholesterol levels are still high.

480
00:17:09,192 --> 00:17:10,551
So I got you fish oil capsules.

481
00:17:10,632 --> 00:17:11,392
Three times daily,

482
00:17:11,511 --> 00:17:13,192
take them half an hour before meals.

483
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:13,831
Remember

484
00:17:13,872 --> 00:17:14,672
to take them daily.

485
00:17:16,271 --> 00:17:16,751
Okay.

486
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:18,432
Send them by courier.

487
00:17:19,952 --> 00:17:20,551
I will

488
00:17:20,551 --> 00:17:21,672
send them all.

489
00:17:21,744 --> 00:17:22,832
Remember to collect them.

490
00:17:23,712 --> 00:17:24,192
Okay.

491
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:26,551
How's your Kunqu Opera practice

492
00:17:26,551 --> 00:17:27,632
coming along?

493
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:29,271
Did the teacher comment

494
00:17:29,392 --> 00:17:30,712
on your progress?

495
00:17:31,632 --> 00:17:32,912
The teacher praised me,

496
00:17:32,912 --> 00:17:34,111
saying I'm learning fast.

497
00:17:35,111 --> 00:17:36,551
I should thank you.

498
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:38,111
You always told me as a kid,

499
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,311
"Learn various skills.

500
00:17:40,472 --> 00:17:42,111
Having more never burdens you."

501
00:17:42,392 --> 00:17:43,632
So the teacher praised me.

502
00:17:43,992 --> 00:17:44,992
Right?

503
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:47,591
Listen to me more. It pays off.

504
00:17:47,672 --> 00:17:49,232
Okay, I will.

505
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:53,271
Well, one more thing,

506
00:17:53,392 --> 00:17:55,472
do you have time to come visit me?

507
00:17:57,712 --> 00:17:58,712
After I

508
00:18:00,392 --> 00:18:01,511
finish this busy period.

509
00:18:01,952 --> 00:18:02,632
Then I'll return

510
00:18:02,632 --> 00:18:03,712
to keep you company.

511
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:05,551
I even bought you a set

512
00:18:05,591 --> 00:18:06,872
of Kunqu Opera costumes.

513
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:08,311
I'll teach you then.

514
00:18:08,472 --> 00:18:09,311
We'll both practice.

515
00:18:11,192 --> 00:18:12,912
Okay, you go ahead.

516
00:18:13,111 --> 00:18:14,311
I'm going to sleep.

517
00:18:15,031 --> 00:18:16,232
Okay, go and rest.

518
00:18:16,271 --> 00:18:17,432
It's already late.

519
00:18:17,992 --> 00:18:19,271
Sleep soon. Goodnight.

520
00:19:01,831 --> 00:19:03,071
Focus on your waist movement.

521
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:05,111
Side waist.

522
00:19:05,271 --> 00:19:06,472
Watch the hands.

523
00:19:06,551 --> 00:19:07,311
Final pose.

524
00:19:07,472 --> 00:19:08,591
Finish with the waist.

525
00:19:09,031 --> 00:19:09,591
Yes.

526
00:19:09,872 --> 00:19:10,472
Right.

527
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:12,152
Good.

528
00:19:12,311 --> 00:19:12,712
Excellent.

529
00:19:12,872 --> 00:19:14,192
That's all for today's lesson.

530
00:19:14,392 --> 00:19:15,632
Go rest early.

531
00:19:16,152 --> 00:19:16,591
Ma'am.

532
00:19:16,672 --> 00:19:17,192
I know.

533
00:19:17,432 --> 00:19:18,031
Extra time?

534
00:19:18,232 --> 00:19:18,712
Okay.

535
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:19,192
Bye.

536
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:19,712
Thanks.

537
00:19:26,472 --> 00:19:27,111
Miss.

538
00:19:28,031 --> 00:19:29,432
Is that girl new here?

539
00:19:29,432 --> 00:19:30,472
I haven't seen her before.

540
00:19:30,551 --> 00:19:31,472
Right, she's new here.

541
00:19:31,751 --> 00:19:32,551
She's smart.

542
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:33,751
She achieved this in days.

543
00:19:39,351 --> 00:19:40,071
Hello.

544
00:19:41,632 --> 00:19:42,111
Hello.

545
00:19:42,152 --> 00:19:43,952
I noticed your water sleeve techniques

546
00:19:44,472 --> 00:19:45,591
are excellent.

547
00:19:45,712 --> 00:19:46,392
Thank you.

548
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:47,672
The teacher mentioned

549
00:19:47,672 --> 00:19:48,952
you just started learning?

550
00:19:49,712 --> 00:19:51,311
I've loved it since childhood.

551
00:19:51,912 --> 00:19:53,672
Back then, I just found it beautiful.

552
00:19:54,632 --> 00:19:55,712
Now that I'm older,

553
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,751
I finally grasp its deeper essence.

554
00:19:58,232 --> 00:19:59,311
So I'm studying it now.

555
00:20:00,071 --> 00:20:00,992
That's rare.

556
00:20:01,472 --> 00:20:03,351
To be so young
and already love Kunqu Opera.

557
00:20:03,632 --> 00:20:05,351
Likewise, I've loved it since childhood.

558
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:06,551
We're organizing

559
00:20:06,551 --> 00:20:08,392
a Kunqu Opera enthusiasts competition.

560
00:20:08,912 --> 00:20:10,071
I'm the organizer.

561
00:20:10,311 --> 00:20:11,152
I was thinking,

562
00:20:11,351 --> 00:20:12,511
as the organizer,

563
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:13,872
if I couldn't perform,

564
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:14,912
people might laugh at me.

565
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:16,591
So I came here to learn intensively.

566
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:17,831
By the way,

567
00:20:18,232 --> 00:20:19,152
I'm Qu Li.

568
00:20:20,551 --> 00:20:21,432
Hello, Ms. Li.

569
00:20:22,432 --> 00:20:23,152
I'm Xu Yan.

570
00:20:23,591 --> 00:20:24,791
You're talented.

571
00:20:24,992 --> 00:20:26,152
You should join

572
00:20:26,152 --> 00:20:26,872
our competition.

573
00:20:27,111 --> 00:20:27,751
No problem.

574
00:20:28,632 --> 00:20:29,672
Wonderful!

575
00:20:30,472 --> 00:20:31,632
The class has ended.

576
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:32,872
Let's practice together.

577
00:20:32,912 --> 00:20:34,192
Help me get the rhythm right.

578
00:20:34,672 --> 00:20:35,271
Perfect.

579
00:20:35,311 --> 00:20:36,551
I was just needing a break.

580
00:20:36,952 --> 00:20:37,791
Let me observe you.

581
00:20:37,992 --> 00:20:39,672
My water sleeves

582
00:20:40,311 --> 00:20:41,591
never flow properly.

583
00:20:41,632 --> 00:20:43,232
Can you find out what's wrong?

584
00:20:43,271 --> 00:20:43,992
Look. See?

585
00:20:44,031 --> 00:20:45,351
I can't move them like you do.

586
00:20:45,831 --> 00:20:46,751
Try keeping

587
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:48,632
some space between your body

588
00:20:48,632 --> 00:20:49,632
and your sleeves.

589
00:20:49,712 --> 00:20:51,071
Toss them outward slightly.

590
00:20:51,271 --> 00:20:52,271
- A gentle toss.
- Like this?

591
00:20:52,271 --> 00:20:52,712
Right.

592
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:54,432
Release and retrieve smoothly.

593
00:20:54,551 --> 00:20:55,031
Right.

594
00:20:55,432 --> 00:20:55,872
Right.

595
00:20:55,952 --> 00:20:57,904
Maintain distance between
your hands and torso.

596
00:20:58,232 --> 00:20:58,712
Right.

597
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,351
Like this,

598
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:00,511
they'll flow naturally.

599
00:21:01,472 --> 00:21:02,111
That's right.

600
00:21:03,712 --> 00:21:04,311
Got it.

601
00:21:04,392 --> 00:21:05,952
You pinpoint key details well.

602
00:21:06,831 --> 00:21:07,591
That's it.

603
00:21:29,632 --> 00:21:30,712
I need to take this call.

604
00:21:30,751 --> 00:21:31,111
Okay.

605
00:21:35,591 --> 00:21:36,311
Zhao?

606
00:21:38,232 --> 00:21:38,831
Yes.

607
00:21:38,992 --> 00:21:39,791
That

608
00:21:41,071 --> 00:21:42,192
Rhine International School.

609
00:21:42,192 --> 00:21:42,551
Yes.

610
00:21:45,392 --> 00:21:46,551
It's for Hao.

611
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:50,311
They have

612
00:21:50,311 --> 00:21:51,992
absolutely no vacancies?

613
00:21:54,712 --> 00:21:55,472
Alright.

614
00:22:01,591 --> 00:22:03,111
You must have prior training.

615
00:22:03,152 --> 00:22:04,432
Judging by your posture,

616
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:05,912
you've surely studied dance.

617
00:22:06,432 --> 00:22:07,551
No, I haven't.

618
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:09,192
Actually, I'm a TV host.

619
00:22:09,591 --> 00:22:11,031
A host?

620
00:22:11,152 --> 00:22:12,071
What show?

621
00:22:12,591 --> 00:22:13,111
Family Feast.

622
00:22:13,351 --> 00:22:14,031
Seen it?

623
00:22:15,591 --> 00:22:16,472
Wait, I think

624
00:22:16,472 --> 00:22:17,432
I've watched your show.

625
00:22:17,472 --> 00:22:18,791
It features celebrities

626
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:19,712
cooking together?

627
00:22:19,912 --> 00:22:20,472
Right.

628
00:22:21,031 --> 00:22:21,751
But we're

629
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,192
revamping the format.

630
00:22:23,511 --> 00:22:24,872
We're planning to invite

631
00:22:24,952 --> 00:22:26,591
influential women from various fields

632
00:22:26,952 --> 00:22:27,511
to join us.

633
00:22:30,271 --> 00:22:30,872
I'm sorry.

634
00:22:31,311 --> 00:22:32,271
But I'm needed

635
00:22:32,472 --> 00:22:33,111
somewhere else.

636
00:22:46,912 --> 00:22:47,751
Qu Li?

637
00:22:48,271 --> 00:22:49,311
She'll really come?

638
00:22:50,872 --> 00:22:51,791
Of course.

639
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:54,432
That's why I'm inviting you

640
00:22:54,632 --> 00:22:56,192
to join Family Feast.

641
00:22:57,152 --> 00:22:58,111
Miss Xu,

642
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:00,791
if Ms. Qu is coming,
I'll definitely be there.

643
00:23:02,311 --> 00:23:03,111
Meiling,

644
00:23:03,351 --> 00:23:05,511
I've prepared a provisional guest list.

645
00:23:05,831 --> 00:23:07,351
Please see if there's anyone you know.

646
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:08,992
For the show recording,

647
00:23:09,192 --> 00:23:10,551
having familiar faces around

648
00:23:10,992 --> 00:23:11,952
would be better.

649
00:23:12,472 --> 00:23:13,311
Miss Xu,

650
00:23:13,952 --> 00:23:15,351
good thing you came to ask me.

651
00:23:15,672 --> 00:23:16,351
You should know

652
00:23:16,551 --> 00:23:17,912
there's a lot of tension

653
00:23:18,111 --> 00:23:19,111
among these women.

654
00:23:20,992 --> 00:23:22,232
Let me explain in detail.

655
00:23:46,712 --> 00:23:47,872
You want to replace guests?

656
00:23:47,912 --> 00:23:48,351
Yes.

657
00:23:49,192 --> 00:23:50,472
Here's the revised proposal.

658
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,232
Xiao Nanpeng's wife?

659
00:24:00,511 --> 00:24:01,392
Lanshan Capital's

660
00:24:01,591 --> 00:24:03,071
global executive partner.

661
00:24:04,472 --> 00:24:05,551
She's agreed

662
00:24:05,551 --> 00:24:06,751
to join our next episode.

663
00:24:08,511 --> 00:24:09,672
What about other guests?

664
00:24:10,232 --> 00:24:11,511
We've already secured Ms. Qu.

665
00:24:12,071 --> 00:24:12,831
I believe

666
00:24:12,992 --> 00:24:14,632
female representatives from other fields

667
00:24:15,271 --> 00:24:16,392
shouldn't be an issue.

668
00:24:20,632 --> 00:24:21,432
Mr. Zhou,

669
00:24:21,632 --> 00:24:22,311
our show has been

670
00:24:22,351 --> 00:24:23,311
running for three years.

671
00:24:24,472 --> 00:24:25,111
Nowadays,

672
00:24:25,152 --> 00:24:26,511
celebrities are losing interest

673
00:24:26,511 --> 00:24:27,591
in our format.

674
00:24:28,511 --> 00:24:30,791
We need to reignite audience engagement.

675
00:24:31,872 --> 00:24:34,271
Besides keeping celebrity guests,

676
00:24:34,712 --> 00:24:36,351
we should invite

677
00:24:36,632 --> 00:24:38,632
influential figures from various fields

678
00:24:38,632 --> 00:24:39,311
to participate.

679
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:41,351
This could create fresh dynamics.

680
00:24:42,192 --> 00:24:43,712
If the show delivers,

681
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:45,311
viewers will naturally want

682
00:24:46,511 --> 00:24:48,111
to join future episodes.

683
00:24:48,511 --> 00:24:49,872
This is an excellent idea.

684
00:24:50,472 --> 00:24:51,192
I support you.

685
00:24:52,912 --> 00:24:54,152
But I have one condition.

686
00:24:56,472 --> 00:24:57,992
Resubmit my request

687
00:24:59,551 --> 00:25:00,232
to transition

688
00:25:00,511 --> 00:25:01,472
to hosting.

689
00:25:05,912 --> 00:25:06,831
I'll make it happen.

690
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:08,672
Just go for it.

691
00:25:11,632 --> 00:25:12,432
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

692
00:25:25,351 --> 00:25:25,992
Ms. Li,

693
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:27,472
I understand

694
00:25:27,872 --> 00:25:28,912
you have zero interest

695
00:25:28,952 --> 00:25:30,111
in joining our show.

696
00:25:30,591 --> 00:25:31,791
Then why approach me?

697
00:25:32,271 --> 00:25:33,311
What if it's a show

698
00:25:33,831 --> 00:25:35,712
tailor-made for you?

699
00:25:39,376 --> 00:25:40,111
(Special Guest: An Yaqin)

700
00:25:40,111 --> 00:25:41,992
A board member
of Rhine International School

701
00:25:43,511 --> 00:25:44,232
will be attending.

702
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:46,152
You investigated me?

703
00:25:47,751 --> 00:25:48,831
Just trying to assist.

704
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:51,632
I could meet them

705
00:25:51,712 --> 00:25:52,952
without your help.

706
00:25:54,751 --> 00:25:55,872
With your capabilities,

707
00:25:56,672 --> 00:25:58,111
connecting with them is possible,

708
00:25:58,511 --> 00:26:00,351
but building relationships quickly

709
00:26:01,111 --> 00:26:02,192
isn't that easy.

710
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:04,311
Through a TV show,

711
00:26:04,591 --> 00:26:05,551
you could naturally

712
00:26:05,551 --> 00:26:06,591
develop friendships.

713
00:26:07,351 --> 00:26:08,472
It's mutually beneficial.

714
00:26:10,192 --> 00:26:10,712
Right?

715
00:26:12,831 --> 00:26:13,712
Unfortunately,

716
00:26:14,271 --> 00:26:15,232
I don't cook.

717
00:26:16,031 --> 00:26:16,952
How about being

718
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,071
the Kunqu Opera

719
00:26:18,111 --> 00:26:19,232
competition's initiator?

720
00:26:22,511 --> 00:26:23,672
Join our show,

721
00:26:24,192 --> 00:26:26,232
and I'll create a special segment

722
00:26:26,311 --> 00:26:27,872
showcasing Kunqu Opera for you.

723
00:26:28,472 --> 00:26:29,912
Joining our show

724
00:26:30,271 --> 00:26:30,912
would both

725
00:26:30,912 --> 00:26:32,311
help promote Kunqu Opera

726
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,071
and allow you to connect

727
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:35,511
with like-minded individuals.

728
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:37,632
Most importantly,

729
00:26:38,192 --> 00:26:39,551
the broadcast could spread

730
00:26:39,712 --> 00:26:41,351
Kunqu Opera's beauty

731
00:26:41,551 --> 00:26:43,031
to wider audiences.

732
00:26:43,591 --> 00:26:44,232
You've devoted

733
00:26:44,232 --> 00:26:45,632
your life to this art form.

734
00:26:46,511 --> 00:26:47,712
Isn't this what you want?

735
00:26:50,632 --> 00:26:51,432
Additionally,

736
00:26:52,672 --> 00:26:54,232
I'm willing to host

737
00:26:55,351 --> 00:26:56,392
your opera fan competition

738
00:26:56,392 --> 00:26:57,472
free of charge.

739
00:26:58,071 --> 00:26:59,232
Though I wonder

740
00:27:00,111 --> 00:27:01,511
if I'm worthy of this honor.

741
00:27:25,432 --> 00:27:26,912
Thank you so much, Ms. Li,

742
00:27:26,992 --> 00:27:29,031
for using a traditional Chinese opera,

743
00:27:29,031 --> 00:27:29,616
Kunqu Opera,

744
00:27:29,712 --> 00:27:30,791
to give us

745
00:27:30,791 --> 00:27:31,872
such a magnificent opening.

746
00:27:35,232 --> 00:27:36,472
First, let me introduce

747
00:27:36,472 --> 00:27:38,152
today's distinguished new guests.

748
00:27:38,831 --> 00:27:39,952
The renowned actress,

749
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,152
Ms. Xue Yuqing.

750
00:27:41,472 --> 00:27:41,992
Hello.

751
00:27:41,992 --> 00:27:43,632
I'm Xue Yuqing, an actress.

752
00:27:43,791 --> 00:27:44,872
Welcome to our show.

753
00:27:45,271 --> 00:27:46,791
National Class-A Public Nutritionist,

754
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:47,952
Ms. He Jingshu.

755
00:27:48,071 --> 00:27:48,912
Hello.

756
00:27:49,031 --> 00:27:50,872
Board member
of Rhine International School,

757
00:27:51,031 --> 00:27:52,311
Ms. An Yaqin.

758
00:27:54,712 --> 00:27:57,111
And young female entrepreneur
representative,

759
00:27:57,511 --> 00:27:58,591
Ms. Sun Meiling.

760
00:27:58,672 --> 00:27:59,791
Welcome, all of you.

761
00:28:00,071 --> 00:28:00,551
By the way,

762
00:28:01,271 --> 00:28:02,192
Ms. Yuqing,

763
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:04,432
I heard your new drama

764
00:28:04,632 --> 00:28:05,751
is currently trending.

765
00:28:06,111 --> 00:28:07,351
In the series, you play

766
00:28:07,351 --> 00:28:09,071
a strong-willed

767
00:28:09,111 --> 00:28:10,111
female imperial chef.

768
00:28:11,071 --> 00:28:12,551
What dishes

769
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,432
left a deep impression

770
00:28:15,432 --> 00:28:16,071
on you?

771
00:28:17,992 --> 00:28:19,152
Qianlong-style cabbage,

772
00:28:19,311 --> 00:28:20,872
cherry-braised pork,

773
00:28:21,031 --> 00:28:22,672
and braised deer tendon.

774
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:23,672
When you participate

775
00:28:23,712 --> 00:28:25,392
in the cooking process,

776
00:28:25,551 --> 00:28:26,351
you realize

777
00:28:26,511 --> 00:28:27,511
the craftsmanship,

778
00:28:27,591 --> 00:28:28,551
the precision,

779
00:28:28,672 --> 00:28:30,152
and every detail involved

780
00:28:30,192 --> 00:28:31,071
culminate in

781
00:28:31,392 --> 00:28:32,472
truly achieving

782
00:28:32,591 --> 00:28:34,791
acme in color, aroma, taste,
concept, and presentation.

783
00:28:35,472 --> 00:28:36,672
Well articulated.

784
00:28:37,351 --> 00:28:37,872
Ms. Li,

785
00:28:38,311 --> 00:28:39,912
your husband is known
in business circles

786
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:42,432
as the 'Iron Man of Commerce'.

787
00:28:42,632 --> 00:28:44,591
He often works around the clock.

788
00:28:45,271 --> 00:28:46,872
Caring for such a dedicated partner

789
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:48,511
must be demanding.

790
00:28:48,831 --> 00:28:49,751
Could you share

791
00:28:49,992 --> 00:28:51,672
your signature homemade dish

792
00:28:51,672 --> 00:28:52,271
with us?

793
00:28:52,751 --> 00:28:54,992
Xiao's work keeps him extremely busy.

794
00:28:55,791 --> 00:28:56,751
In terms of diet,

795
00:28:56,791 --> 00:28:59,031
we prioritize quick and simple meals.

796
00:28:59,311 --> 00:29:00,672
What we regularly prepare

797
00:29:01,511 --> 00:29:02,791
are staple foods,

798
00:29:02,952 --> 00:29:05,472
paired with light congee
and side dishes.

799
00:29:05,551 --> 00:29:06,672
The Qianlong-style cabbage

800
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:08,111
you mentioned earlier

801
00:29:08,192 --> 00:29:09,912
is also Xiao's favorite.

802
00:29:11,111 --> 00:29:12,472
It's Qianlong-style cabbage too.

803
00:29:12,992 --> 00:29:14,791
Why don't we have

804
00:29:14,912 --> 00:29:16,351
a live cooking challenge?

805
00:29:16,472 --> 00:29:19,152
Let's have Ms. Li and Ms. Yuqing

806
00:29:19,351 --> 00:29:20,511
both prepare that dish

807
00:29:20,632 --> 00:29:21,952
and see whose is more authentic.

808
00:29:24,992 --> 00:29:25,751
Meiling,

809
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:28,071
I heard your culinary skills

810
00:29:28,071 --> 00:29:29,031
are exceptional too.

811
00:29:29,872 --> 00:29:31,031
My husband particularly loves

812
00:29:31,031 --> 00:29:31,712
my cooking.

813
00:29:31,751 --> 00:29:32,351
So

814
00:29:32,351 --> 00:29:33,831
I cook for him daily.

815
00:29:34,952 --> 00:29:36,712
Then let me divide the teams.

816
00:29:37,632 --> 00:29:38,311
Meiling,

817
00:29:38,632 --> 00:29:40,551
you'll join Ms. Li

818
00:29:40,591 --> 00:29:41,551
and Ms. Yaqin.

819
00:29:42,152 --> 00:29:43,712
I'll team up with Ms. Jingshu

820
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:44,632
and Ms. Yuqing.

821
00:29:44,672 --> 00:29:45,192
Okay?

822
00:29:45,232 --> 00:29:46,031
Wonderful.

823
00:29:47,031 --> 00:29:48,071
Let's move to

824
00:29:48,071 --> 00:29:49,192
our kitchen.

825
00:29:49,232 --> 00:29:50,152
(Family Feast)
Many of my friends' kids

826
00:29:50,152 --> 00:29:50,952
attend Rhein School.

827
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,672
They all praise its excellent ethos.

828
00:29:52,952 --> 00:29:54,152
This is the most meticulously

829
00:29:54,351 --> 00:29:56,031
prepared cabbage I've ever seen.

830
00:29:56,192 --> 00:29:57,551
I learned this during filming.

831
00:29:57,831 --> 00:29:59,071
Need any assistance?

832
00:29:59,111 --> 00:30:00,031
Not just yet.

833
00:30:00,152 --> 00:30:01,712
You can observe first.

834
00:30:01,751 --> 00:30:02,751
Should I add honey first?

835
00:30:02,872 --> 00:30:03,551
Absolutely.

836
00:30:03,591 --> 00:30:04,912
Honey is essential.

837
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:06,472
That explains it.

838
00:30:06,632 --> 00:30:08,071
I hadn't added honey before,

839
00:30:08,071 --> 00:30:08,831
so it tastes odd.

840
00:30:09,192 --> 00:30:10,672
Check their progress.

841
00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:12,031
When making this dish,

842
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:12,992
the taste's not right.

843
00:30:14,192 --> 00:30:14,872
What's going on?

844
00:30:14,992 --> 00:30:15,591
Someone

845
00:30:15,591 --> 00:30:17,311
is trying to steal our secret.

846
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:18,432
Ms. Yuqing,

847
00:30:18,912 --> 00:30:19,511
Ms. Jingshu,

848
00:30:19,591 --> 00:30:20,912
they secretly added honey.

849
00:30:21,591 --> 00:30:22,232
It's fine.

850
00:30:22,351 --> 00:30:23,472
We have our own secret too.

851
00:30:23,751 --> 00:30:24,912
Don't copy us now.

852
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:26,432
This is Ms. Li's secret recipe.

853
00:30:26,432 --> 00:30:27,472
Looks nice on camera.

854
00:30:39,432 --> 00:30:40,192
Meiling.

855
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:42,311
Your husband's building

856
00:30:42,472 --> 00:30:43,791
a hot spring resort in Wenzhou.

857
00:30:44,071 --> 00:30:46,271
He's been wanting
to discuss investments with Xiao.

858
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,432
Now you helped him

859
00:30:47,432 --> 00:30:48,591
connect with Qu Li.

860
00:30:48,872 --> 00:30:49,912
It's a major contribution.

861
00:30:50,311 --> 00:30:51,351
Looks like

862
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:53,632
the year-end bonus came early this year.

863
00:30:55,432 --> 00:30:56,472
You mean this?

864
00:30:57,551 --> 00:30:58,432
Just a small reward.

865
00:30:58,872 --> 00:30:59,672
The year-end bonus

866
00:30:59,831 --> 00:31:00,912
has to be something bigger.

867
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,791
Stop watching.

868
00:31:04,872 --> 00:31:05,912
Let's chat for a bit.

869
00:31:06,351 --> 00:31:07,432
You see how I am,

870
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:08,952
not photogenic and a bit chubby.

871
00:31:09,031 --> 00:31:09,872
Not bad.

872
00:31:10,232 --> 00:31:10,952
Looks good.

873
00:31:11,192 --> 00:31:12,632
If you say so, then it must be.

874
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:14,591
Miss Xu,

875
00:31:15,311 --> 00:31:17,712
your show is quite interesting.

876
00:31:18,511 --> 00:31:19,712
Thank you, Ms. Ma.

877
00:31:21,192 --> 00:31:23,111
For the next Family Feast episode,

878
00:31:23,192 --> 00:31:24,672
Ms. Qu will still attend.

879
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,632
Ms. Ma, Ms. Meng, I wonder

880
00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:28,831
if you will have time.

881
00:31:29,192 --> 00:31:30,192
Ms. Yu said

882
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,071
she reserved spots for both of you.

883
00:31:34,152 --> 00:31:35,591
Ms. Yu,

884
00:31:36,031 --> 00:31:38,111
why are you so kind to us?

885
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:39,872
Thanks.

886
00:31:40,271 --> 00:31:41,031
Of course.

887
00:31:41,031 --> 00:31:42,311
When good things happen,

888
00:31:42,511 --> 00:31:43,872
I think of my besties first.

889
00:31:44,271 --> 00:31:45,111
So when's

890
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:45,992
the next episode?

891
00:31:46,511 --> 00:31:47,311
Monday.

892
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:48,712
Monday?

893
00:31:49,392 --> 00:31:50,591
That's just a few days away.

894
00:31:51,992 --> 00:31:52,791
I'll go back first

895
00:31:52,992 --> 00:31:53,551
to do my hair.

896
00:31:55,071 --> 00:31:57,591
I also need to go get a facial
and a manicure.

897
00:31:57,591 --> 00:31:58,831
I get it.

898
00:31:59,152 --> 00:32:00,031
Alright, Ms. Yu.

899
00:32:00,031 --> 00:32:00,791
Thank you.

900
00:32:00,912 --> 00:32:01,551
I'm leaving.

901
00:32:01,672 --> 00:32:01,992
Bye.

902
00:32:01,992 --> 00:32:02,712
See you Monday.

903
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:03,111
Bye.

904
00:32:03,111 --> 00:32:03,872
- See you Monday.
- Bye.

905
00:32:03,952 --> 00:32:04,791
Thanks. See you.

906
00:32:06,351 --> 00:32:07,232
Miss Xu.

907
00:32:10,071 --> 00:32:11,511
So can I be

908
00:32:11,672 --> 00:32:12,472
on the next episode?

909
00:32:14,271 --> 00:32:15,591
Of course.

910
00:32:15,952 --> 00:32:16,952
Ms. Yu said

911
00:32:17,031 --> 00:32:18,551
you looked especially dazzling on TV.

912
00:32:19,952 --> 00:32:20,831
Then I should go back

913
00:32:20,831 --> 00:32:22,472
and make myself presentable.

914
00:32:22,591 --> 00:32:23,351
I've got to go.

915
00:32:23,472 --> 00:32:24,232
I need to hurry

916
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:25,432
and contact my tailor,

917
00:32:25,472 --> 00:32:26,031
Mr. Fang.

918
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:27,511
My dresses have embroidery.

919
00:32:27,551 --> 00:32:28,232
Top-notch.

920
00:32:28,311 --> 00:32:29,271
I'll introduce him.

921
00:32:29,632 --> 00:32:30,672
Bye, Miss Xu. Thanks.

922
00:32:33,271 --> 00:32:33,791
Yan.

923
00:32:42,831 --> 00:32:43,551
Ms. Yu.

924
00:32:44,232 --> 00:32:45,831
Running a show is tough work.

925
00:32:46,672 --> 00:32:49,472
How could you casually push those favors

926
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:50,672
onto me?

927
00:32:51,632 --> 00:32:52,551
The caliber of guests

928
00:32:52,912 --> 00:32:54,071
determines the show's quality

929
00:32:54,071 --> 00:32:54,712
and value.

930
00:32:55,351 --> 00:32:56,392
I'm just a planner

931
00:32:56,632 --> 00:32:57,672
and on-screen host.

932
00:32:58,111 --> 00:32:59,591
I have limited influence.

933
00:33:00,472 --> 00:33:01,551
But you're different.

934
00:33:01,992 --> 00:33:03,992
With you guiding me

935
00:33:04,192 --> 00:33:06,311
and paving the way, I'm confident

936
00:33:07,271 --> 00:33:09,392
we can create

937
00:33:09,511 --> 00:33:10,872
a good and well-received show.

938
00:33:15,351 --> 00:33:16,031
Here, sit.

939
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,031
Many people get things done,

940
00:33:24,311 --> 00:33:25,511
but few have real vision.

941
00:33:27,712 --> 00:33:29,392
I still have much to learn from you.

942
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:31,392
Good girl.

943
00:33:45,632 --> 00:33:46,432
Ms. Yu.

944
00:33:46,551 --> 00:33:47,311
It's still hot.

945
00:33:54,392 --> 00:33:56,751
(To seize every opportunity
for a comeback,)

946
00:33:57,672 --> 00:33:58,992
(never pin your hopes)

947
00:33:58,992 --> 00:34:00,551
(on others.)

948
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,111
(It's simply)

949
00:34:04,712 --> 00:34:05,712
(using what you have)

950
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:08,832
(to get what you want.)

951
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,992
(Ratings)

952
00:34:11,992 --> 00:34:12,912
Miss Xu.

953
00:34:14,272 --> 00:34:16,071
This episode's results are excellent.

954
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:17,752
In both ratings and reviews.

955
00:34:18,031 --> 00:34:18,671
Impressive.

956
00:34:19,111 --> 00:34:20,191
Keep this up in the future.

957
00:34:22,832 --> 00:34:23,472
Sir,

958
00:34:24,832 --> 00:34:27,111
as for Sun Siwei...

959
00:34:27,792 --> 00:34:28,912
Don't factor her in.

960
00:34:29,312 --> 00:34:30,272
Sent to outdoor shoots.

961
00:34:30,591 --> 00:34:31,711
You know her temperament.

962
00:34:31,952 --> 00:34:32,631
Arguments aside,

963
00:34:33,472 --> 00:34:35,151
she can't deny the show's quality.

964
00:34:35,832 --> 00:34:37,151
No grounds for complaints there.

965
00:34:38,832 --> 00:34:39,912
Thank you for your support.

966
00:34:40,071 --> 00:34:40,752
I'd surely

967
00:34:40,792 --> 00:34:41,952
support a good idea.

968
00:34:43,711 --> 00:34:44,352
Miss Xu.

969
00:34:46,472 --> 00:34:47,472
Earlier, you mentioned

970
00:34:48,191 --> 00:34:49,832
there was something else to discuss?

971
00:34:50,992 --> 00:34:52,872
It's about the show's sponsorship fee.

972
00:34:56,352 --> 00:34:57,272
This company

973
00:34:57,352 --> 00:34:58,952
keeps pushing to finalize the contract.

974
00:34:59,191 --> 00:35:00,591
The sponsorship fee

975
00:35:00,671 --> 00:35:02,191
is 12% higher than before.

976
00:35:02,912 --> 00:35:04,191
If you approve,

977
00:35:04,752 --> 00:35:05,752
we can proceed.

978
00:35:08,071 --> 00:35:09,191
Why are you negotiating

979
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:10,352
sponsorship fees with me?

980
00:35:10,711 --> 00:35:11,231
Mr. Liu,

981
00:35:12,231 --> 00:35:13,231
I'm in charge now.

982
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,912
(Celebrity and Special Guests)
The latest guest list

983
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:16,151
for Family Feast.

984
00:35:16,231 --> 00:35:16,912
Please review it.

985
00:35:19,752 --> 00:35:20,872
Are you sure these people

986
00:35:20,912 --> 00:35:21,671
can be invited?

987
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:22,832
It can be written down,

988
00:35:23,472 --> 00:35:25,071
but with a 12% increase

989
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:26,952
in the sponsorship fee.

990
00:35:27,312 --> 00:35:28,656
(12% sponsorship fee increase)

991
00:35:32,272 --> 00:35:33,231
Miss Xu.

992
00:35:34,231 --> 00:35:35,272
I knew you wouldn't

993
00:35:35,272 --> 00:35:36,711
betray my trust.

994
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,752
(Party B: Anya Mountain Dairy Co., Ltd.)

995
00:35:38,752 --> 00:35:39,312
Pen.

996
00:35:50,472 --> 00:35:50,992
Yan.

997
00:35:51,231 --> 00:35:51,872
Did you see

998
00:35:51,912 --> 00:35:52,752
Mr. Zhou's expression

999
00:35:52,752 --> 00:35:53,952
when he saw the weekly report?

1000
00:35:54,071 --> 00:35:55,392
He was grinning from ear to ear.

1001
00:35:55,952 --> 00:35:57,631
Our show's comeback success

1002
00:35:58,151 --> 00:35:59,711
has agents bombarding our phones.

1003
00:35:59,752 --> 00:36:01,151
They're eager to collaborate.

1004
00:36:02,191 --> 00:36:04,191
Even the top-rated actress
for the next episode

1005
00:36:04,191 --> 00:36:04,912
is confirmed.

1006
00:36:06,392 --> 00:36:07,031
Thank you.

1007
00:36:08,656 --> 00:36:09,904
(Yan, money transfer)

1008
00:36:10,591 --> 00:36:11,111
Yan,

1009
00:36:11,191 --> 00:36:12,151
what are you doing?

1010
00:36:12,312 --> 00:36:13,191
I can't take it.

1011
00:36:13,752 --> 00:36:15,432
Your father's hospitalized.

1012
00:36:15,912 --> 00:36:16,832
You need money.

1013
00:36:16,832 --> 00:36:17,752
Don't refuse.

1014
00:36:19,432 --> 00:36:20,792
Introducing Director Lu to me

1015
00:36:21,031 --> 00:36:22,151
was helpful enough.

1016
00:36:22,591 --> 00:36:23,511
Without you,

1017
00:36:23,631 --> 00:36:24,392
I could never reach

1018
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,432
a hospital director.

1019
00:36:26,992 --> 00:36:27,591
Huanhuan.

1020
00:36:28,631 --> 00:36:30,151
Resources exist to be utilized.

1021
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:31,671
Besides, right now,

1022
00:36:32,151 --> 00:36:33,752
the surgery comes first.

1023
00:36:36,352 --> 00:36:37,591
May the operation go smoothly.

1024
00:36:39,591 --> 00:36:41,111
Juggling work and family lately

1025
00:36:41,151 --> 00:36:42,231
must be exhausting.

1026
00:36:42,472 --> 00:36:43,671
Eat a lot today to replenish.

1027
00:36:43,792 --> 00:36:44,432
Choose.

1028
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:46,272
My treat.

1029
00:36:49,352 --> 00:36:50,031
What'll you have?

1030
00:36:51,312 --> 00:36:52,111
The usual food.

1031
00:36:52,312 --> 00:36:52,752
Okay.

1032
00:36:57,631 --> 00:36:58,872
Congratulations, Yan.

1033
00:36:58,912 --> 00:37:00,272
You become Family Feast's host.

1034
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:01,551
We've all witnessed

1035
00:37:01,551 --> 00:37:02,551
your dedication

1036
00:37:02,631 --> 00:37:04,031
to this show.

1037
00:37:06,631 --> 00:37:07,551
Thank you, Liao.

1038
00:37:08,312 --> 00:37:08,711
Oh,

1039
00:37:08,832 --> 00:37:10,392
join us for dinner tonight.

1040
00:37:11,111 --> 00:37:12,352
You're too kind.

1041
00:37:16,191 --> 00:37:16,952
Siwei.

1042
00:37:17,191 --> 00:37:18,671
You're here early today.

1043
00:37:18,832 --> 00:37:19,952
What are you implying?

1044
00:37:20,551 --> 00:37:21,511
Siwei always starts

1045
00:37:21,551 --> 00:37:22,472
makeup at this hour.

1046
00:37:22,671 --> 00:37:23,031
Wait.

1047
00:37:23,111 --> 00:37:24,111
Your outdoor shoot

1048
00:37:24,151 --> 00:37:25,231
is scheduled for 6 PM,

1049
00:37:25,392 --> 00:37:26,711
arranged after Family Feast.

1050
00:37:27,071 --> 00:37:28,872
It's only 3 PM now.

1051
00:37:29,151 --> 00:37:29,832
Don't we usually

1052
00:37:29,832 --> 00:37:31,231
do makeup two hours beforehand?

1053
00:37:31,352 --> 00:37:32,511
Show schedules are one thing,

1054
00:37:32,591 --> 00:37:33,752
makeup schedules are another.

1055
00:37:34,272 --> 00:37:35,591
Since when does the makeup team

1056
00:37:35,591 --> 00:37:36,551
have the authority

1057
00:37:36,551 --> 00:37:37,231
to dictate

1058
00:37:37,231 --> 00:37:38,511
our filming schedule?

1059
00:37:40,272 --> 00:37:40,752
I...

1060
00:37:41,992 --> 00:37:43,031
You can't do my makeup?

1061
00:37:43,352 --> 00:37:43,912
Fine.

1062
00:37:44,031 --> 00:37:44,671
Your phone.

1063
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:45,912
Wait.

1064
00:37:46,071 --> 00:37:47,711
I'll call Mr. Zhou to clarify.

1065
00:37:47,752 --> 00:37:48,792
If the outdoor shoot today

1066
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:49,832
runs overtime,

1067
00:37:49,872 --> 00:37:51,992
who takes responsibility
for missing the golden hour?

1068
00:37:52,071 --> 00:37:52,912
No, Siwei.

1069
00:37:52,952 --> 00:37:53,832
You got me wrong.

1070
00:37:53,832 --> 00:37:54,352
I mean...

1071
00:37:54,392 --> 00:37:54,952
Liao,

1072
00:37:56,551 --> 00:37:57,551
do her makeup first.

1073
00:37:57,671 --> 00:37:58,392
I can wait.

1074
00:37:59,832 --> 00:38:00,432
Okay.

1075
00:38:00,792 --> 00:38:01,392
Siwei,

1076
00:38:01,671 --> 00:38:03,151
please wait a moment.

1077
00:38:03,352 --> 00:38:05,071
I'll get your touch-up kit.

1078
00:38:16,312 --> 00:38:17,792
You need touch-ups now?

1079
00:38:18,272 --> 00:38:19,312
Your makeup will be ruined

1080
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,231
during the shoot.

1081
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:21,952
Why make things hard for others?

1082
00:38:24,031 --> 00:38:25,792
Who do you think you are?

1083
00:38:26,752 --> 00:38:28,832
You just hosted one episode

1084
00:38:29,671 --> 00:38:30,392
and suddenly act

1085
00:38:30,432 --> 00:38:31,711
like my equal?

1086
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:33,952
Other shows invited me,

1087
00:38:34,591 --> 00:38:35,792
but I worry about you.

1088
00:38:36,872 --> 00:38:37,671
My episode averaged

1089
00:38:37,671 --> 00:38:39,111
a 4 rating.

1090
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:40,832
Yours got 1.

1091
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:42,992
How could I leave?

1092
00:38:47,472 --> 00:38:48,191
Did you write

1093
00:38:48,191 --> 00:38:49,392
the proposal yourself?

1094
00:38:49,671 --> 00:38:51,191
Or did your rich boyfriend buy it?

1095
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:53,551
You know my capabilities well.

1096
00:38:53,912 --> 00:38:54,792
My team and I

1097
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:55,752
can complete such tasks

1098
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:56,711
on our own.

1099
00:38:57,151 --> 00:38:58,472
No boyfriend assistance needed.

1100
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:00,792
You couldn't compete fairly,

1101
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:03,191
so you went to get a rich boyfriend?

1102
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:04,111
Xu Yan,

1103
00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:05,191
I never realized

1104
00:39:05,191 --> 00:39:06,272
you were so ambitious

1105
00:39:06,272 --> 00:39:07,111
and scheming.

1106
00:39:11,551 --> 00:39:12,631
I secure exclusives,

1107
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:15,272
handle full production

1108
00:39:16,631 --> 00:39:17,992
and have professional skills.

1109
00:39:19,111 --> 00:39:20,352
Why shouldn't I compete for it?

1110
00:39:23,432 --> 00:39:24,231
I never consider

1111
00:39:24,231 --> 00:39:25,231
ambition and strategy

1112
00:39:25,231 --> 00:39:26,191
to be insults.

1113
00:39:27,272 --> 00:39:28,352
I'll take it as praise.

1114
00:39:28,752 --> 00:39:29,472
Thanks.

1115
00:39:39,872 --> 00:39:41,511
How can she be this shameless?

1116
00:39:41,631 --> 00:39:42,352
Right.

1117
00:39:46,671 --> 00:39:48,312
When she first joined,

1118
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,031
I distinctly remember

1119
00:39:50,031 --> 00:39:52,432
her saying she only had a grandmother.

1120
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:55,511
Now, suddenly her parents are overseas?

1121
00:39:55,752 --> 00:39:56,912
A highly educated family?

1122
00:39:57,191 --> 00:39:57,992
Is she hiding

1123
00:39:58,031 --> 00:39:59,151
her background and working

1124
00:39:59,591 --> 00:40:00,671
'to experience life'

1125
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:02,392
like some reality show folks?

1126
00:40:02,551 --> 00:40:03,231
Impossible.

1127
00:40:04,071 --> 00:40:04,952
Her shabby appearance

1128
00:40:04,952 --> 00:40:05,912
doesn't seem faked.

1129
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:07,631
Must be it.

1130
00:40:08,231 --> 00:40:09,031
The other day,

1131
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:09,872
I saw her wearing

1132
00:40:09,872 --> 00:40:10,752
a diamond bracelet

1133
00:40:11,111 --> 00:40:12,432
with one-carat stones.

1134
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,231
Isn't she marrying

1135
00:40:14,231 --> 00:40:15,671
a construction company's heir?

1136
00:40:16,231 --> 00:40:17,231
Those families

1137
00:40:17,591 --> 00:40:18,912
care most about women's status.

1138
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,231
Yan.

1139
00:40:29,872 --> 00:40:31,111
I've emailed you the proposal.

1140
00:40:31,191 --> 00:40:32,231
Anything else?

1141
00:40:32,952 --> 00:40:34,071
Send the interview outline

1142
00:40:34,071 --> 00:40:35,151
to the guests beforehand.

1143
00:40:35,872 --> 00:40:36,231
Okay.

1144
00:40:36,472 --> 00:40:37,231
I'm off.

1145
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:37,832
Go.

1146
00:40:53,711 --> 00:40:54,872
(Good evening, everyone.)

1147
00:40:55,151 --> 00:40:55,792
(Welcome)

1148
00:40:55,792 --> 00:40:56,912
(Global Stock Market Trends)
(to tonight's Financial News.)

1149
00:40:57,472 --> 00:40:59,111
(This year,
the global stock market faces)

1150
00:40:59,231 --> 00:41:00,711
(both opportunities and challenges.)

1151
00:41:00,711 --> 00:41:01,352
(The downside,)

1152
00:41:01,472 --> 00:41:03,191
(the tech stock bubble burst)

1153
00:41:03,272 --> 00:41:04,752
(is still weighing on the market.)

1154
00:41:04,992 --> 00:41:05,752
(The upside,)

1155
00:41:05,912 --> 00:41:07,111
(the rise of emerging markets)

1156
00:41:07,272 --> 00:41:07,992

(new growth opportunities.)

1159
00:41:10,472 --> 00:41:11,872
(its stable economic policies)

1160
00:41:12,071 --> 00:41:13,591
(and vast market potential,)

1161
00:41:13,752 --> 00:41:15,111
(has captured global attention.)

1162
00:41:15,392 --> 00:41:16,671
Qiao Yan is recovering well.

1163
00:41:16,912 --> 00:41:18,432
She'll be discharged in two days.

1164
00:41:19,151 --> 00:41:20,231
Thank you, doctor.

1165
00:41:20,392 --> 00:41:20,912
Thank you.

1166
00:41:21,071 --> 00:41:21,792
After discharge,

1167
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:22,591
make sure she

1168
00:41:22,631 --> 00:41:23,631
gets enough sleep.

1169
00:41:23,832 --> 00:41:24,591
No exhaustion.

1170
00:41:24,752 --> 00:41:25,432
I will.

1171
00:41:25,432 --> 00:41:27,071
I'll take good care of her.

1172
00:41:27,191 --> 00:41:27,752
Good.

1173
00:41:28,151 --> 00:41:30,191
(Acquire and disseminate
cultural information.)

1174
00:41:31,912 --> 00:41:33,272
(It has made China's stock market)

1175
00:41:33,352 --> 00:41:34,472
(a prime target)

1176
00:41:34,631 --> 00:41:35,752
(for international capital.)

1177
00:41:35,792 --> 00:41:36,312
Yan.

1178
00:41:40,752 --> 00:41:41,671
How did you get in?

1179
00:41:42,231 --> 00:41:44,191
I met Huanhuan downstairs.

1180
00:41:44,312 --> 00:41:45,151
She swiped me in.

1181
00:41:47,711 --> 00:41:48,952
Are you here alone?

1182
00:41:49,392 --> 00:41:50,151
Working overtime?

1183
00:41:52,591 --> 00:41:53,792
What can I do for you?

1184
00:41:55,432 --> 00:41:56,111
Perfect timing.

1185
00:41:56,551 --> 00:41:57,711
I can't decide

1186
00:41:57,711 --> 00:41:58,551
on some dishes.

1187
00:41:58,792 --> 00:41:59,591
Your taste is good.

1188
00:41:59,711 --> 00:42:00,591
Help me choose.

1189
00:42:01,472 --> 00:42:02,111
Let me look.

1190
00:42:02,352 --> 00:42:02,792
Go.

1191
00:42:05,191 --> 00:42:05,992
(Hangzhou Cuisine)
Look.

1192
00:42:06,231 --> 00:42:07,671
This is the Hangzhou cuisine series.

1193
00:42:07,832 --> 00:42:09,952
Here's Longjing shrimp.

1194
00:42:10,191 --> 00:42:10,912
The recipe.

1195
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,111
This is Dongpo pork.

1196
00:42:13,671 --> 00:42:14,352
This is...?

1197
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:16,312
A pearl necklace.

1198
00:42:20,711 --> 00:42:21,392
Congratulations

1199
00:42:21,551 --> 00:42:22,352
on your promotion.

1200
00:42:23,312 --> 00:42:24,272
A gift for the hostess

1201
00:42:24,272 --> 00:42:25,352
of Family Feast.

1202
00:42:28,551 --> 00:42:29,151
Thank you.

1203
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:31,272
Your surprises always come first.

1204
00:42:32,832 --> 00:42:33,472
Do you like it?

1205
00:42:33,631 --> 00:42:34,591
Of course I do.

1206
00:42:38,591 --> 00:42:40,231
Now that you're officially a hostess,

1207
00:42:40,752 --> 00:42:42,191
do you have your own office?

1208
00:42:42,511 --> 00:42:43,872
Program hosts don't get one,

1209
00:42:44,711 --> 00:42:46,472
but news anchors

1210
00:42:46,711 --> 00:42:47,872
have private offices.

1211
00:42:49,832 --> 00:42:51,352
Then become a news anchor.

1212
00:42:57,432 --> 00:42:58,392
News anchoring

1213
00:42:58,752 --> 00:43:00,151
is highly competitive.

1214
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:01,752
And I don't even

1215
00:43:01,832 --> 00:43:03,392
have news reporting experience.

1216
00:43:03,952 --> 00:43:04,992
It's an uphill battle.

1217
00:43:06,071 --> 00:43:07,551
Others might struggle,

1218
00:43:08,392 --> 00:43:09,231
but for you,

1219
00:43:10,231 --> 00:43:11,992
I've always had faith.

1220
00:43:14,071 --> 00:43:14,671
I believe you

1221
00:43:14,671 --> 00:43:15,671
can make the impossible

1222
00:43:15,752 --> 00:43:16,472
possible.

1223
00:43:18,832 --> 00:43:20,231
You trust I can do this?

1224
00:43:21,111 --> 00:43:22,472
Pursue what you want.

1225
00:43:23,352 --> 00:43:24,031
I'm waiting

1226
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,231
to throw a party for you.

1227
00:43:28,071 --> 00:43:29,272
But first,

1228
00:43:29,671 --> 00:43:31,071
let me solve your current problem.

1229
00:43:31,352 --> 00:43:32,231
Leave work soon.

1230
00:43:32,631 --> 00:43:33,671
It's getting late.

1231
00:43:37,912 --> 00:43:38,711
(Everything moves)

1232
00:43:38,711 --> 00:43:40,511
(towards my desired direction,)

1233
00:43:41,392 --> 00:43:42,832
(but I refuse to believe)

1234
00:43:43,352 --> 00:43:44,872
(that lies can be seamless.)

1235
00:43:45,591 --> 00:43:46,872
(They only tighten their grip)

1236
00:43:46,872 --> 00:43:48,071
(around my throat,)

1237
00:43:48,511 --> 00:43:50,151
(choking me slowly.)

1238
00:43:51,352 --> 00:43:52,511
(Perhaps deception's purpose)

1239
00:43:52,511 --> 00:43:53,952
(isn't to fool others)

1240
00:43:54,792 --> 00:43:56,111
(but to delude oneself.)

1241
00:43:57,792 --> 00:43:59,432
(The family I tried to erase)

1242
00:44:00,511 --> 00:44:02,511
(was never truly gone.)

1243
00:44:05,671 --> 00:44:06,392
Look at this one.

1244
00:44:07,031 --> 00:44:08,031
It's truly exceptional.

1245
00:44:09,832 --> 00:44:10,671
Our past events

1246
00:44:10,671 --> 00:44:11,752
are all

1247
00:44:11,992 --> 00:44:13,111
pretty similar.

1248
00:44:13,792 --> 00:44:15,432
Everyone's long found them boring.

1249
00:44:15,992 --> 00:44:17,272
Your program is fantastic.

1250
00:44:17,591 --> 00:44:18,792
They are so enthusiastic now.

1251
00:44:18,912 --> 00:44:20,472
Some even pull strings to join.

1252
00:44:21,671 --> 00:44:22,231
True.

1253
00:44:22,591 --> 00:44:23,472
Smart people always

1254
00:44:23,551 --> 00:44:25,832
know how to mobilize resources.

1255
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:26,511
Right?

1256
00:44:27,792 --> 00:44:29,272
I didn't understand before,

1257
00:44:29,312 --> 00:44:29,912
Mr. Shen.

1258
00:44:30,392 --> 00:44:30,832
Thank you.

1259
00:44:30,832 --> 00:44:31,912
It's through spending time

1260
00:44:31,952 --> 00:44:32,792
with Ms. Yu recently

1261
00:44:33,031 --> 00:44:34,432
and attending several banquets

1262
00:44:34,752 --> 00:44:35,631
that I've just started

1263
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:36,392
learning a little.

1264
00:44:37,392 --> 00:44:38,472
Such a sweet talker.

1265
00:44:39,992 --> 00:44:40,752
You little rascal.

1266
00:44:40,752 --> 00:44:42,031
Slow down, okay?

1267
00:44:42,272 --> 00:44:43,231
I want cartoons!

1268
00:44:43,631 --> 00:44:44,832
- Your homework?
- Be careful.

1269
00:44:44,952 --> 00:44:45,952
- Homework done?
- Yes.

1270
00:44:46,071 --> 00:44:46,671
Remember.

1271
00:44:46,752 --> 00:44:47,711
Only half an hour of TV.

1272
00:44:47,952 --> 00:44:48,992
You're spoiling him again.

1273
00:44:50,151 --> 00:44:50,872
Have some tea.

1274
00:44:51,111 --> 00:44:51,832
(Now,)

1275
00:44:51,872 --> 00:44:52,872
(let's welcome...)

1276
00:44:53,312 --> 00:44:53,792
Dad!

1277
00:44:53,912 --> 00:44:54,912
Isn't that you?

1278
00:44:55,272 --> 00:44:56,392
(Mr. Shen Jinsong)

1279
00:44:56,511 --> 00:44:58,031
(and merchant representatives)

1280
00:44:58,272 --> 00:44:59,752
(will cut the ribbon)

1281
00:44:59,832 --> 00:45:01,031
(for the street project.)

1282
00:45:01,272 --> 00:45:03,151
(Let's count down together.)

1283
00:45:04,671 --> 00:45:05,191
(Three,)

1284
00:45:05,591 --> 00:45:06,151
(two,)

1285
00:45:06,392 --> 00:45:06,872
(one.)

1286
00:45:07,151 --> 00:45:08,591
(Please cut the ribbon.)

1287
00:45:09,392 --> 00:45:10,952
(Let's applaud to congratulate)

1288
00:45:11,031 --> 00:45:12,352
(Yunjiangli, Dayun County...)

1289
00:45:12,551 --> 00:45:14,191
Honey, you look good on camera.

1290
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:16,631
Not too old to look at yet.

1291
00:45:16,792 --> 00:45:17,352
Right?

1292
00:45:17,472 --> 00:45:18,752
(Let's move to the center)

1293
00:45:18,872 --> 00:45:19,792
(for a group photo.)

1294
00:45:21,832 --> 00:45:23,111
(How do you feel?)

1295
00:45:25,312 --> 00:45:26,231
(Well, very...)

1296
00:45:26,312 --> 00:45:26,992
(I-I-I...)

1297
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:28,792
(On behalf of all the merchants)

1298
00:45:29,071 --> 00:45:29,912
(in the street,)

1299
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:32,432
(let me say thank you)

1300
00:45:33,071 --> 00:45:34,551
(to Jinda Group and Chairman Shen)

1301
00:45:34,912 --> 00:45:35,711
(for creating)

1302
00:45:35,992 --> 00:45:37,312
(a good business environment)

1303
00:45:37,952 --> 00:45:38,792
(and boosting)

1304
00:45:39,352 --> 00:45:40,432
(commercial development.)

1305
00:45:40,432 --> 00:45:41,551
(Yunjiangli Commercial Street Project,
Dayun County, Shanxi Province)

1306
00:45:41,551 --> 00:45:42,912
(We'll continue as always)

1307
00:45:43,312 --> 00:45:44,231
(to fulfill our duties)

1308
00:45:44,792 --> 00:45:46,671
(and serve our fellow villagers.)

1309
00:45:46,912 --> 00:45:47,912
(Yunjiangli...)

1310
00:45:48,071 --> 00:45:48,671
Xu,

1311
00:45:48,992 --> 00:45:50,231
you're from Shanxi, right?

1312
00:45:50,231 --> 00:45:51,392
(A representative project)

1313
00:45:51,432 --> 00:45:52,992
(to promote urban development)

1314
00:45:52,992 --> 00:45:54,031
(and life quality.)

1315
00:45:54,392 --> 00:45:55,671
(The former Yunjiangli had)

1316
00:45:55,832 --> 00:45:56,551
(narrow roads.)

1317
00:45:56,551 --> 00:45:56,992
Right.

1318
00:45:57,312 --> 00:45:57,952
Uh,

1319
00:45:58,071 --> 00:45:59,312
have you been to Dayun County?

1320
00:45:59,472 --> 00:46:00,551
(Widening the roads)

1321
00:46:00,832 --> 00:46:02,272
(and adding accessible pathways)

1322
