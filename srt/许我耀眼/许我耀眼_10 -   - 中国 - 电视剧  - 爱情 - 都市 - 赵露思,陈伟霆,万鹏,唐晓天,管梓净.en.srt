is completely healed.

30
00:01:46,555 --> 00:01:48,555
It's even more flexible than before.

31
00:01:48,555 --> 00:01:49,755
- Look.
- Enough.

32
00:01:50,154 --> 00:01:51,074
Be careful

33
00:01:51,395 --> 00:01:53,635
not to lift anything heavy
for three months.

34
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:55,714
- Got it.
- Or you'll risk habitual dislocation.

35
00:01:55,755 --> 00:01:56,995
- Okay.
- Yiming.

36
00:01:57,434 --> 00:01:58,354
Let's go for food.

37
00:01:58,675 --> 00:01:59,635
Okay, go ahead.

It's already mealtime.

39

- Will you...?
- Okay, let's eat.

40
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:10,995
I heard your canteen

41
00:02:11,034 --> 00:02:11,914
has great food.

42
00:02:12,275 --> 00:02:13,275
Alright, let's go.

43
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:21,034
Wenjin, over here.

44
00:02:21,634 --> 00:02:22,474
Come sit with us.

45
00:02:23,634 --> 00:02:24,275
Come on.

46
00:02:26,154 --> 00:02:27,275
You don't know her, right?

47
00:02:27,835 --> 00:02:28,675
- Alright.
- Thanks.

48
00:02:28,714 --> 00:02:29,754
Let me introduce you.

49
00:02:30,675 --> 00:02:32,675
Yu Yiming, your senior.

50
00:02:33,555 --> 00:02:35,474
An orthopedic PhD two years above you.

51
00:02:36,275 --> 00:02:37,555
- Hello, senior.
- Hi.

52
00:02:37,914 --> 00:02:39,275
Xu Wenjin, your junior.

53
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:40,714
Neurosurgery PhD.

54
00:02:41,474 --> 00:02:42,795
Top scorer in Shandong.

55
00:02:44,115 --> 00:02:45,515
Impressive. Nice to meet you.

56
00:02:46,075 --> 00:02:46,634
Me too.

57
00:02:47,955 --> 00:02:50,555
Guo, stop bringing up ancient history.

58
00:02:51,395 --> 00:02:52,275
Don't be modest.

59
00:02:52,634 --> 00:02:53,355
Right after

60
00:02:53,754 --> 00:02:54,714
her graduation,

61
00:02:54,835 --> 00:02:57,835
Wenjin got invited by
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

62
00:02:57,955 --> 00:02:59,795
to a three-year cancer research project.

63
00:02:59,955 --> 00:03:00,835
I'm so jealous.

64
00:03:03,555 --> 00:03:05,594
Dig in. Should I get you some soup?

65
00:03:05,634 --> 00:03:06,795
No need, this is enough.

66
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,600
Which department are you from?

67
00:03:08,835 --> 00:03:09,874
I'm not staff here.

68
00:03:10,395 --> 00:03:12,075
She's my high school classmate Qiao Lin.

69
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:13,355
She happened to

70
00:03:13,555 --> 00:03:14,594
get my appointment

71
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:15,952
- by chance.
- What a coincidence.

72
00:03:16,555 --> 00:03:17,634
What do you do?

73
00:03:18,194 --> 00:03:19,555
I sell cosmetics at a mall.

74
00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:22,995
She just came to Jingzhou alone.

75
00:03:23,115 --> 00:03:24,395
She's gaining experience

76
00:03:24,874 --> 00:03:25,555
for her career.

77
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:28,874
I like makeup, too.

78
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:30,034
But I think

79
00:03:30,075 --> 00:03:32,555
makeup requires skill just like surgery.

80
00:03:32,835 --> 00:03:33,955
Every morning, I try

81
00:03:33,955 --> 00:03:35,154
to learn from tutorial videos,

82
00:03:35,154 --> 00:03:36,176
but I never get it right.

83
00:03:38,675 --> 00:03:40,075
Why don't you visit my store?

84
00:03:40,835 --> 00:03:42,914
- I can do your makeup.
- Sounds great.

85
00:03:42,955 --> 00:03:45,034
I'll customize makeup based on

86
00:03:45,034 --> 00:03:46,115
your skin type and tone,

87
00:03:46,194 --> 00:03:48,034
and your facial features.

88
00:03:48,154 --> 00:03:50,034
Let me add you on WeChat.

89
00:03:50,115 --> 00:03:51,474
Come find me at the store.

90
00:03:51,555 --> 00:03:52,235
Alright.

91
00:03:53,555 --> 00:03:55,634
- Shall we do the same?
- Sure.

92
00:03:55,754 --> 00:03:56,154
Okay.

93
00:03:56,555 --> 00:03:57,115
I'll add you.

94
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:57,594
Alright.

95
00:03:58,075 --> 00:03:59,795
Senior, let me add you too.

96
00:04:00,154 --> 00:04:00,555
Okay.

97
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:02,474
Qiao Lin.

98
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:03,874
I sent the request.

99
00:04:04,914 --> 00:04:05,434
Okay.

100
00:04:06,194 --> 00:04:06,634
Thanks.

101
00:04:08,675 --> 00:04:09,194
Dig in.

102
00:04:09,355 --> 00:04:09,795
Alright.

103
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:43,760
(Conan)

104
00:05:43,355 --> 00:05:45,675
Do you want to watch TV

105
00:05:45,754 --> 00:05:46,995
or play games?

106
00:05:47,235 --> 00:05:47,995
Play games.

107
00:05:48,274 --> 00:05:49,274
Alright,

108
00:05:50,314 --> 00:05:52,035
but only thirty minutes.

109
00:05:52,035 --> 00:05:53,074
- Deal?
- Deal.

110
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:54,194
Okay.

111
00:05:56,954 --> 00:05:58,394
Let me show you something first.

112
00:05:59,634 --> 00:06:00,235
Look.

113
00:06:03,995 --> 00:06:04,555
See?

114
00:06:07,874 --> 00:06:09,274
You took these?

115
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:13,754
(Junlong Equestrian)

116
00:06:13,754 --> 00:06:14,995
You look really cool

117
00:06:14,995 --> 00:06:16,274
when riding,

118
00:06:17,074 --> 00:06:18,715
especially when you jump obstacles.

119
00:06:19,874 --> 00:06:22,115
You look almost like Hua Tian.

120
00:06:22,954 --> 00:06:24,274
You know Hua Tian?

121
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:25,475
Of course, I do.

122
00:06:25,874 --> 00:06:28,675
He's your favorite equestrian athlete.

123
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,035
He won

124
00:06:31,115 --> 00:06:33,115
the individual champion in show jumping

125
00:06:33,155 --> 00:06:34,274
and the team champion

126
00:06:34,314 --> 00:06:35,715
in the event.

127
00:06:37,274 --> 00:06:37,954
Listen.

128
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:39,314
You can ask the coach

129
00:06:39,314 --> 00:06:40,155
to record videos

130
00:06:40,235 --> 00:06:41,874
during your future training.

131
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:42,834
Then, you'll know

132
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:43,834
your weaknesses

133
00:06:43,995 --> 00:06:45,795
and exactly what to work on.

134
00:06:50,355 --> 00:06:51,035
Look carefully.

135
00:06:51,634 --> 00:06:53,074
Then you can play games.

136
00:06:53,555 --> 00:06:54,795
I'll keep taking photos.

137
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:55,394
Okay.

138
00:06:59,595 --> 00:07:00,434
Look at this move.

139
00:07:01,715 --> 00:07:02,355
Cool, huh?

140
00:07:02,595 --> 00:07:03,475
Check out the horse.

141
00:07:04,194 --> 00:07:05,595
What about the horse?

142
00:07:09,635 --> 00:07:11,536
(Hospital)

143
00:07:16,274 --> 00:07:16,754
How is he?

144
00:07:18,035 --> 00:07:19,754
He fell asleep after the IV.

145
00:07:31,675 --> 00:07:32,555
Are you working?

146
00:07:35,434 --> 00:07:36,834
I need to tell you something

147
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:37,634
important.

148
00:07:38,915 --> 00:07:40,514
I didn't want to worry

149
00:07:40,514 --> 00:07:41,675
your parents.

150
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:46,736
But Haochen

151
00:07:49,392 --> 00:07:51,155
fell from the horse on purpose.

152
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:53,235
What do you mean?

153
00:08:07,475 --> 00:08:08,634
Why would he do that?

154
00:08:09,475 --> 00:08:10,434
I think

155
00:08:11,595 --> 00:08:13,555
he was trying to seek attention

156
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:16,715
from his family.

157
00:08:18,754 --> 00:08:20,274
I've been observing Haochen.

158
00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:21,715
Whenever he's with

159
00:08:21,754 --> 00:08:22,954
you or your parents,

160
00:08:23,555 --> 00:08:25,475
he's extremely happy.

161
00:08:26,434 --> 00:08:27,434
But when you're gone,

162
00:08:27,434 --> 00:08:28,915
he gets very upset.

163
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:35,914
But he shouldn't hurt himself.

164
00:08:36,754 --> 00:08:37,874
How would a child know

165
00:08:37,874 --> 00:08:39,554
the right way to cope?

166
00:08:43,835 --> 00:08:45,115
I have a friend.

167
00:08:50,715 --> 00:08:52,475
She told me that

168
00:08:52,554 --> 00:08:54,235
due to family hardships,

169
00:08:55,554 --> 00:08:57,034
she was sent away

170
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:58,835
for foster care

171
00:08:58,835 --> 00:09:00,075
when she was young.

172
00:09:00,955 --> 00:09:02,914
Though they brought her home later,

173
00:09:05,435 --> 00:09:07,274
she still struggled to get

174
00:09:08,874 --> 00:09:10,674
the love and companionship she needed.

175
00:09:17,435 --> 00:09:18,274
What's wrong?

176
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:21,754
Dad, Mom.

177
00:09:22,274 --> 00:09:22,715
What?

178
00:09:22,715 --> 00:09:23,394
Come here.

179
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:24,195
My hand.

180
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:25,914
You're hurt?

181
00:09:25,955 --> 00:09:26,914
Get a Band-Aid.

182
00:09:26,995 --> 00:09:27,634
Band-Aid.

183
00:09:28,554 --> 00:09:29,195
Come on.

184
00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:30,274
Right here.

185
00:09:30,274 --> 00:09:30,794
Put it on.

186
00:09:31,595 --> 00:09:32,874
Careful.

187
00:09:32,995 --> 00:09:34,235
Careful.

188
00:09:34,394 --> 00:09:35,715
Any other injuries?

189
00:09:36,315 --> 00:09:36,955
Anywhere else?

190
00:09:36,995 --> 00:09:38,075
Do your legs hurt?

191
00:09:38,235 --> 00:09:39,195
Easy now.

192
00:09:39,274 --> 00:09:39,835
Sweetheart.

193
00:09:40,235 --> 00:09:40,914
Take it slow.

194
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:47,955
They say

195
00:09:49,754 --> 00:09:51,394
a happy childhood

196
00:09:52,235 --> 00:09:53,595
can heal you for a lifetime.

197
00:09:55,715 --> 00:09:57,075
But an unhappy one

198
00:10:00,235 --> 00:10:01,595
takes a lifetime to heal.

199
00:10:08,435 --> 00:10:09,514
That's why I believe

200
00:10:10,554 --> 00:10:12,355
no material comforts

201
00:10:13,674 --> 00:10:15,955
can replace family love and presence.

202
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:17,754
Right?

203
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:23,554
Haochen's too young.

204
00:10:25,674 --> 00:10:26,754
Can't we ask

205
00:10:27,034 --> 00:10:28,514
your parents to reconsider

206
00:10:29,075 --> 00:10:30,715
sending him abroad?

207
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:35,315
Okay, let's do as you say.

208
00:10:37,955 --> 00:10:39,514
Thank you for caring for him.

209
00:10:40,554 --> 00:10:42,355
I'll go to the office early tomorrow

210
00:10:42,514 --> 00:10:43,674
and get the work done.

211
00:10:44,355 --> 00:10:46,674
Let's spend more time with him.

212
00:10:50,835 --> 00:10:51,435
Alright.

213
00:10:52,315 --> 00:10:53,514
Stay here with Haochen.

214
00:10:53,874 --> 00:10:55,355
I'll fetch some clothes.

215
00:10:55,475 --> 00:10:56,754
Okay, go ahead.

216
00:10:58,315 --> 00:10:59,274
I'll head back now.

217
00:11:00,274 --> 00:11:00,794
Bye.

218
00:11:18,674 --> 00:11:20,514
Qiao Lin, you're up next.

219
00:11:20,874 --> 00:11:21,274
Alright.

220
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:23,115
Your sales performance is good.

221
00:11:24,075 --> 00:11:26,914
You achieved
the top regional ranking so soon.

222
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:28,955
It's remarkable.

223
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:31,154
Plus, the neo-Chinese-style makeup

224
00:11:31,154 --> 00:11:32,195
you did for clients

225
00:11:32,394 --> 00:11:33,514
went viral online

226
00:11:33,754 --> 00:11:35,794
with great reviews.

227
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,034
It benefits our brand image.

228
00:11:38,394 --> 00:11:40,435
We're promoting a salesperson

229
00:11:40,435 --> 00:11:42,715
from the store to the headquarters'

230
00:11:42,715 --> 00:11:43,955
sales team.

231
00:11:44,075 --> 00:11:45,674
You're on the shortlist.

232
00:11:48,115 --> 00:11:49,674
Thank you for the recognition.

233
00:11:49,874 --> 00:11:52,034
I genuinely love this industry,

234
00:11:52,195 --> 00:11:53,235
especially when

235
00:11:53,274 --> 00:11:54,955
the customers like the makeup I've done.

236
00:11:55,034 --> 00:11:56,034
Their happiness

237
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:57,835
makes me happy too.

238
00:11:58,715 --> 00:12:00,794
Who do you think
should get the last spot?

239
00:12:01,235 --> 00:12:02,955
Qiao Lin might be alright.

240
00:12:03,914 --> 00:12:04,794
Qiao Lin.

241
00:12:05,195 --> 00:12:06,315
That girl's decent.

242
00:12:06,914 --> 00:12:08,514
But her education level is too low.

243
00:12:09,514 --> 00:12:10,394
What a shame.

244
00:12:10,794 --> 00:12:12,355
Let's stick to the standards.

245
00:12:12,674 --> 00:12:13,154
Alright.

246
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:17,554
Education level.

247
00:12:20,483 --> 00:12:23,120
(Interview result: Failed)

248
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:28,835
What's wrong? Did you get eliminated?

249
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:32,154
You know what?

250
00:12:32,195 --> 00:12:33,235
This industry keeps

251
00:12:33,355 --> 00:12:34,634
getting more competitive.

252
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,355
My cousin graduated

253
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,514
from a world-renowned university,

254
00:12:39,195 --> 00:12:40,754
but started as a sales associate.

255
00:12:40,914 --> 00:12:42,034
So forget about it.

256
00:12:54,475 --> 00:12:55,634
You've already ordered?

257
00:12:55,955 --> 00:12:56,315
Well,

258
00:12:56,315 --> 00:12:57,715
I invited you for food,

259
00:12:57,715 --> 00:12:58,514
but I'm late.

260
00:12:58,794 --> 00:12:59,674
Sorry.

261
00:12:59,914 --> 00:13:00,394
No worries.

262
00:13:00,634 --> 00:13:01,195
Let's eat.

263
00:13:01,394 --> 00:13:01,914
Okay.

264
00:13:02,914 --> 00:13:04,075
You bought a new laptop?

265
00:13:06,634 --> 00:13:07,634
It's for work?

266
00:13:08,075 --> 00:13:09,274
The trends are changing

267
00:13:09,274 --> 00:13:10,154
way too fast.

268
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:12,355
I bought it to study

269
00:13:13,034 --> 00:13:13,835
and gather

270
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:14,955
information on

271
00:13:14,955 --> 00:13:16,034
the latest makeup styles.

272
00:13:17,794 --> 00:13:19,754
Plus, I want to continue my education.

273
00:13:20,394 --> 00:13:22,034
I want to enroll in adult education

274
00:13:22,075 --> 00:13:23,355
to improve my qualifications.

275
00:13:25,394 --> 00:13:26,115
Sounds great.

276
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:27,475
I fully

277
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:28,355
support you.

278
00:13:29,034 --> 00:13:30,394
Don't rush to say that.

279
00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:32,034
I'm just having

280
00:13:32,034 --> 00:13:32,874
this idea.

281
00:13:33,115 --> 00:13:35,034
But I haven't decided on a major

282
00:13:35,034 --> 00:13:36,034
or anything.

283
00:13:36,195 --> 00:13:37,034
That's why I wanted

284
00:13:37,034 --> 00:13:38,115
to talk with you.

285
00:13:38,674 --> 00:13:39,195
Alright,

286
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:41,075
tell me.

287
00:13:41,514 --> 00:13:42,595
What's on your mind?

288
00:13:43,195 --> 00:13:44,034
Well, currently,

289
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,595
I'm just doing sales.

290
00:13:45,595 --> 00:13:47,075
A relevant major

291
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:49,034
would be marketing.

292
00:13:49,235 --> 00:13:50,754
I want to join adult education.

293
00:13:51,154 --> 00:13:52,634
It's not so easy to graduate

294
00:13:53,794 --> 00:13:55,235
from those programs.

295
00:13:55,715 --> 00:13:56,955
So I was thinking,

296
00:13:57,235 --> 00:13:59,274
even if I choose a major I like,

297
00:13:59,435 --> 00:14:01,034
the courses I'm weak in

298
00:14:01,034 --> 00:14:02,195
could still become

299
00:14:02,195 --> 00:14:03,195
obstacles, right?

300
00:14:03,595 --> 00:14:04,634
That's why I thought

301
00:14:04,634 --> 00:14:05,674
that maybe

302
00:14:06,195 --> 00:14:07,794
you could tutor me in math

303
00:14:07,794 --> 00:14:08,794
and help me catch up.

304
00:14:10,034 --> 00:14:11,514
Please don't say no.

305
00:14:11,514 --> 00:14:12,475
Please please.

306
00:14:12,595 --> 00:14:14,274
No one else will help me but you.

307
00:14:15,634 --> 00:14:17,355
I'm begging you.

308
00:14:17,355 --> 00:14:18,274
I'm begging you.

309
00:14:21,634 --> 00:14:22,674
- Please.
- Alright.

310
00:14:22,914 --> 00:14:23,955
But I might not

311
00:14:24,835 --> 00:14:25,794
be a good teacher.

312
00:14:25,955 --> 00:14:26,914
You'll be the best.

313
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:27,874
Mr. Yu, cheers.

314
00:14:31,075 --> 00:14:33,424
(Jingzhou Yuekang Hospital)

315
00:14:38,034 --> 00:14:39,274
Have some breakfast.

316
00:14:40,154 --> 00:14:41,195
Your brother will come

317
00:14:41,554 --> 00:14:42,914
after the meeting.

318
00:14:43,435 --> 00:14:44,154
He promised.

319
00:14:45,075 --> 00:14:46,835
And he visited last night.

320
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:49,634
He bought you this. You like it, huh?

321
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,235
Play later.

322
00:14:56,034 --> 00:14:57,394
Thank you, sis-in-law.

323
00:14:58,634 --> 00:14:59,634
You're welcome.

324
00:15:15,235 --> 00:15:15,835
Did...

325
00:15:18,514 --> 00:15:19,435
Did you just

326
00:15:20,475 --> 00:15:22,554
call me "sis-in-law"?

327
00:15:26,595 --> 00:15:27,394
Sis-in-law.

328
00:15:29,674 --> 00:15:30,394
Well,

329
00:15:30,754 --> 00:15:32,195
I was rude yesterday.

330
00:15:33,235 --> 00:15:34,075
Sorry about that.

331
00:15:42,794 --> 00:15:44,554
Good kid for admitting mistakes.

332
00:15:45,435 --> 00:15:46,355
You're forgiven.

333
00:15:46,674 --> 00:15:47,754
Sis-in-law forgives you.

334
00:15:54,794 --> 00:15:55,595
Want some soy milk?

335
00:15:58,674 --> 00:15:59,394
I-I'll do it.

336
00:16:03,355 --> 00:16:03,874
Wipe it.

337
00:16:05,914 --> 00:16:06,514
Hands.

338
00:16:14,355 --> 00:16:14,914
Sis-in-law.

339
00:16:16,634 --> 00:16:19,634
You said you could
keep me from going abroad.

340
00:16:20,034 --> 00:16:20,955
Is that true?

341
00:16:22,475 --> 00:16:23,554
Of course, it's true.

342
00:16:23,835 --> 00:16:24,674
Would I lie to you?

343
00:16:25,195 --> 00:16:27,274
But you must listen to me.

344
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:29,235
Okay.

345
00:16:30,595 --> 00:16:31,475
Have an egg.

346
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:36,715
What's wrong?

347
00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:41,674
Here.

348
00:16:56,075 --> 00:16:57,394
I've brought you the iPad.

349
00:16:57,794 --> 00:16:59,355
And I renewed your membership.

350
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:01,674
Let's go.

351
00:17:02,514 --> 00:17:03,274
Rest your eyes.

352
00:17:03,595 --> 00:17:04,834
Protect your eyesight.

353
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,915
Call me if you need anything.

354
00:17:06,915 --> 00:17:08,314
Yeah, we're leaving.

355
00:17:08,314 --> 00:17:09,514
- Dad...
- Yan, take care of him.

356
00:17:09,514 --> 00:17:10,554
- Dad...
- Call us.

357
00:17:10,554 --> 00:17:11,715
Mom, Dad.

358
00:17:11,955 --> 00:17:13,875
Wait a minute.

359
00:17:19,395 --> 00:17:21,354
What's wrong? Do you need something?

360
00:17:22,754 --> 00:17:25,235
Can you stay with Haochen today?

361
00:17:25,354 --> 00:17:26,195
We have meetings.

362
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:28,834
But Haochen is getting

363
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:30,235
even more upset.

364
00:17:30,314 --> 00:17:31,475
We must take it seriously.

365
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:32,955
Yeah, I've noticed.

366
00:17:33,034 --> 00:17:34,475
We're making time to visit him.

367
00:17:34,715 --> 00:17:36,554
We brought his iPad, but that kid barely

368
00:17:36,554 --> 00:17:37,155
speaks to us.

369
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:38,074
Kids are rebellious

370
00:17:38,074 --> 00:17:39,475
- during puberty.
- Yeah.

371
00:17:41,114 --> 00:17:41,794
Take a look

372
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:42,754
at Haochen's drawing.

373
00:17:45,715 --> 00:17:47,514
- What's this?
- My Mom and Dad.

374
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:48,754
(My Mom and Dad)
Well done.

375
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,435
Our heads are smartphones.

376
00:17:50,915 --> 00:17:53,235
Our child has remarkable creativity.

377
00:17:53,354 --> 00:17:55,475
I'd give him five stars
if I were his art teacher.

378
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:57,754
This is what Haochen thinks of you.

379
00:17:58,074 --> 00:18:00,114
This is Haochen

380
00:18:00,114 --> 00:18:01,114
when he's alone.

381
00:18:02,155 --> 00:18:02,834
Is this healthy?

382
00:18:07,235 --> 00:18:08,915
He has always lacked companionship.

383
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,875
The person who spent
the most time with him

384
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:12,915
was the nanny.

385
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:16,915
You're busy. Haoming's busy.

386
00:18:17,594 --> 00:18:18,915
You spent more time

387
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:20,915
on your phones than with Haochen.

388
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,834
He does have many years ahead of him.

389
00:18:25,554 --> 00:18:26,715
But childhood is short.

390
00:18:27,635 --> 00:18:28,594
Haochen doesn't really

391
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,554
want his iPad or smartphone.

392
00:18:31,114 --> 00:18:32,554
He wants what's most precious

393
00:18:32,554 --> 00:18:33,594
to you.

394
00:18:34,754 --> 00:18:35,554
Your time.

395
00:18:46,794 --> 00:18:48,554
So I'm asking you to stay

396
00:18:50,314 --> 00:18:53,195
and keep him company

397
00:18:55,675 --> 00:18:56,435
for just one day.

398
00:19:01,635 --> 00:19:03,754
Mom, Dad, Haochen, food is ready.

399
00:19:04,274 --> 00:19:04,875
Go ahead.

400
00:19:05,554 --> 00:19:06,354
Yeah, go ahead.

401
00:19:06,435 --> 00:19:07,554
We're watching the match.

402
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:10,794
A pity, huh?

403
00:19:12,114 --> 00:19:13,034
One question for you.

404
00:19:14,435 --> 00:19:16,155
Why did I make you learn equestrian?

405
00:19:20,475 --> 00:19:21,155
You know what?

406
00:19:22,114 --> 00:19:23,955
I've chosen an excellent school for you.

407
00:19:24,314 --> 00:19:26,475
This school offers eleven sports.

408
00:19:26,475 --> 00:19:28,395
Equestrian ranks first.

409
00:19:28,395 --> 00:19:30,435
Equestrian is a graceful sport.

410
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:32,104
If you master equestrian skills

411
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,475
before entering this school,

412
00:19:33,475 --> 00:19:35,114
you've already gained an advantage.

413
00:19:37,675 --> 00:19:38,155
Have it.

414
00:19:45,034 --> 00:19:45,715
Thank you.

415
00:20:22,675 --> 00:20:24,395
I won't drive you back today.

416
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:26,514
Okay.

417
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:30,155
It's red, your favorite.

418
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:31,435
It's for you.

419
00:20:32,514 --> 00:20:33,354
Why?

420
00:20:34,554 --> 00:20:35,594
To congratulate you.

421
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:39,514
Your financial news broadcasts
have been so well-received this week.

422
00:20:40,314 --> 00:20:41,554
Given your current status,

423
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,675
having a car makes a statement.

424
00:20:44,195 --> 00:20:44,915
Also,

425
00:20:45,715 --> 00:20:47,114
Haochen has been spoiled

426
00:20:47,554 --> 00:20:48,875
ever since he was born.

427
00:20:49,235 --> 00:20:50,114
His temper

428
00:20:50,114 --> 00:20:51,195
grew worse and worse.

429
00:20:51,554 --> 00:20:53,195
Even the formidable Ms. Yu

430
00:20:53,514 --> 00:20:54,395
couldn't handle him.

431
00:20:55,155 --> 00:20:56,235
I never expected

432
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:58,675
you'd get along so well with him.

433
00:20:59,435 --> 00:21:00,594
I can sense that

434
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:02,314
he genuinely likes you.

435
00:21:02,715 --> 00:21:04,155
And he got badly injured.

436
00:21:04,794 --> 00:21:06,114
He's been discharged early

437
00:21:06,554 --> 00:21:07,754
thanks to you.

438
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,314
Haochen is your brother.

439
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:11,675
We're family.

440
00:21:11,955 --> 00:21:13,314
It's only natural for us

441
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:14,675
to care for each other.

442
00:21:14,754 --> 00:21:16,034
You don't have to buy me gifts

443
00:21:16,034 --> 00:21:17,594
whenever I do something.

444
00:21:17,594 --> 00:21:18,794
You've done a great job.

445
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:21,114
You deserve a reward.

446
00:21:21,955 --> 00:21:23,554
Because I appreciate it.

447
00:21:24,594 --> 00:21:25,915
You're a typical boss.

448
00:21:26,554 --> 00:21:27,675
Your expression of emotions

449
00:21:27,675 --> 00:21:28,794
has become transactional.

450
00:21:29,715 --> 00:21:30,754
I just want to give you

451
00:21:31,314 --> 00:21:32,514
the life you want.

452
00:21:34,514 --> 00:21:36,235
You are all I want.

453
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,314
See you.

454
00:21:59,794 --> 00:22:00,435
(Zhou Zeyuan)
(Let's meet.)

455
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:10,314
These are my company's

456
00:22:10,314 --> 00:22:11,514
financial reports.

457
00:22:12,794 --> 00:22:14,754
Here are the ongoing

458
00:22:14,754 --> 00:22:15,514
(Projects)
R&D Projects.

459
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,435
Here's the project proposal.

460
00:22:19,195 --> 00:22:19,834
All here.

461
00:22:32,754 --> 00:22:33,594
I came to tell you

462
00:22:33,594 --> 00:22:34,715
that your collaboration

463
00:22:36,675 --> 00:22:37,915
with my husband

464
00:22:37,955 --> 00:22:38,915
won't happen.

465
00:22:43,354 --> 00:22:43,995
Why not?

466
00:22:44,274 --> 00:22:45,435
I work in journalism

467
00:22:45,794 --> 00:22:47,395
and conduct investigations.

468
00:22:47,955 --> 00:22:49,074
All your employees here

469
00:22:49,114 --> 00:22:50,395
are hired actors.

470
00:22:51,794 --> 00:22:54,034
This whole company is just a front

471
00:22:54,995 --> 00:22:57,395
to scam money from investors.

472
00:22:58,034 --> 00:22:59,034
So I'm sure

473
00:22:59,915 --> 00:23:01,995
you don't have any real operations.

474
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,715
I'm not surprised

475
00:23:08,715 --> 00:23:11,955
you saw through this.
You know better about

476
00:23:12,354 --> 00:23:13,314
hiring actors.

477
00:23:20,195 --> 00:23:20,955
What do you mean?

478
00:23:21,395 --> 00:23:23,955
Your parents aren't actually abroad.

479
00:23:24,314 --> 00:23:25,955
They live in a small town.

480
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:27,955
When they came

481
00:23:27,955 --> 00:23:29,155
to visit you in Jingzhou,

482
00:23:29,155 --> 00:23:30,195
you treated them coldly.

483
00:23:30,235 --> 00:23:31,195
They left quickly.

484
00:23:31,635 --> 00:23:33,594
I met them briefly then.

485
00:23:33,794 --> 00:23:34,875
I don't have many strengths

486
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,274
except a good memory.

487
00:23:39,314 --> 00:23:40,715
Don't bother forming

488
00:23:40,715 --> 00:23:41,594
a strategy.

489
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:43,114
I never intended

490
00:23:43,114 --> 00:23:44,114
to destroy

491
00:23:44,114 --> 00:23:45,794
what you've achieved.

492
00:23:46,195 --> 00:23:47,554
My company needs funding.

493
00:23:47,554 --> 00:23:48,915
You married into wealth.

494
00:23:49,034 --> 00:23:49,834
Helping me

495
00:23:50,074 --> 00:23:52,114
would be effortless for you.

496
00:24:04,034 --> 00:24:04,635
Zeyuan,

497
00:24:05,554 --> 00:24:06,514
I still remember

498
00:24:06,834 --> 00:24:07,875
that you told me

499
00:24:07,915 --> 00:24:09,834
to be honest on resumes

500
00:24:11,195 --> 00:24:11,875
and that I must

501
00:24:12,794 --> 00:24:13,955
walk in the light.

502
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:18,395
So I don't understand

503
00:24:19,235 --> 00:24:20,314
why you've become

504
00:24:20,314 --> 00:24:21,314
like this now.

505
00:24:22,435 --> 00:24:23,594
Then why did you hide

506
00:24:23,594 --> 00:24:25,034
your family background?

507
00:24:26,155 --> 00:24:27,034
Why would you

508
00:24:27,034 --> 00:24:28,195
hide your real parents

509
00:24:28,195 --> 00:24:29,274
in the dark?

510
00:24:29,395 --> 00:24:30,435
I saw your wedding photo

511
00:24:30,514 --> 00:24:31,635
at Ms. Ma's place.

512
00:24:31,675 --> 00:24:33,034
Those fake parents of yours

513
00:24:34,114 --> 00:24:35,995
do look like educated elites.

514
00:24:36,354 --> 00:24:37,195
But I get it.

515
00:24:37,675 --> 00:24:39,514
Without these glamorous facades,

516
00:24:39,514 --> 00:24:41,195
every step we take would be harder.

517
00:24:41,715 --> 00:24:42,635
We've both struggled.

518
00:24:43,435 --> 00:24:44,715
I bet you know this.

519
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:45,675
No matter how hard

520
00:24:45,675 --> 00:24:46,834
you try, some things

521
00:24:46,834 --> 00:24:47,675
don't change.

522
00:24:47,955 --> 00:24:49,514
Those of us who come from nothing

523
00:24:49,514 --> 00:24:50,754
need to dress ourselves

524
00:24:50,754 --> 00:24:51,675
in noble disguises.

525
00:24:58,195 --> 00:24:59,514
Since we're the same,

526
00:25:00,514 --> 00:25:02,235
let's help each other.

527
00:25:27,114 --> 00:25:27,635
Yan.

528
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:32,034
You're finally back.

529
00:25:32,314 --> 00:25:33,074
What's wrong, Mom?

530
00:25:33,314 --> 00:25:35,314
Haochen's birthday is early next month.

531
00:25:35,314 --> 00:25:36,875
How should we celebrate it?

532
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:39,155
You can decide.

533
00:25:39,554 --> 00:25:41,395
I asked him, but he wouldn't talk.

534
00:25:41,475 --> 00:25:42,754
I can't handle this kid.

535
00:25:42,955 --> 00:25:45,235
He likes you. He'll like
whatever you do for him.

536
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:48,794
Let me think.

537
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:52,715
Ms. Ma is bringing a friend tomorrow.

538
00:25:53,034 --> 00:25:53,995
She's so picky.

539
00:25:54,034 --> 00:25:54,875
I have no idea

540
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:56,435
what to cook for her.

541
00:25:56,834 --> 00:25:57,435
Help me.

542
00:25:59,594 --> 00:26:01,155
Ms. Ma likes shrimp.

543
00:26:01,475 --> 00:26:02,754
Maybe I'll make her

544
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:04,314
shrimp with black truffle oil.

545
00:26:04,955 --> 00:26:05,514
- How's that?
- Perfect.

546
00:26:05,675 --> 00:26:06,875
And she's dieting.

547
00:26:07,395 --> 00:26:08,875
I'll keep the dishes low-calorie.

548
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:09,514
Rest assured.

549
00:26:09,794 --> 00:26:11,435
I know I can count on you.

550
00:26:12,514 --> 00:26:14,354
Hui said she needs you in the kitchen.

551
00:26:15,235 --> 00:26:16,514
- I'll go then.
- Go ahead.

552
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:23,435
- What's wrong, Hui?
- Yan.

553
00:26:23,995 --> 00:26:25,955
How should I cook these tonight?

554
00:26:27,995 --> 00:26:29,395
Steam the rainbow trout.

555
00:26:29,514 --> 00:26:30,754
Haochen has been coughing.

556
00:26:31,034 --> 00:26:32,875
Skip the seafood. It's inflammatory.

557
00:26:32,955 --> 00:26:34,875
Replace them with vegetarian dishes.

558
00:26:35,235 --> 00:26:35,635
Okay.

559
00:26:36,475 --> 00:26:38,594
Did the fruits I ordered arrive?

560
00:26:39,114 --> 00:26:40,554
I washed and refrigerated them.

561
00:26:40,594 --> 00:26:42,074
Alright, I'm heading back then.

562
00:26:42,235 --> 00:26:42,834
Yan.

563
00:26:45,074 --> 00:26:46,594
I may need a day off tomorrow

564
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:48,235
for personal matters.

565
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,875
But Ms. Yu needs help
hosting guests tomorrow.

566
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:53,114
Go ahead. I'll handle it.

567
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:54,754
Really?

568
00:26:55,995 --> 00:26:57,794
With you here, I'm completely at ease.

569
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,195
They all love your cooking.

570
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:03,395
Only because you help me.

571
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:06,554
Yan.

572
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:08,955
You seem

573
00:27:08,955 --> 00:27:10,274
different from before.

574
00:27:12,915 --> 00:27:13,754
How so?

575
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:15,955
Now, you look

576
00:27:16,195 --> 00:27:17,754

(Jingzhou Yuekang Hospital)

581
00:27:32,794 --> 00:27:34,594
You want to take on patient No. 38's

582
00:27:34,594 --> 00:27:36,195
spine correction surgery?

583
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:37,074
Yes, sir.

584
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,235
Type 1 neurofibromatosis with scoliosis.

585
00:27:40,635 --> 00:27:42,715
This surgery requires extreme precision.

586
00:27:43,155 --> 00:27:46,435
Any mistake could cause
lifelong paralysis.

587
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:48,475
And the patient's young.

588
00:27:48,915 --> 00:27:49,834
It's very challenging.

589
00:27:50,195 --> 00:27:50,995
I understand.

590
00:27:51,554 --> 00:27:52,514
My plan is to conduct

591
00:27:53,435 --> 00:27:54,435
multiple staged surgeries

592
00:27:55,034 --> 00:27:56,754
to minimize risks.

593
00:27:57,155 --> 00:27:57,675
Of course,

594
00:27:58,114 --> 00:27:58,995
we'll monitor

595
00:27:58,995 --> 00:28:01,235
the patient's tolerance responses

596
00:28:01,395 --> 00:28:02,475
during the operation.

597
00:28:03,155 --> 00:28:04,155
Of course, I know

598
00:28:04,235 --> 00:28:05,314
the family has concerns.

599
00:28:05,955 --> 00:28:07,834
We'll handle
pre-op communication carefully.

600
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:08,354
Okay.

601
00:28:09,074 --> 00:28:10,235
Your suggestions are noted.

602
00:28:10,995 --> 00:28:14,195
I'll discuss with the higher-ups.

603
00:28:15,435 --> 00:28:15,915
Alright.

604
00:28:18,475 --> 00:28:19,314
Thank you, sir.

605
00:28:31,155 --> 00:28:32,354
This is a bit spicy.

606
00:28:32,514 --> 00:28:33,395
Not at all.

607
00:28:33,435 --> 00:28:34,395
It's amazing.

608
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:35,195
Skewers.

609
00:28:35,635 --> 00:28:37,114
Have it while it's hot.

610
00:28:37,235 --> 00:28:38,715
Super crispy. That's why we came.

611
00:28:38,715 --> 00:28:39,074
Okay.

612
00:28:39,395 --> 00:28:40,514
Smells great.

613
00:28:42,314 --> 00:28:42,995
What's her deal?

614
00:28:50,114 --> 00:28:50,955
What's wrong?

615
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:53,034
Why are you silent?

616
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:54,834
You ordered this. Won't you eat?

617
00:28:55,274 --> 00:28:56,074
This is good.

618
00:28:58,395 --> 00:29:00,114
Dig in. Don't just watch me.

619
00:29:00,354 --> 00:29:01,834
I shouldn't. I'm on a diet.

620
00:29:02,114 --> 00:29:03,114
That's too much.

621
00:29:04,274 --> 00:29:05,955
I'll gain 500 grams tomorrow.

622
00:29:06,915 --> 00:29:08,314
Dig in. I'll be right back.

623
00:29:11,915 --> 00:29:12,594
Yu Yiming.

624
00:29:13,594 --> 00:29:14,475
You're alone?

625
00:29:15,195 --> 00:29:15,875
Why are you here?

626
00:29:16,395 --> 00:29:17,155
I came with my...

627
00:29:19,114 --> 00:29:21,475
I'm just getting some skewers to go.

628
00:29:24,635 --> 00:29:25,155
I...

629
00:29:26,395 --> 00:29:27,715
I've never seen you drink.

630
00:29:28,514 --> 00:29:29,995
I avoided drinking because of work.

631
00:29:30,915 --> 00:29:32,915
Fine. Let me join you.
Waiter. A dozen beers.

632
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:35,314
Mind your head. Oh my.

633
00:29:44,155 --> 00:29:44,635
Here.

634
00:29:46,435 --> 00:29:47,514
Have some water.

635
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:47,314
Well...

636
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:49,354
I bought you breakfast.

637
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:01,395
I overdrank because I was

638
00:31:02,074 --> 00:31:03,554
overwhelmed with the surgery.

639
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:07,314
I do remember what happened

640
00:31:08,514 --> 00:31:09,395
afterward.

641
00:31:17,514 --> 00:31:19,475
You should have told me.

642
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:20,514
Forget about it.

643
00:31:22,554 --> 00:31:23,754
N-Nothing happened.

644
00:31:24,314 --> 00:31:24,834
Right?

645
00:31:25,715 --> 00:31:27,074
You're pretty heavy, by the way.

646
00:31:27,074 --> 00:31:28,554
Carrying you was exhausting.

647
00:31:28,995 --> 00:31:30,514
Yeah, sorry about that.

648
00:31:31,635 --> 00:31:32,594
It won't happen again.

649
00:31:32,635 --> 00:31:33,675
It's fine. It can happen.

650
00:31:36,114 --> 00:31:36,955
No, no.

651
00:31:37,834 --> 00:31:38,834
That's not what I meant.

652
00:31:39,395 --> 00:31:41,114
You're under too much stress.

653
00:31:41,114 --> 00:31:42,354
Letting loose occasionally

654
00:31:42,354 --> 00:31:43,915
is actually good for you.

655
00:31:47,195 --> 00:31:48,195
This is good.

656
00:31:48,635 --> 00:31:48,995
Yeah.

657
00:31:49,328 --> 00:31:50,896
Have you spoken to your sister lately?

658
00:31:51,514 --> 00:31:52,114
No.

659
00:31:52,834 --> 00:31:54,155
She's happy that you're attending

660
00:31:54,314 --> 00:31:55,114
adult college.

661
00:31:58,155 --> 00:32:01,074
You've been updating her about me?

662
00:32:02,395 --> 00:32:03,875
She asked me to look after you.

663
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:06,955
She could've told me herself.

664
00:32:09,195 --> 00:32:10,995
You're quite similar.

665
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:12,235
Both stubborn.

666
00:32:12,834 --> 00:32:14,314
You care about each other,

667
00:32:14,955 --> 00:32:16,715
but can't sit down for a proper talk.

668
00:32:19,635 --> 00:32:22,395
I wish you could open up
to each other someday,

669
00:32:22,715 --> 00:32:23,888
without a messenger like me.

670
00:32:26,114 --> 00:32:27,195
It doesn't matter.

671
00:32:29,834 --> 00:32:30,514
Spin.

672
00:32:30,514 --> 00:32:31,314
Hide.

673
00:32:31,475 --> 00:32:32,114
Run.

674
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:33,915
Can't find it.

675
00:32:33,915 --> 00:32:34,435
Nice.

676
00:32:34,594 --> 00:32:35,875
You ruined my dress.

677
00:32:36,274 --> 00:32:37,074
Bu. Sweetie.

678
00:32:37,074 --> 00:32:37,475
Fetch.

679
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:39,435
Where is it?

680
00:32:40,114 --> 00:32:41,955
Ms. Yu is really nice.

681
00:32:43,794 --> 00:32:44,475
Well done.

682
00:32:45,514 --> 00:32:46,114
Come here.

683
00:32:46,354 --> 00:32:47,155
Ms. Yu.

684
00:32:48,514 --> 00:32:49,155
Tianzi.

685
00:32:49,354 --> 00:32:50,314
What took you so long?

686
00:32:52,715 --> 00:32:53,875
We've been waiting forever.

687
00:32:54,314 --> 00:32:55,240
I'm slow getting ready.

688
00:32:55,354 --> 00:32:57,314
Ms. Yu, meet my friend.

689
00:32:57,915 --> 00:32:59,354
Zhou Zeyuan, Mr. Zhou.

690
00:32:59,675 --> 00:33:01,034
He's a rising star in tech.

691
00:33:01,635 --> 00:33:02,915
- Hello, Ms. Yu.
- Hello.

692
00:33:03,034 --> 00:33:04,395
Ms. Ma speaks highly of you.

693
00:33:04,834 --> 00:33:05,794
Just call me Randy.

694
00:33:05,995 --> 00:33:06,514
Randy.

695
00:33:07,955 --> 00:33:08,875
This is

696
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,354
Ms. Yu's daughter-in-law, Xu Yan.

697
00:33:12,034 --> 00:33:12,715
Ms. Ma.

698
00:33:13,274 --> 00:33:13,715
Hello.

699
00:33:13,995 --> 00:33:15,514
Hello, Miss Xu.

700
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:17,675
Hello.

701
00:33:19,074 --> 00:33:20,114
Let's sit over there.

702
00:33:22,074 --> 00:33:23,034
I prepared

703
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:23,995
your favorite tea.

704
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:25,794
Thank you, Ms. Yu.

705
00:33:26,475 --> 00:33:28,235
No wonder you won't hang out with me.

706
00:33:28,314 --> 00:33:30,354
You prefer a younger company now.

707
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:34,074
You know me best, Ms. Yu.

708
00:33:34,155 --> 00:33:35,274
I just love

709
00:33:35,635 --> 00:33:36,594
supporting

710
00:33:36,594 --> 00:33:37,754
young entrepreneurs.

711
00:33:38,395 --> 00:33:41,675
I met Randy at the venture forum,
and we hit it off.

712
00:33:42,034 --> 00:33:43,834
So I'm introducing him to you.

713
00:33:44,754 --> 00:33:47,155
Randy, what exactly do you do?

714
00:33:48,034 --> 00:33:48,475
Ms. Yu,

715
00:33:48,915 --> 00:33:50,314
I work in new medical tech.

716
00:33:50,794 --> 00:33:52,915
I empower medical systems

717
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:53,995
with cutting-edge tech,

718
00:33:54,554 --> 00:33:56,034
making healthcare accessible

719
00:33:56,274 --> 00:33:57,915
and streamlining doctors' work.

720
00:33:58,635 --> 00:33:59,155
Ms. Yu,

721
00:33:59,514 --> 00:34:01,794
this is the hottest field now.

722
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:03,395
Young people today

723
00:34:03,594 --> 00:34:04,635
have talent

724
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:05,675
and drive.

725
00:34:05,915 --> 00:34:07,715
They just need resources and chances.

726
00:34:08,435 --> 00:34:09,714
Supporting them

727
00:34:09,795 --> 00:34:10,875
benefits us too.

728
00:34:10,995 --> 00:34:12,514
It's a win-win.

729
00:34:19,714 --> 00:34:20,275
Ms. Yu,

730
00:34:21,074 --> 00:34:22,594
if I'm not mistaken,

731
00:34:22,714 --> 00:34:24,234
your outfit is from

732
00:34:24,475 --> 00:34:25,714
that famous Italian designer,

733
00:34:25,714 --> 00:34:26,915
Maygeogin, right?

734
00:34:27,275 --> 00:34:30,315
Yeah, it's the new model
they just released this year.

735
00:34:30,594 --> 00:34:33,594
This designer debuted recently
and is still niche.

736
00:34:33,915 --> 00:34:35,234
Few people know about her.

737
00:34:36,395 --> 00:34:37,514
How could you tell?

738
00:34:38,475 --> 00:34:39,995
She held a fashion show in New York

739
00:34:40,034 --> 00:34:41,154
when she graduated

740
00:34:41,435 --> 00:34:42,435
from Parsons,

741
00:34:42,435 --> 00:34:43,514
and we met there.

742
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:45,875
Her works have a strong and impressive

743
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:46,955
personal style.

744
00:34:48,114 --> 00:34:50,275
I thought people in tech
and the internet industries

745
00:34:50,275 --> 00:34:52,114
weren't that interested in fashion.

746
00:34:52,594 --> 00:34:54,074
But you're a connoisseur.

747
00:34:56,714 --> 00:34:58,514
Mom, I'll get some hot water.

748
00:34:58,674 --> 00:34:59,755
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

749
00:34:59,755 --> 00:35:00,554
Take your time.

750
00:35:04,355 --> 00:35:05,435
You know, Ms. Yu.

751
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:07,475
Randy mainly works on tech,

752
00:35:07,594 --> 00:35:09,634
but he has great connections.

753
00:35:09,634 --> 00:35:10,795
He has many friends from

754
00:35:10,795 --> 00:35:12,074
the fashion and art circles.

755
00:35:12,234 --> 00:35:14,194
His taste is impeccable.

756
00:35:19,154 --> 00:35:19,755
Miss Xu.

757
00:35:21,194 --> 00:35:22,674
Where's the restroom?

758
00:35:36,915 --> 00:35:38,514
Should I discuss with you

759
00:35:39,755 --> 00:35:41,234
or your mother-in-law

760
00:35:43,514 --> 00:35:44,674
about the investment?

761
00:35:45,634 --> 00:35:46,475
Zhou Zeyuan.

762
00:35:51,755 --> 00:35:52,475
Randy.

763
00:35:54,114 --> 00:35:55,234
You're being naive.

764
00:35:55,795 --> 00:35:57,154
Your business proposal

765
00:35:57,634 --> 00:35:58,795
and financial statements

766
00:35:59,194 --> 00:36:00,154
can't fool

767
00:36:00,154 --> 00:36:01,114
my mother-in-law

768
00:36:02,154 --> 00:36:03,275
or my husband.

769
00:36:04,674 --> 00:36:06,074
Forget about getting investment.

770
00:36:08,315 --> 00:36:09,835
Whether he invests

771
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:11,395
depends on how well you whisper

772
00:36:11,395 --> 00:36:12,435
in his ear.

773
00:36:13,835 --> 00:36:17,074
Besides, I'm only asking for
a tiny investment from him.

774
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,674
He won't care about it.

775
00:36:19,435 --> 00:36:20,114
What do you mean?

776
00:36:20,955 --> 00:36:21,875
In this circle,

777
00:36:22,114 --> 00:36:23,355
how much you get

778
00:36:23,554 --> 00:36:25,114
isn't as important as

779
00:36:25,114 --> 00:36:26,034
who you get it from.

780
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:27,955
A hundred thousand from a tycoon

781
00:36:28,194 --> 00:36:29,594
is more valuable than

782
00:36:29,594 --> 00:36:31,674
five million from some island chief.

783
00:36:31,995 --> 00:36:33,755
For other investors,

784
00:36:33,995 --> 00:36:35,435
who back you up

785
00:36:35,435 --> 00:36:36,594
and endorse you,

786
00:36:36,755 --> 00:36:37,875
is their primary criterion

787
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:39,714
to judge your potential.

788
00:36:40,315 --> 00:36:41,714
That's why I never intended

789
00:36:41,714 --> 00:36:42,714
to have your husband

790
00:36:42,795 --> 00:36:44,154
make big investments.

791
00:36:46,275 --> 00:36:47,634
You want to use his reputation

792
00:36:47,634 --> 00:36:49,475
to attract more money, right?

793
00:36:55,435 --> 00:36:56,714
It just hit me

794
00:36:57,755 --> 00:36:58,995
how incredibly attractive

795
00:37:01,435 --> 00:37:02,755
intelligent women look.

796
00:37:02,755 --> 00:37:03,755
You're disgusting.

797
00:37:04,674 --> 00:37:06,034
Let me make it clear.

798
00:37:06,995 --> 00:37:07,594
No.

799
00:37:08,835 --> 00:37:09,755
Xu Yan, you...

800
00:37:12,755 --> 00:37:13,514
Qiao Yan.

801
00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:16,234
This name makes us closer, doesn't it?

802
00:37:16,795 --> 00:37:17,995
Don't tell me that

803
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:19,355
you genuinely

804
00:37:19,355 --> 00:37:20,594
love Shen Haoming,

805
00:37:20,634 --> 00:37:23,114
not his money, status,

806
00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:24,514
or his family's influence.

807
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:32,795
I don't owe you explanations.

808
00:37:33,234 --> 00:37:34,275
But you should know

809
00:37:35,634 --> 00:37:36,835
everything you're doing now

810
00:37:36,835 --> 00:37:38,475
is extortion and illegal.

811
00:37:39,315 --> 00:37:39,995
Qiao Yan.

812
00:37:40,795 --> 00:37:42,995
It's fascinating how much you're trying

813
00:37:43,034 --> 00:37:44,114
to protect Shen Haoming.

814
00:37:44,355 --> 00:37:46,034
You're actually love-struck.

815
00:37:46,634 --> 00:37:48,435
Let me tell you
the most ridiculous story

816
00:37:48,514 --> 00:37:49,795
I've heard this year.

817
00:37:50,154 --> 00:37:51,955
A common scammer married into wealth

818
00:37:51,955 --> 00:37:52,875
not for money,

819
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:54,475
but for true love.

820
00:37:54,795 --> 00:37:56,915
Isn't this more absurd
than fairy tales...?

821
00:38:07,594 --> 00:38:08,875
Thankfully, it's not burning.

822
00:38:11,234 --> 00:38:12,112
The dry-cleaning bill

823
00:38:13,475 --> 00:38:14,714
is included in the investment.

824
00:38:20,074 --> 00:38:21,034
So smart.

825
00:38:21,034 --> 00:38:22,395
Unbelievable.

826
00:38:22,395 --> 00:38:23,714
Ms. Yu, really,

827
00:38:24,034 --> 00:38:26,194
you've even trained Bu so well.

828
00:38:26,795 --> 00:38:28,275
You're amazing.

829
00:38:28,275 --> 00:38:29,355
I'm so clumsy.

830
00:38:29,755 --> 00:38:31,034
I splashed water everywhere

831
00:38:31,034 --> 00:38:32,275
when I washed my hands.

832
00:38:34,034 --> 00:38:35,315
You're hilarious.

833
00:38:35,395 --> 00:38:36,315
It's okay.

834
00:38:36,435 --> 00:38:37,594
I'll have Yan bring

835
00:38:37,594 --> 00:38:38,835
Haoming's clothes.

836
00:38:38,835 --> 00:38:39,955
You can wear those.

837
00:38:40,355 --> 00:38:42,435
- Sorry for the trouble.
- Don't mention it.

838
00:38:42,594 --> 00:38:44,034
Is Ms. Yu's faucet at home

839
00:38:44,034 --> 00:38:45,634
too high-tech for you?

840
00:38:45,835 --> 00:38:47,554
It's different from mine.

841
00:38:47,634 --> 00:38:48,634
I got confused.

842
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:49,634
No worries.

843
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:04,835
- It's alright.
- Okay, Mr. Shen.

844
00:39:19,475 --> 00:39:20,034
Xu Yan.

845
00:39:20,514 --> 00:39:22,275
Sorry. The traffic was terrible.

846
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,874
Mr. Shen, nice to meet you.

847
00:39:28,874 --> 00:39:30,835
I'm Zhou Zeyuan, Xu Yan's friend.

848
00:39:32,674 --> 00:39:33,360
Hello.

849
00:39:34,034 --> 00:39:35,074
Are you dining here too?

850
00:39:35,355 --> 00:39:36,594
Didn't Xu Yan inform you?

851
00:39:36,755 --> 00:39:37,875
She invited me here.

852
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:47,915
I've been swamped

853
00:39:47,955 --> 00:39:48,955
and forgot to tell you.

854
00:39:49,808 --> 00:39:50,640
It's okay.

855
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:52,275
She said you'd be

856
00:39:52,275 --> 00:39:53,395
having lunch here.

857
00:39:53,674 --> 00:39:55,795
- So she invited me over.
- Okay.

858
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:57,594
Mr. Shen, the dishes are ready.

859
00:39:58,915 --> 00:40:00,395
- An extra table setting.
- Yes, sir.
