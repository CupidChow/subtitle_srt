Distinguished leaders and guests,

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,641
good day.

30
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:50,401
(Strategic Cooperation Signing Ceremony)
This is the venue

31
00:01:50,481 --> 00:01:53,080
for Jinda Group and Shifeng Group's
strategic cooperation signing.

32
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:56,281
First, let's give
a warm round of applause

33
00:01:56,401 --> 00:01:58,921
to extend our most sincere welcome
to all the leaders

34
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,841
and guests present here today.

35
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,041
Welcome!

36
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,041
Alright,

37
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,081
now please welcome
the two representatives to the stage.

38
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:13,320
Mr. Shen Jinsong,
Chairman of Jinda Group,

39
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:16,200
and Mr. Zheng Yuanzhou,
Chairman of Shifeng Group,

40
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:17,801
please come forward to sign.

41
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:18,681
Applause please.

42
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:27,801
Very well.

43
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,640
Both representatives,
please hold the ceremonial pens.

44
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,241
Three, two, one.

45
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,961
Please sign the documents.

46
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,600
Hold on!

47
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
A moment if I may.

48
00:02:45,561 --> 00:02:46,200
Zheng Yuanzhou,

49
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:48,480
during Shifeng Group's board election,

50
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,640
you unlawfully
obtained votes and benefits

51
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,801
through bribery, etc.

52
00:02:52,121 --> 00:02:53,801
Your actions
constitute suspected bribery.

53
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:56,480
Here is the warrant.

54
00:02:57,681 --> 00:02:58,320
Read it.

55
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,880
Come with us for investigation.

56
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:01,801
Cuff him.

57
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,640
Step aside.

58
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,841
Step aside.

59
00:03:15,841 --> 00:03:16,561
Please make way.

60
00:03:20,144 --> 00:03:21,509
(Shen)

61
00:03:22,681 --> 00:03:23,160
Mr. Shen,

62
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,241
the news of our impending cooperation
with Shifeng was released early.

63
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,361
When Mr. Zheng's scandal broke,

64
00:03:28,561 --> 00:03:30,681
our stock price started plummeting
at market open.

65
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:32,961
If there's no recovery by tomorrow,

66
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,920
shareholders will likely
convene an emergency board meeting.

67
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:39,320
I see.

68
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,320
Mr. Shen.

69
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:44,920
Dad.

70
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:45,681
Don't call me.

71
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:47,920
Go home.

72
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:53,640
I came to report something important.

73
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,561
Zheng Yuanzhou's
bribery-fueled chairmanship election

74
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:00,640
has destroyed his reputation.

75
00:04:01,081 --> 00:04:03,160
Shifeng Group
can't escape the fallout either.

76
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,920
Several agreed-upon projects

77
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:08,040
are now facing withdrawal
from key partners.

78
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,920
I've decided to collaborate with Shouke

79
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,681
to reclaim those projects.

80
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,081
That's preposterous!

81
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:15,841
What's the point of that?

82
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:16,960
We have no land.

83
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,200
Shouke and I secured it

84
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,400
through bidding.

85
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:24,801
Land acquisition requires funds.

86
00:04:25,121 --> 00:04:26,320
Where's your money?

87
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,001
Yuanhang Fund.

88
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:29,520
Yuanhang?

89
00:04:33,921 --> 00:04:35,041
These people and affairs

90
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:38,280
couldn't have been achieved overnight.

91
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:42,681
Unless you had a long-term,
meticulous plan

92
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,241
already in motion.

93
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,601
Even with such a plan,

94
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,080
if Zheng hadn't imploded,

95
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,840
it couldn't have been executed.

96
00:04:57,921 --> 00:04:59,440
You knew Zheng's downfall?

97
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,320
Dad, I warned you before.

98
00:05:03,361 --> 00:05:04,161
You forgot.

99
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,161
Zheng Yuanzhou has three confidants.

100
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,200
The last-ranked one is the most capable.

101
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:11,601
He overworked

102
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,200
but didn't gain enough credit
for a long time.

103
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:15,840
Resentment was inevitable.

104
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:20,520
Wait.

105
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,640
Let me confirm.

106
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,361
You're implying

107
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,840
that you orchestrated Zheng's downfall?

108
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:30,121
Certain truths should remain
between father and son.

109
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,880
Hold on.

110
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,681
Move over there.

111
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,481
Tell me.

112
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:39,241
How did you secure that man's loyalty?

113
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,440
During my London internship,

114
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,041
I flew back five times.

115
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:46,520
He avoided me each time.

116
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,161
On the sixth attempt, he met me.

117
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,161
We immediately aligned.

118
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:52,960
All terms were agreed upon.

119
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,640
I emphasized three points:

120
00:05:57,921 --> 00:05:58,640
recognition,

121
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,280
sincerity,

122
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,601
and benefits.

123
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:05,241
I showed him my character
and convinced him

124
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,960
that when I pursue goals,

125
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,400
I spare no effort to achieve them.

126
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,041
Dad,

127
00:06:24,721 --> 00:06:27,520
I know you've never wanted me
involved in the projects.

128
00:06:28,361 --> 00:06:32,520
I can now publicly announce the news
about our cooperation with Shouke

129
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,640
and use the company's
stock price recovery

130
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,400
to reassure shareholders.

131
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,121
Or I can leave Jinda

132
00:06:40,001 --> 00:06:41,200
and work with Shouke alone.

133
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,001
Tell me your conditions.

134
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:49,200
First,

135
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,200
I need to bring my own people
into the company.

136
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,640
Whatever department they go,

137
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,561
I want your decisive vote
supporting my choices.

138
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,320
Second,

139
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,280
I need to establish
my own independent department

140
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,200
with full authority
over personnel and financial matters,

141
00:07:03,361 --> 00:07:05,041
free from any interference.

142
00:07:06,241 --> 00:07:07,801
I hope to gain your support.

143
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:18,440
All departments, get ready.

144
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:19,320
Host, get ready.

145
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,400
Counting down.

146
00:07:20,561 --> 00:07:25,520
Five, four, three, two, one.

147
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,400
(Host: Xu Yan)
The city's renowned real estate firms,

148
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,001
Jinda Group and Shouke Real Estate,
have established strategic cooperation

149
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,601
in jointly developing Plot 178.

150
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,400
Both companies stated

151
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:37,640
this marks a milestone collaboration,

152
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,161
signifying that both companies

153
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:42,400
have taken solid steps
in diversified development strategies

154
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,440
while creating new opportunities
and growth potential for the industry.

155
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,520
Jinda Group will adopt Shouke's
technology and management expertise

156
00:07:50,801 --> 00:07:53,721
to further enhance project quality
and service standards

157
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,320
to provide consumers with quality,
convenient residential and commercial

158
00:07:57,361 --> 00:07:58,320
experiences.

159
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,320
(Reportedly, this cooperation
was spearheaded by Shen Haoming,)

160
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,921
(Jinda Group's Vice President
and head of the Plot 178 task force.)

161
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:08,880
(He stated
that the successful agreement signing)

162
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,921
(resulted from the company's
long-term commitment to innovation)

163
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,520
(and deepened cooperation.)

164
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,520
(That concludes
the latest city updates.)

165
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:19,121
(We'll continue
monitoring follow-up developments)

166
00:08:19,361 --> 00:08:22,561
(to bring you
more comprehensive coverage.)

167
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,681
Shen Jinsong

168
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,161
dares not face me.

169
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:30,880
Shen Haoming,

170
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,760
you just rose to power

171
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,640
and are finding ways to sabotage me.

172
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:37,280
First you promoted me sideways,

173
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,201
pushing me out of core departments

174
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:40,560
and marginalizing me.

175
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,520
You really are something.

176
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:44,680
I watched you grow up.

177
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:51,400
Is this how you
treat your father's key contributor?

178
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,601
There's no denying

179
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,880
you've brought the company
significant profits.

180
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,760
But while generating revenue,

181
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,880
plenty found its way into your pockets.

182
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:07,201
You earn 3 million annually

183
00:09:08,241 --> 00:09:09,361
and own two villas,

184
00:09:09,441 --> 00:09:11,400
one with a 200-square-meter garden.

185
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,560
You also have

186
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,001
properties in America and Australia.

187
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,760
Over these years,

188
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:18,680
you helped my father build this empire

189
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,121
as one of the founding pioneers.

190
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:22,520
I've always respected you

191
00:09:23,081 --> 00:09:24,841
for your decades of dedication

192
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:25,601
and hard work.

193
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,001
But your pay has been the highest
in the industry.

194
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,680
We haven't wronged you.

195
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,160
What I can do is

196
00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:37,040
when legal authorities prosecute you,

197
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:41,361
I'll demonstrate to the court
about your cooperative attitude

198
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:42,640
and your voluntary compensation.

199
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:46,001
Stop thinking.

200
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:50,841
This is your only option.

201
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:54,512
(Resignation Agreement)

202
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:10,520
What brings you?

203
00:10:11,961 --> 00:10:13,520
I knew you were working late.

204
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,361
So I wanted to ask you out
for late-night snacks.

205
00:10:17,601 --> 00:10:18,481
Since you mention it,

206
00:10:18,481 --> 00:10:19,520
I am actually hungry.

207
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,880
I just need to send an email.

208
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:22,520
No problem, I'll wait.

209
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,640
Okay.

210
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:25,841
Let's go.

211
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:28,280
What to eat?

212
00:10:31,001 --> 00:10:32,081
That place from before?

213
00:10:32,321 --> 00:10:32,760
Okay.

214
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,441
Haoming.

215
00:10:36,441 --> 00:10:37,121
Mr. Wu.

216
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,201
Still working this late?

217
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,640
I need to talk with you.

218
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,001
Haoming, perhaps...

219
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:49,201
Go ahead.

220
00:10:49,841 --> 00:10:51,400
I acknowledge my mistakes.

221
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,601
I accept the company's punishment.

222
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,201
But could you
consider my years of service

223
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,361
and give me one more chance?

224
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,001
I don't want to leave.

225
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,241
Mr. Wu,

226
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,920
you should've anticipated consequences
before acting.

227
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,280
Staying with the company is impossible.

228
00:11:13,961 --> 00:11:14,560
Let's go.

229
00:11:16,121 --> 00:11:16,760
Haoming,

230
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,361
my wife left me
and took the kids with her.

231
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,961
I got nothing in the divorce.

232
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,920
Being fired at my age,

233
00:11:24,441 --> 00:11:25,400
if this gets out,

234
00:11:26,321 --> 00:11:27,321
I will be ruined

235
00:11:27,361 --> 00:11:29,160
and no company would ever hire me again.

236
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,121
Even my own wife and kids
look down on me.

237
00:11:34,481 --> 00:11:35,201
I'm sorry.

238
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:37,760
Haoming,

239
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,760
I've truly lost everything.

240
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,721
Please have some mercy

241
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,201
and let me stay in the company.

242
00:11:44,841 --> 00:11:47,920
Even a meaningless position would do.

243
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,961
I've truly lost everything.

244
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:53,841
Mr. Wu,

245
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,680
consider it early retirement.

246
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,601
The company
can't make exceptions for this.

247
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,640
Let's go.

248
00:12:05,841 --> 00:12:06,481
Haoming.

249
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:08,880
Haoming!

250
00:12:14,841 --> 00:12:15,481
Are you okay?

251
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,201
I'm fine.

252
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,241
Seems you really need to retire.

253
00:12:26,601 --> 00:12:27,481
Let me go!

254
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:29,321
You alright?

255
00:12:47,344 --> 00:12:48,436
(Fang Lei)

256
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:16,441
Back so early?

257
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,760
How's your injury?

258
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,040
I'm fine. Don't worry.

259
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,800
Let me see.

260
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:27,841
Haoming.

261
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:32,201
I got you a supplementary card.

262
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,001
No spending limit. Use it freely.

263
00:13:38,321 --> 00:13:39,481
What's this reward for?

264
00:13:39,601 --> 00:13:42,081
Go shopping after you recover.

265
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,481
Buy whatever you like.

266
00:13:45,481 --> 00:13:46,560
I don't want this.

267
00:13:47,001 --> 00:13:48,760
You must keep the card.

268
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:49,400
Here.

269
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,560
There are more to come.

270
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,920
That's not what I meant.

271
00:13:58,841 --> 00:13:59,321
Hello?

272
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,321
I see.

273
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:03,640
I'm coming over now.

274
00:14:06,241 --> 00:14:07,201
It's about Wu Deliang.

275
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,721
I need to go to the office.

276
00:14:12,241 --> 00:14:13,361
Will you be back for dinner?

277
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,280
Sure.

278
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,400
Order takeout.

279
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,601
Don't cook yourself.

280
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:19,961
I'll wait for you.

281
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:44,601
Mr. Fang,

282
00:14:44,601 --> 00:14:45,680
long time no see.

283
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,961
How have you been in America?

284
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:49,121
Pretty well.

285
00:14:50,841 --> 00:14:51,880
I came back this time

286
00:14:52,081 --> 00:14:54,321
mainly for the New District project
you're handling.

287
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,680
Lei told me everything.

288
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:59,121
Your return
couldn't have come at a better time.

289
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:03,160
The New District project's funding
relies entirely on you now.

290
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,601
Haoming,

291
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:07,321
I know your capabilities.

292
00:15:07,721 --> 00:15:09,280
For the final signing phase,

293
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,201
I'll lend my support.

294
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,441
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

295
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,201
Has Lei been any trouble at Jinda Group?

296
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,241
Not at all.

297
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,640
Lei's the only daughter I have left.

298
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:24,081
Please continue looking after her.

299
00:15:25,001 --> 00:15:27,760
Fang Lei's been calling me 'brother'
since her teens.

300
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:29,201
Now that she's back,

301
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:30,880
it's right that I

302
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,160
care for her.

303
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,920
Shame Fang Yu left us too soon.

304
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,081
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

305
00:15:50,081 --> 00:15:51,001
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

306
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,961
Goodbye.

307
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,361
Son, over here.

308
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,880
- Bye.
- Bye.

309
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,560
Haoming!

310
00:15:58,081 --> 00:15:59,400
What brings you here?

311
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,760
Since when
do you have time to pick me up?

312
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,560
Thought I was seeing things.

313
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,400
What do you want?

314
00:16:05,441 --> 00:16:06,121
I'll take you.

315
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,560
Burgers, fried chicken, and fries.

316
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,201
Where to after eating?

317
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,201
Are you free today?

318
00:16:13,441 --> 00:16:14,680
I'm all yours today.

319
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,280
Really?

320
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:19,361
It's not my birthday, is it?

321
00:16:22,721 --> 00:16:23,952
- Seatbelt.
- Okay.

322
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:31,920
Let's play a game.

323
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,121
What game?

324
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,361
I want to create
a fantasy football team.

325
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,721
You have two options each time

326
00:16:37,721 --> 00:16:38,640
and need to pick one.

327
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,280
Deal.

328
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,001
First, the goalkeeper.

329
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:47,841
Buffon or Kahn?

330
00:16:49,481 --> 00:16:50,880
Isn't Kahn

331
00:16:51,321 --> 00:16:51,961
the captain?

332
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:53,001
What?

333
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,081
Well...

334
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:55,400
Right, he's Germany's captain.

335
00:16:55,721 --> 00:16:58,721
No, Kahn is English.

336
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,001
I confused him with that striker.

337
00:17:04,681 --> 00:17:05,840
Exactly. What's funny?

338
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:07,040
The striker,

339
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:07,681
Messi,

340
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:08,681
right?

341
00:17:08,721 --> 00:17:09,360
Okay.

342
00:17:09,961 --> 00:17:10,840
Let's do it tomorrow.

343
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,161
Okay.

344
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:13,001
- Sleep. It's late.
- Haoming.

345
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,320
Let's do this often from now on, okay?

346
00:17:16,961 --> 00:17:17,320
Deal.

347
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,120
Sleep.

348
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,840
Let's team up every night.

349
00:17:22,921 --> 00:17:24,560
First decide between Ronaldo and Messi.

350
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,280
Then tell me.

351
00:17:26,201 --> 00:17:27,320
Think carefully.

352
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,881
It's the ultimate dilemma.

353
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:29,921
True.

354
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,120
Bedtime.

355
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,928
(Yan)

356
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,600
Are you leaving again?

357
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,641
No.

358
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,360
I'm staying.

359
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,456
(Yan)

360
00:17:58,032 --> 00:18:00,112
(Haoming)

361
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:05,552
(Haoming)

362
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:15,320
(A woman's sixth sense tells me
there's a crisis approaching.)

363
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,080
(I sense that sandcastle we built)

364
00:18:20,201 --> 00:18:21,881
(is gradually collapsing)

365
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:24,120
(and crumbling.)

366
00:18:29,721 --> 00:18:30,600
Dear viewers,

367
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,840
we've finally located
this hidden noodle shop in the alley.

368
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:36,921
Let's find out together what makes

369
00:18:36,921 --> 00:18:38,681
this 30-year-old noodle shop so special.

370
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,560
I'll be your taste tester today.

371
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:49,080
The noodles have a wonderfully chewy
and springy texture.

372
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:49,881
Siwei,

373
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,800
take another bite.

374
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,961
A big mouthful.

375
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,120
I can't resist

376
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,641
wanting another big bite.

377
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,560
Cut! Stop!

378
00:19:06,401 --> 00:19:09,641
Mom, I'm begging you.

379
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,201
Get me a different job, please?

380
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,600
I...

381
00:19:17,401 --> 00:19:19,280
I can't take this anymore.

382
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,161
I'm filming outdoor segments daily,

383
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,721
eating at 7 to 8 restaurants per day.

384
00:19:22,721 --> 00:19:24,001
I'm gonna puke!

385
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,721
Sun Siwei,

386
00:19:25,921 --> 00:19:26,800
listen to me.

387
00:19:26,921 --> 00:19:27,881
No way.

388
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:28,961
We can't support you.

389
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,161
What's more important? Me or money?

390
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,560
Money!

391
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,320
Mom?

392
00:19:41,401 --> 00:19:42,441
Siwei, hurry up.

393
00:19:42,721 --> 00:19:43,721
Next shop's waiting.

394
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:44,800
Coming.

395
00:19:53,921 --> 00:19:55,001
Forget anniversaries.

396
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:55,840
Not even gifts

397
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,080
for birthdays.

398
00:19:57,201 --> 00:19:58,401
Always 'forgot' when asked.

399
00:19:59,001 --> 00:20:00,600
Oh god, same with mine.

400
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,681
He literally doesn't see me at all.

401
00:20:02,681 --> 00:20:03,721
He only cares about work.

402
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,481
Oh my.

403
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,481
It's not worth it at all.

404
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:07,040
Exactly.

405
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,881
Can you believe it?

406
00:20:08,201 --> 00:20:09,280
Same thing last night.

407
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:09,921
Morning, Yan.

408
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:10,721
Morning, Yan.

409
00:20:10,721 --> 00:20:11,201
Morning.

410
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,881
Your guy's the best.

411
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:13,320
Yan,

412
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,201
- the files you wanted.
- Every day

413
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,520
he picks you up after work.

414
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,001
Don't get me started on him.

415
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,520
He has no sense of style

416
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,681
and no career ambition.

417
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,241
A total clueless big man,

418
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,401
immune to romance.

419
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,881
After coming home,

420
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,600
he doesn't say a word to me.

421
00:20:25,921 --> 00:20:26,441
Really?

422
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:27,241
He's useless.

423
00:20:27,721 --> 00:20:29,401
Yan, you're the real champion.

424
00:20:29,921 --> 00:20:31,040
With privileged background,

425
00:20:31,161 --> 00:20:31,840
you work hard

426
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:33,600
and have earned your top spot.

427
00:20:33,961 --> 00:20:35,560
You even married an amazing husband.

428
00:20:36,161 --> 00:20:37,560
You live a charmed life.

429
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,481
No kidding.

430
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,241
Your husband keeps sending gifts.

431
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,001
Is the proposal for
our planning meeting ready?

432
00:20:45,641 --> 00:20:46,641
Right away.

433
00:20:46,721 --> 00:20:47,881
We're working on it now.

434
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:50,280
Jiang Lai,

435
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,600
is this the script you wrote?

436
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,441
Have you read it yourself?

437
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,681
Is it human language?

438
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,840
Sorry. I'll revise it.

439
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,001
I've reviewed your field recording.

440
00:21:20,401 --> 00:21:21,401
You seemed uneasy eating.

441
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:23,721
What'd the audience think?

442
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,280
Will they find it interesting?

443
00:21:29,001 --> 00:21:29,800
I tried my best.

444
00:21:30,921 --> 00:21:33,241
I've never eaten cheap noodles
since childhood.

445
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,921
How happy did you expect me to look?

446
00:21:35,401 --> 00:21:36,520
The audience is smart

447
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,481
and sensitive.

448
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,201
So don't patronize them
with your half-hearted efforts.

449
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,641
For the next episode's video,

450
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,201
I need you

451
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,401
to show sincerity in every single frame.

452
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,961
Stop wearing heels
during field recordings.

453
00:22:01,681 --> 00:22:02,481
Wear sneakers.

454
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:03,520
They're convenient.

455
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,800
Heels slow down filming

456
00:22:05,921 --> 00:22:07,280
and are safety hazards.

457
00:22:07,481 --> 00:22:09,241
You're part of my team now.

458
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:14,120
I need to ensure both safety
and work quality for all my team.

459
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:15,600
Understood?

460
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,760
Earlier, people were praising you,

461
00:22:21,881 --> 00:22:23,241
calling you the 'female lead'.

462
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:26,600
But that image doesn't match

463
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,120
your actual mindset or taste.

464
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,161
I choose shoes by their looks,

465
00:22:31,481 --> 00:22:33,360
not convenience.

466
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,280
That's nouveau riche mentality.

467
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,760
Sun Siwei.

468
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,881
Siwei means thinking.

469
00:22:44,161 --> 00:22:45,241
With a name like that,

470
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,560
you never use your brain.

471
00:22:49,881 --> 00:22:51,800
Your husband is a great catch.

472
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:53,320
With so many options,

473
00:22:53,641 --> 00:22:56,201
why does he obey you blindly?

474
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,800
Could there be something fishy?

475
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,560
Could it be guilt compensation

476
00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:09,360
or creating smokescreens?

477
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,560
You better watch out.

478
00:23:14,641 --> 00:23:15,401
Siwei,

479
00:23:16,001 --> 00:23:19,280
you know scumbag tactics so well.

480
00:23:20,161 --> 00:23:22,241
Is your boyfriend one?

481
00:23:22,921 --> 00:23:23,481
Yan,

482
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,520
we're ready

483
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,280
to film.

484
00:23:26,241 --> 00:23:27,080
Let's go.

485
00:23:33,241 --> 00:23:34,681
Dear viewers,

486
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:35,320
hello.

487
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,921
Welcome to Financial News.

488
00:23:36,961 --> 00:23:38,001
I'm your host, Xu Yan.

489
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:39,201
(Jinda And Shouke
Build a Smart New District)

490
00:23:39,201 --> 00:23:42,520
After Jinda Group
and Shouke Real Estate's partnership,

491
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,001
public attention remains high.

492
00:23:45,201 --> 00:23:48,161
Today, on behalf of both companies,
Mr. Shen Haoming,

493
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,401
Jinda's representative,

494
00:23:49,681 --> 00:23:53,721
announced the development theme
and plan for Plot 178.

495
00:23:57,641 --> 00:23:58,280
Haoming.

496
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,881
It's the cooperation agreement
my father drafted for the New District.

497
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:04,760
Qualifications,

498
00:24:04,961 --> 00:24:05,961
responsibility division,

499
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:07,040
collaboration model,

500
00:24:07,241 --> 00:24:08,120
construction plans,

501
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,320
and risk sharing.

502
00:24:09,441 --> 00:24:11,560
I've highlighted key sections for you.

503
00:24:11,921 --> 00:24:12,560
Take a look.

504
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,241
You're new to the industry,

505
00:24:20,161 --> 00:24:23,280
but your competence surprises me.

506
00:24:24,681 --> 00:24:27,201
Your approval means everything.

507
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,481
To help you

508
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,681
and this project

509
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,961
is my goal.

510
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,201
Next,

511
00:24:32,481 --> 00:24:33,600
I'll strive to do better.

512
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,001
It's getting late.

513
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,568
I'll drive you home.

514
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,520
No need.

515
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,192
I'm heading the other way.

516
00:24:43,921 --> 00:24:44,921
I'll get a ride-hail.

517
00:24:44,921 --> 00:24:45,721
It's convenient.

518
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,681
And after making you
miss Xu Yan's birthday,

519
00:24:51,161 --> 00:24:53,840
I still feel guilty.

520
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:55,721
I'm sorry.

521
00:24:56,001 --> 00:24:57,600
It's fine. It's all in the past now.

522
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,360
Let's go.

523
00:25:06,401 --> 00:25:07,001
You okay?

524
00:25:07,241 --> 00:25:07,721
I'm fine.

525
00:25:07,721 --> 00:25:09,481
I skipped dinner.

526
00:25:09,481 --> 00:25:10,201
I'm feeling dizzy.

527
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,201
Sit down.

528
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,080
Thanks.

529
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,800
Eat this.

530
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,520
Take the whole box.

531
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,241
You work late often.

532
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,104
It's easy to get low blood sugar.

533
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,721
Keep some sweets handy.

534
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:44,560
Thank you.

535
00:25:49,401 --> 00:25:50,721
Take your time eating.

536
00:25:51,001 --> 00:25:52,001
I'll drive you home.

537
00:26:38,241 --> 00:26:38,921
Haoming,

538
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,120
thanks for the ride.

539
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:42,881
Don't mention it.

540
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,241
Go up.

541
00:26:50,481 --> 00:26:52,241
After this project wraps up,

542
00:26:52,961 --> 00:26:54,641
can we go see a movie together?

543
00:26:57,681 --> 00:26:59,681
I just want a reward for myself.

544
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,881
The approval from my superior.

545
00:27:05,001 --> 00:27:05,641
Okay.

546
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,201
Pick a movie.

547
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,161
Great.

548
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:12,560
Bye, Haoming.

549
00:27:24,641 --> 00:27:25,840
Why do you have this?

550
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,760
I've been looking everywhere for it.

551
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,760
I found it.

552
00:27:41,721 --> 00:27:42,360
The reward.

553
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,721
Bye, Haoming.

554
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:14,840
Haoming.

555
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,760
You're here.

556
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,641
Yeah.

557
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,360
Yan, you're here too.

558
00:28:21,721 --> 00:28:23,280
Feels like ages since I last saw you.

559
00:28:23,881 --> 00:28:25,201
I've been busy lately.

560
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,201
I'm free today.

561
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,520
I came to accompany Haoming.

562
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:31,921
Are you alone?

563
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,520
Let's play.

564
00:28:35,721 --> 00:28:36,560
Is that okay?

565
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:38,161
Yan rarely gets to accompany you.

566
00:28:38,241 --> 00:28:39,840
Aren't you worried I'll crash your date?

567
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,120
It's fine.

568
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:43,520
Haoming wanted me to join him,

569
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,481
but I can't grasp it.

570
00:28:44,721 --> 00:28:45,681
Perfect you came.

571
00:28:46,401 --> 00:28:47,040
Haoming,

572
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,441
go easy on your sister.

573
00:28:49,681 --> 00:28:50,280
No need.

574
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,840
We'll keep it fair since it's a match.

575
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,001
No advantages taken.

576
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,441
Which club first?

577
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,120
Iron club.

578
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,441
That suits me better.

579
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,320
I'll go first.

580
00:29:17,201 --> 00:29:17,800
Nice shot.

581
00:29:19,161 --> 00:29:19,800
Haoming,

582
00:29:20,201 --> 00:29:21,161
are you free tonight?

583
00:29:21,881 --> 00:29:24,001
Let me treat you and Yan to dinner.

584
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,641
I have a dinner
with Yuanhang Fund tonight.

585
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,560
Why don't you join us?

586
00:29:30,441 --> 00:29:31,881
Mr. Yun, Mr. Liang,

587
00:29:32,001 --> 00:29:33,712
and their executive team
will be there too.

588
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,921
They might ask technical questions.

589
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,320
We can play off each other.

590
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,481
I'll follow your lead.

591
00:29:44,161 --> 00:29:45,840
Let's have dinner together tonight.

592
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:49,001
I'll skip the work dinner.

593
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:49,840
Actually,

594
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,441
I'm having dinner with my cousin.

595
00:29:51,481 --> 00:29:51,921
Okay.

596
00:29:52,201 --> 00:29:53,120
Careful, it's hot.

597
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,641
How's the temperature?

598
00:29:54,921 --> 00:29:55,681
Just right.

599
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,241
You've practiced a lot.

600
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,280
Not really.

601
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,040
Didn't you teach me everything I know?

602
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,401
I never liked golfing in London.

603
00:30:10,201 --> 00:30:11,600
If you hadn't kept inviting me,

604
00:30:11,641 --> 00:30:12,800
I would've quit long ago.

605
00:30:13,001 --> 00:30:14,360
So thank you.

606
00:30:23,961 --> 00:30:24,760
No way.

607
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,280
They could never be together.

608
00:30:26,961 --> 00:30:27,800
Keep your voice down.

609
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,520
No matter what happens,

610
00:30:31,641 --> 00:30:33,800
he'd never fall for another woman.

611
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,241
Even if every man cheated,

612
00:30:35,241 --> 00:30:36,241
he wouldn't. Understand?

613
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,001
You've only met him a few times.

614
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,201
Why trust him so much?

615
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,721
True, I haven't seen him often,

616
00:30:44,241 --> 00:30:46,080
but I observe carefully each time

617
00:30:46,481 --> 00:30:47,481
and see it clearly.

618
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,280
Every second, he only has eyes for you.

619
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,001
But we used to share everything.

620
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:07,721
Now it feels like glass separates us.

621
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,040
We can see each other,

622
00:31:11,681 --> 00:31:13,080
but can't get closer.

623
00:31:15,161 --> 00:31:17,161
Maybe you're overthinking?

624
00:31:17,481 --> 00:31:19,721
Look, he's a businessman

625
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,360
working around clock.

626
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,161
Maybe he's just tired.

627
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,401
Right?

628
00:31:25,921 --> 00:31:27,760
We finally got together today.

629
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,280
Forget him.

630
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:28,840
Let's drink.

631
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,921
Haoming,

632
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,520
don't you think I'm great?

633
00:31:45,201 --> 00:31:49,641
Today I finally got Jiang Yun
and Jiang Liang into signing for you.

634
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:52,560
Our efforts finally paid off.

635
00:31:53,441 --> 00:31:54,120
You did great.

636
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,840
You acted very professionally.

637
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,320
Well done.

638
00:31:58,881 --> 00:31:59,840
I'll get you some water.

639
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,161
Haoming,

640
00:32:08,921 --> 00:32:10,201
take a good look at me.

641
00:32:15,241 --> 00:32:16,481
I grew up long ago.

642
00:32:22,896 --> 00:32:24,336
(Yan)

643
00:32:41,264 --> 00:32:42,288
(Chen Lin)

644
00:32:47,481 --> 00:32:48,760
Can you not answer that?

645
00:32:49,721 --> 00:32:50,320
It's Chen Lin.

646
00:32:52,401 --> 00:32:53,280
Then answer it.

647
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,401
Hello?

648
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,441
It's done.

649
00:33:00,201 --> 00:33:00,681
The photo

650
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,560
is sent to you.

651
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,201
Okay.

652
00:33:16,181 --> 00:33:17,680
(Signatures)

653
00:33:19,921 --> 00:33:21,360
Why show me this?

654
00:33:21,721 --> 00:33:22,961
Mr. Huang and your father

655
00:33:23,441 --> 00:33:24,840
just signed the contract in the US.

656
00:33:25,721 --> 00:33:27,481
Good thing your father is on my side.

657
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,441
Or the New District project
wouldn't materialize.

658
00:33:32,961 --> 00:33:35,241
Well he's my father.

659
00:33:35,441 --> 00:33:36,721
Naturally he supports

660
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,840
the person I like.

661
00:33:44,641 --> 00:33:45,961
Thank him for me.

662
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,840
Get some rest early.

663
00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:49,881
Shen Haoming,

664
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,481
what are you doing?

665
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,201
Now it's truly settled.

666
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,280
You performed excellently.

667
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,080
You'll be very pleased
with this year's bonus.

668
00:34:03,721 --> 00:34:04,360
Stop.

669
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,420
Were you nice to me

670
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,200
just to win over my father

671
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,281
and keep me in check?

672
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,600
You've been putting on an act with me.

673
00:34:24,001 --> 00:34:25,321
Can't call it an act.

674
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,801
Just to keep you stable

675
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:30,881
and prevent your occasional outbursts.

676
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,841
Shen Haoming!

677
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,040
I love you so much.

678
00:34:34,481 --> 00:34:35,720
You think I'm a lunatic?

679
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,321
I'll tell Xu Yan

680
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,441
and my father

681
00:34:38,441 --> 00:34:39,361
about what you've done.

682
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,401
Suit yourself.

683
00:34:42,801 --> 00:34:44,040
If you dare walk out that door,

684
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,520
I won't let you off.

685
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,841
I'm begging you, Haoming.

686
00:34:49,001 --> 00:34:50,080
I didn't mean to.

687
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,240
Don't be angry.

688
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,080
Mr. Shen.

689
00:34:56,841 --> 00:34:57,321
Han Weiping,

690
00:34:57,321 --> 00:34:58,200
why are you here?

691
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,881
Let me reintroduce you.

692
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,520
Han Weiping,

693
00:35:02,441 --> 00:35:05,441
former senior corporate lawyer
at Jinda Group,

694
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,520
now my private attorney.

695
00:35:08,921 --> 00:35:10,001
You've worked hard lately.

696
00:35:10,361 --> 00:35:11,881
Take your time with the follow-ups.

697
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,801
Don't worry.

698
00:35:12,881 --> 00:35:13,841
I'll handle it properly.

699
00:35:14,001 --> 00:35:15,040
What do you mean?

700
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:16,600
Why did you lie to me?

701
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,080
Explain yourself.

702
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,200
Go away.

703
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,401
Go!

704
00:35:23,881 --> 00:35:24,761
Had enough drama?

705
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,160
You...

706
00:35:27,841 --> 00:35:29,481
All of you are liars.

707
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,720
It was all a setup from the beginning.

708
00:35:32,761 --> 00:35:33,801
You trapped me.

709
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,720
You think signing means victory?

710
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,761
I won't forgive any of you.

711
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,640
Especially you, Han Weiping.

712
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:42,680
Miss Fang,

713
00:35:43,401 --> 00:35:44,801
as a professional lawyer,

714
00:35:45,321 --> 00:35:46,881
I advise against escalating conflicts.

715
00:35:47,881 --> 00:35:48,680
What?

716
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,640
Scared now?

717
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,080
I'm not scared.

718
00:35:52,801 --> 00:35:53,921
I want to tell you.

719
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:55,801
You tried to wreck Mr. Shen's family.

720
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,200
For every thing you did

721
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,160
and every word you said,

722
00:35:58,881 --> 00:36:01,600
I have all evidence and recordings.

723
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,600
So I advise you.

724
00:36:07,961 --> 00:36:09,001
You're still young.

725
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,120
You need reputation
for future endeavors.

726
00:36:23,921 --> 00:36:25,240
You were my client after all.

727
00:36:25,841 --> 00:36:26,961
I'll let it slide this time.

728
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,520
If there's a next time,

729
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,441
you'll face legal consequences.

730
00:36:30,761 --> 00:36:31,640
Get some rest.

731
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,481
It's late.

732
00:37:15,921 --> 00:37:16,680
Still awake?

733
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,841
I'm expecting you.

734
00:37:28,401 --> 00:37:29,720
Why didn't you answer your phone?

735
00:37:31,321 --> 00:37:32,961
I had something important to handle.

736
00:37:33,761 --> 00:37:35,120
So I didn't call back. Sorry.

737
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,160
Haoming,

738
00:37:46,841 --> 00:37:48,281
I need to tell you something.

739
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:54,240
If it's something that'll make me happy,

740
00:37:54,761 --> 00:37:55,560
go ahead and say it.

741
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,361
If it'll upset me,

742
00:38:05,321 --> 00:38:06,640
don't say a single word.

743
00:38:11,801 --> 00:38:12,761
I'm a bit tired.

744
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,441
I need to rest.

745
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,401
Yan.

746
00:39:17,881 --> 00:39:18,680
Why are you here?

747
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:22,160
I'm here to pick up Haochen.

748
00:39:22,321 --> 00:39:23,801
Why are you picking up Haochen?

749
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,600
Does this need a reason?

750
00:39:28,921 --> 00:39:30,200
I'm his biological aunt.

751
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:37,801
What scheme are you plotting now?

752
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:40,680
This is a school.

753
00:39:42,441 --> 00:39:43,640
Control yourself and leave.

754
00:39:44,361 --> 00:39:45,040
Yan,

755
00:39:47,361 --> 00:39:49,001
actually, every time I face you,

756
00:39:50,281 --> 00:39:52,080
I feel really guilty inside.

757
00:39:53,401 --> 00:39:54,520
Also, I found out

758
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:56,600
you've been kept in the dark.

759
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,001
I think this situation

760
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,560
is very unfair to you.

761
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,881
Actually, Haoming and Haochen
aren't brothers at all.

762
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,401
They're father and son.

763
00:40:20,801 --> 00:40:22,881
When Haoming was studying in London,

764
00:40:23,401 --> 00:40:24,520
he dated my sister.

765
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,640
My sister got accidentally pregnant
and gave birth to Haochen.

766
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,441
But they were still young back then,

767
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,600
only twenty years old.

768
00:40:32,281 --> 00:40:34,401
My sister made me keep it
from our father.

769
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,560
So the baby was taken
by the Shens immediately after birth.

770
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,321
Shen Jinsong and Yu Lan were worried
about an illegitimate child scandal.

771
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,961
Fortunately, not many people
knew about it.

772
00:40:48,481 --> 00:40:50,641
To the public, they said

773
00:40:51,664 --> 00:40:53,321
(it's Haoming's younger brother.)

774
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,961
Later, my sister died
in a diving accident.

775
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:04,441
That made this matter
a permanent secret.

776
00:41:12,841 --> 00:41:15,881
The three of us are blood-related.

777
00:41:16,321 --> 00:41:17,600
No one can change that

778
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,961
or sever that bond.

779
00:41:19,481 --> 00:41:20,560
In this world,

780
00:41:20,761 --> 00:41:24,040
no one could accept Haochen
more sincerely than me.

781
00:41:29,281 --> 00:41:30,640
You probably didn't know this.

782
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,281
On your birthday,

783
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,321
Haoming was at my place.

784
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,321
You didn't answer my call.

785
00:41:39,321 --> 00:41:40,640
I feared something happened.

786
00:41:40,841 --> 00:41:41,361
I'm fine.

787
00:41:41,921 --> 00:41:43,881
Shifeng and Jinda
are signing an agreement.

788
00:41:43,961 --> 00:41:44,921
We had a meeting.

789
00:41:45,281 --> 00:41:46,680
So I put my phone on silent.

790
00:41:48,761 --> 00:41:50,281
He probably didn't tell you

791
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,520
what we did together, did he?

792
00:42:07,481 --> 00:42:09,481
Unless Shen Haoming tells me himself,

793
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,680
I won't believe anything you say.

794
00:42:15,761 --> 00:42:17,841
You... you don't think

795
00:42:17,921 --> 00:42:23,040
your relationship with Haoming
is some pure romance, do you?

796
00:42:31,441 --> 00:42:33,600
From the start,
he wasn't looking for a wife.

797
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:37,640
He wanted a name
to put on a marriage certificate.

798
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,130
You just happened to appear

799
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:43,001
(in his sight at that time.)

800
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,080
But my philosophy is

801
00:42:46,921 --> 00:42:49,321
I must shape it into what I like.

802
00:42:54,801 --> 00:42:56,441
You're not from matching social status,

803
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,401
but you're fairly clever

804
00:42:59,961 --> 00:43:00,921
and ambitious.

805
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,080
You've become a host lately,

806
00:43:03,401 --> 00:43:05,761
which perfectly serves
to promote his business

807
00:43:05,921 --> 00:43:06,761
and his character.

808
00:43:07,361 --> 00:43:10,600
I wonder if we could have the honor
of Xu Yan interviewing you.

809
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,921
Consider it
giving the new host a chance.

810
00:43:21,321 --> 00:43:23,200
A seemingly perfect family

811
00:43:23,761 --> 00:43:26,841
can gain him much trust
from business partners.

812
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,401
Plus you're obedient and sensible.

813
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,281
Even knowing he has a child,

814
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,881
you'd still let him control you.

815
00:43:37,001 --> 00:43:40,361
It'd be a perfect
and rational choice for him.

816
00:43:42,401 --> 00:43:43,040
By the way,

817
00:43:44,361 --> 00:43:48,921
you actually thought you became a host
through your own ability?

818
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,001
He put in great effort

819
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,921
to get you that host position.

820
00:44:05,489 --> 00:44:06,896
Bye bye!

821
00:44:06,896 --> 00:44:08,987
- Bye.
- Bye, sir!

822
00:44:13,961 --> 00:44:14,640
Sis-in-law?

823
00:44:16,361 --> 00:44:17,321
Sis-in-law.

824
00:44:25,761 --> 00:44:27,001
(Haochen is your brother.)

825
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,361
(We're family.)

826
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,520
(It's only natural for us
to care for each other.)

827
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:32,961
(You've done well.)

828
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,401
Thank you, sis-in-law.

829
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,801
(Haochen has been spoiled
ever since he was born.)

830
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,040
(His temper grew worse and worse.)

831
00:44:45,281 --> 00:44:48,720
(I never expected
you'd get along so well with him.)

832
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,961
(I think he genuinely likes you.)
