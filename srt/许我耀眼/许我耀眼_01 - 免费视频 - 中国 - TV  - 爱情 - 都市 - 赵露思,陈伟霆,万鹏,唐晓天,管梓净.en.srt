38
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:29,419
(The apple of their eye.)

39
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:32,060
I'll take her

40
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:34,780
if you don't want her.

41
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,859
If you won't raise her,

42
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:38,859
I will.

43
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,699
Mom.

44
00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:44,220
She has congenital heart disease.

45
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,900
We can't afford her treatment.

46
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,539

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:21,979
Xu Yan.

61
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,220
What a lovely name.

62
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:25,979
Does it have a meaning?

63
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,139
Xu stands for "promise"
as in a promise of gold.

64
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:32,979
Yan stands for beauty inside and out.

65
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,859
It represents our expectations

66
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:35,819
for our daughter.

67
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:39,460
Thank you

68
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,379
for entrusting Yan to me.

69
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:43,020
I'm lucky to be able

70
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,099
to marry her.

71
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,460
Haoming,

72
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,780
you're outstanding in every way.

73
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,139
Top schools.

74
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,579
Good-looking.

75
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,819
And you're already

76
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:53,940
helping your father

77
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:54,659
at this age.

78
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,699
That's impressive.

79
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,419
Syracuse University's
architecture program

80
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,500
is prestigious.

81
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,740
With you two here,

82
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:02,699
we'll surely need

83
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,060
your insights on future trends

84
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:05,699
in architecture.

85
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:06,699
I'll definitely

86
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:08,460
seek your guidance.

87
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:10,900
You're too modest.

88
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,460
Jinda Group is a top player

89
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,699
in the industry.

90
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:15,340
In the past few years,

91
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:16,620
you've led several

92
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,060
national landmark projects.

93
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,180
No matter what,

94
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,500
our practice still needs

95
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,579
theoretical guidance.

96
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,060
What are you working on these days?

97
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:31,699

103
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:45,060
Environmental building.

104
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:46,060
Yeah, that.

105
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:46,940
Yeah.

106
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,060
I sent you the files last week.

107
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,060
Please memorize everything

108
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,779
to avoid any slip-ups.

109
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:53,819
Rest assured,

110
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,420
we'll definitely...

111
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,899
I'll try another shampoo.

112
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,019
This perfume is for you.

113
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:05,899
Cheap perfumes have

114
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,579
a harsh alcohol smell.

115
00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:10,259
Start using this tomorrow.

116
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:11,819
Miss Xu, don't worry.

117
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,699
We'll memorize all the materials

118
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,660
and professional terms.

119
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:16,660
We'll memorize them

120
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:19,339
by heart and be flawless.

121
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,300
You specialize in...

122
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,540
Environmental building.

123
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,540
This has been my focus

124
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:28,339
at the research studio.

125
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:30,420
Zero-carbon buildings

126
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,860
have been and will remain

127
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,819
a major research field worldwide.

128
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:37,860
Only highly educated parents

129
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:39,339
like you could raise

130
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:40,660
their daughter so well.

131
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:45,980
Syracuse University.

132
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,980
I visited this university last year.

133
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:50,740
The campus diners are awful.

134
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,819
Typical Western food.

135
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:53,860
There's a Chinese restaurant

136
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,100
on Marshall Street nearby

137
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:56,899
with authentic Peking duck.

138
00:05:57,579 --> 00:05:58,620
Have you tried it?

139
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:13,579
(Three.)

140
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:14,540
(Two.)

141
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:15,620
(One.)

142
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,699
Smile.

143
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:18,339
Stop.

144
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,180
You're not here sightseeing.

145
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:22,540
We will visit

146
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,219
the campus and local communities

147
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,420
to enhance your memory

148
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,060
as if you've genuinely

149
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,540
lived and worked here.

150
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:29,459
Understand?

151
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:30,379
Got it.

152
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,540
Behind you

153
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,060
is the Ernest Bird Library.

154
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,660
(Ernest Bird Library)

155
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,259
To the right is the law school.

156
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:37,219
(Law School)

157
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:39,100
The campus has two canteens

158
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:40,300
and 14 coffee shops.

159
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:42,540
We usually go to Schine Diner.

160
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,139
The only Chinese restaurant

161
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,259
has three signature dishes.

162
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:46,620
Sichuan boiled fish, mapo tofu,

163
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:47,540
and spicy chicken.

164
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:48,740
What's it called?

165
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,259
P.F. Chang's, right?

166
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:53,540
My husband and I are regulars there.

167
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,300
But it's a Sichuan restaurant.

168
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:58,019
They don't serve Peking duck.

169
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:00,980
Their specialty is actually mapo tofu.

170
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,819
Dad loves their boiled fish.

171
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,459
What a pity.

172
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:09,100
They run out in the winter,

173
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,420
unlike how things are back at home.

174
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:11,899
Exactly.

175
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,339
Sorry, I got confused.

176
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,139
I visited too many places last time.

177
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,899
Actually, I met several

178
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:22,259
Chinese-American professors.

179
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:24,219
Why haven't I seen you there?

180
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,579
I've searched on Baidu

181
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:30,899
but found no information about you.

182
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:39,259
Why is that?

183
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:47,940
(Xu Jiajia.)

184
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:49,139
(You're really immigrating?)

185
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,420
This university?

186
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,660
It looks amazing.

187
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,660
My paperwork's done.
I'm leaving next month.

188
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,219
I really envy you.

189
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:58,579
(Directory)
Your parents are professors.

190
00:07:58,699 --> 00:07:59,379
And you attend

191
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,819
the university where they work.

192
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,660
They're not professors.

193
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:05,300
They are just research staff.

194
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,660
You might find
their names listed abroad.

195
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,740
But on Baidu,

196
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,100
you can't find anything.

197
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:14,899
Ms. Yu.

198
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:18,779
My father doesn't teach.

199
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,579
He only serves
as a researcher at the institute.

200
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,620
Therefore,

201
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,300
you probably won't find him on Baidu.

202
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:39,900
Here you are.

203
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,660
We researchers may not enjoy

204
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:51,260
the wealth of industrialists.

205
00:08:51,979 --> 00:08:53,540
But we possess our own value.

206
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,699
I'm not after fame and fortune.

207
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,099
Absolutely.

208
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,900
You dedicate yourselves to research,

209
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:02,339
right?

210
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,420
Without seeking glory.

211
00:09:03,739 --> 00:09:06,699
That's true intellectual nobility.

212
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,619
Sorry.

213
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,260
I've been quite forward.

214
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,140
Oh.

215
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,699
Here is

216
00:09:22,099 --> 00:09:23,660
my recently published work.

217
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,619
You are professionals.

218
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,579
I'd appreciate your opinion. Thank you.

219
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:29,260
Thank you.

220
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,459
Nice handwriting.

221
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,819
Educated people have
beautiful handwriting.

222
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,900
Why don't I get a signature?

223
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,660
Perhaps you forgot.

224
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,819
Please sign it.

225
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,219
Or it'd be a shame.

226
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:48,099
My apologies.

227
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,459
I must have forgotten.

228
00:10:08,619 --> 00:10:10,300
Thank you for the book, Mr. Xu.

229
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,499
Thank you for bringing me gifts

230
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,459
all the way.

231
00:10:14,859 --> 00:10:15,420
What a pity.

232
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:17,699
Jiajia has gone to Paris.

233
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,420
I've spoken to her.

234
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:20,979
It's fine.

235
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,060
We can meet next time.

236
00:10:22,979 --> 00:10:24,540
Could you sign this for me?

237
00:10:25,739 --> 00:10:26,060
Well...

238
00:10:26,619 --> 00:10:28,540
I didn't write this book alone.

239
00:10:28,739 --> 00:10:29,660
All our researchers

240
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:30,579
put in their efforts.

241
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,420
But you're the only one I know.

242
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:34,140
Alright then.

243
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:06,859
There.

244
00:11:06,979 --> 00:11:07,619
Thank you.

245
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,940
Excellent handwriting.

246
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,180
I can feel the cultural refinement.

247
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,300
Mr. Xu and Mrs. Xu.

248
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:29,619
You must be hungry now.

249
00:11:30,099 --> 00:11:31,300
Let's discuss the wedding

250
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,940
in the dining room.

251
00:11:33,979 --> 00:11:36,339
You should decide on the wedding.

252
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:39,420
Our opinions are just suggestions.

253
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,339
This way.

254
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,979
The main advantage

255
00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:47,540
of this area is
its prime location, maybe.

256
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:49,180
The only drawback

257
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,540
I can think of is that

258
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:51,739
it's under a flight path.

259
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:52,540
Sometimes,

260
00:11:52,619 --> 00:11:53,619
planes pass overhead.

261
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,660
It's alright.

262
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,060
It's not so loud.

263
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,020
Yan,

264
00:12:04,219 --> 00:12:05,900
do you like the cooking

265
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,180
of our family chef?

266
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,020
Great food.

267
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:09,979
Thank you.

268
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:11,499
I'm glad you like it.

269
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,420
You don't like eggs?

270
00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:26,260
Are they your biological parents?

271
00:12:31,219 --> 00:12:33,180
You don't seem so close to them.

272
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,020
How could a mother

273
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,739
not know her own daughter

274
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,540
doesn't eat eggs?

275
00:12:48,499 --> 00:12:49,459
Yan, here.

276
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,660
Thanks, Mom.

277
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:54,979
Yan,

278
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,099
dig in.

279
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:17,739
What's true can't be faked.

280
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,540
What's fake can't be real.

281
00:13:24,219 --> 00:13:25,339
I want the truth.

282
00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:35,499
Have some fruit.

283
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,660
Okay, thank you.

284
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:37,619
Don't be shy.

285
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:43,819
I'm sorry.

286
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:47,739
What for?

287
00:13:51,859 --> 00:13:52,780
I lied.

288
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,739
About what?

289
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,540
They want a spare cue.

290
00:14:01,859 --> 00:14:02,300
I said,

291
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:02,979
"Keep learning.

292
00:14:02,979 --> 00:14:03,979
We won't make it."

293
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:05,180
Actually,

294
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,979
I grew up living with my grandma.

295
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:10,219
My parents left me behind

296
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:14,499
and went to work overseas early on.

297
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,540
So I've barely

298
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,420
seen them at all.

299
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,180
I don't know what it's like to be loved

300
00:14:29,219 --> 00:14:31,339
by my father or mother.

301
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,219
I've fought

302
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:40,900
and protested.

303
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:43,979
But it didn't do anything.

304
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,540
I even wanted to cut ties with them.

305
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,900
If it weren't

306
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,420
for the fact that we were

307
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:56,579
getting married,

308
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,060
I wouldn't have contacted them.

309
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,660
When I said that

310
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,780
I have a loving family

311
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:09,499
earlier today,

312
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:12,900
that was a lie.

313
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,540
I'm sorry, Ms. Yu.

314
00:15:16,979 --> 00:15:17,859
I just wanted

315
00:15:17,859 --> 00:15:18,859
to do my best

316
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,940
to make you

317
00:15:19,979 --> 00:15:21,579
think highly of me.

318
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,499
I wanted you to believe

319
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,780
that I grew up

320
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,099
in a loving household,

321
00:15:30,979 --> 00:15:32,099
which was not true.

322
00:15:34,739 --> 00:15:35,940
I wanted you

323
00:15:36,739 --> 00:15:38,380
and Haoming to feel assured, so...

324
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,060
I'm sorry.

325
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,380
Your parents had their reasons.

326
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:54,459
Everyone tries to balance

327
00:15:54,499 --> 00:15:55,900
work and family life.

328
00:15:57,819 --> 00:15:58,940
But achieving that balance

329
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,859
isn't easy.

330
00:16:02,499 --> 00:16:03,819
Haoming's been studying abroad

331
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,339
alone since childhood.

332
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,459
We rarely saw him.

333
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,940
I've always felt sorry about that.

334
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:22,940
Ms. Yu.

335
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,499
Haochen is back from school.

336
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:26,940
I see.

337
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:29,499
Excuse me.

338
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:30,900
Ms. Yu.

339
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:34,260
Thank you.

340
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:07,216
(Huanhuan)

341
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,259
What's wrong?

342
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:12,219
Yan.

343
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:14,100
You didn't make it as the host

344
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:14,900
of Family Feast.

345
00:17:15,259 --> 00:17:16,580
Sun Siwei heard you applied

346
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:18,259
and shouted at the director.

347
00:17:18,499 --> 00:17:19,459
Watch your back.

348
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,739
This is just the beginning.

349
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:26,180
The matter

350
00:17:28,499 --> 00:17:29,739
isn't settled yet.

351
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,180
Yan,

352
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:32,620
come have some fruit.

353
00:17:40,219 --> 00:17:40,739
Coming.

354
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,180
Come on.

355
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,580
Miss Xu,

356
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,299
everything went smoothly.

357
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:55,019
I will help you

358
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:56,100
check out tomorrow.

359
00:17:56,739 --> 00:17:57,739
Just leave your key cards

360
00:17:57,979 --> 00:17:59,259
at the front desk.

361
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,340
Lay low until the wedding.

362
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,340
I'll contact you.

363
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,580
Your job will be done after the wedding.

364
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:06,940
I won't bother you

365
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,340
with anything afterward.

366
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:10,860
Okay.

367
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,539
Got it.

368
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,779
Rest assured.

369
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,299
We're character actors.

370
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:15,900
If you see us on the street

371
00:18:15,979 --> 00:18:16,539
one day,

372
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,660
you won't recognize us.

373
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:18,620
Yeah.

374
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,499
Since we've taken on this job,

375
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,420
we won't cause you any trouble.

376
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,180
Rest assured.

377
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,180
Yeah.

378
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:26,739
Alright.

379
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,380
Right.

380
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,499
Miss Xu.

381
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,779
I've pre-screened these extras

382
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,979
for the wedding.

383
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,499
See if they qualify as wedding guests.

384
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,459
I will settle the payment.

385
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,100
The rest is none of your business.

386
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:43,979
Got it.

387
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:44,820
Got it.

388
00:18:49,219 --> 00:18:50,380
Check out before 7:00 AM.

389
00:18:51,219 --> 00:18:51,860
I'm leaving.

390
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,259
Well...

391
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:54,259
Miss Xu, take care.

392
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,140
Take care.

393
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,459
(It's a life built on lies.)

394
00:19:10,699 --> 00:19:11,620
(I did my best)

395
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,820
(to make a fortress.)

396
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,620
(But how can there be)

397
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,979
(fortresses built on sand?)

398
00:19:34,948 --> 00:19:36,660
(Family Feast)

399
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,420
Everything needs to be categorized.

400
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:40,860
The salad ingredients

401
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,059
and the recipes

402
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:43,299
for today's show

403
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:44,539
should all be sorted.

404
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,299
Here.

405
00:19:46,699 --> 00:19:47,380
Wash this.

406
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,100
Huanhuan.

407
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,900
The guest has been waiting for an hour.

408
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,259
Where is Sun Siwei?

409
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,940
Yan. I've urged her twice.

410
00:20:00,219 --> 00:20:01,580
Try to fetch her, okay?

411
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,019
I...

412
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,900
How dare you call me by my name?

413
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:08,860
Sorry, Siwei.

414
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,420
Why don't we first...

415
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,620
Do you know why you can't replace me

416
00:20:12,699 --> 00:20:13,900
as the host?

417
00:20:15,259 --> 00:20:16,779
Because you only scheme

418
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,180
behind the scenes.

419
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:20,059
It's just too low-class.

420
00:20:21,739 --> 00:20:24,140
A mere planner like you
wants to become a host?

421
00:20:24,699 --> 00:20:26,380
Are you even qualified?

422
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,820
Besides,

423
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,620
you can't even do your job right.

424
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,059
What is this script?

425
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,539
(Script)
The lines are so convoluted.

426
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,620
Every time we record this show,

427
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,420
I can't use your scripts

428
00:20:38,459 --> 00:20:39,699
and have to improvise.

429
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:41,140
The guests you book

430
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:42,219
keep getting worse.

431
00:20:42,499 --> 00:20:44,259
The topics get increasingly boring.

432
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:44,900
And you think

433
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,340
you can be a host?

434
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:51,699
Siwei,

435
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,100
if you don't like the script,

436
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,739
I can revise it right now.

437
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,900
But some guests have mentioned

438
00:20:59,979 --> 00:21:01,380
that the interview

439
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,620
doesn't match the script.

440
00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:03,539
What's going on?

441
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,219
Are you blaming this on me?

442
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:07,420
What now?

443
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,100
You're dating some rich guy.

444
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,059
So you think you can be in charge?

445
00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:18,259
You'd better know your place.

446
00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:21,019
Those rich guys

447
00:21:21,499 --> 00:21:22,699
have relationships that last

448
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,059
a month or two at most.

449
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,299
Instead of wasting time there,

450
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,259
you should focus on pleasing me.

451
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,900
I call the shots here.

452
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:34,820
I can kick you out with just one word.

453
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,820
Where is the guest?

454
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,100
(Weekly Ratings)
The weekly ratings are out.

455
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,340
See for yourself.

456
00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:48,979
Mr. Zhou,

457
00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:51,979
the low ratings for this episode

458
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:52,979
are my responsibility.

459
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,539
I tried communicating

460
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,739
with the host about the guests.

461
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,140
But she...

462
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,820
Could you please

463
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,779
talk to her?

464
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,539
Xu,

465
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:05,420
I know it's challenging.

466
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,860
But a successful show

467
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,940
requires great teamwork.

468
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,140
As the planner, you need to
consider the bigger picture.

469
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,100
Do you agree?

470
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:15,699
Found a guest for next week?

471
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,180
Yes.

472
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,259
We're contacting Mr. Sanmu,

473
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:21,820
founder of Sanmu Art Museum,

474
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,459
to appear on our show.

475
00:22:25,699 --> 00:22:26,420
He said he'd come?

476
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,380
He's interested

477
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,699
and has to check

478
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,539
his schedule.

479
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:31,739
So it's not confirmed yet.

480
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,259
Xu Yan,

481
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:35,299
you've worked here long enough.

482
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,860
You should know

483
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,140
that as the planner of the Family Feast,

484
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,180
your job is to make a great show

485
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,059
and invite popular guests.

486
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:47,019
Don't rush

487
00:22:47,739 --> 00:22:49,259
to apply to be a host.

488
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,499
Let me remind you.

489
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:55,299
If the ratings keep dropping next week,

490
00:22:57,739 --> 00:22:59,100
management will reconsider

491
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,900
your position here.

492
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,180
Still working?

493
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,340
I haven't secured guests

494
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,420
for the next episode.

495
00:23:20,459 --> 00:23:23,180
So, we need backup scripts.

496
00:23:32,228 --> 00:23:34,192
(Mr. Sanmu)

497
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,019
I've been reaching out for so long.

498
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,739
Mr. Sanmu is a friend I made in London.

499
00:23:44,219 --> 00:23:45,072
This museum contains

500
00:23:45,072 --> 00:23:46,180
(Sanmu Art Museum)
his private collection.

501
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,259
I've set up a meeting.

502
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,499
He'll contact you.

503
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:51,900
Thank you.

504
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,620
No problem.

505
00:23:53,739 --> 00:23:54,739
Let me note down

506
00:23:54,739 --> 00:23:55,660
his phone number.

507
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:02,660
How do you know about my work?

508
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,979
Because I have

509
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,699
my informants there.

510
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,019
Oh.

511
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,820
I meant to ask you.

512
00:24:33,219 --> 00:24:35,580

Hello, sir.

589
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:07,580
I'm here for the interview.

590
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,499
I'm Amy.

591
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,299
Prune and repot that agave.

592
00:29:15,979 --> 00:29:16,580
Got it.

593
00:29:21,499 --> 00:29:22,539
Your resume says

594
00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:24,459
you've worked on agaves for ages.

595
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,739
It hasn't been that long.

596
00:29:26,699 --> 00:29:28,459
Compared to you,

597
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,420
I'm just a beginner.

598
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:32,779
Very few girls like agaves.

599
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,660
Why are you interested?

600
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,180
Because of its extraordinary resilience.

601
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,019
It was crafted by Earth

602
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:44,420
100 million years ago.

603
00:29:51,739 --> 00:29:53,100
They coexisted with dinosaurs,

604
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,180
thriving in rocky terrains,

605
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,059
enduring harsh elements.

606
00:29:57,979 --> 00:29:59,059
Their shape

607
00:29:59,499 --> 00:30:01,580
resembles dragon tongues,

608
00:30:01,739 --> 00:30:02,539
as legends say.

609
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,299
But most importantly,

610
00:30:07,219 --> 00:30:08,380
I can shape them

611
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,499
as I desire.

612
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:22,140
Every plant cultivator

613
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,340
has a unique perspective.

614
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:26,420
Some people prefer

615
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,820
natural growth.

616
00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:29,860
Others, however,

617
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:32,140
favor controlled cultivation.

618
00:30:32,699 --> 00:30:34,180
But my philosophy is

619
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,860
I must shape it into

620
00:30:37,979 --> 00:30:39,140
the form I envision.

621
00:30:53,499 --> 00:30:54,940
So I will use intense lighting

622
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,459
to suppress leaf expansion,

623
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,420
precisely regulate
fertilizer and watering,

624
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,860
and monitor soil and ventilation.

625
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,499
Every minute change

626
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,779
must remain

627
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,140
under my supervision.

628
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:08,580
Only through this

629
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,580
can it achieve its full potential.

630
00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:12,660
Start working tomorrow.

631
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,019
Okay.

632
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,860
But what about your current job

633
00:31:23,539 --> 00:31:24,779
if you come to work here,

634
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,459
Miss Xu?

635
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:36,180
Miss Xu Yan.

636
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,019
You're very smart.

637
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,259
You're a great show planner

638
00:31:42,699 --> 00:31:43,699
and a superb actress.

639
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,459
To approach me,

640
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,940
you studied so much

641
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:50,100
about agave cultivation

642
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:51,860
and practiced

643
00:31:52,299 --> 00:31:53,539
gardening techniques.

644
00:31:54,699 --> 00:31:56,459
And you disguised yourself well.

645
00:31:58,299 --> 00:32:00,539
Judging from your clothing and resume,

646
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:02,979
average people

647
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:05,499
won't be able to spot the lies.

648
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,459
Unfortunately,

649
00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:13,019
your assistant

650
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:14,420
who's been contacting me

651
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,100
once posted

652
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:18,180
(Weibo)
your photo on Weibo.

653
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,459
But your philosophy

654
00:32:30,459 --> 00:32:31,299
impressed me.

655
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:33,459
I stand by what I said.

656
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,100
No interviews.

657
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:38,059
You may leave now.

658
00:32:44,059 --> 00:32:45,539
I'm sorry, Mr. Shen.

659
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,660
This isn't

660
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,059
how I wanted to make your acquaintance.

661
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,259
I respect

662
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,860
your decision

663
00:32:58,499 --> 00:32:59,660
regarding the interview.

664
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,820
However,

665
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,420
I did prepare a gift

666
00:33:05,539 --> 00:33:06,620
for you.

667
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,420
It's a pruning shear crafted

668
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,299
by Mr. Yiding,

669
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,739
the renowned botanist.

670
00:33:17,459 --> 00:33:18,580
I believe

671
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,059
you will like this.

672
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,059
Miss,

673
00:33:23,219 --> 00:33:24,580
you've come many times.

674
00:33:24,699 --> 00:33:26,459
Haven't you found anything you like?

675
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:29,180
Let me look around.

676
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,219
I'm indecisive.

677
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,059
No rush.

678
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:31,940
Take your time.

679
00:33:31,979 --> 00:33:32,979
Tell me if you need me.

680
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:33,499
Thanks.

681
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,739
Careful there.

682
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,459
Take this to the back.

683
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:42,860
That...

684
00:33:44,219 --> 00:33:44,860
Let me help you.

685
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,420
Yeah.

686
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:45,779
Here.

687
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,820
If I lose this,

688
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,580
I'd get fired.

689
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,340
It's so valuable?

690
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,580
It's my boss's personal garden fork,

691
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,016
crafted by Mr. Yiding.

692
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,140
It's precious.

693
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,380
Seems you've thoroughly

694
00:34:10,059 --> 00:34:11,340
researched my preferences.

695
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,659
However,

696
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:15,220
it's quite pointless.

697
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,979
That's not true.

698
00:34:18,979 --> 00:34:21,340
You found this limited-edition.

699
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,820
It shows your dedication.

700
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,340
I have something for you too.

701
00:34:32,499 --> 00:34:33,700
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

702
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,659
Open it.

703
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,499
Is it a coincidence?

704
00:34:46,979 --> 00:34:47,780
Of course not.

705
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,380
Every move I made

706
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,139
was under your surveillance.

707
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,260
A pretty lady like you

708
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,340
visits my shop so often.

709
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:07,979
How could I not notice you?

710
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,420
I thought I was being subtle.

711
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:15,139
So you knew it all along.

712
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,579
You enjoy taking the initiative, right?

713
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,420
I've read your articles online.

714
00:35:26,979 --> 00:35:28,420
"My grandma's eyesight was failing,

715
00:35:29,059 --> 00:35:30,059
but she collected

716
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,979
osmanthus flowers early in the morning.

717
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,900
I would come home from school

718
00:35:35,659 --> 00:35:36,619
and see her

719
00:35:37,139 --> 00:35:39,619
through the window.

720
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,940
(Wearing reading glasses,)

721
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,139
(she was baking the petals.)

722
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:48,579
(She told me that)

723
00:35:50,059 --> 00:35:51,499
(the osmanthus jam won't be sweet)

724
00:35:52,539 --> 00:35:53,900
(if we miss the blooming season.)

725
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,300
(If your grandmother)

726
00:35:57,659 --> 00:36:00,340
(had also made osmanthus jam for you,)

727
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,300
I don't believe

728
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,780
you could be filled with loneliness."

729
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,979
Your writing is full of emotion.

730
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,940
It deeply moved me.

731
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,740
I believe

732
00:36:21,459 --> 00:36:23,139
you love osmanthus jam very much.

733
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,220
What?

734
00:36:37,659 --> 00:36:38,900
He recognized you.

735
00:36:40,539 --> 00:36:41,860
Did he give you a hard time?

736
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:44,820
Not exactly.

737
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:48,300
But he still refused the interview.

738
00:36:49,659 --> 00:36:50,820
What a stubborn guy.

739
00:36:54,099 --> 00:36:55,260
Let's not judge him.

740
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,820
Maybe

741
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,059
he has his reasons.

742
00:36:59,300 --> 00:36:59,940
Or...

743
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:00,940
