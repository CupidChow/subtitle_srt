By the way,
there's something I want to tell you.

30
00:02:15,915 --> 00:02:16,755
I'm getting married.

31
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:20,674
Marry whom?

32
00:02:21,755 --> 00:02:25,554
Is it someone you knew from London?

33
00:02:26,315 --> 00:02:26,995
No, it's not.

34
00:02:27,634 --> 00:02:29,234
I'll introduce you two later.

35
00:02:29,794 --> 00:02:30,715
Go back early.

36
00:02:58,715 --> 00:02:59,234
Sir.

37
00:02:59,394 --> 00:03:00,475
Sorry I'm late.

38
00:03:00,954 --> 00:03:02,595
- Hurry.
- Okay.

39
00:03:11,035 --> 00:03:12,035
Excuse me, may I ask

40
00:03:12,315 --> 00:03:13,435
what dishes to cook today?

41
00:03:13,954 --> 00:03:14,794
Garden salad.

42
00:03:18,195 --> 00:03:19,634
Haven't we met before?

43
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:22,875
Jinda Group.

44
00:03:24,595 --> 00:03:25,554
Do we know each other?

45
00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:28,715
We met once at the company.

46
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,195
Hi, I'm Xu Yan.

47
00:03:32,595 --> 00:03:33,995
Hello, I'm Fang Lei.

48
00:03:34,275 --> 00:03:35,674
I'm Shen Haoming's fiancée.

49
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:43,755
His junior schoolmate.

50
00:03:45,755 --> 00:03:47,114
We attended school together

51
00:03:47,554 --> 00:03:48,514
when we were in London.

52
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:52,995
And our families have been
close friends for generations.

53
00:03:54,915 --> 00:03:55,755
In that case,

54
00:03:55,794 --> 00:03:57,155
you've known each other for years.

55
00:03:58,554 --> 00:03:59,394
Sixteen years old.

56
00:04:01,514 --> 00:04:02,634
Since sixteen years old.

57
00:04:05,595 --> 00:04:06,794
So like his little sister.

58
00:04:09,234 --> 00:04:10,275
Come visit us often.

59
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:11,514
We can go shopping.

60
00:04:12,954 --> 00:04:13,475
Alright.

61
00:04:48,395 --> 00:04:51,674
Lei, you're so good at it.

62
00:04:51,715 --> 00:04:53,275
This looks so appetizing.

63
00:04:58,075 --> 00:04:59,035
Can I try some?

64
00:05:01,314 --> 00:05:03,395
- Of course.
- Thanks.

65
00:05:14,794 --> 00:05:15,635
Delicious.

66
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:17,194
Are you busy later?

67
00:05:17,395 --> 00:05:18,194
Let's have a meal,

68
00:05:18,354 --> 00:05:19,354
so you can teach me.

69
00:05:21,794 --> 00:05:22,354
Okay.

70
00:05:28,754 --> 00:05:30,794
Xu Yan, thank you for treating me.

71
00:05:32,754 --> 00:05:33,595
Between you and me,

72
00:05:33,674 --> 00:05:34,635
no need to be so formal.

73
00:05:35,314 --> 00:05:36,434
Let's meet up more often.

74
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:42,515
I'm glad

75
00:05:42,994 --> 00:05:43,915
you care for me.

76
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:45,475
When I was abroad,

77
00:05:45,754 --> 00:05:46,515
I was so young.

78
00:05:47,075 --> 00:05:49,994
Haoming always worried I'd get homesick

79
00:05:50,234 --> 00:05:51,715
and feared foreigners might bully me,

80
00:05:52,035 --> 00:05:54,515
so he visited whenever he had time.

81
00:05:56,915 --> 00:05:57,915
You're like his sister,

82
00:05:57,955 --> 00:05:59,114
so it's natural.

83
00:05:59,754 --> 00:06:01,395
He should've done even better.

84
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:08,674
I just started at Jinda Group,

85
00:06:09,275 --> 00:06:11,354
and Haoming put me on his project.

86
00:06:12,314 --> 00:06:14,114
Now I have to bother him again.

87
00:06:17,035 --> 00:06:18,234
Do your job well,

88
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:20,194
then you won't trouble him, right?

89
00:06:24,794 --> 00:06:26,595
Lei, don't drink that much.

90
00:06:26,715 --> 00:06:28,395
Let's eat. They're delicious.

91
00:06:33,754 --> 00:06:35,434
Seeing Haoming marry someone

92
00:06:35,515 --> 00:06:37,835
so beautiful and accomplished,

93
00:06:38,754 --> 00:06:39,955
I'm really happy for him.

94
00:06:42,395 --> 00:06:43,635
This is my first time

96
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:48,475

You're such a well-matched couple.

192
00:11:43,794 --> 00:11:44,995
- Congratulations!
- Thanks.

193
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:45,755
Since we met here,

194
00:11:45,794 --> 00:11:46,794
if you don't mind,

195
00:11:47,115 --> 00:11:48,434
come join us.

196
00:11:49,755 --> 00:11:51,434
Would it bother you?

197
00:11:51,674 --> 00:11:52,035
No.

198
00:11:52,155 --> 00:11:52,915
Please, come in.

199
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:53,954
This way, please.

200
00:11:54,355 --> 00:11:54,674
Please.

201
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,035
- What's your surname?
- Xu.

202
00:11:56,794 --> 00:11:58,355
Same surname to Xu Yan.

203
00:11:58,474 --> 00:12:00,314
Exactly, I'm also a Xu.

204
00:12:01,194 --> 00:12:01,554
Surprise.

205
00:12:01,594 --> 00:12:01,915
Hello.

206
00:12:02,474 --> 00:12:03,474
Yan, I'll take him in.

207
00:12:03,954 --> 00:12:04,314
Alright.

208
00:12:05,035 --> 00:12:05,355
Come on.

209
00:12:07,355 --> 00:12:07,800
Come on.

210
00:12:13,235 --> 00:12:13,875
Thank you, Dad.

211
00:12:14,594 --> 00:12:15,275
Thank you, Mom.

212
00:12:16,314 --> 00:12:16,594
Thanks.

213
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:17,594
Thank you, Ms. Ma.

214
00:12:18,235 --> 00:12:18,674
Thank you.

215
00:12:18,755 --> 00:12:19,395
Cheers.

216
00:12:19,515 --> 00:12:19,995
Thank you.

217
00:12:25,635 --> 00:12:26,554
Have a toast.

218
00:12:27,794 --> 00:12:28,115
Here.

219
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:29,834
Come on.

220
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:31,515
Haoming. Congratulations!

221
00:12:31,594 --> 00:12:32,434
- Cheers!
- Thanks!

222
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,515
Haoming, what a wonderful wedding.

223
00:12:34,794 --> 00:12:36,594
You're a workaholic.

224
00:12:37,115 --> 00:12:39,074
Was all this prepared by Yan?

225
00:12:40,035 --> 00:12:41,875
So this toast shouldn't go to you.

226
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:44,275
To our beautiful and capable Yan!

227
00:12:44,314 --> 00:12:45,434
To Yan!

228
00:12:45,594 --> 00:12:47,235
Xu Yan has already had enough drink.

229
00:12:47,275 --> 00:12:48,275
No more drink.

230
00:12:48,515 --> 00:12:50,074
I'll take this drink for her.

231
00:12:50,954 --> 00:12:51,554
Liquor?

232
00:12:52,074 --> 00:12:52,995
Drink three glasses.

233
00:12:53,794 --> 00:12:54,834
Yes, three glasses!

234
00:12:55,235 --> 00:12:55,594
Come on.

235
00:12:55,794 --> 00:12:56,635
Three glasses it is!

236
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:57,194
Good.

237
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:58,035
First!

238
00:12:59,954 --> 00:13:00,875
Impressive!

239
00:13:01,194 --> 00:13:01,794
Another one!

240
00:13:03,594 --> 00:13:04,235
Second!

241
00:13:05,434 --> 00:13:06,474
- Amazing!
- Good!

242
00:13:06,594 --> 00:13:07,355
One more to go!

243
00:13:10,035 --> 00:13:10,474
Alright.

244
00:13:10,594 --> 00:13:11,395
Last one!

245
00:13:11,395 --> 00:13:11,995
Third one!

246
00:13:12,115 --> 00:13:13,314
- Another!
- The final one!

247
00:13:14,074 --> 00:13:14,515
Mr. Shen.

248
00:13:14,714 --> 00:13:15,275
Mr. Xu.

249
00:13:15,275 --> 00:13:15,674
Mr. Xu.

250
00:13:15,714 --> 00:13:16,915
Honored to attend

251
00:13:16,915 --> 00:13:17,656
Xu Yan's wedding.

252
00:13:17,995 --> 00:13:18,554
We two...

253
00:13:18,594 --> 00:13:19,474
Enjoy your drinks.

254
00:13:20,474 --> 00:13:21,434
Thank you.

255
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:22,875
Thank you, everyone.

256
00:13:22,995 --> 00:13:23,515
Alright.

257
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:24,594
Next table.

258
00:13:25,035 --> 00:13:25,474
Come on.

259
00:13:26,074 --> 00:13:27,635
Mr. Xu, you came to Jingzhou for...

260
00:13:27,794 --> 00:13:28,355
For vacation.

261
00:13:28,995 --> 00:13:29,875
Stay for a few days,

262
00:13:30,194 --> 00:13:31,115
then go to hometown.

263
00:13:31,515 --> 00:13:32,635
Why the rush?

264
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:33,995
Stay in Jingzhou longer.

265
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:37,074
I'm reaching retirement age,

266
00:13:37,155 --> 00:13:38,314
planning to return and settle

267
00:13:38,995 --> 00:13:41,515
back in my hometown.

268
00:13:42,035 --> 00:13:42,755
Great.

269
00:13:43,074 --> 00:13:44,954
The medical facilities, shopping,

270
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:46,355
and everything is much better.

271
00:13:47,355 --> 00:13:50,456
Mr. Xu, what do you do overseas?

272
00:13:50,456 --> 00:13:51,314
Architecture studies.

273
00:13:51,635 --> 00:13:52,594
Construction?

274
00:13:52,995 --> 00:13:54,755
Then you're in the same field
as my in-law.

275
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:55,995
Really?

276
00:13:57,834 --> 00:14:00,115
What a double fate!

277
00:14:00,434 --> 00:14:01,554
Cheers!

278
00:14:04,696 --> 00:14:05,877
You look gorgeous.

279
00:14:05,995 --> 00:14:06,834
One more.

280
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:07,714
Cheers!

281
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:09,194
Thank you.

282
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:10,395
Come on.

283
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:10,875
Yan.

284
00:14:11,794 --> 00:14:12,794
Your classmate's parents

285
00:14:12,995 --> 00:14:14,074
came here first time.

286
00:14:14,794 --> 00:14:15,714
Go greet them.

287
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,794
Okay, I'll be right back.

288
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,434
Your dress looks lovely.

289
00:14:23,635 --> 00:14:24,115
Come on.

290
00:14:24,915 --> 00:14:25,674
How many more?

291
00:14:26,434 --> 00:14:27,115
One last glass.

292
00:14:27,155 --> 00:14:27,594
One glass.

293
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:28,275
I'll drink.

294
00:14:28,594 --> 00:14:29,275
He has

295
00:14:29,594 --> 00:14:32,275
deep expertise in architecture,

296
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:33,635
even wrote a book,

297
00:14:33,674 --> 00:14:34,714
called... something...

298
00:14:34,954 --> 00:14:36,594
Sustainable Building Design.

299
00:14:39,035 --> 00:14:40,155
My father specializes in

300
00:14:40,194 --> 00:14:41,714
sustainable building research.

301
00:14:44,074 --> 00:14:46,594
My research focuses
on architectural mechanics.

302
00:14:47,035 --> 00:14:49,194
Though in the same field,
our focuses differ.

303
00:14:49,794 --> 00:14:51,714
Let's chat if you have time.

304
00:14:52,314 --> 00:14:53,115
Absolutely.

305
00:14:53,395 --> 00:14:54,115
Mr. Xu.

306
00:14:54,554 --> 00:14:56,074
We've finally gathered today.

307
00:14:56,115 --> 00:14:57,275
Why don't we take a photo?

308
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:58,954
You can show it to Jiajia. How's it?

309
00:14:59,115 --> 00:14:59,755
Great idea.

310
00:14:59,794 --> 00:15:00,235
Come on.

311
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:00,554
Okay.

312
00:15:00,554 --> 00:15:01,115
Take a photo.

313
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:01,755
Alright.

314
00:15:01,794 --> 00:15:02,714
Take a photo.

315
00:15:02,755 --> 00:15:03,834
I'll get Haoming.

316
00:15:04,434 --> 00:15:04,794
Alright.

317
00:15:04,834 --> 00:15:05,474
Let's be here.

318
00:15:05,474 --> 00:15:05,834
Alright?

319
00:15:05,915 --> 00:15:06,474
This way.

320
00:15:06,594 --> 00:15:07,194
This way.

321
00:15:07,275 --> 00:15:07,915
This spot, okay?

322
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:09,915
You silly!

323
00:15:09,915 --> 00:15:11,155
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

324
00:15:11,155 --> 00:15:11,915
Sorry, sorry.

325
00:15:11,915 --> 00:15:12,434
Let me.

326
00:15:13,035 --> 00:15:13,915
Look at this mess.

327
00:15:13,915 --> 00:15:14,674
Here.

328
00:15:14,995 --> 00:15:15,954
So sorry.

329
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,515
I'm sorry.

330
00:15:17,755 --> 00:15:18,554
It's fine.

331
00:15:19,035 --> 00:15:19,635
I'm so sorry.

332
00:15:19,674 --> 00:15:20,434
I live upstairs.

333
00:15:21,074 --> 00:15:21,915
I'll go change.

334
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:23,194
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

335
00:15:23,194 --> 00:15:24,355
We'll cover the dry cleaning.

336
00:15:24,474 --> 00:15:25,915
We're so sorry.

337
00:15:25,954 --> 00:15:26,834
Don't mind it.

338
00:15:26,915 --> 00:15:27,794
The wedding matters.

339
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:28,235
See you.

340
00:15:28,474 --> 00:15:28,954
Alright.

341
00:15:29,074 --> 00:15:30,275
I'm sorry.

342
00:15:31,194 --> 00:15:31,714
This way.

343
00:15:40,554 --> 00:15:41,554
I'm really sorry.

344
00:15:41,755 --> 00:15:42,635
I'll have them get you

345
00:15:42,674 --> 00:15:43,314
a new suit.

346
00:15:43,314 --> 00:15:43,875
No need.

347
00:15:43,995 --> 00:15:45,035
I have one upstairs.

348
00:15:46,035 --> 00:15:46,395
Okay.

349
00:15:46,995 --> 00:15:47,794
Your turn.

350
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:48,995
Haoming.

351
00:15:49,355 --> 00:15:49,954
Happy wedding!

352
00:15:50,355 --> 00:15:50,714
Thanks.

353
00:15:50,755 --> 00:15:52,035
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

354
00:15:52,674 --> 00:15:53,594
Let me introduce you.

355
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,474
She's my sister,
just graduated from law school.

356
00:15:57,954 --> 00:15:58,834
- Impressive!
- Great.

357
00:15:58,834 --> 00:15:59,714
You know what?

358
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:01,035
She's still single.

359
00:16:01,714 --> 00:16:02,474
Be proactive.

360
00:16:03,434 --> 00:16:04,395
What a coincidence!

361
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:06,194
Haoming and I go way back.

362
00:16:06,515 --> 00:16:07,074
I'm single.

363
00:16:08,155 --> 00:16:08,755
Add my WeChat.

364
00:16:09,155 --> 00:16:11,115
Haoming, what's her name?

365
00:16:11,915 --> 00:16:12,474

366
00:16:13,635 --> 00:16:14,155
Miss Fang.

367
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,035

368
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:15,515

Add my WeChat too.

371
00:16:21,635 --> 00:16:25,395
Miss Fang, hello.

372
00:16:25,794 --> 00:16:28,035
I'm Han Weiping, from legal department
of Jinda Group.

373
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,155
Can I add your WeChat?

374
00:16:31,635 --> 00:16:32,155
It'd better

375
00:16:32,515 --> 00:16:33,194
to keep in touch.

376
00:16:33,755 --> 00:16:34,275

Done.

Miss Fang, add me.

386
00:16:45,554 --> 00:16:46,008
Okay.

387
00:17:14,155 --> 00:17:15,115
(At the infinity pool.)

388
00:17:33,034 --> 00:17:34,274
(Think drunk people)

389
00:17:34,315 --> 00:17:35,795
(drown easily?)

390
00:18:20,555 --> 00:18:21,954
Being drunk in a pool isn't safe.

391
00:18:22,474 --> 00:18:23,032
Come up!

392
00:18:25,595 --> 00:18:26,555
I don't want to go back.

393
00:18:27,155 --> 00:18:28,754
I need to sober up here.

394
00:18:30,555 --> 00:18:31,194
Suit yourself.

395
00:18:31,795 --> 00:18:33,835
Aren't you afraid
I'll drown like my sister did?

396
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:44,595
Don't ever say that.

397
00:18:46,234 --> 00:18:46,994
It brings bad luck.

398
00:18:48,274 --> 00:18:49,274
This is my wedding day.

399
00:18:49,555 --> 00:18:51,034
Is this drama necessary?

400
00:19:09,635 --> 00:19:10,355
Haoming.

401
00:19:12,315 --> 00:19:13,875
Remember our first meeting?

402
00:19:18,714 --> 00:19:19,674
I remember very clearly

403
00:19:20,954 --> 00:19:23,835
what color you're wearing that day.

404
00:19:24,954 --> 00:19:26,434
Even the sunlight that day

405
00:19:27,674 --> 00:19:29,315
and the scent in the air,

406
00:19:30,915 --> 00:19:34,795
I remember every single detail.

407
00:19:41,795 --> 00:19:43,915
I thought I could let you go,

408
00:19:48,034 --> 00:19:49,555
but seeing you get married today,

409
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:52,395
watching you walk down the aisle,

410
00:19:53,754 --> 00:19:54,474
I realize

411
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,555
I can never let you go.

412
00:20:02,474 --> 00:20:03,315
Shen Haoming,

413
00:20:05,635 --> 00:20:06,315
I love you.

414
00:20:10,635 --> 00:20:11,434
I'm married now.

415
00:20:12,434 --> 00:20:13,075
Back off.

416
00:20:15,034 --> 00:20:16,155
You mean that woman?

417
00:20:16,795 --> 00:20:18,835
Don't think she's that naive.

418
00:20:20,155 --> 00:20:21,795
She pretended to be close with me

419
00:20:21,835 --> 00:20:22,514
once we met,

420
00:20:22,954 --> 00:20:24,434
just to figure out our relationship.

421
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:27,355
That Xu Yan is calculating.

422
00:20:28,714 --> 00:20:30,034
Why marry her?

423
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,034
Your performance at the wedding today

424
00:20:34,355 --> 00:20:35,315
was quite dramatic.

425
00:20:36,274 --> 00:20:37,155
No need

426
00:20:37,514 --> 00:20:39,514
to overthink anything.

427
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:40,514
Just drop it.

428
00:20:41,315 --> 00:20:42,075
Once sobered up,

429
00:20:43,194 --> 00:20:43,954
go home.

430
00:21:05,754 --> 00:21:06,795
Won't we miss our flight?

431
00:21:07,155 --> 00:21:07,595
Relax.

432
00:21:08,315 --> 00:21:08,835
Haoming.

433
00:21:09,315 --> 00:21:09,915
Yan.

434
00:21:12,514 --> 00:21:13,954
Leaving for your honeymoon now?

435
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:15,355
Yes.

436
00:21:17,274 --> 00:21:19,034
You drank so much for me yesterday.

437
00:21:19,915 --> 00:21:20,754
Feeling okay?

438
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,395
I was completely drunk.

439
00:21:23,514 --> 00:21:24,434
Don't even remember

440
00:21:24,474 --> 00:21:25,555
how I got home.

441
00:21:26,835 --> 00:21:27,315
Right.

442
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:28,915
Last night,

443
00:21:29,075 --> 00:21:30,674
did I cause any trouble?

444
00:21:31,274 --> 00:21:31,635
No.

445
00:21:33,555 --> 00:21:34,635
Glad to hear that.

446
00:21:38,395 --> 00:21:38,915
Yan.

447
00:21:39,635 --> 00:21:40,315
You two talk.

448
00:21:40,795 --> 00:21:41,635
I'll wait in the car.

449
00:21:46,315 --> 00:21:47,155
Haoming said

450
00:21:47,194 --> 00:21:48,395
you're honeymooning in London.

451
00:21:49,194 --> 00:21:51,194
There's a great steakhouse over there.

452
00:21:51,795 --> 00:21:54,034
Haoming used to take me there often.

453
00:22:00,315 --> 00:22:01,395
What places did Haoming

454
00:22:01,434 --> 00:22:02,194
take you before?

455
00:22:03,915 --> 00:22:05,395
Please sort it out and send it to me.

456
00:22:08,075 --> 00:22:09,514
Don't go in the pool after drinking.

457
00:22:11,234 --> 00:22:12,155
You could be drowned.

458
00:22:51,434 --> 00:22:51,994
Mr. Shen.

459
00:22:52,395 --> 00:22:52,875
Yan.

460
00:22:53,674 --> 00:22:54,474
You're finally back.

461
00:22:54,954 --> 00:22:55,835
We've missed you!

462
00:22:57,115 --> 00:22:58,714
We brought souvenirs for everyone.

463
00:22:59,034 --> 00:23:00,115
The driver'll bring them up

464
00:23:00,355 --> 00:23:00,875
to you.

465
00:23:02,234 --> 00:23:02,635
Got it.

466
00:23:03,075 --> 00:23:03,635
Thank you.

467
00:23:11,075 --> 00:23:11,835
Han Weiping,

468
00:23:12,954 --> 00:23:14,915
Jinda Group's
newly hired legal consultant,

469
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:16,555
young and capable.

470
00:23:17,595 --> 00:23:19,234
They met at our wedding.

471
00:23:20,754 --> 00:23:21,875
Lei has good taste.

472
00:23:23,595 --> 00:23:24,155
Let's go.

473
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,714
By the way,
let's go visit Grandma in a few days.

474
00:23:31,395 --> 00:23:32,474
But we just got back.

475
00:23:32,714 --> 00:23:34,514
It's fine. It won't affect work.

476
00:23:35,155 --> 00:23:36,234
I've asked for leave.

477
00:23:40,674 --> 00:23:41,075
Okay.

478
00:23:42,355 --> 00:23:44,434
We can bring Grandma her gifts.

479
00:23:44,795 --> 00:23:45,115
Alright.

Yan.

488
00:24:06,835 --> 00:24:07,915
You fell asleep?

489
00:24:07,994 --> 00:24:09,994
I really miss you!

490
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:11,075
Let me see.

491
00:24:11,555 --> 00:24:12,595
You've lost weight!

492
00:24:12,674 --> 00:24:13,395
Again?

493
00:24:13,434 --> 00:24:14,595
Haven't you been eating well?

494
00:24:14,714 --> 00:24:16,034
You're the one who's lost weight.

495
00:24:16,754 --> 00:24:18,315
No way. You...

496
00:24:19,595 --> 00:24:20,194
Hello, Grandma.

497
00:24:20,355 --> 00:24:22,315
I'm your grandson-in-law, Shen Haoming.

498
00:24:22,595 --> 00:24:23,674
I brought you some gifts.

499
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:27,595
What a handsome man!

500
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:29,875
Welcome home.

501
00:24:29,915 --> 00:24:30,395
Come in.

502
00:24:30,395 --> 00:24:31,194
Come in.

503
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,595
You didn't need to bring

504
00:24:33,674 --> 00:24:35,355
so many gifts to me.

505
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:37,355
I can't possibly eat all this by myself.

506
00:24:37,395 --> 00:24:40,355
I brought glucosamine for you.

507
00:24:40,434 --> 00:24:42,434
It helps prevent osteoporosis.

508
00:24:42,635 --> 00:24:43,234
Too much!

509
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,234
Haoming said

510
00:24:44,355 --> 00:24:46,514
you need to keep taking this fish oil.

511
00:24:46,595 --> 00:24:49,075
It helps lower your cholesterol.

512
00:24:49,075 --> 00:24:50,264
Do you know?

513
00:24:56,555 --> 00:24:57,034
Grandma.

514
00:24:57,434 --> 00:24:58,355
It smells wonderful.

515
00:24:59,115 --> 00:24:59,754
What's this?

516
00:25:00,234 --> 00:25:01,075
This...

517
00:25:01,395 --> 00:25:02,395
Fresh greens.

518
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,234
You city folks can't get this.

519
00:25:04,635 --> 00:25:05,555
I picked them fresh

520
00:25:05,595 --> 00:25:07,434
at the vegetable patch this afternoon.

521
00:25:07,795 --> 00:25:09,555
You city people always talk about

522
00:25:09,835 --> 00:25:11,274
green and eco-friendly,

523
00:25:11,754 --> 00:25:12,754
and pollution-free.

524
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:15,875
What's that dish then?

525
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:18,075
Oxtail and taro stew.

526
00:25:19,115 --> 00:25:20,155
Nourishing.

527
00:25:22,234 --> 00:25:24,514
Grandma, you live here alone.

528
00:25:25,034 --> 00:25:27,034
So Yan's parents...

529
00:25:27,155 --> 00:25:27,754
Grandma.

530
00:25:29,155 --> 00:25:29,635
This one.

531
00:25:30,115 --> 00:25:31,835
I brought your favorite photo.

532
00:25:32,434 --> 00:25:33,875
I'll hang it...

533
00:25:34,355 --> 00:25:35,234
In the bedroom

534
00:25:35,514 --> 00:25:36,754
where I can easily see.

535
00:25:37,714 --> 00:25:38,635
Go on!

536
00:25:38,754 --> 00:25:39,795
It's all greasy smoke.

537
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:40,994
- Don't stay here.
- Come.

538
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:42,456
Right.

539
00:25:43,234 --> 00:25:44,115
Serve it up!

540
00:25:49,234 --> 00:25:49,795
Look.

541
00:25:50,994 --> 00:25:51,595
Is this okay?

542
00:25:52,754 --> 00:25:54,434
It seems slightly tilted to the left.

543
00:26:04,714 --> 00:26:05,274
Yan.

544
00:26:05,915 --> 00:26:06,555
Is this okay?

545
00:26:08,994 --> 00:26:09,555
Good.

546
00:26:14,514 --> 00:26:15,194
Perfect.

547
00:26:35,915 --> 00:26:36,674
Yan,

548
00:26:37,315 --> 00:26:39,194
I prepared a room for you

549
00:26:39,315 --> 00:26:41,234
with a double bed.

550
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,674
Why don't you sleep there

551
00:26:42,954 --> 00:26:45,355
but squeeze into my bed instead?

552
00:26:45,674 --> 00:26:47,115
I rarely come back.

553
00:26:47,155 --> 00:26:48,635
I want to sleep with you.

554
00:26:49,555 --> 00:26:51,395
You insist on sleeping with me.

555
00:26:51,674 --> 00:26:53,075
You don't come back often.

556
00:26:53,075 --> 00:26:55,994
Just sleep with him, will you?

557
00:26:56,555 --> 00:26:58,155
Why sleep with me?

558
00:26:58,555 --> 00:26:59,514
- Let me.
- It seems...

559
00:27:00,075 --> 00:27:01,075
Hand over your hand.

560
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:03,274
It's that simple?

561
00:27:05,635 --> 00:27:07,835
I can't make it right.

562
00:27:08,954 --> 00:27:09,635
Let me help you.

563
00:27:20,395 --> 00:27:21,194
Yan,

564
00:27:23,674 --> 00:27:26,075
there's something

565
00:27:26,115 --> 00:27:27,714
I need to tell you.

566
00:27:30,595 --> 00:27:34,555
Your father hasn't been well recently,

567
00:27:34,595 --> 00:27:35,635
and he did a body checkup.

568
00:27:36,514 --> 00:27:37,635
The test results

569
00:27:37,674 --> 00:27:40,474
said there's a tumor in his lung.

570
00:27:51,115 --> 00:27:52,994
Is it benign?

571
00:27:53,595 --> 00:27:55,434
It appears benign for now.

572
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:56,714
But the doctor said

573
00:27:56,754 --> 00:27:57,915
he mustn't overexert himself

574
00:27:57,954 --> 00:27:59,315
from now on.

575
00:28:00,155 --> 00:28:01,474
As for whether this benign state

576
00:28:02,315 --> 00:28:03,274
might turn malignant,

577
00:28:03,835 --> 00:28:05,234
the doctor can't guarantee.

578
00:28:10,115 --> 00:28:13,434
I know how you think of him.

579
00:28:14,474 --> 00:28:15,875
But you didn't invite him

580
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:18,395
to your wedding.

581
00:28:20,434 --> 00:28:21,674
Now that he's ill,

582
00:28:22,395 --> 00:28:23,474
I think

583
00:28:24,194 --> 00:28:25,835
you should

584
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:27,194
go visit him.

585
00:28:31,434 --> 00:28:32,674
Is this length okay?

586
00:28:33,115 --> 00:28:33,514
Perfect.

587
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:34,875
Okay, switch hands.

588
00:28:39,274 --> 00:28:41,274
If you don't want to go alone,

589
00:28:41,915 --> 00:28:43,434
I can go with you.

590
00:28:53,474 --> 00:28:54,315
I understand.

591
00:28:56,674 --> 00:28:57,514
Listen.

592
00:28:57,915 --> 00:28:58,355
See?

593
00:28:58,954 --> 00:29:00,115
When trimming nails,

594
00:29:00,555 --> 00:29:02,474
you must cut the edges

595
00:29:02,635 --> 00:29:03,355
like this.

596
00:29:04,194 --> 00:29:04,875
Like this.

597
00:29:05,754 --> 00:29:07,075
Otherwise, you'll get paronychia.

598
00:29:07,194 --> 00:29:08,514
T-This is so difficult.

599
00:29:08,674 --> 00:29:09,754
I always use

600
00:29:09,795 --> 00:29:10,994
small scissors

601
00:29:11,034 --> 00:29:11,954
to trim them.

602
00:29:30,194 --> 00:29:31,034
Shen,

603
00:29:31,795 --> 00:29:33,194
got up so early?

604
00:29:35,115 --> 00:29:36,795
Work habits keep me rising early.

605
00:29:37,714 --> 00:29:39,795
Come grocery shopping with me?

606
00:29:40,034 --> 00:29:41,155
Okay, let's go.

607
00:29:43,274 --> 00:29:44,915
You young people

608
00:29:45,274 --> 00:29:46,555
run big companies

609
00:29:46,674 --> 00:29:48,075
and chase grand career.

610
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,795
You need to balance work and rest.

611
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,875
Health should be your top priority.

612
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:56,234
Only when you're well-rested,

613
00:29:56,234 --> 00:29:57,754
and well-fed

614
00:29:58,115 --> 00:30:01,474
can you achieve great things.

615
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:04,234
Come visit more often.

616
00:30:04,315 --> 00:30:06,474
The fresh air here does wonders.

617
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,075
Okay, I'll do it.

618
00:30:10,234 --> 00:30:12,434
You know, Yan cares about you

619
00:30:12,795 --> 00:30:14,115
most, Grandma.

620
00:30:15,474 --> 00:30:16,635
You're getting old,

621
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:18,674
and it's hard to live alone.

622
00:30:18,954 --> 00:30:20,915
Move to Jingzhou with us, okay?

623
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,075
No, no.

624
00:30:22,555 --> 00:30:24,434
My legs still work fine.

625
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:26,355
I've lived here for my life.

626
00:30:26,434 --> 00:30:28,674
I can't get used to the city life.

627
00:30:29,635 --> 00:30:32,155
Don't worry about me.

628
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:33,674
Rest assured.

629
00:30:34,274 --> 00:30:35,514
If you need anything,

630
00:30:35,915 --> 00:30:37,075
tell us anytime.

631
00:30:39,234 --> 00:30:41,555
Before you leave,

632
00:30:42,714 --> 00:30:45,474
I want to say something to you.

633
00:30:46,355 --> 00:30:46,915
Go ahead.

634
00:30:48,234 --> 00:30:50,514
Every time Yan called,

635
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:52,514
she praised you,

636
00:30:52,595 --> 00:30:53,994
saying you're great

637
00:30:54,234 --> 00:30:55,915
and treating her well.

638
00:30:57,595 --> 00:30:59,194
After I've met you,

639
00:31:00,474 --> 00:31:02,954
you're exactly as she said.

640
00:31:04,954 --> 00:31:05,714
I really like you.

641
00:31:07,434 --> 00:31:08,514
We're a married couple.

642
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:10,474
I should treat her well.

643
00:31:14,635 --> 00:31:15,595
Shen,

644
00:31:17,234 --> 00:31:20,474
I've raised Yan since she was a kid.

645
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:23,674
I'm just an old country woman,

646
00:31:23,714 --> 00:31:25,835
couldn't teach her much.

647
00:31:26,514 --> 00:31:27,555
She might have

648
00:31:28,115 --> 00:31:31,835
some bad habits or whatnot.

649
00:31:34,075 --> 00:31:37,315
If she makes mistakes,

650
00:31:38,434 --> 00:31:40,994
can you be more forgiving?

651
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,000
Okay.

652
00:31:43,474 --> 00:31:46,155
Give her a chance to improve.

653
00:31:46,954 --> 00:31:47,795
Okay?

654
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:50,315
Absolutely, Grandma.

655
00:31:51,315 --> 00:31:52,274
I remember every word

656
00:31:53,034 --> 00:31:53,954
you said.

657
00:31:54,915 --> 00:31:55,896
Rest assured.

658
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:58,835
What do we buy later?

659
00:31:59,795 --> 00:32:00,875
What would you like to eat?

660
00:32:01,075 --> 00:32:02,555
I want oysters.

661
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:06,274
There aren't oysters here.

662
00:32:06,395 --> 00:32:07,954
But we have fresh fish here.

663
00:32:08,514 --> 00:32:09,034
Fish?

664
00:32:28,274 --> 00:32:29,274
(For your treatment.)

665
00:32:29,994 --> 00:32:31,448
(Password is Qiao Lin's birthday.)

666
00:33:17,754 --> 00:33:18,194
We're here.

667
00:33:43,714 --> 00:33:44,754
What do you think?

668
00:33:51,835 --> 00:33:52,835
Blue bricks, gray tiles,

669
00:33:53,635 --> 00:33:54,595
and bamboo groves.

670
00:33:55,395 --> 00:33:57,075
Every inch of this space
seems to whisper

671
00:33:57,474 --> 00:33:59,315
tales of tranquility and peace.

672
00:34:01,434 --> 00:34:03,555
That's why
it's called Jingzhou's retreat.

673
00:34:05,194 --> 00:34:06,994
As expected from
a top journalism student,

674
00:34:07,395 --> 00:34:08,034
so eloquent.

675
00:34:09,234 --> 00:34:10,274
Stop teasing me.

676
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:12,915
I just feel that in such spaces

677
00:34:13,315 --> 00:34:15,034
we should speak poetically

678
00:34:15,514 --> 00:34:16,994
to suit the vibe here.

679
00:34:21,154 --> 00:34:22,634
In this vast city,

680
00:34:22,954 --> 00:34:24,355
having such a serene corner

681
00:34:25,275 --> 00:34:27,434
instantly soothes all anxieties.

682
00:34:28,675 --> 00:34:29,514
It's truly wonderful.

683
00:34:30,795 --> 00:34:32,795
I think in a completely different way.

684
00:34:33,355 --> 00:34:34,634
Alright, tell me,

685
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:35,634
what do you think?

686
00:34:36,395 --> 00:34:37,195
Here, look.

687
00:34:37,994 --> 00:34:39,074
All the plumbing and wiring

688
00:34:39,675 --> 00:34:40,675
needs renovation.

689
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:42,994
Behind you is the kitchen.

690
00:34:43,835 --> 00:34:44,715
The bathroom

691
00:34:45,434 --> 00:34:45,915
needs to get

692
00:34:46,315 --> 00:34:47,355
the waterproofing repairs.

693
00:34:47,434 --> 00:34:48,875
Why do you know this place so well?

694
00:34:49,114 --> 00:34:49,634
You.

695
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:54,875
You'll be the lady of this retreat.

696
00:34:55,634 --> 00:34:58,074
Work connections help you meet guests

697
00:34:58,554 --> 00:34:59,514
and expand your network.

698
00:35:00,074 --> 00:35:00,675
That's good.

699
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:03,875
But mere show interactions

700
00:35:03,915 --> 00:35:05,355
aren't enough for real connections.

701
00:35:05,835 --> 00:35:07,195
Off-camera relationships

702
00:35:07,275 --> 00:35:08,074
require

703
00:35:08,514 --> 00:35:09,434
maintenance too.

704
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:17,034
The location is excellent,

705
00:35:17,634 --> 00:35:19,994
private and secure.

706
00:35:21,235 --> 00:35:22,154
Perfect for hosting

707
00:35:22,474 --> 00:35:24,235
gatherings with friends.

708
00:35:25,034 --> 00:35:27,715
This will benefit your career.

709
00:35:32,474 --> 00:35:34,554
Yan, listen.

710
00:35:35,114 --> 00:35:35,954
The better you work,

711
00:35:36,514 --> 00:35:37,915
the more influence

712
00:35:37,994 --> 00:35:39,315
you'll gain at the network.

713
00:35:39,675 --> 00:35:42,715
It'll benefit your anchor application.

714
00:35:48,034 --> 00:35:49,154
You think I don't know

715
00:35:49,755 --> 00:35:53,395
you practice broadcasting at 5 AM?

716
00:35:57,034 --> 00:36:01,154
You're my wife now.

717
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:04,195
Whatever dreams you have,

718
00:36:04,994 --> 00:36:07,154
I'll help you make them real.

719
00:36:13,994 --> 00:36:14,634
Go check inside.

720
00:36:16,235 --> 00:36:16,715
Come on.

721
00:36:24,795 --> 00:36:26,074
Is it enough for a dining area?

722
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:27,235
More than sufficient.

723
00:36:27,915 --> 00:36:29,675
In such prime location,

724
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,355
this space is sufficient.

725
00:36:33,554 --> 00:36:35,034
I think we should

726
00:36:35,634 --> 00:36:37,395
put cabinets here.

727
00:36:37,634 --> 00:36:38,994
And dining area's here.

728
00:36:39,034 --> 00:36:41,395
But these white walls seem too plain.

729
00:36:41,434 --> 00:36:41,795
So...

730
00:36:47,544 --> 00:36:50,840
(Soon, I'll be as tall as Dad)

731
00:36:53,954 --> 00:36:56,114
The previous owners left

732
00:36:56,355 --> 00:36:58,315
their child's height markings

733
00:36:58,514 --> 00:36:59,195
on the frame.

734
00:36:59,395 --> 00:37:00,074
How adorable.

735
00:37:02,634 --> 00:37:04,034
When I was little,

736
00:37:05,594 --> 00:37:07,355
Dad measured my height like this too.

737
00:37:08,034 --> 00:37:09,074
These are precious,

738
00:37:09,755 --> 00:37:11,074
so I kept them intact.

739
00:37:15,034 --> 00:37:16,034
(You kid!)

740
00:37:16,154 --> 00:37:17,994
(Stand still. Dad's measuring.)

741
00:37:17,994 --> 00:37:18,594
Come here.

742
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:19,755
Do it again.

743
00:37:22,474 --> 00:37:23,315
- No cheating.
- Hey!

744
00:37:23,355 --> 00:37:23,994
Do it again.

745
00:37:24,074 --> 00:37:24,755
Ready? Okay.

746
00:37:24,795 --> 00:37:25,594
Stand straight.

747
00:37:26,154 --> 00:37:26,634
There.

748
00:37:26,755 --> 00:37:27,355
Move.

749
00:37:28,235 --> 00:37:28,554
Come.

750
00:37:28,634 --> 00:37:29,275
Come to me.

751
00:37:32,434 --> 00:37:33,434
Last time was 133cm.

752
00:37:33,474 --> 00:37:34,395
Now it's 134cm.

753
00:37:34,434 --> 00:37:36,074
How much did you grow?

754
00:37:37,395 --> 00:37:38,074
One centimeter.

755
00:37:38,514 --> 00:37:41,235
Let's celebrate Lin's growth!

756
00:37:41,434 --> 00:37:43,235
I'll cook you delicious dishes, okay?

757
00:37:50,915 --> 00:37:51,554
I remember too.

758
00:37:58,795 --> 00:37:59,474
Have a lipstick?

759
00:38:11,275 --> 00:38:11,835
Stand still.
