28
00:01:50,757 --> 00:01:51,356
Mr. Zhou,

29
00:01:51,757 --> 00:01:53,397
my mother mentioned that you're

30
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:54,757
in new medical tech.

31
00:01:55,076 --> 00:01:56,516
Ms. Ma invested in you.

32
00:01:57,397 --> 00:01:58,477
You're so busy every day.

33
00:01:58,557 --> 00:02:00,117
I'm so grateful that you still remember

34
00:02:00,236 --> 00:02:01,076
who I am.

35
00:02:01,637 --> 00:02:03,156
Thanks to Xu Yan for the introduction.

36
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:04,316
Xu Yan.

37
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:05,557
Toast you.

38
00:02:06,236 --> 00:02:06,956
I have to drive.

39
00:02:07,316 --> 00:02:07,837
Alright.

40
00:02:10,117 --> 00:02:10,997
Let's eat.

41
00:02:16,277 --> 00:02:17,316
How long have you met?

42
00:02:18,876 --> 00:02:19,277
We...

43
00:02:19,316 --> 00:02:20,077
Xu Yan and I

44
00:02:20,156 --> 00:02:21,196
have quite some history.

45
00:02:21,624 --> 00:02:24,476
We met when we first came to Jingzhou
to start our business.

46
00:02:27,756 --> 00:02:28,636
So it's been long.

47
00:02:29,077 --> 00:02:29,636
Right.

48
00:02:30,716 --> 00:02:31,837
But over these years,

49
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:32,797
we've all been busy

50
00:02:32,876 --> 00:02:34,036
in our own fields.

51
00:02:34,277 --> 00:02:34,957
So

52
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,237
we hardly met.

53
00:02:36,237 --> 00:02:38,232
True, we hardly met,

54
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:39,916
but we've stayed in contact.

55
00:02:40,436 --> 00:02:42,237
Moreover, I'm very close to her family.

56
00:02:42,677 --> 00:02:44,557
I often chat with her parents

57
00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:45,636
by overseas calls.

58
00:02:48,957 --> 00:02:49,557
That close?

59
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:51,357
You should meet more often.

60
00:02:52,436 --> 00:02:53,517
It's my fault.

61
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:54,557
Over these years,

62
00:02:54,756 --> 00:02:56,596
I've thrown myself into work

63
00:02:58,036 --> 00:02:59,117
and drifted apart

64
00:02:59,117 --> 00:03:00,756
from my friends.

65
00:03:02,077 --> 00:03:03,476
Asking Xu Yan for help

66
00:03:03,557 --> 00:03:04,316
this time we met.

67
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:05,557
Sorry about that.

68
00:03:07,677 --> 00:03:08,196
Mr. Shen.

69
00:03:08,677 --> 00:03:09,876
She knows me well.

70
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:11,677
I'm direct.

71
00:03:12,316 --> 00:03:13,876
I asked her to contact you

72
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,196
for your help with my company.

73
00:03:17,517 --> 00:03:18,077
Haoming.

74
00:03:19,517 --> 00:03:20,277
There's something

75
00:03:20,357 --> 00:03:21,476
I haven't told you.

76
00:03:22,196 --> 00:03:23,636
Zeyuan's company

77
00:03:24,156 --> 00:03:25,636
is in medical tech.

78
00:03:26,117 --> 00:03:27,316
I think Jinda Group

79
00:03:27,436 --> 00:03:29,237
lacks sufficient expertise
in medical fields.

80
00:03:29,596 --> 00:03:30,196
This time...

81
00:03:30,196 --> 00:03:31,156
I get it.

82
00:03:32,397 --> 00:03:34,196
I had similar concerns before.

83
00:03:34,596 --> 00:03:35,316
A few days ago,

84
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:36,916
I had a chat with Mr. Xu on the phone.

85
00:03:37,557 --> 00:03:38,316
He said

86
00:03:38,316 --> 00:03:40,237
that every industry is embracing

87
00:03:40,237 --> 00:03:41,077
new technologies now.

88
00:03:41,237 --> 00:03:43,077
He strongly advised me to meet Mr. Shen

89
00:03:43,196 --> 00:03:43,837
and have a talk.

90
00:03:46,357 --> 00:03:47,916
Our group invests widely.

91
00:03:49,077 --> 00:03:50,036
If it's a good project,

92
00:03:50,436 --> 00:03:51,117
we're open.

93
00:03:51,277 --> 00:03:51,997
Great.

94
00:03:53,677 --> 00:03:54,517
Well,

95
00:03:54,997 --> 00:03:56,716
Mr. Xu has become an authority

96
00:03:57,077 --> 00:03:58,156
in construction

97
00:03:58,277 --> 00:03:59,476
after years of dedication.

98
00:03:59,876 --> 00:04:01,077
But he remains

99
00:04:01,077 --> 00:04:01,957
attentive to sectors

100
00:04:01,957 --> 00:04:03,196
like high-tech.

101
00:04:03,517 --> 00:04:05,036
That open mind

102
00:04:05,196 --> 00:04:06,277
is truly admirable.

103
00:04:06,397 --> 00:04:07,436
It's my fault.

104
00:04:07,957 --> 00:04:09,077
I don't communicate enough

105
00:04:09,237 --> 00:04:09,997
with my in-laws.

106
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,316
I'll work on it.

107
00:04:12,316 --> 00:04:13,277
Strive to do better.

108
00:04:13,517 --> 00:04:13,876
Cheers.

109
00:04:15,237 --> 00:04:15,916
Don't just talk.

110
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:16,636
Let's eat.

111
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:19,036
Enjoy your meal.

112
00:04:19,237 --> 00:04:20,237
I'll step out.

113
00:04:20,876 --> 00:04:21,357
Take care.

114
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:22,797
Enjoy.

115
00:04:25,477 --> 00:04:25,917
Mr. Shen.

116
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:27,316
I'll briefly introduce

117
00:04:27,316 --> 00:04:28,076
my projects.

118
00:04:28,117 --> 00:04:28,717
Eat first.

119
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:31,797
Okay.

120
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,557
Your behavior surprised me.

121
00:05:32,276 --> 00:05:33,956
I thought we've reached a consensus.

122
00:05:33,956 --> 00:05:36,117
We were on the same side.

123
00:05:36,316 --> 00:05:38,157
We never were.

124
00:05:40,557 --> 00:05:42,836
That's harsh.

125
00:05:43,157 --> 00:05:45,597
I've been covering for you.

126
00:05:45,876 --> 00:05:46,797
And you repay me

127
00:05:46,836 --> 00:05:48,357
by blocking me?

128
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:57,917
Did I speak too much just now?

129
00:05:57,917 --> 00:05:59,436
Did I cause you any trouble?

130
00:05:59,836 --> 00:06:00,717
Would your husband

131
00:06:01,037 --> 00:06:02,076
suddenly get the urge

132
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:04,076
to call his father-in-law overseas

133
00:06:04,076 --> 00:06:04,997
on a whim?

134
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:18,237
If you keep resisting me,

135
00:06:19,717 --> 00:06:20,797
I really can't guarantee

136
00:06:20,836 --> 00:06:22,196
what I'll say next.

137
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:26,037
No matter what you'll say,

138
00:06:27,076 --> 00:06:28,597
I won't let Shen Haoming

139
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:30,316
get dragged into your scam.

140
00:06:31,117 --> 00:06:32,597
Worst case, we both go down.

141
00:06:33,836 --> 00:06:35,117
I'll face the consequences,

142
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:36,756
you too.

143
00:06:37,117 --> 00:06:38,396
You've got everything you want.

144
00:06:40,396 --> 00:06:41,436
Can you discard them?

145
00:06:43,157 --> 00:06:44,276
You're bluffing.

146
00:06:44,756 --> 00:06:46,357
You're scared, actually.

147
00:06:46,477 --> 00:06:47,636
You know very well

148
00:06:47,797 --> 00:06:49,836
you'll lose the most in the end.

149
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:51,677
What do I have to fear?

150
00:06:51,997 --> 00:06:53,876
I have nothing to lose.

151
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:54,717
I have no fear!

152
00:06:54,756 --> 00:06:55,557
Good.

153
00:06:56,396 --> 00:06:58,037
Then go tell Shen Haoming

154
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,836
the whole truth right now.

155
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:07,797
Seems you're really

156
00:07:07,797 --> 00:07:09,237
trying to be his perfect wife.

157
00:07:11,076 --> 00:07:11,797
Fine.

158
00:07:12,956 --> 00:07:15,037
Don't want to use his money?

159
00:07:17,876 --> 00:07:18,477
Give yours

160
00:07:20,117 --> 00:07:20,997
to me.

161
00:07:24,396 --> 00:07:26,276
You have one night to think.

162
00:07:26,876 --> 00:07:28,797
Or I'll expose you online.

163
00:07:39,076 --> 00:07:40,157
A friendly reminder to you.

164
00:07:42,276 --> 00:07:44,237
A man drowning in debt

165
00:07:48,237 --> 00:07:49,396
is a devil.

166
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,557
Remember to pay up.

167
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:32,597
Otherwise,

168
00:08:32,597 --> 00:08:34,557
I'll haunt you like one.

169
00:08:40,477 --> 00:08:42,156
What are you doing?

170
00:08:54,477 --> 00:08:55,556
(Zhou Zeyuan)
Look into this guy for me.

171
00:08:58,077 --> 00:08:58,636
Okay.

172
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,117
I've told you.

173
00:09:08,437 --> 00:09:09,717
I won't help you.

174
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,437
Solve your own mess.

175
00:09:13,117 --> 00:09:13,676
And

176
00:09:14,516 --> 00:09:15,036
don't

177
00:09:15,036 --> 00:09:16,036
call me again.

178
00:09:18,237 --> 00:09:18,796
Yan.

179
00:09:24,077 --> 00:09:26,276
Who's that?

180
00:09:28,197 --> 00:09:29,077
Work call.

181
00:09:30,957 --> 00:09:31,597
What's wrong?

182
00:09:31,876 --> 00:09:32,556
Did I awake you?

183
00:09:33,636 --> 00:09:34,237
It's nothing.

184
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,876
(New message received)

185
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:39,237
If it's work-related,

186
00:09:39,717 --> 00:09:41,156
is there anything I can help with?

187
00:09:42,317 --> 00:09:43,156
No.

188
00:09:43,477 --> 00:09:44,636
They just informed me

189
00:09:45,156 --> 00:09:46,117
tomorrow's guests

190
00:09:46,197 --> 00:09:47,477
may cancel

191
00:09:47,957 --> 00:09:48,997
due to weather.

192
00:09:49,237 --> 00:09:50,437
I told them

193
00:09:51,036 --> 00:09:52,717
to handle it on their own.

194
00:09:55,676 --> 00:09:57,437
You seem tired lately.

195
00:09:57,837 --> 00:09:59,096
Don't push yourself too hard.

196
00:10:04,276 --> 00:10:05,357
A little, indeed.

197
00:10:06,597 --> 00:10:07,796
I have

198
00:10:07,837 --> 00:10:08,837
two shows at once.

199
00:10:10,036 --> 00:10:11,516
And I just started anchoring.

200
00:10:12,276 --> 00:10:13,396
It's exhausting.

201
00:10:15,077 --> 00:10:16,357
If it's too much,

202
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:17,756
just

203
00:10:18,516 --> 00:10:19,197
drop one.

204
00:10:21,636 --> 00:10:22,636
But you know

205
00:10:22,636 --> 00:10:24,477
being a news anchor is my dream.

206
00:10:26,077 --> 00:10:28,117
And I built Family Feast from scratch.

207
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:31,036
I can't give up either.

208
00:10:32,036 --> 00:10:32,796
Then I support you.

209
00:10:33,477 --> 00:10:34,556
Keep both.

210
00:10:37,276 --> 00:10:38,357
You changed so fast.

211
00:10:39,756 --> 00:10:41,796
(Zhou Zeyuan)
I'll always choose your choice.

212
00:10:42,276 --> 00:10:45,036
(Xu Yan, think about the consequences
of refusing me.)

213
00:10:55,563 --> 00:10:56,376
(Phone off)

214
00:11:01,676 --> 00:11:03,276
Having someone supporting me

215
00:11:04,717 --> 00:11:05,357
feels good.

216
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,197
I stand by what I said.

217
00:11:08,717 --> 00:11:10,197
Do whatever you want.

218
00:11:11,197 --> 00:11:12,357
Mistakes don't matter.

219
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:13,997
Even if you fail,

220
00:11:14,636 --> 00:11:15,957
we can start over.

221
00:11:26,876 --> 00:11:27,636
Sorry.

222
00:11:27,876 --> 00:11:29,837
The number you dialed is powered off.

223
00:11:35,256 --> 00:11:37,624
(Xu Yan)

224
00:12:02,276 --> 00:12:02,997
No answer.

225
00:12:03,237 --> 00:12:04,237
No reply.

226
00:12:04,676 --> 00:12:05,437
Xu Yan.

227
00:12:05,636 --> 00:12:06,796
What are you thinking?

228
00:12:06,997 --> 00:12:08,156
I've got nothing to say.

229
00:12:08,556 --> 00:12:09,717
My cash flow's gone,

230
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:10,516
salaries unpaid,

231
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:11,997
investors digging into my books.

232
00:12:12,156 --> 00:12:13,477
My company's about to collapse.

233
00:12:13,477 --> 00:12:14,636
I'm cornered.

234
00:12:14,756 --> 00:12:15,477
I'm telling you.

235
00:12:15,796 --> 00:12:16,837
If I go down,

236
00:12:16,957 --> 00:12:17,916
I'm dragging you.

237
00:12:17,997 --> 00:12:18,957
Understood?

238
00:12:20,077 --> 00:12:21,117
Let go of me!

239
00:12:21,597 --> 00:12:22,904
- Let go!
- What are you doing?

240
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:24,837
What are you doing?

241
00:12:26,156 --> 00:12:26,837
Who are you?

242
00:12:26,957 --> 00:12:28,197
Who are you?

243
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:29,117
None of your business.

244
00:12:29,117 --> 00:12:29,876
Don't step in.

245
00:12:29,876 --> 00:12:30,317
Go away!

246
00:12:31,437 --> 00:12:31,916
Listen up.

247
00:12:31,997 --> 00:12:32,837
There are many

248
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:33,437
cameras here.

249
00:12:33,437 --> 00:12:34,237
All recording.

250
00:12:34,357 --> 00:12:35,224
I'll call the police!

251
00:12:35,477 --> 00:12:36,276
Right now.

252
00:12:40,756 --> 00:12:41,156
Hello?

253
00:12:41,437 --> 00:12:42,077
Police?

254
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:43,317
Someone's harassing me!

255
00:12:43,516 --> 00:12:44,197
Guards!

256
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:45,197
Help!

257
00:12:57,357 --> 00:12:58,296
Drink something warm.

258
00:12:58,997 --> 00:12:59,357
Thanks.

259
00:13:05,276 --> 00:13:05,717
Yan.

260
00:13:06,556 --> 00:13:07,957
Who was that guy?

261
00:13:08,036 --> 00:13:09,437
What's going on?

262
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:13,916
Just someone I knew.

263
00:13:13,997 --> 00:13:14,997
We had a small dispute.

264
00:13:15,556 --> 00:13:16,636
But it's all settled now.

265
00:13:16,676 --> 00:13:17,437
Don't worry.

266
00:13:19,396 --> 00:13:21,516
He looked menacing.

267
00:13:21,597 --> 00:13:23,477
Didn't seem a small matter.

268
00:13:27,957 --> 00:13:29,117
You are still the same.

269
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,156
Keeping everything bottled up.

270
00:13:31,997 --> 00:13:33,077
Truly, I may not

271
00:13:33,197 --> 00:13:33,876
be much help

272
00:13:33,957 --> 00:13:35,197
if you tell me.

273
00:13:39,756 --> 00:13:41,156
You're still the same too,

274
00:13:42,477 --> 00:13:43,676
hot-tempered.

275
00:13:44,876 --> 00:13:45,676
Thank you.

276
00:13:47,357 --> 00:13:48,676
I should be thanking you.

277
00:13:49,317 --> 00:13:50,756
Yu Yiming told me everything.

278
00:13:51,756 --> 00:13:54,997
You paid my adult education tuition

279
00:13:54,997 --> 00:13:56,276
for next semester.

280
00:13:57,276 --> 00:13:57,837
Why?

281
00:13:58,357 --> 00:13:59,317
Why hide it?

282
00:14:00,077 --> 00:14:00,957
Trying to be a saint?

283
00:14:01,036 --> 00:14:02,117
Do good deeds anonymously?

284
00:14:02,437 --> 00:14:03,556
It's nothing.

285
00:14:06,717 --> 00:14:08,156
So today you came to see me?

286
00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:13,117
To give you this.

287
00:14:14,357 --> 00:14:16,516
Some makeup,

288
00:14:16,997 --> 00:14:18,676
just to thank you.

289
00:14:21,117 --> 00:14:22,437
I was waiting

290
00:14:22,477 --> 00:14:23,396
at the main entrance.

291
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:25,317
But you drove straight to the basement,

292
00:14:25,317 --> 00:14:26,117
didn't notice me.

293
00:14:26,197 --> 00:14:27,077
So I went

294
00:14:27,077 --> 00:14:28,317
down to find you.

295
00:14:29,876 --> 00:14:30,197
And...

296
00:14:30,556 --> 00:14:31,317
About

297
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:32,997
Lin Tao's matter,

298
00:14:33,876 --> 00:14:35,237
I was too harsh.

299
00:14:35,237 --> 00:14:36,516
I wanted to apologize.

300
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:38,036
I'm sorry, Yan.

301
00:14:43,957 --> 00:14:45,756
I was impulsive too.

302
00:14:48,036 --> 00:14:48,756
I'm sorry.

303
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:51,796
I like the gift. Thanks.

304
00:14:51,997 --> 00:14:52,796
I'll keep it.

305
00:14:58,676 --> 00:15:00,876
Has his bothered you again?

306
00:15:01,796 --> 00:15:02,396
No.

307
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:03,597
Good.

308
00:15:04,876 --> 00:15:05,957
I can't help you much.

309
00:15:06,117 --> 00:15:07,156
But Yan,

310
00:15:07,317 --> 00:15:08,317
as long as I'm here,

311
00:15:08,837 --> 00:15:10,276
nobody's bullying you.

312
00:15:10,756 --> 00:15:11,480
I'll protect you.

313
00:15:14,117 --> 00:15:15,036
So today,

314
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:16,276
your treat.

315
00:15:17,276 --> 00:15:18,437
I already paid.

316
00:15:21,957 --> 00:15:22,904
That's not your style.

317
00:15:23,676 --> 00:15:24,317
Hello.

318
00:15:26,317 --> 00:15:27,516
Your most expensive cake,

319
00:15:27,597 --> 00:15:28,396
please.

320
00:15:28,437 --> 00:15:28,837
Thanks.

321
00:15:28,837 --> 00:15:29,624
- One moment.
- Thank you.

322
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:31,036
Thank you.

323
00:15:32,756 --> 00:15:33,516
Your treat.

324
00:15:36,796 --> 00:15:37,317
Yan.

325
00:15:37,477 --> 00:15:38,876
Here's the news file.

326
00:15:38,957 --> 00:15:39,516
Thanks.

327
00:15:42,156 --> 00:15:42,756
Dong Chao.

328
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:45,077
Close the door.

329
00:15:50,207 --> 00:15:57,112
(Incoming call from Qiao Jianbin)

330
00:16:00,756 --> 00:16:01,276
What's wrong?

331
00:16:01,556 --> 00:16:02,036
Qiao Yan.

332
00:16:02,597 --> 00:16:03,916
Your mom and I are in Jingzhou.

333
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:05,437
Sending you the hotel address.

334
00:16:05,876 --> 00:16:07,117
Come right now.

335
00:16:07,437 --> 00:16:09,357
Don't ask. We'll talk in person.

336
00:16:13,976 --> 00:16:15,800
(From Qiao Jianbin
Wuseshi Hotel)

337
00:16:29,997 --> 00:16:31,197
Why are you here?

338
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:32,916
Come in.

339
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:37,717
You've arrived.

340
00:17:15,197 --> 00:17:16,637
I invited your parents here.

341
00:17:18,316 --> 00:17:18,957
Qiao Yan.

342
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:21,637
No one loves us more

343
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:23,637
than our parents.

344
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:25,877
As children,

345
00:17:26,316 --> 00:17:27,356
we shouldn't hide anything

346
00:17:27,717 --> 00:17:28,917
from them.

347
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:31,957
Maybe you've had

348
00:17:32,116 --> 00:17:33,237
some conflicts.

349
00:17:33,796 --> 00:17:34,516
But I believe

350
00:17:34,877 --> 00:17:36,116
if you sit down

351
00:17:36,397 --> 00:17:37,237
and talk openly

352
00:17:37,477 --> 00:17:38,756
with each other,

353
00:17:39,276 --> 00:17:39,836
everything

354
00:17:39,997 --> 00:17:41,437
will be resolved.

355
00:17:42,197 --> 00:17:42,877
Right, Mr. Qiao?

356
00:17:46,276 --> 00:17:47,917
Qiao Yan is a good girl.

357
00:17:48,677 --> 00:17:50,276
Don't be too angry.

358
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:51,036
Take care.

359
00:17:51,516 --> 00:17:52,836
I've arranged the rooms.

360
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:54,316
Stay as long as you want.

361
00:17:54,516 --> 00:17:55,477
Then I'll head back.

362
00:17:55,796 --> 00:17:56,356
Okay.

363
00:17:56,957 --> 00:17:57,877
I'm leaving.

364
00:18:21,237 --> 00:18:22,836
Where did you get the nerve

365
00:18:24,356 --> 00:18:25,836
to fake your parents' jobs

366
00:18:26,197 --> 00:18:28,516
and hire actors at your wedding?

367
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:29,917
Who gave you the courage

368
00:18:30,036 --> 00:18:31,997
to tell such a lie?

369
00:18:32,437 --> 00:18:33,717
I, Qiao Jianbin,

370
00:18:33,836 --> 00:18:34,756
have never done

371
00:18:34,836 --> 00:18:36,397
a shameful thing in my life.

372
00:18:36,756 --> 00:18:38,677
How did I raise a daughter like you?

373
00:18:38,877 --> 00:18:39,677
Calm down.

374
00:18:42,437 --> 00:18:43,157
Yan.

375
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,556
Just tell your father the truth.

376
00:18:45,677 --> 00:18:46,877
Why did you do this?

377
00:18:47,157 --> 00:18:48,116
Why?

378
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,116
Greedy for wealth
and blinded by ambition.

379
00:18:51,516 --> 00:18:52,596
To marry into riches,

380
00:18:52,677 --> 00:18:54,516
you've abandoned all moral principles!

381
00:18:57,516 --> 00:18:59,437
I didn't take a single penny
from the Shens.

382
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,356
My feelings for Shen Haoming are real.

383
00:19:03,356 --> 00:19:04,076
I love him,

384
00:19:04,397 --> 00:19:05,477
so I want to marry him

385
00:19:05,516 --> 00:19:06,677
and become his wife.

386
00:19:08,157 --> 00:19:09,157
I did nothing wrong

387
00:19:10,157 --> 00:19:10,877
with that.

388
00:19:11,356 --> 00:19:12,796
Ridiculous!

389
00:19:13,116 --> 00:19:14,556
You fooled everyone.

390
00:19:15,076 --> 00:19:16,917
You played us all!

391
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:17,957
You think that

392
00:19:17,997 --> 00:19:19,397
will erase everything?

393
00:19:19,437 --> 00:19:20,437
Who would believe that?

394
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:21,596
I don't need you to.

395
00:19:23,677 --> 00:19:24,516
I never

396
00:19:24,516 --> 00:19:25,356
expected

397
00:19:25,437 --> 00:19:26,836
you to understand me.

398
00:19:27,276 --> 00:19:28,316
I just want to say.

399
00:19:28,596 --> 00:19:29,957
No matter when

400
00:19:30,356 --> 00:19:31,796
I met someone like Shen Haoming,

401
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:32,756
I would use

402
00:19:33,356 --> 00:19:34,677
any means

403
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:36,796
necessary

404
00:19:37,556 --> 00:19:38,437
to be with him.

405
00:19:38,717 --> 00:19:40,237
But you shouldn't have deceived him!

406
00:19:40,237 --> 00:19:41,957
I didn't want to.

407
00:19:44,356 --> 00:19:45,917
It's just that since I was little,

408
00:19:46,637 --> 00:19:48,677
I knew I could only rely on myself.

409
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:55,437
Yan.

410
00:19:56,877 --> 00:19:57,957
When you were a kid,

411
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:59,316
we didn't raise you.

412
00:20:00,516 --> 00:20:02,957
But we took you back later.

413
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,997
We've raised you all these years.

414
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:08,157
You can't blame your mistakes

415
00:20:08,237 --> 00:20:09,917
all on us!

416
00:20:14,596 --> 00:20:15,157
No.

417
00:20:22,836 --> 00:20:24,796
You'll not understand
what you did wrong.

418
00:20:25,556 --> 00:20:26,836
My only mistake

419
00:20:27,556 --> 00:20:29,197
was not exposing you earlier!

420
00:20:30,076 --> 00:20:31,756
I'll go confront the Shen family now

421
00:20:31,917 --> 00:20:33,076
and expose everything!

422
00:20:33,197 --> 00:20:33,917
Qiao! Qiao!

423
00:20:34,036 --> 00:20:34,756
Don't go! Don't!

424
00:20:34,877 --> 00:20:35,556
Calm down!

425
00:20:35,717 --> 00:20:36,477
Let go!

426
00:20:36,717 --> 00:20:37,756
Think about Yan!

427
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,437
If you do this, her career is ruined!

428
00:20:39,596 --> 00:20:41,076
If I didn't know, fine.

429
00:20:41,197 --> 00:20:42,596
But now, if I cover for her,

430
00:20:42,717 --> 00:20:43,997
I'd be failing as a father!

431
00:20:43,997 --> 00:20:45,437
She's already married.

432
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:46,516
You can't do this.

433
00:20:46,596 --> 00:20:47,756
What's this act about?

434
00:20:54,596 --> 00:20:54,997
Well.

435
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:57,276
What are you

436
00:20:58,717 --> 00:20:59,957
acting out here?

437
00:21:01,116 --> 00:21:01,836
Parents

438
00:21:02,116 --> 00:21:03,157
brokenhearted

439
00:21:03,157 --> 00:21:05,397
over their daughter's mistakes?

440
00:21:10,356 --> 00:21:11,477
Do you really care?

441
00:21:14,957 --> 00:21:16,596
This is how I grew up.

442
00:21:16,637 --> 00:21:17,877
You never cared about me!

443
00:21:18,397 --> 00:21:19,917
I fought so hard

444
00:21:19,957 --> 00:21:21,157
to get where I am today,

445
00:21:22,397 --> 00:21:23,717
to get a loving husband.

446
00:21:26,157 --> 00:21:27,116
Are you unhappy?

447
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:32,877
I got it.

448
00:21:34,157 --> 00:21:35,157
You think

449
00:21:35,197 --> 00:21:35,957
this life

450
00:21:35,957 --> 00:21:37,637
should've belonged to Qiao Lin,

451
00:21:37,637 --> 00:21:38,276
not me, right?

452
00:21:41,237 --> 00:21:42,036
Or you want

453
00:21:42,036 --> 00:21:43,637
to expose me to the Shen family

454
00:21:43,756 --> 00:21:44,316
so you can

455
00:21:44,316 --> 00:21:45,677
extort money from me?

456
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:48,836
Fine. No problem.

457
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:50,237
I'll pay.

458
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:51,864
What did you say?

459
00:21:53,756 --> 00:21:55,677
How could you think that?

460
00:21:57,437 --> 00:21:58,116
You...

461
00:21:59,756 --> 00:22:01,756
Are you still

462
00:22:01,796 --> 00:22:02,957
a Qiao family's girl?

463
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:04,756
Do you still bear our surname?

464
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:06,036
I don't bear Qiao.

465
00:22:09,677 --> 00:22:10,877
My name is Xu Yan.

466
00:22:12,237 --> 00:22:12,836
Good.

467
00:22:15,397 --> 00:22:18,036
From now on,
we're no longer father and daughter.

468
00:22:19,356 --> 00:22:21,397
You are not part of this family anymore!

469
00:22:21,437 --> 00:22:21,957
No!

470
00:22:22,997 --> 00:22:23,637
Qiao!

471
00:23:24,824 --> 00:23:27,416
(Secretary Chen)

472
00:23:28,237 --> 00:23:29,076
- Go ahead.
- Mr. Shen.

473
00:23:29,437 --> 00:23:30,237
Your wife

474
00:23:30,276 --> 00:23:31,556
sold the car

475
00:23:32,397 --> 00:23:33,116
you gifted her.

476
00:23:37,836 --> 00:23:38,477
Got it.

477
00:23:47,637 --> 00:23:49,116
I've given you the money.

478
00:23:52,076 --> 00:23:53,197
What do you want?

479
00:23:57,076 --> 00:23:58,637
Are you throwing scraps on me?

480
00:23:59,116 --> 00:24:00,116
Do you know how much

481
00:24:00,116 --> 00:24:01,596
my company spends every day?

482
00:24:03,756 --> 00:24:05,116
Zhou Zeyuan, I'm warning you.

483
00:24:05,397 --> 00:24:06,556
This is the first

484
00:24:07,477 --> 00:24:08,596
and the last time.

485
00:24:10,756 --> 00:24:11,756
Take this money

486
00:24:11,756 --> 00:24:12,637
as your hush fee,

487
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:13,596
for your last life.

488
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:14,997
I won't tolerate

489
00:24:15,276 --> 00:24:16,877
endless extortion.

490
00:24:21,637 --> 00:24:22,637
Try this again,

491
00:24:27,237 --> 00:24:28,556
and I'll call the police.

492
00:24:30,556 --> 00:24:31,997
But the deficit's too large.

493
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:33,877
This is far from enough.

494
00:24:36,997 --> 00:24:38,596
If my company crashes,

495
00:24:38,796 --> 00:24:40,356
everyone will come

496
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:41,477
demanding repayment.

497
00:24:41,836 --> 00:24:43,877
Then it'll be do-or-die.

498
00:24:47,677 --> 00:24:49,397
But the one who should be afraid

499
00:24:49,397 --> 00:24:50,316
isn't me.

500
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:51,437
It's you.

501
00:24:52,276 --> 00:24:54,276
Everything you schemed so hard to get

502
00:24:54,276 --> 00:24:55,556
will turn to ashes.

503
00:24:56,836 --> 00:24:57,556
Xu Yan.

504
00:24:58,437 --> 00:25:00,356
Do you dare gamble everything?

505
00:25:00,717 --> 00:25:01,637
Can't you see

506
00:25:01,717 --> 00:25:02,756
I've been

507
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:03,957
giving you chances?

508
00:25:05,836 --> 00:25:06,316
Fine.

509
00:25:11,756 --> 00:25:12,556
Give it a try then.

510
00:25:14,877 --> 00:25:16,157
See who can go further.

511
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:26,477
If I end up in jail,

512
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:28,796
- at least I'll have you with me.
- Let go!

513
00:25:42,197 --> 00:25:43,356
Ten million per blow.

514
00:25:45,596 --> 00:25:46,637
Another strike?

515
00:25:49,976 --> 00:25:51,416
(Mr. Shen)

516
00:25:52,677 --> 00:25:53,796
Your husband's calling.

517
00:26:00,504 --> 00:26:01,720
(Mr. Shen)

518
00:26:04,024 --> 00:26:04,984
(Mr. Shen)

519
00:26:06,116 --> 00:26:07,076
Hello, Mr. Shen.

520
00:26:07,237 --> 00:26:08,237
What's up?

521
00:26:08,756 --> 00:26:09,677
2 PM.

522
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:11,157
Golf game.

523
00:26:11,276 --> 00:26:11,836
Available?

524
00:26:12,397 --> 00:26:13,796
Of course.

525
00:26:16,276 --> 00:26:17,637
He walked into this himself.

526
00:26:17,717 --> 00:26:18,516
Not my fault.

527
00:26:24,477 --> 00:26:25,397
Listen well.

528
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,276
If you hurt him,

529
00:26:29,076 --> 00:26:29,997
I won't let you go.

530
00:26:31,836 --> 00:26:33,316
You want to expose me?

531
00:26:34,197 --> 00:26:34,877
Go ahead!

532
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:44,917
Mr. Shen.

533
00:26:45,677 --> 00:26:47,637
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.

534
00:26:48,237 --> 00:26:49,877
Xu Yan is with me now.

535
00:26:50,516 --> 00:26:51,877
She says she's coming too.

536
00:26:53,157 --> 00:26:53,836
Got it.

537
00:26:54,756 --> 00:26:55,437
Goodbye.

538
00:27:01,237 --> 00:27:01,997
To put it simply,

539
00:27:02,116 --> 00:27:03,036
the idea is to combine

540
00:27:03,036 --> 00:27:04,157
the thinking and experience

541
00:27:04,237 --> 00:27:05,516
of top medical experts

542
00:27:05,756 --> 00:27:06,957
with new technologies

543
00:27:07,036 --> 00:27:08,437
in each case.

544
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:09,756
Then we can replicate

545
00:27:09,756 --> 00:27:11,556
countless top doctors

546
00:27:11,637 --> 00:27:12,516
to serve patients.

547
00:27:13,437 --> 00:27:14,677
Jinda Group hasn't touched

548
00:27:15,036 --> 00:27:16,677
the medical field yet.

549
00:27:17,276 --> 00:27:18,197
But I'm interested.

550
00:27:19,276 --> 00:27:20,237
What's the return rate?

551
00:27:21,917 --> 00:27:22,917
This round, we're raising

552
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:23,877
100 million.

553
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:25,036
I saved

554
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:25,877
50 million for you.

555
00:27:26,237 --> 00:27:27,276
Based on current

556
00:27:27,316 --> 00:27:27,957
figures,

557
00:27:28,036 --> 00:27:28,877
the annualized return

558
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:29,957
is around 20%.

559
00:27:30,197 --> 00:27:31,076
10 million a year.

560
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:31,796
Of course,

561
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,756
the more you put in,
the higher the returns.

562
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:44,477
Nice shot.

563
00:27:45,076 --> 00:27:45,556
Your turn.

564
00:27:46,356 --> 00:27:46,756
Okay.

565
00:27:54,316 --> 00:27:55,556
Looks like

566
00:27:55,836 --> 00:27:57,197
you haven't been practicing.

567
00:27:58,637 --> 00:27:59,877
Can't compare with you.

568
00:28:00,677 --> 00:28:01,157
Mr. Shen.

569
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:03,197
The project we discussed,

570
00:28:03,316 --> 00:28:04,677
I've been developing it for years.

571
00:28:05,477 --> 00:28:06,957
From medical R&D

572
00:28:07,116 --> 00:28:08,076
to data collection,

573
00:28:08,276 --> 00:28:09,437
our company leads

574
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,796
in the industry.

575
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,076
I believe,

576
00:28:12,356 --> 00:28:14,356
with your financial support,

577
00:28:14,477 --> 00:28:15,477
it'll take off.

578
00:28:15,796 --> 00:28:17,036
Not just substantial returns,

579
00:28:17,157 --> 00:28:18,076
but also solving

580
00:28:18,076 --> 00:28:19,276
real problems for patients.

581
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:20,477
Good for the people.

582
00:28:20,836 --> 00:28:21,356
Okay.

583
00:28:21,957 --> 00:28:23,356
I've got the picture.

584
00:28:23,596 --> 00:28:25,157
I'll discuss it internally.

585
00:28:26,917 --> 00:28:27,957
Should be feasible.

586
00:28:28,197 --> 00:28:30,356
My secretary will update you.

587
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:32,316
Okay.

588
00:28:32,957 --> 00:28:33,957
Thank you so much

589
00:28:34,076 --> 00:28:34,917
for this opportunity.

590
00:28:35,036 --> 00:28:35,556
No problem.

591
00:28:35,717 --> 00:28:36,516
I'll take my leave.

592
00:28:37,437 --> 00:28:37,836
Xu Yan.

593
00:28:38,157 --> 00:28:38,877
I'm heading out.

594
00:28:40,917 --> 00:28:41,276
Goodbye.

595
00:28:41,756 --> 00:28:42,157
Goodbye.

596
00:28:50,237 --> 00:28:50,677
What's up?

597
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:55,836
Haoming.

598
00:28:56,796 --> 00:28:57,717
I don't think

599
00:28:57,717 --> 00:28:58,917
you should invest.

600
00:29:00,877 --> 00:29:01,717
First,

601
00:29:02,316 --> 00:29:03,237
we don't know much

602
00:29:03,276 --> 00:29:04,197
about medicine.

603
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:05,516
Second,

604
00:29:06,356 --> 00:29:07,917
we don't know his company's

605
00:29:08,036 --> 00:29:08,756
operations either.

606
00:29:10,276 --> 00:29:11,717
It's too risky.

607
00:29:14,276 --> 00:29:15,877
Don't do it for my sake.

608
00:29:16,677 --> 00:29:17,556
I'm not

609
00:29:18,477 --> 00:29:19,637
that close to him.

610
00:29:20,316 --> 00:29:21,197
So,

611
00:29:21,917 --> 00:29:22,756
the investment...

612
00:29:23,237 --> 00:29:24,756
Actually,

613
00:29:25,637 --> 00:29:26,997
the funds he wants aren't huge.

614
00:29:27,756 --> 00:29:29,076
The medical field

615
00:29:29,316 --> 00:29:31,036
isn't our business,

616
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:32,877
so I won't use

617
00:29:32,957 --> 00:29:33,756
Jinda's funds.

618
00:29:34,477 --> 00:29:36,276
I'll find other investors.

619
00:29:36,637 --> 00:29:37,437
It'll work out.

620
00:29:40,556 --> 00:29:42,116
With you handling it, of course.

621
00:29:45,237 --> 00:29:46,197
But 50 million

622
00:29:46,397 --> 00:29:47,437
isn't small.

623
00:29:47,596 --> 00:29:49,596
The risks and potential losses

624
00:29:50,116 --> 00:29:50,877
are

625
00:29:50,877 --> 00:29:52,036
within acceptable limits.

626
00:29:52,596 --> 00:29:53,356
I can handle it.

627
00:29:53,677 --> 00:29:54,397
Trust me.

628
00:29:56,316 --> 00:29:56,796
Let's go.

629
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:58,477
Haoming.

630
00:30:02,756 --> 00:30:04,237
There's something I want to tell you.

631
00:30:04,316 --> 00:30:05,717
I want to tell you,

632
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:08,157
I just want you by my side,

633
00:30:08,637 --> 00:30:10,276
happy

634
00:30:10,717 --> 00:30:11,717
and carefree.

635
00:30:13,516 --> 00:30:14,677
Not frowning.

636
00:30:16,836 --> 00:30:17,637
Smile.

637
00:30:22,836 --> 00:30:23,397
Let's go.

638
00:30:41,836 --> 00:30:42,477
Mr. Shen.

639
00:30:43,116 --> 00:30:44,437
Mr. Huang's secretary called,

640
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,936
asking if you're available
the day after tomorrow.

641
00:30:47,197 --> 00:30:47,796
He will bring

642
00:30:47,796 --> 00:30:48,717
some important guests

643
00:30:48,796 --> 00:30:49,477
to play golf.

644
00:30:50,276 --> 00:30:50,796
No problem.

645
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:51,477
And,

646
00:30:52,437 --> 00:30:53,917
Zhou Zeyuan's called multiple times.

647
00:30:54,036 --> 00:30:54,637
Looks like

648
00:30:54,917 --> 00:30:55,717
he's about to crack.

649
00:30:57,836 --> 00:30:58,397
No rush.

650
00:30:59,036 --> 00:30:59,796
Let him wait.

651
00:31:01,917 --> 00:31:04,596
Schedule a meeting with
the investment department in 15 minutes.

652
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:05,116
Understood.

653
00:31:25,836 --> 00:31:26,356
Mr. Zhou.

654
00:31:26,997 --> 00:31:27,957
Our account funds

655
00:31:28,036 --> 00:31:29,116
can only sustain us

656
00:31:29,157 --> 00:31:29,997
for two days.

657
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:32,076
Keep calling Shen Haoming.

658
00:31:32,917 --> 00:31:34,157
I've called numerous times.

659
00:31:34,397 --> 00:31:35,836
His secretary always makes excuses.

660
00:31:35,957 --> 00:31:37,197
Enough!

661
00:31:37,356 --> 00:31:39,197
Just call!

662
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,197
Or tell me

663
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,036
where else

664
00:31:41,076 --> 00:31:42,036
we can get money!

665
00:31:43,437 --> 00:31:44,157
Make the call!

666
00:31:58,677 --> 00:31:59,397
Secretary Chen.

667
00:31:59,796 --> 00:32:00,717
Congras, Mr. Zhou.

668
00:32:01,316 --> 00:32:02,076
Mr. Shen

669
00:32:02,157 --> 00:32:03,637
has agreed to invest.

670
00:32:04,237 --> 00:32:04,877
Moreover,

671
00:32:05,116 --> 00:32:06,717
he's willing to add more.

672
00:32:07,157 --> 00:32:07,836
However,

673
00:32:08,756 --> 00:32:09,997
he wants

674
00:32:09,997 --> 00:32:11,276
a 6% higher return.

675
00:32:11,877 --> 00:32:12,516
Is that okay?

676
00:32:13,157 --> 00:32:13,596
Sure.

677
00:32:13,717 --> 00:32:14,637
No problem at all.

678
00:32:15,796 --> 00:32:16,477
Secretary Chen,

679
00:32:16,877 --> 00:32:18,157
please inform Mr. Shen

680
00:32:18,397 --> 00:32:19,516
I'll make arrangements now.

681
00:32:19,877 --> 00:32:21,036
When he's not busy,

682
00:32:21,116 --> 00:32:22,796
I'll visit with the contract.

683
00:32:23,997 --> 00:32:24,957
There's no hurry.

684
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:26,596
Mr. Shen

685
00:32:26,836 --> 00:32:27,677
thinks your sector

686
00:32:27,677 --> 00:32:29,076
is potential.

687
00:32:29,596 --> 00:32:30,116
However,

688
00:32:30,677 --> 00:32:31,997
it's his personal interest.

689
00:32:32,596 --> 00:32:33,116
The money

690
00:32:33,116 --> 00:32:34,157
won't be from

691
00:32:34,157 --> 00:32:34,796
Jinda Group.

692
00:32:35,316 --> 00:32:36,477
A professional agent will

693
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:37,796
handle the contract.

694
00:32:38,237 --> 00:32:38,997
He'll contact you

695
00:32:38,997 --> 00:32:39,637
later.

696
00:32:40,356 --> 00:32:41,877
The funds will

697
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:43,556
be transferred

698
00:32:44,036 --> 00:32:44,756
in batches

699
00:32:44,957 --> 00:32:45,796
within three months.

700
00:32:46,917 --> 00:32:47,516
Understood.

701
00:32:48,076 --> 00:32:49,276
Don't worry.

702
00:32:49,356 --> 00:32:49,917
I won't tell

703
00:32:49,957 --> 00:32:51,356
anyone about this.

704
00:32:51,877 --> 00:32:52,957
I'm grateful to him

705
00:32:53,036 --> 00:32:54,437
for recognizing my project

706
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:56,036
and me.

707
00:32:56,717 --> 00:32:57,237
Okay.

708
00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,477
I'll convey

709
00:32:59,637 --> 00:33:00,917
your gratitude to him.

710
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:01,836
Goodbye.

711
00:33:02,997 --> 00:33:03,836
Okay. Goodbye.

712
00:33:12,312 --> 00:33:13,688
(Four months later)

713
00:33:13,796 --> 00:33:14,356
Miss Xu.

714
00:33:14,836 --> 00:33:16,437
Nice job hosting the finance news.

715
00:33:16,917 --> 00:33:18,237
Since you've joined Family Feast,

716
00:33:18,477 --> 00:33:19,116
from today,

717
00:33:19,596 --> 00:33:21,717
take charge of that show too.

718
00:34:22,328 --> 00:34:23,192
(Zhou Zeyuan)

719
00:34:28,116 --> 00:34:29,437
(It suddenly dawned on me)

720
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:32,156
(that it's been four months)

721
00:34:32,997 --> 00:34:35,156
(since Zhou Zeyuan last contacted me.)

722
00:34:38,156 --> 00:34:40,357
(He disappeared)

723
00:34:41,397 --> 00:34:42,516
(without a trace.)

724
00:34:55,357 --> 00:34:56,236
Is dinner ready?

725
00:34:57,156 --> 00:34:58,116
Yes. Go wash your hands.

726
00:34:59,116 --> 00:34:59,672
Smells great.

727
00:35:00,917 --> 00:35:01,596
Zhou Zeyuan's

728
00:35:01,917 --> 00:35:02,556
arrested.

729
00:35:07,116 --> 00:35:08,357
When?

730
00:35:08,596 --> 00:35:09,757
I just heard about it.

731
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:15,437
(Recently,)

732
00:35:15,596 --> 00:35:17,556
(head of a well-known medical company,)

733
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:18,397
(Zhou Zeyuan,)

734
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:22,116
(has been arrested for financial fraud,)

735
00:35:22,196 --> 00:35:24,877
(collusion with foreign charities,
and illegally transferring)

736
00:35:24,877 --> 00:35:25,877
(investors' funds.)

737
00:35:25,877 --> 00:35:26,516
That's too much.

738
00:35:26,636 --> 00:35:28,196
(He was apprehended at a Macau casino,)

739
00:35:28,477 --> 00:35:29,397
(for investigation.)

740
00:35:40,437 --> 00:35:41,036
Honey.

741
00:35:42,196 --> 00:35:42,997
You've promised

742
00:35:42,997 --> 00:35:44,556
to invest in him.

743
00:35:45,156 --> 00:35:46,437
Will this affect you?

744
00:35:46,676 --> 00:35:47,516
No.

745
00:35:48,757 --> 00:35:51,917
I heard he was a gambling addict,

746
00:35:52,757 --> 00:35:54,296
so I ended the cooperation long ago.

747
00:35:54,797 --> 00:35:55,877
Moreover, my funds

748
00:35:55,877 --> 00:35:58,156
are managed by professional brokers.

749
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:00,076
There shouldn't be any issues.

750
00:36:04,156 --> 00:36:04,797
That's great.

751
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:06,317
But you...

752
00:36:07,676 --> 00:36:08,917
You sold your car, didn't you?

753
00:36:18,757 --> 00:36:20,397
Because I heard Ms. Ma

754
00:36:21,917 --> 00:36:23,236
also invested heavily in him.

755
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:26,877
She doesn't care about returns.

756
00:36:30,116 --> 00:36:30,837
Why?

757
00:36:31,477 --> 00:36:32,397
As everyone knows,

758
00:36:33,317 --> 00:36:34,797
Ms. Ma's patronized

759
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:36,196
many upstarts

760
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,716
as Zhou Zeyuan.

761
00:36:39,076 --> 00:36:40,196
She enjoys being surrounded

762
00:36:40,357 --> 00:36:41,397
by those

763
00:36:42,236 --> 00:36:43,236
promising youths.

764
00:36:44,516 --> 00:36:45,556
You fell for her act.

765
00:36:50,437 --> 00:36:52,236
Actually, she knew all along

766
00:36:52,236 --> 00:36:53,277
what Zhou was really like.

767
00:37:01,236 --> 00:37:02,516
Try the shrimp.

768
00:37:03,156 --> 00:37:04,357
Last time you said it's salty.

769
00:37:04,636 --> 00:37:05,036
How's it?

770
00:37:06,596 --> 00:37:06,997
Better?

771
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:11,397
Not salty at all.

772
00:37:16,957 --> 00:37:17,556
Yan.

773
00:37:19,716 --> 00:37:21,236
If you want to invest

774
00:37:21,636 --> 00:37:22,317
in the future,

775
00:37:23,196 --> 00:37:24,236
just ask me for money.

776
00:37:25,357 --> 00:37:26,397
No need to sell your car.

777
00:37:38,477 --> 00:37:38,997
Tastes great.

778
00:37:39,196 --> 00:37:40,317
Eat more vegetables.

779
00:37:42,437 --> 00:37:43,236
What soup is this?

780
00:37:43,917 --> 00:37:44,437
Chicken soup.

781
00:37:45,317 --> 00:37:45,997
So nourishing?

782
00:37:46,156 --> 00:37:46,596
Right.

783
00:37:58,196 --> 00:37:59,196
Since he found out

784
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:00,716
you sold your car,

785
00:38:01,156 --> 00:38:02,357
could he's discovered

786
00:38:02,357 --> 00:38:03,317
you lied to him?

787
00:38:08,957 --> 00:38:09,877
Probably not.

788
00:38:13,036 --> 00:38:14,957
Zhou Zeyuan is terrifying.

789
00:38:15,397 --> 00:38:16,437
But why did he

790
00:38:16,437 --> 00:38:17,676
suddenly get caught?

791
00:38:19,556 --> 00:38:21,317
That's what puzzles me too.

792
00:38:21,917 --> 00:38:23,036
I feel like

793
00:38:24,076 --> 00:38:25,236
someone's helping me,

794
00:38:27,917 --> 00:38:29,116
but I don't know who.

795
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:39,076
Never mind.

796
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:39,997
Forget it.

797
00:38:40,437 --> 00:38:40,957
Anyway,

798
00:38:40,957 --> 00:38:42,036
it's resolved now.

799
00:38:42,156 --> 00:38:43,397
You should stop overthinking.

800
00:38:43,716 --> 00:38:44,757
Maybe you're just lucky,

801
00:38:44,917 --> 00:38:46,116
avoiding the dangers, right?

802
00:38:47,317 --> 00:38:47,917
But

803
00:38:48,236 --> 00:38:49,676
I still want to advise you.

804
00:38:50,236 --> 00:38:52,397
You can't keep hiding forever.

805
00:38:52,716 --> 00:38:54,357
Find a proper chance

806
00:38:54,516 --> 00:38:55,797
to explain to the Shen family.

807
00:38:56,317 --> 00:38:57,716
Your husband really loves you.

808
00:38:57,917 --> 00:38:58,997
Talk it through with him,

809
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:00,196
and he'll forgive you.

810
00:39:00,477 --> 00:39:01,716
I do want to tell him.

811
00:39:04,757 --> 00:39:06,397
Just haven't found the right moment.

812
00:39:08,716 --> 00:39:09,076
Alright.

813
00:39:10,156 --> 00:39:11,397
That's good.

814
00:39:12,156 --> 00:39:13,716
I've been worried sick

815
00:39:13,716 --> 00:39:14,516
about this thing.

816
00:39:23,877 --> 00:39:24,636
It's ready.

817
00:39:26,236 --> 00:39:26,676
Eat up.

818
00:39:36,437 --> 00:39:37,076
Yu Yiming!

819
00:39:38,596 --> 00:39:39,397
Just off work?

820
00:39:39,636 --> 00:39:40,196
Had eaten?

821
00:39:40,596 --> 00:39:41,464
Yes, at the canteen.

822
00:39:41,957 --> 00:39:42,837
Xu Yan and I are here.

823
00:39:42,997 --> 00:39:43,997
Join us for more?

824
00:39:44,397 --> 00:39:45,357
The food here's good.

825
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:46,797
- Come on.
- Okay.

826
00:39:46,797 --> 00:39:47,672
Just sit for a while.

827
00:39:48,116 --> 00:39:48,437
Come.

828
00:39:48,957 --> 00:39:49,277
Come.

829
00:39:49,477 --> 00:39:50,596
Try the lamb.

830
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:51,317
Thanks.

831
00:39:52,116 --> 00:39:52,596
Off work?

832
00:39:54,837 --> 00:39:55,236
Here.

833
00:39:56,676 --> 00:39:57,076
Alright.

834
00:39:57,317 --> 00:39:57,757
Enough.

835
00:39:58,877 --> 00:39:59,277
Xu Yan.

836
00:40:00,236 --> 00:40:00,877
Yesterday, I saw

837
00:40:00,877 --> 00:40:01,997
the financial news.

838
00:40:02,116 --> 00:40:02,676
Honestly,

839
00:40:02,712 --> 00:40:03,877
you look great on camera.

840
00:40:04,196 --> 00:40:05,156
Stop teasing me.

841
00:40:05,317 --> 00:40:05,877
Just eat.

842
00:40:06,397 --> 00:40:07,036
I'm serious.

843
00:40:07,716 --> 00:40:08,036
Here.

844
00:40:08,357 --> 00:40:08,716
Try it.

845
00:40:08,716 --> 00:40:09,357
It's enough.

846
00:40:10,757 --> 00:40:11,437
Congratulations.

847
00:40:11,877 --> 00:40:13,156
You finally achieved your dream.

848
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:14,397
Thank you.

849
00:40:15,196 --> 00:40:16,437
Sign an autograph for me later.

850
00:40:17,636 --> 00:40:18,397
When you're famous,

851
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:19,997
I can show off

852
00:40:19,997 --> 00:40:20,797
to my coworkers.

853
00:40:21,156 --> 00:40:22,437
Don't overdo it, Yu Yiming.

854
00:40:24,716 --> 00:40:26,556
Not overdoing.

855
00:40:27,156 --> 00:40:27,716
Well,

856
00:40:28,357 --> 00:40:29,837
my coworkers

857
00:40:30,477 --> 00:40:32,236
all love watching that news

858
00:40:32,877 --> 00:40:33,596
and Family Feast.

859
00:40:34,196 --> 00:40:35,076
Since they learned

860
00:40:35,156 --> 00:40:36,757
we were high-school classmates,

861
00:40:37,156 --> 00:40:38,837
they talk about you all the time.

862
00:40:39,277 --> 00:40:39,757
Well,

863
00:40:40,116 --> 00:40:41,156
give me

864
00:40:41,196 --> 00:40:41,797
your autograph,

865
00:40:41,877 --> 00:40:42,477
okay?

866
00:40:43,317 --> 00:40:43,797
Qiao Lin.

867
00:40:45,357 --> 00:40:46,877
Isn't he tutoring you?

868
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:47,997
How's it going?

869
00:40:48,236 --> 00:40:49,116
Excellent, of course.

870
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:49,877
Just of average.

871
00:40:57,757 --> 00:40:58,357
Forget it.

872
00:40:58,797 --> 00:40:59,357
We finally

873
00:40:59,357 --> 00:40:59,917
reunite today.

874
00:41:00,076 --> 00:41:00,837
This meal's on me.

875
00:41:01,076 --> 00:41:01,556
My treat.

876
00:41:02,397 --> 00:41:03,036
Your treat?

877
00:41:04,357 --> 00:41:04,997
Waiter!

878
00:41:05,076 --> 00:41:06,277
30 more plates of lamb!

879
00:41:09,236 --> 00:41:09,837
You...

880
00:41:10,997 --> 00:41:11,997
Haven't seen Wolverine?

881
00:41:19,156 --> 00:41:20,196
The food was good today.

882
00:41:21,556 --> 00:41:21,997
Qiao Lin.

883
00:41:22,196 --> 00:41:22,596
What?

884
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:23,957
What time to start?

885
00:41:24,277 --> 00:41:24,957
Starting what?

886
00:41:25,636 --> 00:41:26,277
The tutoring.

887
00:41:26,997 --> 00:41:28,277
After all that lamb?

888
00:41:29,036 --> 00:41:30,076
What's wrong with you?

889
00:41:30,357 --> 00:41:31,757
Overheated. Eaten too much lambs.

890
00:41:34,556 --> 00:41:35,236
Overheated?

891
00:41:36,636 --> 00:41:38,317
30 plates will do that.

892
00:42:38,036 --> 00:42:38,757
Are you busy?

893
00:42:45,116 --> 00:42:45,556
What's up?

894
00:42:50,877 --> 00:42:51,957
A friend

895
00:42:54,277 --> 00:42:55,477
just called me.

896
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:01,076
She said before marriage,

897
00:43:01,076 --> 00:43:02,837
she hid something from her husband.

898
00:43:08,036 --> 00:43:09,596
Now she wants to confess.

899
00:43:14,116 --> 00:43:15,437
Why did she hide it?

900
00:43:21,196 --> 00:43:23,596
Afraid to ruin their relationship.

901
00:43:27,076 --> 00:43:27,957
And afraid

902
00:43:32,556 --> 00:43:34,156
he wouldn't have married her.

903
00:43:35,757 --> 00:43:37,877
How's their relationship now?

904
00:43:40,957 --> 00:43:41,437
Great.

905
00:43:44,596 --> 00:43:45,317
That's easy then.

906
00:43:46,076 --> 00:43:48,076
Then keep it hidden.

907
00:43:51,917 --> 00:43:53,277
Keep it hidden?

908
00:44:05,116 --> 00:44:06,437
- But I think...
- No buts.

909
00:44:10,196 --> 00:44:10,636
Listen.

910
00:44:19,596 --> 00:44:21,116
Tell your friend.

911
00:44:21,877 --> 00:44:23,357
Confession

912
00:44:24,156 --> 00:44:25,156
is like a thorn

913
00:44:25,236 --> 00:44:26,516
in marriage.

914
00:44:28,676 --> 00:44:29,716
Principles

915
00:44:29,757 --> 00:44:30,917
are not needed in marriage,

916
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:32,837
right?

917
00:44:35,236 --> 00:44:38,116
Principles are just packaging.

918
00:44:38,196 --> 00:44:39,116
Empty words.

919
00:44:39,997 --> 00:44:40,997
In the end,

920
00:44:41,116 --> 00:44:42,516
a happy ending

921
00:44:43,116 --> 00:44:44,236
is what truly matters.

922
00:44:44,877 --> 00:44:45,397
Right?

923
00:44:50,116 --> 00:44:51,837
Stop worrying about others' problems.

924
00:44:51,837 --> 00:44:52,556
Okay?

925
00:44:53,076 --> 00:44:53,917
Think about me.

926
00:44:56,076 --> 00:44:56,556
Look.

927
00:44:59,556 --> 00:45:00,957
Yuanhang Fund.

928
00:45:01,596 --> 00:45:02,957
Jiang Liang and Jiang Yun

929
00:45:03,516 --> 00:45:05,076
(Yuanhang Fund)
will return to China next week.

930
00:45:05,917 --> 00:45:07,036
I've invited them

931
00:45:07,196 --> 00:45:08,596
to Jinda Group's reception.

932
00:45:11,716 --> 00:45:13,516
You need to help me prepare in advance

933
00:45:15,516 --> 00:45:16,397
to impress

934
00:45:16,504 --> 00:45:17,236
(Jiang Yun, Chairwoman)

935
00:45:17,236 --> 00:45:18,477
Jiang Yun.

936
00:45:25,116 --> 00:45:26,116
Look at her profile.

937
00:45:27,757 --> 00:45:29,596
Thirty-five years old.

938
00:45:30,236 --> 00:45:32,076
Calm,

939
00:45:32,716 --> 00:45:35,116
decisive.

940
00:45:48,952 --> 00:45:50,968
(Mr. Huang's calling)

941
00:45:52,076 --> 00:45:52,556
Hello?

942
00:45:53,116 --> 00:45:54,716
The New District project isn't getting

943
00:45:54,716 --> 00:45:55,957
your father's support now.

944
00:45:56,076 --> 00:45:56,877
We must find

945
00:45:56,957 --> 00:45:59,317
a fund company as backup.

946
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:01,076
Jiang Liang and Jiang Yun

947
00:46:01,196 --> 00:46:02,596
are both back.

948
00:46:02,917 --> 00:46:04,636
Perfect chance

949
00:46:04,676 --> 00:46:05,556
to meet them.

950
00:46:06,036 --> 00:46:06,636
However,

951
00:46:06,757 --> 00:46:08,676
they're famously tough.

952
00:46:09,397 --> 00:46:09,957
Jiang Yun

953
00:46:10,676 --> 00:46:11,516
is calm,

954
00:46:11,716 --> 00:46:12,997
decisive in actions,

955
00:46:13,397 --> 00:46:15,236
and has a bad temper.

956
00:46:15,797 --> 00:46:16,917
(Jiang Yun, Chairwoman)
Known as

957
00:46:16,957 --> 00:46:18,277
the "Black Rose" of investing.

958
00:46:18,997 --> 00:46:19,676
Jiang Liang.

959
00:46:20,317 --> 00:46:22,877
Don't be fooled by the playboy look.

960
00:46:23,277 --> 00:46:24,757
He's meticulous-minded,

961
00:46:24,957 --> 00:46:26,397
(Jiang Liang, Deputy Manager)
a numbers genius.

962
00:46:26,676 --> 00:46:28,516
Key to Yuanhang Fund's finance.

963
00:46:28,997 --> 00:46:31,156
Rumor says he has a photographic memory.

964
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:33,716
This is all I can help you.

965
00:46:34,397 --> 00:46:35,757
The rest is up to you.

966
00:46:36,116 --> 00:46:37,076
