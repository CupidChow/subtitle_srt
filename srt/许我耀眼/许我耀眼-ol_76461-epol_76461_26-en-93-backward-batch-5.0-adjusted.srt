00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:42,469
Who's next?

197
00:07:42,989 --> 00:07:43,628
Come on.

198
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,349
Qiao Lin.

199
00:07:46,472 --> 00:07:48,680
♪If you remember me♪

200
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,360
♪Then I'm pleased♪

201
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,672
(Fleeting Time)

202
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:00,109
This...

203
00:08:02,068 --> 00:08:03,268
Drink less.

204
00:08:03,748 --> 00:08:04,989
When you're upset, you'll...

205
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:06,068
get drunk quickly.

206
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:09,268
I'm upset?

207
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:12,989
I'm happy right now.

208
00:08:14,388 --> 00:08:15,709
Stop pretending.

209
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:17,388
I saw everything.

210
00:08:17,508 --> 00:08:18,628
Yan didn't ask you to stay,

211
00:08:18,868 --> 00:08:19,709
and your face showed

212
00:08:20,748 --> 00:08:21,349
disappointment.

213
00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:26,709
Yiming.

214
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,189
Tell me,

215
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:31,268
have I been

216
00:08:31,268 --> 00:08:32,989
sincere enough?

217
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:33,908
Yes.

218
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,589
I've tried everything I have,

219
00:08:37,628 --> 00:08:38,989
and tried everything

220
00:08:38,989 --> 00:08:40,069
to win her back,

221
00:08:41,069 --> 00:08:41,949
yet she ignored it.

222
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:48,989
Yiming.

223
00:08:50,908 --> 00:08:52,989
I'm done with her.

224
00:08:53,668 --> 00:08:54,628
Alright, done with her.

225
00:08:56,229 --> 00:08:58,069
I won't call her anymore.

226
00:09:02,189 --> 00:09:03,949
If I ever call her again,

227
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:07,469
I'm not a Shen.

228
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:09,429
Stop drinking.

229
00:09:18,268 --> 00:09:18,829
Yan.

230
00:09:19,148 --> 00:09:20,229
I had Meng Zhao

231
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:21,868
take Jiang Liang home.

232
00:09:23,349 --> 00:09:23,989
Let's leave.

233
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,028
Come on, let's go.

234
00:09:26,628 --> 00:09:27,349
Wait.

235
00:09:27,989 --> 00:09:29,189
One last high note to hit.

236
00:09:34,748 --> 00:09:35,709
Beautiful. Let's go.

237
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:37,589
To where?

238
00:09:38,548 --> 00:09:38,989
Sit down.

239
00:09:39,469 --> 00:09:40,229
Let's drink more.

240
00:09:40,548 --> 00:09:42,748
More? You're already drunk.

241
00:09:43,268 --> 00:09:44,109
I'm not drunk.

242
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,349
If you say that,

243
00:09:45,429 --> 00:09:46,788
I'll get upset.

244
00:09:47,268 --> 00:09:48,028
I'm not drunk,

245
00:09:48,109 --> 00:09:48,949
but happy.

246
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:49,908
Pure joy.

247
00:09:50,668 --> 00:09:51,508
I think everything

248
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:52,429
is perfect now.

249
00:09:52,668 --> 00:09:53,548
Drink with me.

250
00:09:55,109 --> 00:09:56,109
Drowning your sorrows,

251
00:09:56,148 --> 00:09:56,548
right?

252
00:09:57,668 --> 00:09:59,109
Alright.

253
00:09:59,748 --> 00:10:01,148
You're upset to let him leave.

254
00:10:01,189 --> 00:10:02,148
Then you should have

255
00:10:02,148 --> 00:10:02,868
asked him to stay.

256
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,028
Now, you're upset.

257
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,829
I'm not upset.

258
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:08,268
I'm happy.

259
00:10:08,548 --> 00:10:09,309
Stop pretending.

260
00:10:09,469 --> 00:10:10,309
Think I can't tell?

261
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:11,429
I have you all.

262
00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:13,109
You all love me.

263
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:15,268
And I have Yan Studio.

264
00:10:16,268 --> 00:10:17,788
So many things make me happy.

265
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,309
I don't care if he wants to leave.

266
00:10:21,349 --> 00:10:21,829
Don't stay.

267
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:22,868
Just walk.

268
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:24,309
Don't stay.

269
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:25,388
Would I stay?

270
00:10:25,508 --> 00:10:26,309
I won't either.

271
00:10:26,868 --> 00:10:27,668
It doesn't matter.

272
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:29,309
Who cares?

273
00:10:30,989 --> 00:10:32,069
Who cares if Shen Haoming

274
00:10:32,109 --> 00:10:32,949
loves me.

275
00:10:34,908 --> 00:10:35,589
Stop it.

276
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:36,949
Need a gulp.

277
00:10:53,788 --> 00:10:55,388
Yan, answer the phone.

278
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:57,189
I got signal here.

279
00:10:57,508 --> 00:10:58,189
Yan.

280
00:10:58,548 --> 00:10:59,788
Answer the phone.

281
00:10:59,989 --> 00:11:00,868
Get down here.

282
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:02,268
You swore you'd never call her.

283
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:03,589
Listen.

284
00:11:03,668 --> 00:11:04,508
Calling her now

285
00:11:04,548 --> 00:11:05,268
disgusts her more.

286
00:11:07,148 --> 00:11:08,469
I would never disgust Yan.

287
00:11:08,989 --> 00:11:09,908
She loves me,

288
00:11:09,908 --> 00:11:11,388
right, Yan?

289
00:11:13,028 --> 00:11:13,949
Yan!

290
00:11:14,628 --> 00:11:15,949
Haoming, listen.

291
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:16,989
You're no Shen anymore.

292
00:11:17,628 --> 00:11:19,069
I don't care. Yan.

293
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:20,229
I love you.

294
00:11:20,469 --> 00:11:21,748
Answer the phone.

295
00:11:22,508 --> 00:11:23,748
Why did you open the window?

296
00:11:24,668 --> 00:11:26,148
I think someone's calling me.

297
00:11:26,788 --> 00:11:27,628
Who is it?

298
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:28,788
No one's calling you.

299
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:29,349
Come on.

300
00:11:29,349 --> 00:11:30,268
Someone's calling me.

301
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:31,069
Who is it?

302
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:32,668
Alright.

303
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:37,229
I feel terrible.

304
00:11:38,109 --> 00:11:38,868
I want to go home.

305
00:11:39,229 --> 00:11:40,349
Okay, we're going back.

306
00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:41,268
We'll be there soon.

307
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:44,148
Wait.

308
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:47,069
This isn't my house.

309
00:11:47,788 --> 00:11:48,469
It is.

310
00:11:48,989 --> 00:11:49,829
No, my house

311
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:51,868
is not on this way.

312
00:11:53,388 --> 00:11:55,788
I live at Building 7, 33 East District.

313
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:56,908
Where are we?

314
00:11:57,148 --> 00:11:57,429
Well,

315
00:11:57,589 --> 00:11:58,829
we're on the way to your place.

316
00:11:58,829 --> 00:11:59,148
This...

317
00:11:59,148 --> 00:11:59,868
No.

318
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:00,908
Turn around.

319
00:12:01,349 --> 00:12:02,229
Where are you going?

320
00:12:02,229 --> 00:12:03,349
Turn around!

321
00:12:04,748 --> 00:12:05,788
Don't be a gate-crasher.

322
00:12:05,868 --> 00:12:07,469
I'm not. That's my house.

323
00:12:07,868 --> 00:12:08,268
Where?

324
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:08,908
I don't know.

325
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:09,829
My house!

326
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:11,309
Don't you live in Lugang?

327
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:13,349
Kind of.

328
00:12:14,268 --> 00:12:15,788
No. Turn around!

329
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:17,309
Turn around.

330
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:20,508
Hey...

331
00:12:20,989 --> 00:12:21,908
Think it carefully.

332
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:22,668
Where is it?

333
00:12:23,388 --> 00:12:24,429
Don't be a gate-crasher.

334
00:12:24,508 --> 00:12:24,949
You!

335
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:25,709
Alright.

336
00:12:25,748 --> 00:12:26,429
Take a rest.

337
00:12:30,868 --> 00:12:31,668
I'm back.

338
00:12:31,868 --> 00:12:32,628
Okay, come back.

339
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,069
I'll be back soon.

340
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:39,069
Jeez!

341
00:12:43,748 --> 00:12:44,829
Wait for me.

342
00:13:28,788 --> 00:13:29,548
Stop it.

343
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:45,548
Well...

344
00:13:47,109 --> 00:13:48,309
I drank too much last night.

345
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:51,709
It's okay.

346
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:59,309
No one knows I'm here,

347
00:13:59,508 --> 00:14:00,028
anyway.

348
00:14:02,548 --> 00:14:03,148
Who is it?

349
00:14:04,748 --> 00:14:05,628
Haoming, are you up?

350
00:14:06,189 --> 00:14:06,989
It's almost noon.

351
00:14:06,989 --> 00:14:07,589
Get up.

352
00:14:08,189 --> 00:14:08,868
Why is he here?

353
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:11,548
Why are you here?

354
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:12,268
I'm here too.

355
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:14,388
Yan.

356
00:14:14,748 --> 00:14:16,148
You two blacked out last night.

357
00:14:16,548 --> 00:14:17,388
Want to know

358
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:18,668
what happened yesterday?

359
00:14:19,349 --> 00:14:20,148
Get dressed.

360
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:21,148
Come see the video!

361
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:29,189
You go get dressed.

362
00:14:30,908 --> 00:14:31,469
It's okay.

363
00:14:32,109 --> 00:14:32,709
You first.

364
00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:34,028
I won't look.

365
00:14:49,148 --> 00:14:49,829
The quilt.

366
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:53,268
The quilt.

367
00:14:56,628 --> 00:14:57,148
Sorry.

368
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:58,028
Don't move.

369
00:15:03,748 --> 00:15:04,148
Come.

370
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:05,069
Easy, easy.

371
00:15:05,508 --> 00:15:06,628
Yiming, you're the best.

372
00:15:06,748 --> 00:15:08,429
You're so nice to drink with me.

373
00:15:08,469 --> 00:15:08,989
Okay.

374
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:10,349
You're home.

375
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:11,508
Alright.

376
00:15:12,508 --> 00:15:13,868
Why is this a bar?

377
00:15:14,268 --> 00:15:15,148
No, you're home.

378
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:16,148
This is a bar!

379
00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:18,309
Such a beautiful bar!

380
00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:19,748
Sit down first.

381
00:15:19,868 --> 00:15:20,268
Sit down.

382
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:21,429
- There's a sofa here.
- Bar.

383
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:27,229
Open the door.

384
00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:29,069
Open the door.

385
00:15:30,628 --> 00:15:31,508
Honey!

386
00:15:33,229 --> 00:15:34,148
Honey!

387
00:15:36,748 --> 00:15:37,349
Why here?

388
00:15:38,349 --> 00:15:39,189
Isn't it obvious?

389
00:15:40,508 --> 00:15:41,189
I'm home.

390
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:43,868
I feel like throwing up.

391
00:15:46,548 --> 00:15:48,469
Why did you drink so much?

392
00:15:49,268 --> 00:15:49,748
No.

393
00:15:50,388 --> 00:15:52,268
Why did you drink so much?

394
00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:54,069
Wait, why is there

395
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:54,949
a stranger?

396
00:15:55,109 --> 00:15:55,908
It's so late now.

397
00:15:55,949 --> 00:15:57,788
Staying out this late?

398
00:15:58,189 --> 00:15:58,628
Get out.

399
00:15:59,829 --> 00:16:00,508
Who are you?

400
00:16:00,788 --> 00:16:02,028
Who are you?

401
00:16:02,788 --> 00:16:03,508
Call the police!

402
00:16:03,788 --> 00:16:05,788
This is my bar!

403
00:16:06,388 --> 00:16:07,709
This is my bar!

404
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:08,949
Why call the police?

405
00:16:08,989 --> 00:16:10,349
This is my house.

406
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:11,628
This is my house.

407
00:16:11,628 --> 00:16:12,189
My house!

408
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:12,989
My house!

409
00:16:13,109 --> 00:16:13,709
Mine!

410
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:15,268
Why did you bring her here?

411
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:16,508
- They're fighting now!
- Want a fight?

412
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:17,349
- Think I wanted this?
- Alright.

413
00:16:17,788 --> 00:16:18,589
She insisted on

414
00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:19,388
going here.

415
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:20,109
What could I do?

416
00:16:21,109 --> 00:16:22,388
Stop making things up.

417
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:23,349
Not that dramatic.

418
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,429
I'm just telling

419
00:16:24,668 --> 00:16:25,429
the truth,

420
00:16:25,668 --> 00:16:26,788
or I'll take your last name.

421
00:16:27,388 --> 00:16:28,628
But you lost your surname.

422
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:30,309
Well...

423
00:16:31,748 --> 00:16:32,628
That means

424
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,148
you two stayed here

425
00:16:34,229 --> 00:16:35,229
last night, right?

426
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:38,028
It's because you two

427
00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:39,309
were unpredictable!

428
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:41,668
One second you're enemies...

429
00:16:41,748 --> 00:16:42,508
The next

430
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,709
you were inseparable.

431
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:45,709
I want to throw up.

432
00:16:46,349 --> 00:16:47,748
Put me down!

433
00:16:48,109 --> 00:16:48,748
I'm warning you,

434
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:50,028
I'll count to three.

435
00:16:50,148 --> 00:16:51,069
Put me down now!

436
00:16:51,229 --> 00:16:51,748
Go ahead.

437
00:16:52,189 --> 00:16:52,668
Three.

438
00:16:57,748 --> 00:16:58,388
Three.

439
00:17:01,108 --> 00:17:01,669
Three.

440
00:17:03,068 --> 00:17:03,588
Yan! Yan!

441
00:17:03,588 --> 00:17:04,469
Be careful.

442
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:06,389
Be careful.

443
00:17:07,508 --> 00:17:08,149
I'm dizzy.

444
00:17:08,629 --> 00:17:09,268
Honey.

445
00:17:11,588 --> 00:17:12,508
You're so beautiful.

446
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:14,229
Honey, you're so manly.

447
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:17,308
You're finally back.

448
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:18,548
Did you hear

449
00:17:18,548 --> 00:17:20,308
me calling your name?

450
00:17:20,629 --> 00:17:22,429
I knew it was you calling me.

451
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:24,669
Good that you heard.

452
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:27,909
Let's go.

453
00:17:28,788 --> 00:17:29,308
Wait!

454
00:17:31,469 --> 00:17:32,028
Put me down!

455
00:17:32,588 --> 00:17:33,308
Now!

456
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:37,068
Who is this?

457
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:39,709
Where is my wedding photo?

458
00:17:41,308 --> 00:17:42,909
Whose back is this?

459
00:17:43,469 --> 00:17:44,909
Don't rush. Wait for me.

460
00:17:51,828 --> 00:17:53,548
This is my back.

461
00:17:55,588 --> 00:17:57,308
No. Don't try to fool me.

462
00:17:57,669 --> 00:17:58,788
This one is slimmer.

463
00:17:59,389 --> 00:18:00,028
See?

464
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:04,068
The shoulders
are much leaner than yours.

465
00:18:04,308 --> 00:18:04,989
Understand?

466
00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:07,068
This was before I built muscle.

467
00:18:08,068 --> 00:18:08,629
This...

468
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:11,348
I am

469
00:18:12,588 --> 00:18:14,229
facing my wife.

470
00:18:15,548 --> 00:18:17,108
Right here.

471
00:18:18,508 --> 00:18:19,949
My wife is so beautiful.

472
00:18:20,788 --> 00:18:21,869
Right here.

473
00:18:23,028 --> 00:18:23,669
Honey.

474
00:18:24,268 --> 00:18:24,828
Come.

475
00:18:27,068 --> 00:18:29,108
First pan-fry the tuna.

476
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:30,068
Okay?

477
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,268
Golden brown on both sides, okay?

478
00:18:34,828 --> 00:18:35,268
Hungry.

479
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:36,788
Should be fine now.

480
00:18:38,548 --> 00:18:40,108
Which one do you want?

481
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:42,989
This one?

482
00:18:43,788 --> 00:18:44,828
The one that just swam by.

483
00:18:44,949 --> 00:18:45,469
This one?

484
00:18:45,629 --> 00:18:46,949
That one! That one!

485
00:18:47,149 --> 00:18:48,828
They aren't sober at all.

486
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:50,949
What if something

487
00:18:50,949 --> 00:18:51,308
happens?

488
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:53,149
Maybe we should stay.

489
00:18:53,348 --> 00:18:53,949
Makes sense.

490
00:18:54,748 --> 00:18:55,748
I'm afraid they'd really

491
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:56,629
eat live fish.

492
00:18:57,268 --> 00:18:58,149
I want to eat it.

493
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:06,508
Don't!

494
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:08,268
Not here.

495
00:19:09,068 --> 00:19:09,869
It's cold here.

496
00:19:09,989 --> 00:19:11,028
- You'll catch cold.
- Don't.

497
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:11,588
Don't.

498
00:19:11,828 --> 00:19:12,548
Go to the bedroom.

499
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:13,548
Where's the bedroom?

500
00:19:13,548 --> 00:19:14,028
Bedroom!

501
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:17,709
You know what?

502
00:19:18,348 --> 00:19:19,588
You two were too wild.

503
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:20,508
Right there,

504
00:19:21,108 --> 00:19:22,989
you kept taking
clothes off and touching.

505
00:19:23,149 --> 00:19:24,108
We were worried you'd

506
00:19:24,189 --> 00:19:25,308
catch cold,

507
00:19:25,709 --> 00:19:26,788
so we sent you upstairs.

508
00:19:26,788 --> 00:19:27,828
But you still did wild.

509
00:19:29,949 --> 00:19:30,268
Fine.

510
00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:32,028
Then stop.

511
00:19:32,189 --> 00:19:32,548
Right.

512
00:19:32,828 --> 00:19:34,389
I'm getting a break. I'll take her out.

513
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:34,669
Right.

514
00:19:34,709 --> 00:19:36,108
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

515
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:37,949
I want to go out too.

516
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:39,989
You? You go with him.

517
00:19:40,028 --> 00:19:40,909
I need to go date.

518
00:19:41,068 --> 00:19:41,748
I'm leaving. Bye.

519
00:19:41,788 --> 00:19:42,588
Let's go.

520
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,629
Shall we...

521
00:19:51,548 --> 00:19:52,588
I need to work today.

522
00:19:55,268 --> 00:19:56,068
Me too.

523
00:20:02,189 --> 00:20:03,989
Did I bring my bag yesterday?

524
00:20:06,028 --> 00:20:06,788
I'll look for it.

525
00:20:07,229 --> 00:20:07,748
Thanks.

526
00:20:11,268 --> 00:20:12,429
Can't be here.

527
00:20:13,508 --> 00:20:14,308
I'll look for it.

528
00:20:19,189 --> 00:20:19,709
This...

529
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:20,588
Nothing.

530
00:20:20,748 --> 00:20:21,268
No?

531
00:20:21,748 --> 00:20:22,788
Not here either?

532
00:20:23,068 --> 00:20:23,588
Let me see.

533
00:20:28,788 --> 00:20:29,308
Over there.

534
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:30,508
There.

535
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:33,149
Right.

536
00:20:39,469 --> 00:20:40,268
Found it.

537
00:20:41,189 --> 00:20:41,869
Hard to find.

538
00:20:41,869 --> 00:20:42,909
Well...

539
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:44,429
I'm leaving.

540
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:49,189
Want to grab a meal before that?

541
00:20:52,229 --> 00:20:52,828
Sounds good.

542
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:56,669
What would you like?

543
00:20:57,748 --> 00:20:58,429
Anything is fine.

544
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:00,989
Like what?

545
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:04,629
Haoming.

546
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:06,149
I bought you food.

547
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,348
Are you home?

548
00:21:20,389 --> 00:21:20,949
She left.

549
00:21:28,108 --> 00:21:28,669
Yes.

550
00:21:33,629 --> 00:21:34,548
I am still here.

551
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,548
Morning, Mom.

552
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:44,348
Look.

553
00:21:44,389 --> 00:21:44,909
This is good.

554
00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:45,429
Quite sturdy.

555
00:21:46,828 --> 00:21:48,028
We're doing

556
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:48,709
exercises.

557
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:51,189
Tricep training.

558
00:21:51,189 --> 00:21:52,149
Very good.

559
00:21:53,788 --> 00:21:54,068
Nice.

560
00:21:54,108 --> 00:21:54,588
Well done.

561
00:21:54,909 --> 00:21:55,348
Work?

562
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:55,869
Great.

563
00:21:56,268 --> 00:21:56,788
Go to work.

564
00:21:56,788 --> 00:21:57,189
Work.

565
00:21:57,469 --> 00:21:58,189
Okay, me too.

566
00:21:59,429 --> 00:21:59,909
Pants.

567
00:22:01,949 --> 00:22:02,828
I'm going to work out.

568
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:04,229
He's so cute.

569
00:22:04,229 --> 00:22:05,469
Mom, want to work out?

570
00:22:05,469 --> 00:22:06,068
- Work out.
- Yes.

571
00:22:07,508 --> 00:22:08,548
I bought some breakfast.

572
00:22:08,949 --> 00:22:09,909
How about...

573
00:22:12,108 --> 00:22:12,469
Perfect.

574
00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:13,788
Let me help you, Mom.

575
00:22:14,588 --> 00:22:16,028
I'll help.

576
00:22:26,788 --> 00:22:27,588
Yan, eat this.

577
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:29,149
I think

578
00:22:29,189 --> 00:22:30,229
it's your favorite.

579
00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:31,389
Have a few more.

580
00:22:35,989 --> 00:22:36,508
Yan.

581
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:38,696
Congratulations
on winning the competition.

582
00:22:38,989 --> 00:22:39,748
Haoming

583
00:22:39,748 --> 00:22:41,108
has been happy for you about this.

584
00:22:42,189 --> 00:22:42,828
Right, Haoming?

585
00:22:44,748 --> 00:22:45,189
Yes.

586
00:22:45,548 --> 00:22:47,308
Actually, Haoming has helped me a lot,

587
00:22:48,308 --> 00:22:49,709
so I should thank him.

588
00:22:53,389 --> 00:22:54,229
There's something

589
00:22:54,229 --> 00:22:55,189
I need your help with.

590
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:59,028
Haochen has advanced
in his equestrian competition.

591
00:22:59,229 --> 00:23:00,229
He wants to hold

592
00:23:00,268 --> 00:23:01,629
a home party.

593
00:23:02,268 --> 00:23:03,748
You know him best.

594
00:23:04,108 --> 00:23:05,028
Could you help me

595
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:05,949
and plan it out?

596
00:23:08,828 --> 00:23:09,508
No problem.

597
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:10,788
I'll make a plan

598
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:12,108
and send you then.

599
00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:12,909
Mom.

600
00:23:12,949 --> 00:23:14,068
Ask Haochen

601
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:15,068
if he has any ideas,

602
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:15,869
okay?

603
00:23:16,469 --> 00:23:17,788
Why don't you just come home

604
00:23:17,788 --> 00:23:18,389
and handle it?

605
00:23:19,028 --> 00:23:20,068
Haochen would be thrilled

606
00:23:20,068 --> 00:23:20,909
to see you back.

607
00:23:21,469 --> 00:23:22,588
So is Haoming.

608
00:23:22,949 --> 00:23:23,429
Right?

609
00:23:28,268 --> 00:23:29,669
I'll check my schedule.

610
00:23:31,028 --> 00:23:31,828
It's settled then.

611
00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:37,588
This is also your favorite.

612
00:23:39,108 --> 00:23:39,548
Mom.

613
00:23:40,108 --> 00:23:41,669
I really need to go to work

614
00:23:41,709 --> 00:23:42,348
today.

615
00:23:43,828 --> 00:23:45,389
I haven't even freshened up...

616
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:47,389
For the files.

617
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:50,869
Well...

618
00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:52,028
take your time.

619
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:53,189
I'm leaving.

620
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:55,669
Well...

621
00:23:56,828 --> 00:23:58,068
Haoming, see Yan out.

622
00:23:58,108 --> 00:23:58,469
No need.

623
00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:01,429
Stay here and finish your meal.

624
00:24:01,788 --> 00:24:02,308
Okay.

625
00:24:03,588 --> 00:24:05,149
What? Just go!

626
00:24:30,389 --> 00:24:30,949
Hot?

627
00:24:33,828 --> 00:24:34,429
No.

628
00:24:36,629 --> 00:24:37,508
Need the AC?

629
00:24:38,028 --> 00:24:38,588
No.

630
00:24:38,748 --> 00:24:39,108
Okay.

631
00:24:46,788 --> 00:24:48,108
Play some music?

632
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:49,548
Okay.

633
00:25:13,189 --> 00:25:14,268
Let's turn it off.

634
00:25:22,028 --> 00:25:23,308
My mom's always been like this.

635
00:25:24,268 --> 00:25:25,429
Speaks her mind,

636
00:25:25,828 --> 00:25:26,788
without caring others.

637
00:25:27,268 --> 00:25:27,909
Well,

638
00:25:28,389 --> 00:25:29,189
I think it's nice.

639
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:30,909
Be open and honest,

640
00:25:32,348 --> 00:25:33,588
never hiding feelings.

641
00:25:50,108 --> 00:25:50,909
- Right, you...
- Right, you...

642
00:25:53,308 --> 00:25:53,989
You first.

643
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:56,989
How's Yan Studio lately?

644
00:25:59,268 --> 00:25:59,709
Good.

645
00:26:01,588 --> 00:26:03,028
After the competition,

646
00:26:04,108 --> 00:26:05,429
our sales are back to normal.

647
00:26:05,869 --> 00:26:07,348
So our third batch

648
00:26:07,348 --> 00:26:08,508
is being produced now.

649
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:10,989
Great.

650
00:26:11,629 --> 00:26:12,709
People have

651
00:26:12,828 --> 00:26:14,308
high recognition for handmade brocade

652
00:26:14,348 --> 00:26:15,149
right now.

653
00:26:15,588 --> 00:26:16,469
Then what's

654
00:26:16,469 --> 00:26:17,429
your next plan?

655
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:21,588
I want to develop more projects

656
00:26:21,828 --> 00:26:24,229
about traditional dyeing techniques.

657
00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:25,949
For example,

658
00:26:26,989 --> 00:26:27,709
Shu brocade.

659
00:26:29,229 --> 00:26:29,828
Heard of it?

660
00:26:33,068 --> 00:26:34,024
Gambiered Canton gauze,

661
00:26:34,949 --> 00:26:35,548
grass cloth.

662
00:26:36,989 --> 00:26:37,669
Moreover,

663
00:26:37,949 --> 00:26:40,068
I want to create a new series

664
00:26:40,229 --> 00:26:42,389
about botanical dyeing technique.

665
00:26:43,189 --> 00:26:44,508
I think it would be unique.

666
00:26:44,949 --> 00:26:45,629
But this

667
00:26:45,629 --> 00:26:46,828
requires training.

668
00:26:47,588 --> 00:26:48,068
Wonderful.

669
00:26:49,469 --> 00:26:50,909
What did you want to ask me?

670
00:26:52,108 --> 00:26:53,189
I wanted to ask you

671
00:26:53,828 --> 00:26:55,909
if your collaboration with Mr. Baraikin

672
00:26:56,429 --> 00:26:56,909
goes well.

673
00:26:58,068 --> 00:26:58,869
Very well.

674
00:26:59,389 --> 00:26:59,869
Also,

675
00:27:00,709 --> 00:27:01,869
Mrs. Baraikin

676
00:27:02,348 --> 00:27:03,629
is very concerned about you.

677
00:27:06,909 --> 00:27:07,429
Right.

678
00:27:09,748 --> 00:27:11,348
I should properly thank her,

679
00:27:11,348 --> 00:27:12,348
but I've been too busy.

680
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,788
Are you free tomorrow evening?

681
00:27:20,108 --> 00:27:21,268
I'll invite them for dinner.

682
00:27:24,508 --> 00:27:24,989
Sure.

683
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:26,588
I'll treat them.

684
00:27:26,869 --> 00:27:27,588
No,

685
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:28,629
my treat this time.

686
00:27:29,108 --> 00:27:31,108
Tomorrow at 6 PM.
I'll text you the address.

687
00:27:32,469 --> 00:27:32,788
Okay.

688
00:27:35,389 --> 00:27:37,229
I wonder if Mr. Baraikin

689
00:27:37,308 --> 00:27:39,068
prefers domestic or imported liquor.

690
00:27:40,028 --> 00:27:41,308
I'll prepare both.

691
00:27:44,508 --> 00:27:45,508
Are we drinking tomorrow?

692
00:27:46,788 --> 00:27:47,429
Of course.

693
00:27:48,189 --> 00:27:48,949
Last time,

694
00:27:48,949 --> 00:27:49,909
he and I didn't enjoy.

695
00:27:50,308 --> 00:27:50,989
Let me tell you,

696
00:27:51,429 --> 00:27:52,548
alcohol is wonderful.

697
00:27:52,709 --> 00:27:53,548
After drinking,

698
00:27:53,828 --> 00:27:55,149
it brings us closer

699
00:27:55,629 --> 00:27:56,348
and builds bond.

700
00:28:01,308 --> 00:28:02,788
You shouldn't drink tomorrow.

701
00:28:05,548 --> 00:28:06,429
I can handle it.

702
00:28:16,788 --> 00:28:17,548
Gas it up.

703
00:28:20,108 --> 00:28:21,108
I definitely will.

704
00:28:27,389 --> 00:28:28,588
I mean your car.

705
00:28:48,028 --> 00:28:48,869
We've confirmed

706
00:28:48,869 --> 00:28:50,028
the details with the factory.

707
00:28:50,268 --> 00:28:51,268
They'll prioritize

708
00:28:51,308 --> 00:28:52,229
producing our line.

709
00:28:52,548 --> 00:28:53,709
The release date

710
00:28:53,748 --> 00:28:54,669
can likely be moved up.

711
00:28:56,588 --> 00:28:57,748
And 30 percent deposit?

712
00:28:58,828 --> 00:29:00,149
The factory manager

713
00:29:00,268 --> 00:29:01,548
has changed attitudes.

714
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:02,989
Now he's eager to keep us.

715
00:29:03,828 --> 00:29:04,989
The award changed everything.

716
00:29:06,268 --> 00:29:07,068
So,

717
00:29:07,709 --> 00:29:09,108
we need to improve and stay strong.

718
00:29:09,989 --> 00:29:10,989
Once we are stronger,

719
00:29:12,308 --> 00:29:13,629
the world smiles at us.

720
00:29:18,068 --> 00:29:19,469
Monitor the factory closely.

721
00:29:20,108 --> 00:29:20,588
No problem.

722
00:29:20,869 --> 00:29:21,909
Let's end here for today.

723
00:29:22,989 --> 00:29:23,588
Head back early

724
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:24,909
- and get some rest.
- Alright.

725
00:29:25,788 --> 00:29:27,229
I'll review this with you.

726
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:28,709
Bye.

727
00:29:29,548 --> 00:29:30,429
Are you busy tonight?

728
00:29:31,548 --> 00:29:32,028
Yes.

729
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:37,028
Hello.

730
00:29:38,788 --> 00:29:39,748
Who's the person

731
00:29:39,748 --> 00:29:40,348
in charge?

732
00:29:41,028 --> 00:29:41,508
Hello.

733
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:42,669
I'm Xu Yan.

734
00:29:43,189 --> 00:29:44,268
Let me introduce myself.

735
00:29:45,108 --> 00:29:46,308
I'm Zhang Fengyu,

736
00:29:46,629 --> 00:29:48,909
Director of the Economic Service Center
of Gubei Town.

737
00:29:49,189 --> 00:29:50,108
My business card.

738
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:51,068
Okay.

739
00:29:51,348 --> 00:29:52,548
I heard about you won

740
00:29:52,748 --> 00:29:53,389
the competition

741
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:54,588
and came to visit.

742
00:29:55,348 --> 00:29:56,469
Here to place orders?

743
00:29:57,788 --> 00:29:58,508
Actually,

744
00:29:59,028 --> 00:30:00,268
I'm not here to purchase.

745
00:30:01,108 --> 00:30:02,108
Let me tell you

746
00:30:02,189 --> 00:30:03,229
the purpose of my visit.

747
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,788
This is Gubei Town's

748
00:30:07,268 --> 00:30:07,828
brochure.

749
00:30:07,909 --> 00:30:08,508
(Gubei Town)
Take a look.

750
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:10,788
This is the leaflet

751
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,229
of our botanical dyeing technique.

752
00:30:13,389 --> 00:30:13,949
Take a look.

753
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:20,748
Gubei Town specializes
in botanical dyeing,

754
00:30:21,229 --> 00:30:22,548
an intangible cultural heritage.

755
00:30:23,108 --> 00:30:24,629
We know you've helped promote

756
00:30:24,629 --> 00:30:26,268
the handmade brocade.

757
00:30:26,268 --> 00:30:26,909
I wonder

758
00:30:27,268 --> 00:30:28,548
if you could

759
00:30:29,068 --> 00:30:30,909
help promote our botanical dyeing.

760
00:30:32,068 --> 00:30:33,588
We are about

761
00:30:33,588 --> 00:30:34,508
to develop this series.

762
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:38,469
I was right to come!

763
00:30:39,108 --> 00:30:39,828
Wonderful!

764
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:41,229
To be honest,

765
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:42,548
for promoting

766
00:30:42,748 --> 00:30:43,909
Gubei Town's tourism,

767
00:30:44,308 --> 00:30:44,828
we plan

768
00:30:45,229 --> 00:30:46,949
to invite influencers

769
00:30:46,989 --> 00:30:47,788
to come for a tour.

770
00:30:48,788 --> 00:30:49,469
We want more

771
00:30:49,469 --> 00:30:50,308
promotional angles.

772
00:30:50,588 --> 00:30:51,028
But

773
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:52,748
I trust you

774
00:30:53,108 --> 00:30:54,629
on promoting the botanical dyeing.

775
00:30:56,629 --> 00:30:57,229
Thank you.

776
00:30:57,909 --> 00:30:59,469
Mr. Zhang, thank you

777
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:01,308
for your trust in Yan Studio.

778
00:31:02,149 --> 00:31:03,588
We're deeply interested in

779
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:04,989
the botanical dyeing.

780
00:31:06,028 --> 00:31:07,308
We'll contact you later

781
00:31:07,429 --> 00:31:08,389
for the details.

782
00:31:10,308 --> 00:31:11,869
I need to study more

783
00:31:11,909 --> 00:31:13,788
about botanical dyeing.

784
00:31:14,028 --> 00:31:14,429
Ms. Xu.

785
00:31:15,028 --> 00:31:16,828
We have botanical dyeing workshops.

786
00:31:17,149 --> 00:31:18,149
Just come.

787
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:19,949
I'll arrange hands-on sessions for you.

788
00:31:20,348 --> 00:31:20,669
Right.

789
00:31:21,308 --> 00:31:22,268
This is Gubei Town's

790
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:23,308
invitation letter.

791
00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:23,909
Here.

792
00:31:23,989 --> 00:31:24,348
Okay.

793
00:31:24,814 --> 00:31:27,816
(Invitation)

794
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:29,108
Thank you so much.

795
00:31:29,548 --> 00:31:30,588
No, thank you so much.

796
00:31:31,028 --> 00:31:31,788
I'm leaving then.

797
00:31:32,709 --> 00:31:33,949
- I'll see you out.
- No need.

798
00:31:33,949 --> 00:31:34,629
Don't bother.

799
00:31:35,108 --> 00:31:35,828
See you in town.

800
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:37,949
- Bye.
- Take care.

801
00:31:39,629 --> 00:31:41,189
Perfect timing.

802
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:43,469
Things go smoothly.

803
00:31:46,028 --> 00:31:46,389
Right.

804
00:31:46,869 --> 00:31:47,989
Sort out all the materials

805
00:31:48,068 --> 00:31:49,229
we collected about

806
00:31:49,469 --> 00:31:50,149
botanical dyeing,

807
00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:51,028
and hold a meeting.

808
00:31:51,348 --> 00:31:51,828
Okay.

809
00:31:55,348 --> 00:31:55,828
Ms. Xu.

810
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:56,949
Let's go.

811
00:31:57,508 --> 00:31:58,108
Where to?

812
00:31:58,429 --> 00:32:00,108
An excellent Yunnan cuisine restaurant.

813
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:01,189
Let's go try it today.

814
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:04,588
I have plans.

815
00:32:06,068 --> 00:32:06,588
I'm leaving.

816
00:32:08,709 --> 00:32:09,189
Leaving?

817
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,669
Then Ms. Qiao, shall we go?

818
00:32:12,909 --> 00:32:13,588
I have plans too.

819
00:32:16,588 --> 00:32:16,949
Wait,

820
00:32:17,508 --> 00:32:18,389
only us have no plans?

821
00:32:18,748 --> 00:32:19,669
Apparently.

822
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:53,149
This place is gorgeous.

823
00:32:54,669 --> 00:32:55,869
Stunning.

824
00:32:58,189 --> 00:32:58,669
You're here.

825
00:32:59,869 --> 00:33:00,548
Nice to meet you.

826
00:33:01,149 --> 00:33:01,709
Same here.

827
00:33:01,748 --> 00:33:02,308
Welcome.

828
00:33:02,308 --> 00:33:03,788
Mr. Shen, we meet again.

829
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:04,268
Hello.

830
00:33:04,709 --> 00:33:05,469
Everything's ready.

831
00:33:05,869 --> 00:33:06,748
Okay, thanks.

832
00:33:25,508 --> 00:33:25,989
Thank you.

833
00:33:48,669 --> 00:33:49,348
Hello.

834
00:33:49,748 --> 00:33:51,028
In a hurry to go to the banquet?

835
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:51,949
Miss Xu.

836
00:34:04,429 --> 00:34:05,309
What's the matter,

837
00:34:05,349 --> 00:34:05,869
Steve?

838
00:34:08,548 --> 00:34:09,349
I want to give you

839
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:10,228
a friendly warning.

840
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:11,708
No need,

841
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:12,188
thanks.

842
00:34:13,028 --> 00:34:14,108
Don't you want to know

843
00:34:14,269 --> 00:34:15,309
why Shen Haoming

844
00:34:15,309 --> 00:34:16,269
invited you here?

845
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:19,349
Networking?

846
00:34:20,269 --> 00:34:21,269
Or acting with him?

847
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:23,429
Seems like

848
00:34:23,548 --> 00:34:24,869
Shen Haoming

849
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:25,989
has deceived you.

850
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:27,909
Perhaps you don't know

851
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:31,188
Baraikin set a three-month
evaluation period for Jinda Group.

852
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:33,228
When Yan Studio was in trouble,

853
00:34:33,548 --> 00:34:34,588
he tried everything

854
00:34:34,588 --> 00:34:35,588
to help you.

855
00:34:36,548 --> 00:34:37,548
Have you ever considered

856
00:34:39,108 --> 00:34:40,628
he did all that

857
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,668
merely to keep you

858
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,028
from divorce?

859
00:34:45,068 --> 00:34:46,068
Everything he did

860
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:48,148
was just for business,

861
00:34:49,188 --> 00:34:49,909
not out of love.

862
00:34:50,108 --> 00:34:52,068
How long will you stay
in Jingzhou this time?

863
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:53,108
Actually,

864
00:34:53,108 --> 00:34:54,148
I came with my husband.

865
00:34:54,628 --> 00:34:55,749
He's here to discuss

866
00:34:55,749 --> 00:34:57,188
a collaboration project.

867
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:57,829
Right,

868
00:34:58,508 --> 00:34:59,228
Haoming's company

869
00:34:59,309 --> 00:35:00,508
is on our shortlist

870
00:35:00,508 --> 00:35:01,429
for the collaboration.

871
00:35:01,548 --> 00:35:02,389
However,

872
00:35:02,389 --> 00:35:03,469
all companies will face

873
00:35:03,508 --> 00:35:04,708
a three-month evaluation.

874
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:08,188
Then I'll wait

875
00:35:08,188 --> 00:35:08,749
for good news.

876
00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:13,789
Shen Haoming said

877
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,228
to love and support his wife

878
00:35:15,548 --> 00:35:16,869
in the interview.

879
00:35:17,228 --> 00:35:18,309
It was genuinely touching.

880
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:20,309
If there were a business world Oscar,

881
00:35:20,588 --> 00:35:21,628
he'd undoubtedly win it.

882
00:35:22,148 --> 00:35:22,469
Right,

883
00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:24,309
after Shen Haoming got interviewed,

884
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:25,469
Jinda Group's stock

885
00:35:25,469 --> 00:35:26,588
hit the upper limit twice.

886
00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:28,068
I think investors

887
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,829
eagerly want to see

888
00:35:29,989 --> 00:35:31,429
a loving couple

889
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:33,789
supporting each other.

890
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:35,429
Mr. Shen has

891
00:35:35,628 --> 00:35:36,588
helped you,

892
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:37,749
caught the attention

893
00:35:37,749 --> 00:35:38,429
of the Baraikins,

894
00:35:38,708 --> 00:35:39,588
and profited

895
00:35:39,628 --> 00:35:40,429
from stock gains.

896
00:35:41,269 --> 00:35:42,269
A triple victory indeed.

897
00:35:43,028 --> 00:35:43,949
So impressed.

898
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,349
As far as I know,

899
00:35:45,749 --> 00:35:46,909
today's dinner

900
00:35:47,588 --> 00:35:49,068
aims to convince the Baraikins

901
00:35:49,068 --> 00:35:50,349
that you two

902
00:35:50,469 --> 00:35:51,349
are a loving couple.

903
00:35:54,548 --> 00:35:55,949
He even hired someone

904
00:35:56,829 --> 00:35:57,789
to take pictures

905
00:35:57,789 --> 00:35:58,588
of you nearby

906
00:35:59,188 --> 00:36:00,389
and publish romantic snippets.

907
00:36:00,508 --> 00:36:01,389
Giving his all out!

908
00:36:03,108 --> 00:36:04,309
If Shen Haoming

909
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,469
secures Baraikin's collaboration,

910
00:36:06,949 --> 00:36:07,869
he'll probably

911
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:08,909
enter the board.

912
00:36:09,188 --> 00:36:10,389
A quadruple victory.

913
00:36:10,949 --> 00:36:11,668
Are you done?

914
00:36:12,548 --> 00:36:13,148
Almost.

915
00:36:14,269 --> 00:36:15,389
I just want to remind you.

916
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:16,869
In business,

917
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,588
always be cautious.

918
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:03,548
Mr. Shen,

919
00:37:04,508 --> 00:37:06,588
the three-month evaluation starts now.

920
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:10,028
We hope to partner with Jinda.

921
00:37:11,389 --> 00:37:12,068
Me too.

922
00:37:13,028 --> 00:37:14,389
Both Xu Yan and I are thrilled

923
00:37:14,789 --> 00:37:16,188
to see you again in China.

924
00:37:17,508 --> 00:37:18,909
How are you two going?

925
00:37:19,949 --> 00:37:20,749
We've reconciled.

926
00:37:21,228 --> 00:37:21,989
She'll arrive soon.

927
00:37:32,789 --> 00:37:35,068
Sorry I'm late.

928
00:37:35,989 --> 00:37:36,708
Mr. Baraikin.

929
00:37:37,068 --> 00:37:37,749
Yan.

930
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:39,429
We were just mentioning you.

931
00:37:39,628 --> 00:37:40,429
Long time no see.

932
00:37:40,429 --> 00:37:40,989
Darling.

933
00:37:41,188 --> 00:37:42,789
Happy to see you.

934
00:37:43,949 --> 00:37:45,548
I've been overwhelmed

935
00:37:45,548 --> 00:37:46,429
with work lately.

936
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:47,749
I should've visited you.

937
00:37:48,148 --> 00:37:48,749
No worries.

938
00:37:48,989 --> 00:37:50,989
Brought some tea for you
and Mr. Baraikin.

939
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:51,749
Thank you.

940
00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:52,989
You're so kind.

941
00:37:53,789 --> 00:37:54,588
Let's sit and chat.

942
00:37:54,949 --> 00:37:55,989
I want to sit

943
00:37:56,068 --> 00:37:56,628
with Sophia.

944
00:37:57,148 --> 00:37:58,389
You remembered my real name?

945
00:37:58,588 --> 00:37:59,508
Why can't I remember?

946
00:38:01,068 --> 00:38:02,588
You've lost a lot of weight.

947
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:03,469
Really?

948
00:38:05,389 --> 00:38:06,108
Ms. Xu.

949
00:38:07,068 --> 00:38:07,749
I've heard about

950
00:38:07,749 --> 00:38:08,989
your company's trouble.

951
00:38:09,349 --> 00:38:10,628
Fortunately, you went through.

952
00:38:11,429 --> 00:38:11,949
Yes.

953
00:38:12,628 --> 00:38:14,068
Thanks to your wife.

954
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:15,909
She wore Yan Studio's gown

955
00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:18,389
and gave us such a strong endorsement.

956
00:38:18,668 --> 00:38:20,028
So, we have this success now.

957
00:38:20,228 --> 00:38:20,829
Not really.

958
00:38:20,829 --> 00:38:22,389
Yan Studio's designs are exceptional.

959
00:38:25,068 --> 00:38:26,869
I saw Mr. Shen's interview too.

960
00:38:27,228 --> 00:38:28,548
His vision and integrity

961
00:38:28,588 --> 00:38:29,869
truly impress me.

962
00:38:31,789 --> 00:38:34,548
Men like us in business circles

963
00:38:34,789 --> 00:38:36,548
may dominate the outside world,

964
00:38:37,309 --> 00:38:38,869
and many cherish their wives.

965
00:38:39,269 --> 00:38:41,349
But to be like Mr. Shen,

966
00:38:41,949 --> 00:38:43,548
who admits his wife outshines him,

967
00:38:44,108 --> 00:38:44,949
that's truly rare.

968
00:38:46,269 --> 00:38:46,749
Thank you.

969
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:48,588
Indeed.

970
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:50,068
Back then, Mr. Shen

971
00:38:50,108 --> 00:38:52,228
asked me to choose a gown at Yan Studio.

972
00:38:52,269 --> 00:38:53,108
I knew

973
00:38:53,228 --> 00:38:54,309
he wanted to help you.

974
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:56,309
I told my husband

975
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,708
that they couldn't be in conflict.

976
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:00,429
If you don't love someone

977
00:39:00,469 --> 00:39:01,628
with sincerity,

978
00:39:02,188 --> 00:39:02,949
you can't possibly

979
00:39:02,949 --> 00:39:03,949
be so considerate.

980
00:39:06,028 --> 00:39:06,668
I'm flattered.

981
00:39:07,108 --> 00:39:07,989
I should do so.

982
00:39:08,668 --> 00:39:09,148
Yan.

983
00:39:09,749 --> 00:39:10,989
Let's have a toast.

984
00:39:29,148 --> 00:39:30,909
I do need to thank my husband.

985
00:39:32,668 --> 00:39:34,028
He's been secretly

986
00:39:34,068 --> 00:39:35,548
doing a lot of things for me.

987
00:39:36,148 --> 00:39:36,989
And he even

988
00:39:37,028 --> 00:39:37,989
hid some to me.

989
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:42,548
Haoming.

990
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:45,228
I toast to you.

991
00:39:56,829 --> 00:39:57,349
Honey.

992
00:39:57,668 --> 00:39:59,749
If your collaboration succeeds,

993
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:01,068
you must invite them

994
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:02,389
to visit our home in Russia.

995
00:40:02,749 --> 00:40:03,188
Okay?

996
00:40:03,188 --> 00:40:03,668
Sure.

997
00:40:04,548 --> 00:40:05,588
You're welcome to come.

998
00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:07,668
He says you're welcome.

999
00:40:08,108 --> 00:40:08,628
Thank you.

1000
00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:10,548
Have some more.

1001
00:40:10,749 --> 00:40:11,188
Let's eat.

1002
00:40:16,909 --> 00:40:18,188
Thank you for today.

1003
00:40:18,909 --> 00:40:19,309
Right.

1004
00:40:19,548 --> 00:40:20,148
Don't forget

1005
00:40:20,228 --> 00:40:21,188
to order my gown.

1006
00:40:21,668 --> 00:40:22,508
Don't worry.

1007
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:24,269
We'll have it custom-tailored.

1008
00:40:24,749 --> 00:40:25,789
But it might take...

1009
00:40:25,869 --> 00:40:26,829
Let's meet

1010
00:40:26,949 --> 00:40:27,829
at the conference.

1011
00:40:28,269 --> 00:40:29,228
Looking forward to it.

1012
00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:30,309
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1013
00:40:31,708 --> 00:40:32,708
Goodbye, Mr. Baraikin.

1014
00:40:32,749 --> 00:40:33,108
Goodbye.

1015
00:40:34,508 --> 00:40:34,869
Okay.

1016
00:40:38,148 --> 00:40:39,028
Goodbye.

1017
00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:39,789
Goodbye.

1018
00:40:41,469 --> 00:40:41,989
Goodbye.

1019
00:40:45,028 --> 00:40:46,148
The wine tonight was good.

1020
00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:46,829
Yes.

1021
00:40:53,148 --> 00:40:53,989
I'm going back.

1022
00:40:55,028 --> 00:40:55,548
Yan.

1023
00:40:55,909 --> 00:40:57,588
I've finished the acting.

1024
00:40:58,228 --> 00:40:59,148
Let me explain.

1025
00:40:59,389 --> 00:41:00,148
Mr. Baraikin

1026
00:41:00,148 --> 00:41:01,108
gave Jinda Group

1027
00:41:01,148 --> 00:41:02,429
a three-month evaluation period?

1028
00:41:08,668 --> 00:41:09,869
Don't explain to me.

1029
00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:13,989
You did help me,

1030
00:41:16,429 --> 00:41:17,429
but you also achieved

1031
00:41:17,829 --> 00:41:18,668
your own purpose.

1032
00:41:21,989 --> 00:41:23,628
To secure this collaboration,

1033
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:25,789
you skillfully used

1034
00:41:25,829 --> 00:41:27,068
those around you.

1035
00:41:27,749 --> 00:41:28,749
Typical of you.

1036
00:41:30,349 --> 00:41:31,749
You haven't changed.

1037
00:41:34,668 --> 00:41:35,469
But now you can

1038
00:41:35,469 --> 00:41:36,349
finally relax.

1039
00:41:38,148 --> 00:41:38,668
Fine.

1040
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:40,389
I admit it.

1041
00:41:41,949 --> 00:41:43,349
I had Mrs. Baraikin

1042
00:41:43,389 --> 00:41:44,668
wearing a gown from Yan Studio

1043
00:41:45,309 --> 00:41:46,668
and had that interview,

1044
00:41:47,068 --> 00:41:49,269
just to impress Mr. Baraikin.

1045
00:41:49,628 --> 00:41:50,749
But I invited you here

1046
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:52,028
not to put on an act.

1047
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:55,668
Yet Mr. Baraikin

1048
00:41:55,708 --> 00:41:56,429
still saw

1049
00:41:56,508 --> 00:41:58,429
what you wanted him to see, right?

1050
00:41:58,829 --> 00:41:59,668
What?

1051
00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:01,749
Do you mean everything

1052
00:42:01,749 --> 00:42:02,508
between us

1053
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:03,588
during this period

1054
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:04,469
was all fake?

1055
00:42:08,389 --> 00:42:09,068
Doesn't matter.

1056
00:42:13,668 --> 00:42:14,469
What matters is

1057
00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:14,989
if we keep

1058
00:42:14,989 --> 00:42:16,188
arguing like this,

1059
00:42:17,909 --> 00:42:18,909
the paparazzo you hired

1060
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:19,708
might capture

1061
00:42:19,749 --> 00:42:20,588
undesirable photos.

1062
00:42:29,429 --> 00:42:30,628
Chen Lin, come here.

1063
00:42:42,429 --> 00:42:42,989
Mr. Shen.

1064
00:42:43,389 --> 00:42:43,909
Yan.

1065
00:42:44,588 --> 00:42:45,349
I've deleted

1066
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:46,588
all his photos.

1067
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:48,429
I didn't mean

1068
00:42:48,469 --> 00:42:49,749
to take photos of you.

1069
00:42:50,789 --> 00:42:51,708
Take him away.

1070
00:42:53,989 --> 00:42:54,349
Come on.

1071
00:42:58,469 --> 00:42:59,628
That guy was sneaking around.

1072
00:42:59,668 --> 00:43:00,989
I wondered what he was doing.

1073
00:43:04,469 --> 00:43:05,548
Am I that stupid

1074
00:43:06,749 --> 00:43:08,588
to hire such an amateur
for sneak photos?

1075
00:43:09,108 --> 00:43:10,269
Chen Lin is better.

1076
00:43:14,548 --> 00:43:15,148
I understand.

1077
00:43:16,068 --> 00:43:17,668
The collaboration with Mr. Baraikin

1078
00:43:17,749 --> 00:43:19,309
is crucial for Jinda Group.

1079
00:43:20,909 --> 00:43:22,389
But someone's exploiting

1080
00:43:22,429 --> 00:43:23,548
our relationship

1081
00:43:24,508 --> 00:43:25,909
to sabotage your overseas market.

1082
00:43:27,949 --> 00:43:29,309
Someone's targeting me?

1083
00:43:30,148 --> 00:43:30,949
That Steve guy

1084
00:43:33,228 --> 00:43:34,588
has approached me multiple times.

1085
00:43:36,148 --> 00:43:36,749
I know.

1086
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:38,469
His backing company

1087
00:43:38,469 --> 00:43:39,389
is Situo Company,

1088
00:43:39,749 --> 00:43:41,028
with a shady background.

1089
00:43:42,749 --> 00:43:44,228
He's just their frontman puppet.

1090
00:43:44,228 --> 00:43:45,789
But I don't know

1091
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:46,909
who's truly behind it.

1092
00:43:52,309 --> 00:43:54,068
That's not my concern,

1093
00:43:54,068 --> 00:43:54,789
but yours.

1094
00:43:56,789 --> 00:43:57,949
I've repaid your favor.

1095
00:43:59,749 --> 00:44:01,068
Wish you go smoothly

1096
00:44:01,068 --> 00:44:01,749
in business.

1097
00:44:02,949 --> 00:44:04,068
When did I ever ask you

1098
00:44:04,068 --> 00:44:04,829
to repay my favor?

1099
00:44:04,829 --> 00:44:05,789
Am I that kind of man?

1100
00:44:05,789 --> 00:44:06,548
I'd like to know

1101
00:44:06,548 --> 00:44:07,869
who exactly you are.

1102
00:44:13,588 --> 00:44:15,188
But I never figured it out.

1103
00:44:19,588 --> 00:44:20,909
Now I finally understand.

1104
00:44:26,829 --> 00:44:27,909
If you want to help me,

1105
00:44:28,789 --> 00:44:30,148
I'll accept it graciously.

1106
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:33,309
We're adults after all.

1107
00:44:33,708 --> 00:44:35,628
It's quite normal
to go after mutual benefit.

1108
00:44:37,108 --> 00:44:38,469
As for you and I,

1109
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:41,269
let's just take what we need.

1110
00:44:46,668 --> 00:44:48,068
We can still be friends.

1111
00:44:50,909 --> 00:44:51,389
Take care.
