1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,260
The End

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
How annoying the talk is.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We look back.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I hope we are all good.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Didn't you say you'd get me clothes?

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Chenchen.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Chenchen.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Did you talk to me just now?

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I didn't hear it clearly.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Can you say it again?

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Chenchen.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Say it again.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Haoming.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What are you talking about?

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Grandma.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Did you hear it?

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Hao Chen talked to me.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I heard it.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I heard it.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I didn't hear it clearly.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Why are you so happy?

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Thank you.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You're welcome.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
This kid is smart.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Whoever treats him well,

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
he'll be a smart kid.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This is the first step he took.

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Thank you, Grandma.

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Don't thank me.

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
As long as you're considerate.

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Thank you.

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Hao Chen.

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
How's the water temperature?

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Let me adjust it for you.

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Do you need a blanket?

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
If you have anything to tell me,

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'll stand at the door.

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I won't move.

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'll stand at the door.

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Chenchen.

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You can eat it.

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Here.

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Is it ice-cold?

73
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Of course.

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's sweet.

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Try it.

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Here.

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
How's Dad?

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Mom said he's fine.

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's good.

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Did you tell Mom

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
any good news?

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Is Hao Chen willing to talk?

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes.

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He's very happy.

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I really hope Hao Chen

86
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
can recover quickly

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
to the way he was before.

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Soon.

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Give Chenchen some time.

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I've told Dr. Wang

91
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
about Hao Chen's condition.

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Dr. Wang said it's good.

93
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It means

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Grandma has a good idea.

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Right?

96
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I've always thought

97
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
that Grandma is

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
a very wise person.

99
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
She's considerate

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and takes good care of her children.

101
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm glad that

102
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I can still

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
play with them.

104
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I feel at ease

105
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
as long as

106
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Grandma is with me.

107
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Grandma is the God of the Sea

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
in your heart.

109
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And you are the God of the Sea

110
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
in my heart.

111
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Why did you suddenly

112
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
say such things?

113
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I saw your photo album

114
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
on the street.

115
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It should be

116
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
the photo album of us two.

117
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
How did you see it?

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That photo

119
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
was taken when we

120
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
were getting divorced.

121
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm glad

122
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
that it's not our last night.

123
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Why are you taking photos?

124
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I want to put this photo

125
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
in the photo album

126
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
to be our new night.

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'll write

128
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
that today's watermelon is sweet.

129
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Change.

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll write that

131
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
today's watermelon is sweet.

132
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Change.

133
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'll write that

134
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
today's watermelon is sweet.

135
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Change.

136
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We have to record it

137
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
until you become a grandma.

138
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We also have to

139
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
enjoy the moon here.

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's an amazing topic.

141
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I finally know

142
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
what is double-way running.

143
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Do you know?

144
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
you draw a pen, I eat a melon.

146
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Does he want to eat a watermelon?

147
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Okay.

148
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The moon is so bright today.

149
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Look.

150
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Look.

151
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Look.

152
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You must have heard

153
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
that there is a

154
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
big news

155
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
in the real estate circle.

156
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The North and South Sichuan branch

157
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
in the East China Sea

158
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
is going to be destroyed.

159
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
This is the first big project

160
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
in the world.

161
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Only with this

162
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,640
real-life

163
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,000
and real-life

164
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
can we stop the

165
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
big and powerful.

166
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Mr. Qu,

167
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'll do my best

168
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
to do it.

169
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Weiping,

170
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
what are the

171
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
family and children doing now?

172
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Godfather,

173
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Shen Haoming left Jingzhou

174
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
with Xu Yan and his son.

175
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I don't know where they went

176
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
and got sealed.

177
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Shen Jinsong is

178
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
in a coma since now.

179
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Mr. Qu,

180
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
do you think

181
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Shen Haoming's possibility of

182
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
re-entering the land is high?

183
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I believe Shen Haoming

184
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
will never give up on this diamond piece.

185
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The audience

186
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
will see who they are in contact with.

187
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Are you tired?

188
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Do you want some water?

189
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You can't do this.

190
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You can't do this.

191
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You can't do this.

192
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Chenchen,

193
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
grandma's cooking is delicious.

194
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm so hungry.

195
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm so hungry.

196
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm so hungry.

197
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm so hungry.

198
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm so hungry.

199
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm so hungry.

200
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It smells so good.

201
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Let's eat.

202
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Okay.

203
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Take a rest.

204
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Your soil is so good.

205
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
This seed

206
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
must be the best one here.

207
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm so hungry.

208
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You still ignore

209
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
what he says to you.

210
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You don't give him any respect.

211
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Dad is not my dad.

212
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Mom is not my mom.

213
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Brother is not my brother.

214
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm not myself.

215
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I don't know what to say.

216
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I just don't know

217
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
why

218
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
he lied to me.

219
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Why he didn't recognize me.

220
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Chenchen,

221
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
have you ever thought that

222
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Shen Haoming

223
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
was just a kid at that time?

224
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
He suddenly knew

225
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
he was a father.

226
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
He was also nervous.

227
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But he never thought

228
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
about giving up on you.

229
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
He wanted to protect you.

230
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Of course.

231
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Haoming's father

232
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
wanted to protect his son.

233
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So he used an incorrect way.

234
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But their original intention

235
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
was to help you.

236
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Do you understand what I said?

237
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But he lied.

238
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
He lied.

239
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yes.

240
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Lying is lying.

241
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Lying is wrong.

242
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
As long as it's a lie,

243
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
it will be exposed one day.

244
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Everyone has to pay for it.

245
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
They are also very sad.

246
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
No matter what your identity is,

247
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
in this family,

248
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
they all love you so much.

249
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Love you as always.

250
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I believe you can feel it.

251
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Right?

252
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I love you.

253
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So I have to forgive them?

254
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Of course not.

255
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You can have your own choice.

256
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The decision is in your heart.

257
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You can do whatever you want.

258
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But I just want to remind you.

259
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
We all love you.

260
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
This will not change.

261
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I believe you can understand.

262
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Really.

263
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Grandma's cooking is delicious.

264
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Potatoes.

265
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Let's go.

266
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm going to eat.

267
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Let's go.

268
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Look at that potato.

269
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I just dug it out.

270
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Did you see it?

271
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm going to eat.

272
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Hello.

273
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
How do I go to the small storey?

274
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Small storey?

275
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's not possible.

276
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You have to go forward along this road.

277
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Then you will meet a crossroad.

278
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Then turn left.

279
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Then go forward.

280
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The next crossroad will turn right.

281
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Go forward about 500 meters.

282
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Then you can see that small storey.

283
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I have to go.

284
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I have to go.

285
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I have to go.

286
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I have to go.

287
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I have to go.

288
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I have to go.

289
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I have to go.

290
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Turn left and then turn right.

291
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yes.

292
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Thank you.

293
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You're welcome.

294
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Chun Chun.

295
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Chun Chun.

296
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Chun Chun.

297
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Chun Chun.

298
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Chun Chun.

299
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Chun Chun.

300
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm here.

301
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's late at night.

302
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Why don't you say hello?

303
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Why are you walking out?

304
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Why don't you tell me?

305
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Do you know how worried I am about you?

306
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Are you hurt?

307
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Hungry?

308
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Tell me if you're hungry.

309
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'll cook for you.

310
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Are you cold?

311
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You're sweating so much.

312
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Be careful not to catch a cold.

313
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Don't catch a cold.

314
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'll cook for you.

315
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'll cook for you.

336
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000

I'll cook for you.

368
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:51,540
Wu Hanっ

369
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:09,960
Is B flavor enough?

370
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,460
Enough!

371
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,000
Langlang!

372
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,640
I'm gonna discuss thing with Haoming.

373
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,960
I'm planning to go back to Jingzhou tomorrow.

374
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,440
Ha beber, what are you doing?

375
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,040
He's large.

376
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,840
We shouldn't keep him moving.

377
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,220
As the new Type

378
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,560
He's gone to hisㅅ

379
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,860
30 years

380
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,740
I'm sure.

381
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,740
But he's just not in the mood.

382
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,060
Go back now.

383
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,860
People who are sick

384
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,020
need their families

385
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,580
to take care of them.

386
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,780
Tomorrow morning,

387
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,140
I'll pack your luggage.

388
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,500
Come!

389
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,100
Come!

390
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,020
I didn't know

391
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,420
I'm not like you.

392
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,300
I'm the one who's always on my side.

393
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,100
Yan Yan.

394
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,140
No matter what difficult

395
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,140
or unhappy things you encounter,

396
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,420
you can always come back to me.

397
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,380
I'll always be waiting for you.

398
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,460
When things get better in Jinzhou,

399
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,860
I'll come back to visit you with Hao Chen.

400
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,820
I'm so happy.

401
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,220
Okay.

402
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:08,660
Here.

403
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,420
Here.

404
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,420
Your pants are too wet.

405
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:13,740
Here.

406
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,220
You.

407
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,500
Stand up straight.

408
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,740
Yes.

409
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:17,900
Okay.

410
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,660
My goodness.

411
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,020
Here.

412
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,740
Stand up straight.

413
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,380
So tight.

414
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,060
Welcome back, Director Lin.

415
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,180
Welcome back, Director Lin.

416
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:30,820
You're back.

417
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,660
Sit down.

418
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,180
Sit down.

419
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,780
Recently,

420
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,260
my personal affairs

421
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,460
have delayed the progress of the company.

422
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,940
But thank you, my sister.

423
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,300
Thank you for your hard work.

424
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,380
Yan Yifang, everything is going well.

425
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,140
I especially want to thank

426
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,820
our Finance Director, Lin Tao.

427
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,260
He applied for a loan in the bank

428
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,740
and solved the fuel-fuel crisis for us.

429
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,180
Thank you, Director Lin.

430
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:55,860
Thank you.

431
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,820
You're welcome.

432
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,700
Thank you.

433
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,620
I'm doing my job.

434
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,740
It's all Director Qiao's doing.

435
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,060
Thank you, Director Qiao.

436
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,340
Okay.

437
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,180
Okay.

438
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,020
Let's start

439
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,300
to summarize

440
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,780
the progress of the project.

441
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:12,860
Yao Yao,

442
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,300
about the hot-sandwich thing,

443
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,060
now...

444
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,140
I've made a

445
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,220
anti-toxic card about the hot-sandwich series.

446
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,620
And for this new product,

447
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,860
we'll find

448
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,860
dozens of head-on-head-spotters

449
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,220
and video call-ups.

450
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,380
That's all.

451
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,020
So he was the one

452
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,220
who made a fake

453
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,900
in the finance report of Yan Yifang

454
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,820
and applied for a loan.

455
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,620
He did this

456
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,340
to get you married to him.

457
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,340
So that's why

458
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,900
you moved out.

459
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,260
I want to say

460
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,500
to keep him calm.

461
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,180
If I want to keep him calm,

462
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,940
I have to keep a distance from Yu Ming.

463
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,260
Okay.

464
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,180
He was in the company

465
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,900
and worked hard.

466
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,420
He was always acting.

467
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,780
He had planned

468
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,100
to do all this, right?

469
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,900
I've been thinking

470
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,660
how to handle this.

471
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,300
I recorded it.

472
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,620
I went to him

473
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,900
and recorded it.

474
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,620
Listen.

475
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,700
When did I make a fake?

476
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,740
If you say I made a fake,

477
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,500
I'll call the police.

478
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,420
Yes.

479
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,860
I admit

480
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,140
I threatened you with the money

481
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,500
because I was too mean.

482
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,540
But I love you

483
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,900
with a pure heart.

484
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,060
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

485
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,180
I just wanted you to go home with me.

486
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,660
With this recording,

487
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,340
we can prove to the bank

488
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,940
that we're not on the same side.

489
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,220
We don't know about the money.

490
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,620
We didn't take the initiative.

491
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,900
We used some of the money.

492
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,860
But luckily, we don't have much.

493
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,940
I told my parents

494
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,500
that the company's funds

495
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,740
are in trouble.

496
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,580
They took out all the pension

497
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,900
you gave them.

498
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,180
Now we have a lot of money.

499
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,740
We can return it to the bank at any time.

500
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,820
I'm sorry, Yanyan.

501
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,420
I'm sorry.

502
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,340
I made a big mistake

503
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,660
by giving the company to me.

504
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,020
It's none of your business.

505
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,540
Besides,

506
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,860
you found the evidence

507
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,180
and did a good job.

508
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,340
By the way,

509
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,300
did you just tell me

510
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,180
that Lin Tao increased the profit

511
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,300
to 21%

512
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,500
and let the bank go?

513
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,420
Yes.

514
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,260
According to the high cost

515
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,540
of our handmade fabrics,

516
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,940
and the huge cost of

517
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,260
the promotion,

518
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,820
we can't afford to lose

519
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,260
the biggest amount of money.

520
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,380
Our company is now

521
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,700
at a stage of finding a balance point.

522
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,540
It's impossible to increase the profit

523
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,060
to 21%

524
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,100
because the bank can't see it.

525
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,180
The new employee, Xiao Feng,

526
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,540
is Lin Tao's good friend.

527
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,900
It's impossible.

528
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,540
You have to go to jail for fraud.

529
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,900
This Xiao Feng

530
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,020
wants to go back to his hometown

531
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,460
to get married.

532
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,260
He risked so much.

533
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,380
Even if there is a mistake

534
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,260
in the audit,

535
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,060
the staff and the superior leaders

536
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,820
will be severely responsible.

537
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,660
In this area,

538
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,860
the bank will be very cautious.

539
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,740
It's impossible.

540
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,060
You said it like that.

541
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,460
There are some things that are not right.

542
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,460
Mr. Tao,

543
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,060
Lin Tao has done the paperwork.

544
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,220
You can just

545
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,700
take a photo here.

546
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,420
Xiao Feng,

547
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,980
please take care of the approval.

548
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,620
Don't worry.

549
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,380
Tao and I are old friends.

550
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,140
We will follow the rules

551
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,180
and deliver the goods as soon as possible.

552
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,460
Thanks to you,

553
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,940
we can deliver the goods in a good way.

554
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,860
No problem.

555
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,900
That's enough.

556
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,300
When the payment is done,

557
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,860
I'll inform you immediately.

558
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,540
Xiao Feng,

559
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,100
what time do you get off work today?

560
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,340
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

561
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:09,780
Mr. Qiao,

562
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,860
I've booked the ticket for Fancheng.

563
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,300
We have to go back tonight.

564
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,580
Let's make an appointment next time.

565
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,460
We have already cooperated.

566
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,860
We'll have a chance in the future.

567
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,820
We can only do it next time.

568
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,860
So Lin Tao is so anxious

569
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,260
because he doesn't want you

570
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,700
to contact Xiao Feng.

571
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,060
Now,

572
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,020
the priority is

573
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,700
to find Xiao Feng

574
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,060
and find out

575
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,460
what happened

576
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,340
in the loan.

577
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:38,940
Also,

578
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,540
I know you don't want

579
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,500
Yu Yiming to get involved.

580
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,620
But this matter

581
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,260
has nothing to do

582
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,660
with your relationship.

583
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,380
So I suggest you

584
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,740
tell him the truth.

585
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,180
Anyway,

586
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,620
this is the matter.

587
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,060
I know you...

588
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,140
I know you'll be angry.

589
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,340
You didn't tell me

590
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,500
because you're afraid that Lin Tao

591
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,980
will get things out of hand.

592
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,300
You've been under a lot of pressure

593
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,900
these days.

594
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,740
But in the future,

595
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,980
no matter big or small,

596
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,340
if you can solve it,

597
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,180
if you can't,

598
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,260
tell me the truth.

599
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:35,900
I...

600
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,140
I'm going back to my hometown

601
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,300
to find Xiao Feng

602
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,500
to see if I can

603
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,460
get this thing out of hand.

604
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,380
Okay.

605
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,380
I'll go with you.

606
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,860
No, I can go by myself.

607
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,540
No.

608
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,140
You know if

609
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,420
Xiao Feng and Lin Tao are together.

610
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,900
What if they meet up?

611
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,660
So I have to go with you.

612
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,060
Okay.

613
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,940
So,

614
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,740
in addition to

615
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,860
the stable export of production lines,

616
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,220
I hope you can

617
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,060
put your focus

618
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,820
on the promotion of

619
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,500
our offline physical store.

620
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,100
There are four things to remember.

621
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,060
First,

622
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,660
the design of the windows and windows.

623
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:24,620
Second,

624
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,020
the early-warning marketing.

625
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,060
Third,

626
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,580
the employee service training.

627
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,220
Fourth,

628
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,740
the stability of the supply.

629
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,740
I need all departments

630
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,780
to give me an immediate feedback.

631
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,180
I want to tell you again.

632
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,300
Later,

633
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,100
all departments will increase staff.

634
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,140
If you have any needs,

635
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,780
remember to tell the personnel.

636
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,300
Qiao Lin.

637
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,820
Tianjin has a comprehensive square

638
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,820
that invites us to enter the physical store.

639
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,300
I think it's a good opportunity.

640
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,580
Go and talk to the person you meet

641
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,820
about the details.

642
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:53,540
Okay.

643
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:54,780
Director Lin.

644
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,620
We are promoting

645
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,420
the work of offline physical stores.

646
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,540
So the amount of work

647
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,300
will definitely increase.

648
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,060
Thank you for your hard work.

649
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,700
The company is growing.

650
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,100
The more busy, the happier.

651
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,580
You have put the budget of each department

652
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,220
under my office these two days.

653
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,900
I hope our company's reserve

654
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,100
will be 3% by the end of the month.

655
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:13,860
No problem.

656
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,340
I will talk to you

657
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,220
on Wednesday.

658
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,500
Okay.

659
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,100
Okay.

660
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,300
Tell the departments

661
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,660
about your budget needs.

662
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,060
Lin Tao, please.

663
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:28,780
Huanhuan.

664
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,900
What is the biggest

665
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,700
sales of the promotion?

666
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,020
We mainly promote

667
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,780
the promotion of the expert

668
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,340
and plan offline activities.

669
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,940
We plan to launch

670
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,820
the offline physical store's

671
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,020
打卡活動

672
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,700
and release the research and development...

673
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,540
Okay.

674
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,540
What's wrong?

675
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,500
What's the matter?

676
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:54,780
When will you come back

677
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,580
from Tianjin?

678
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,580
I will go tomorrow morning.

679
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,140
I will have dinner tonight.

680
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,020
I will be back

681
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,060
the day after tomorrow morning.

682
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,140
Don't worry.

683
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:03,780
I won't be late

684
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,980
to go back to my hometown with you.

685
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,260
The company is going smoothly.

686
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,340
We are back to normal.

687
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,740
I promise you

688
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,700
that I will keep my word.

689
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,420
I know.

690
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,980
I'm not forcing you.

691
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,940
It's meaningless to say.

692
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,380
Time will prove everything.

693
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,060
Qiao Lin,

694
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,780
do you remember this place?

695
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,180
There was also a place

696
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,060
where I had dinner last time.

697
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,620
I carefully arranged it.

698
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,020
There are balloons,

699
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,300
flowers,

700
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,700
and champagne.

701
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,780
Most importantly,

702
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,340
there are two of us

703
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,780
who can't be together.

704
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,780
We can't be together.

705
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,820
We can't be together.

706
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,860
We can't be together.

707
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,780
We can't be together.

708
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,980
We can't be together.

709
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,980
We can't be together.

710
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,260
Faster.

711
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,580
Marry me.

712
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,660
Yu Min?

713
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:19,700
Lin Lin.

714
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,180
What's wrong?

715
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,340
Why did you bring him along?

716
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,660
Lin Lin,

717
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,420
look at my ring.

718
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,260
The train is scheduled for Saturday morning at 11 p.m.

719
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:35,580
Let go to my hometown

720
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,060
and meet my father.

721
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,740
LOL

722
00:28:50,940 --> 00:29:05,820
Before I add

723
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,660
the best

724
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:09,940
you did

725
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,780
master the интер than me

726
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,500
the more this matter gets worse.

727
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,180
You also think that

728
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,900
I dare not go to the bank.

729
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,500
Your heart is that

730
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,900
we will silently accept this loan

731
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,220
and pay it back on time

732
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,700
and never mention this matter again.

733
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,460
But how is that possible?

734
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,380
If it's really a scam,

735
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,100
and you really have to be legally responsible,

736
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,180
it's me who should be responsible

737
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,300
and it's my negligence.

738
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,780
I will definitely accept the punishment.

739
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,380
That's what I planned.

740
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,860
Of course, you saw Xiao Feng.

741
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,340
I wanted to explain the situation to him

742
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,420
and I found out

743
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,940
that you didn't do a fake loan scam.

744
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,100
All you gave him

745
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,460
was real data.

746
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,820
Of course, he would lend it to me.

747
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,020
No wonder you didn't let me

748
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,060
eat with him that day.

749
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,340
You lied to me,

750
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,780
gave me a fake report card,

751
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,820
and asked me to cover the accounts.

752
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,340
You lied to me to go back to my hometown

753
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,020
and get married with you

754
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:55,900
and get a license with you.

755
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,140
Ling Tao,

756
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,740
thank goodness you have a conscience

757
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,940
and didn't really cheat me.

758
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,620
Otherwise, we would have been

759
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,740
directly in the Public Security Bureau.

760
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,940
I can also sue you,

761
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,780
but I want to leave you some sympathy.

762
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,780
So from now on,

763
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,300
please leave.

764
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,100
Ling Tao,

765
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,100
don't do these things again.

766
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:27,460
Especially don't do the

767
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,420
Mr.

768
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,540
Mr.

769
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,700
Are you coming with your hot dishes?

770
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,340
Get out!

771
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,420
Ahh...

772
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,580
Go to your mom.

773
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,460
The End

774
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,460
Episode 13

775
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,060
I received the email.

776
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,660
You mean

777
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,260
I need to sign a contract

778
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,060
to be the head of the company, right?

779
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,060
Mr. Qu, you are

780
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,660
the head of the company now.

781
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,860
You also announced the 3,000 million yuan

782
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,260
land price.

783
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,060
You also proposed that if the bid is successful,

784
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,060
you would terminate the first year

785
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,860
of the market period.

786
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,660
A bid that can change

787
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:27,260
the housing development pattern.

788
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,860
Is this requirement reasonable?

789
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,860
But if it fails,

790
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,860
the stock will surely fluctuate.

791
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,460
You just saved the day.

792
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,860
The shareholders are indeed concerned.

793
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,860
That's why they proposed this

794
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,460
performance comparison.

795
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,660
If it succeeds, the market period will end in advance.

796
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,860
If it fails,

797
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,260
we will re-vote

798
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,660
the position of the chairman.

799
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,460
Mr. Qu, don't misunderstand.

800
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,460
This is not for anyone.

801
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,660
The new chairman of the company

802
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,260
will face such a test.

803
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,660
After all, the shareholders want to see

804
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,660
the performance of Zhen Jin and Bai Yan.

805
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,660
It's the same for everyone.

806
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,660
I'm back.

807
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,060
How is Chen Chen?

808
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,260
He has been doing well on the way.

809
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,460
I saw Mr. Sun and I talked to him.

810
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,260
He said that Chen Chen will contact us

811
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,460
if there are any problems.

812
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,460
Anyway, don't worry.

813
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,260
Everything is going in the right direction.

814
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,060
Chen Chen's initiative to go to school

815
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,860
is really amazing.

816
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,060
My mom also said

817
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,660
that she is very grateful to you and grandma.

818
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,460
If mom says that,

819
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,860
it's too polite.

820
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,060
When Chen Chen is well,

821
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,460
our whole family will be well.

822
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,460
Okay.

823
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,260
Are you doing well in the offline store?

824
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,660
Everything is going well.

825
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,060
The progress of the decoration has been over half.

826
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,860
And the Grass and Fog series

827
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,260
Yaoyao has already released a design draft.

828
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,860
You can see it today at the company.

829
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,460
That's great.

830
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,260
What are you going to do next?

831
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:11,860
Continue to bid and sell the shares.

832
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,260
Qu Mingcheng asked other shareholders

833
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,060
to sue me and my dad.

834
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,260
We need to compensate the shareholders

835
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:21,460
for the loss of the company.

836
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,860
Our accounts have been frozen.

837
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,060
Jinta's position has also been lost.

838
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:29,860
Everyone thinks that I want to bid for this diamond piece

839
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,860
because of Tianfang Group.

840
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,260
I know that I won't always win.

841
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,460
But for the sake of dad and Chen Chen,

842
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,860
I won't lose to Qu Mingcheng.

843
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,660
Which company are you going to bid for?

844
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,460
My dad's first company.

845
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,060
It's called Xinye.

846
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:53,860
Our team's shareholders have all resigned.

847
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,860
They will quit with me.

848
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:00,260
I still have confidence and energy to continue to bid.

849
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,460
I also have to thank you for your help.

850
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,660
I won't accept any thanks.

851
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:11,060
If you want to thank me,

852
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,860
thank me when you go to the public show.

853
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,460
I know.

854
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,260
Oh, right.

855
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,860
You're going to see Mr. Huang, right?

856
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,260
Yes.

857
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,060
I heard that he put your tie upstairs.

858
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,060
So I'm very grateful for your help.

859
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:31,460
I told you I won't accept any thanks.

860
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:37,260
Qu Ming, is everything going well with Xinye?

861
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,660
It's going well. I hope that

862
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,660
I'll have a chance to work with Mr. Huang later.

863
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:47,860
To be honest, you don't have any funds or company documents anymore.

864
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,260
How do you want me to work with you?

865
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,060
Four years ago,

866
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,860
North Overseas Sichuan,

867
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,660
the early plan was announced.

868
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,060
My team and I have already been concerned.

869
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,660
The land supply, the policy direction,

870
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,060
the city planning,

871
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,860
and our competitors' strategy.

872
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,460
We have a lot of research.

873
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,860
I'll give out the bidding plan and the funds.

874
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,060
We'll form a joint team.

875
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:21,860
What I think of this project is not the profit.

876
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,460
It's the move to Qu Ming City.

877
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,980
olsa,

878
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,860
Put me off, please.

879
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,220
What did you expect?

880
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,100
chapter 2

881
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,020
here you are.

882
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,420
Are these the same vehicles that you used in the past?

883
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,260
They're too modern.

884
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,500
They look the same for your company.

885
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,740
So I never heard of that.

886
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,140
and the company will be in a bad shape.

887
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,700
But Shen Jin Song

888
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,060
is the founder of Jingda.

889
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,100
He has been in charge of the company for decades.

890
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,860
Now, these shareholders

891
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,940
are on your side.

892
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,860
But once Shen Jin Song

893
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,540
recovers and returns to the company,

894
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,300
it's hard to say

895
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,660
where the shareholders will go.

896
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,500
Shen Jin Song

897
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,260
can't even manage his life now.

898
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,260
He has completely

899
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,620
quit the company.

900
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,060
What's wrong with that?

901
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:35,820
Ha ha.

902
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,340
Bring me the information

903
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,660
we have brought from the bank.

904
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:41,780
Here.

905
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:42,500
Yes.

906
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,660
This is the memorandum.

907
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,620
OK.

908
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,900
Please summarize the data.

909
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,780
The ninth.

910
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,980
Please help me write it down.

911
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,860
There's good news.

912
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,660
Mr. Chen agreed to invest

913
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,780
in our project.

914
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:56,820
Really?

915
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:57,620
That's great.

916
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,340
Wow.

917
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,260
How is it?

918
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,420
How is it?

919
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:06,940
Mr. Huang.

920
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,100
You attend the marathon every year

921
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,500
and run the whole field.

922
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,180
I need to practice more.

923
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,180
Haoming.

924
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,700
I like to team up with

925
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,620
young people like you.

926
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,540
You have spirit and endurance.

927
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,860
How about I run around the lake

928
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:20,660
alone every day?

929
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,460
It's a pity that

930
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,780
I can't share such a beautiful view.

931
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,460
By the way,

932
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,060
the memorandum is ready.

933
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,860
You can submit it in two days.

934
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,260
Haoming.

935
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,060
Your vision,

936
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,580
experience and pattern

937
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,060
are all clear to me.

938
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,900
I'm getting old.

939
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,500
I'm not as good as before.

940
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,140
I always want to quit

941
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,540
and invest in the company.

942
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,100
But since I started working with you,

943
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,180
I feel that I'm getting younger.

944
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,580
I feel like I can suffer for a few more years.

945
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,700
Mr. Huang.

946
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,300
Don't quit so soon.

947
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,180
Stay here.

948
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,180
Let us continue to learn.

949
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,420
Let's go.

950
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,420
Haoming.

951
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,300
I'm sorry.

952
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,620
I want to run around the lower city alone.

958
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,100
is the biggest focus of the sense of winning the bidding

959
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,460
His life is Fitzgerald

960
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,500
does not want to exit temporarily

961
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,220
beat us in time

962
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,660
It's too late to change the bidding strategy temporarily.

963
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,820
We used to have the royal card.

964
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,220
We could also make a profit of one plus one plus two.

965
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,620
We could also win the competition with Qu Misheng.

966
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,540
But now Mr. Huang insists on withdrawing the investment

967
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,420
and cancel the cooperation.

968
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,780
We don't have any chance to win.

969
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:16,980
I think

970
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,660
instead of being hit by the blood flow,

971
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,820
we should stop the loss in time.

972
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:20,740
I suggest

973
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,500
we should give up the bidding.

974
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,020
We don't have any confidence.

975
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,780
We don't need to be in the game.

976
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,460
Mr. Shen,

977
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,420
what do you mean?

978
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,420
Continue to bid.

979
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,980
We've been preparing for this for so long.

980
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,860
I don't want to waste your efforts.

981
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,620
These two days,

982
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,300
we'll change the bidding strategy

983
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,420
and report it to the government.

984
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,140
We'll pay the deposit

985
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,260
according to the minimum share.

986
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,260
Why?

987
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,580
It doesn't matter if we lose.

988
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:54,980
Just take it as

989
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,700
we're showing our weakness in front of our peers.

990
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,220
The second chance to win

991
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,020
is not for the outside world.

992
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,460
If we lose a partner,

993
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,860
we'll be in a dilemma.

994
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,740
We won't even have the courage

995
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,740
to stand on the stage.

996
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,300
Take out the bidding book.

997
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,060
Continue to discuss.

998
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,140
Check if there are any

999
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,300
greening boards around our project.

1000
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,620
Still busy?

1001
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,340
It's late.

1002
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,340
Can't you just go?

1003
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,180
Ok.

1004
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,020
Just keep speaking.

1005
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,060
Next time.

1006
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,340
This time,

1007
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,300
although a profit bid

1008
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,260
only includes running for the first piece,

1009
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,340
it can only be won

1010
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,180
if there is a project

1011
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,580
works well

1012
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,460
as a new company.

1013
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,860
Have you selected your project?

1014
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:50,460
Yes.

1015
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,500
Have a look.

1016
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:52,740
Here.

1017
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,300
It's a project to transform the old city.

1018
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,340
It's a good idea.

1019
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,340
The cooperation between Yan Yifang

1020
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,820
and the Gubei Town

1021
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,860
also shows me that

1022
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,900
the governments

1023
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,540
value the protection

1024
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,380
and inheritance of human history.

1025
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,700
These years,

1026
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,300
it's a new level.

1027
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,500
So I'm right.

1028
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:22,940
Very right.

1029
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,260
What's wrong?

1030
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,620
It's a hair blow.

1031
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,660
Hurry up.

1032
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,780
Go to bed early.

1033
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,460
Okay.

1034
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,220
Do you need my company?

1035
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,100
It's okay.

1036
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,300
I'll be there soon.

1037
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,100
Okay.

1038
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,340
This way.

1039
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,420
Is it going well?

1040
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,140
Very well.

1041
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:24,580
That's good.

1042
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:25,940
Right?

1043
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,460
The Gubei Town

1044
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,420
I heard that Shen Haoming

1045
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,100
took over a government

1046
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,420
old-time construction.

1047
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,100
Yes, that's right.

1048
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,060
We've basically confirmed the cooperation.

1049
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,300
This guy

1050
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,100
knows the facts.

1051
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,780
He knows how to take on some tasks

1052
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,300
and get his company up first.

1053
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,620
Why haven't you seen Lao Weiping recently?

1054
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,380
You opened a new company for him.

1055
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,860
It's his first time as a boss.

1056
00:42:59,020 --> 00:42:59,820
He's busy.

1057
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:05,740
Do you need anything else?

1058
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:08,540
Mr. Qu,

1059
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,860
I know you've promised Weiping

1060
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,580
to let Jingda's legal department

1061
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,580
work with him

1062
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:14,860
and hand the company's project

1063
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,260
to his new firm.

1064
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,420
But

1065
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:19,900
I recently received

1066
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,340
a new company's information.

1067
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,500
In every aspect,

1068
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,620
it's more suitable than his new firm.

1069
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,460
But I've already

1070
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,460
promised Weiping.

1071
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,100
Mr. Qu,

1072
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,980
you asked me to join the board of directors.

1073
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:33,780
Those old guys

1074
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,140
are already in danger.

1075
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,580
If we hand the company's business

1076
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,620
to a new firm now,

1077
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,100
they won't find out

1078
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,300
your relationship with Weiping.

1079
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,100
How about this?

1080
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:50,860
Let's wait for a while.

1081
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:51,980
The company's business

1082
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,100
is already there.

1083
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,500
Weiping won't be in a hurry.

1084
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,700
We can get to the meeting room as soon as possible.

1085
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,940
Tell him the situation.

1086
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,460
Don't cause unnecessary trouble.

1087
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:08,780
Don't worry.

1088
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,060
Hello?

1089
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,740
I'm waiting for you in the cafe downstairs.

1090
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:29,820
I need to talk to you.

1091
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,740
You did a good job.

1092
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:34,940
My godfather has already

1093
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:36,060
promised me

1094
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:38,500
that Jingda will sign a long-term

1095
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:39,860
contract with my firm.

1096
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:40,940
You asked me to come down

1097
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,340
just to talk to me about this?

1098
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,500
Your godfather is busy

1099
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:46,820
with the transfer of the land.

1100
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,780
This is the most important thing.

1101
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,780
Can you handle it easily?

1102
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:54,420
I can.

1103
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,220
Steve.

1104
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,540
You're the one who's behind this.

1105
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,300
I'm very suspicious

1106
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,180
that this contract will still be mine.

1107
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:10,860
Weiping.

1108
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,180
I understand

1109
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,260
how you feel now.

1110
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:15,980
But,

1111
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:17,620
you did

1112
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,020
something that's not fair.

1113
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,780
It's all for your godfather.

1114
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,580
But now,

1115
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,300
it's a special time for the bidding.

1116
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:26,700
You have to be careful.

1117
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,300
I hope you can understand.

1118
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:32,300
You're playing with me

1119
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:33,700
to kill the fish, right?

1120
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,580
For the Shen family,

1121
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:36,940
I've done so much for them.

1122
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,100
Don't you know that?

1123
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:39,540
I was locked up

1124
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,500
for so long by the police

1125
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,780
that I lost my license.

1126
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,460
I lost everything.

1127
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:48,420
I'm going to the godfather's

1128
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,380
to ask him.

1129
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,780
Aren't you afraid that

1130
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:55,580
the other hand will be lost too?

1131
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:02,580
Young man.

1132
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,620
Don't be so impulsive.

1133
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:14,660
Mr. Xu.

1134
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,060
What's the matter?

1135
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,220
Hao Ming, come here. Sit down.

1136
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:19,740
Come here. Sit.

1137
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:25,540
Hao Ming.

1138
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:27,700
Actually,

1139
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,220
I don't want to see

1140
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:32,980
the situation

1141
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:35,700
between you and me.

1142
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:38,420
I don't have a child.

1143
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,580
You've been close to me since you were a child.

1144
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,380
To be honest,

1145
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:45,900
sometimes,

1146
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,380
I really envy your father

1147
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,900
for having a son like you.

1148
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,100
My grudge

1149
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:51,980
is just for

1150
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,780
your father's power.

1151
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:56,420
Think about it.

1152
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:57,780
If he

1153
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:00,220
could be more understanding

1154
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:01,580
to me,

1155
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,100
we would be the ones

1156
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,740
who would be here

1157
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:05,940
to open the box and attack.

1158
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,220
You didn't come to me

1159
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,700
to talk about love, right?

1160
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,700
I don't want to see

1161
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,940
your father in the hospital.

1162
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,100
Now you have a small company.

1163
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:23,700
You're going to take some government projects

1164
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:24,980
and take the safe route.

1165
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:27,340
I think it's good.

1166
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:30,700
If...

1167
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,260
I mean if

1168
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,500
you want to do this,

1169
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,300
you can withdraw me

1170
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,540
and buy the shares

1171
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,020
of your father and son

1172
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:42,500
at a good price.

1173
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,700
You can withdraw

1174
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:46,540
the company for the lawsuit.

1175
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:47,940
It's the best situation

1176
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,380
for you.

1177
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:52,740
I'm sorry.

1178
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:54,700
My father

1179
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:56,940
founded Jin Da.

1180
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,860
We won't buy any shares.

1181
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,100
This is the best thing

1182
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,540
I can give you.

1183
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,660
If you don't appreciate it,

1184
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:16,180
it's your father and son

1185
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:17,780
fighting against the whole company.

1186
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,220
In the end,

1187
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,980
you'll lose your family.

1188
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,300
I'm sorry.

1189
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:23,700
I'm sorry.

1190
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,100
I'm sorry.

1191
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,260
I'm sorry.

1192
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:27,420
I'm sorry.

1193
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:28,540
I'm sorry.

1194
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:29,660
I'm sorry.

1195
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:30,780
I'm sorry.

1196
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:31,900
I'm sorry.

1197
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,020
I'm sorry.

1198
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:34,140
I'm sorry.

1199
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:35,260
I'm sorry.

1200
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,380
I'm sorry.

1201
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,500
I'm sorry.

1202
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:38,620
I'm sorry.

1203
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:39,740
I'm sorry.

1204
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:40,860
I'm sorry.

1205
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:41,980
I'm sorry.

1206
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:43,100
I'm sorry.

1207
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,220
I'm sorry.

1208
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,340
I'm sorry.

1209
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,460
I'm sorry.

1210
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:47,580
I'm sorry.

1211
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:48,700
I'm sorry.

1212
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:49,820
I'm sorry.

1213
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:50,940
I'm sorry.

1214
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:52,780
I'm sorry.

1215
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:57,060
I'm sorry.

1216
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:58,380
I'm sorry.

1217
00:48:58,860 --> 00:48:59,860
I'm sorry.

1218
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:01,900
I'm sorry.

1219
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:04,260
I'm sorry.

1220
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,020
I'm sorry.

1221
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,220
I'm sorry.

1222
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:10,340
I'm sorry.

1223
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:12,700
I'm sorry.

1224
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:13,820
I'm sorry.

1225
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:14,940
I'm sorry.

1226
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,020
I'm sorry.

1227
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,220
I'm sorry.

1228
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:18,340
I'm sorry.

1229
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:19,500
I'm sorry.

1230
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:24,900
Today's bidding meeting will be held under the supervision of the discipline inspection agency and the public administration.

1231
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:28,260
To ensure fairness, justice, and openness.

1232
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:35,300
This bidding project involves the comprehensive development of the No. 1137 of North Overseas Sichuan.

1233
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:40,100
All bidding companies must strictly abide by

1234
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:45,900
the law and related legal regulations of the Chinese People's Republic of China.

1235
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:50,300
Be strict and self-disciplined. Once you discover illegal actions,

1236
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,300
you must be strictly punished.

1237
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:56,900
Next, the supervisor will check the details of the bidding document.

1238
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:01,300
During the inspection, if there are any objections, please make a comment.

1239
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:04,300
Otherwise, it will be considered as a good seal.

1240
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:19,100
The seal is good. It's all in line with the bidding requirements.

1241
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,700
Wait a minute.

1242
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:28,300
Sorry, I interrupted the process.

1243
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:42,500
These materials are from Jin Da, Shijia, Wanlin,

1244
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:47,900
and the internal documents of the first company I work for.

1245
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:55,100
The details include the price strategy and the standard of distribution.

1246
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:57,700
I personally have 10 people to supervise.

1247
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:01,700
Jin Da, the chairman, and Xu Mingcheng

1248
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:07,300
have the lead in planning this thorough and thorough bidding operation.

1249
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,100
Yes.

1250
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:24,500
Did you see the car that was passing by?

1251
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,100
I saw it.

1252
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:31,900
My every move is monitored by Xu Mingcheng.

1253
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:34,300
He was really afraid that you would do something.

1254
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:39,700
But he never thought that you would be standing on my side.

1255
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:40,460
Alright.

1256
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:41,980
You can go back first.

1257
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:43,180
He'll be here soon.

1258
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,820
Jin Da, Shijia, Wanlin,

1259
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:55,140
three company representatives

1260
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:56,620
need to come with us.

1261
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:58,540
Besides,

1262
00:51:58,540 --> 00:51:59,860
the first company representative

1263
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,020
as the supervisor

1264
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:02,700
also needs to cooperate with the investigation.

1265
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:10,780
Luцию.

1266
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:26,700
Due to private reason,

1267
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:28,860
convened by a Auditor is aims

1268
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:28,920
to postpone the

1269
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:30,100
hands-on case

1270
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,500
at the fair.

1271
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,420
It will be relapsed on the last minute.

1272
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:35,980
Thank you.

1273
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:11,980
If I can be with you, that's enough

1274
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:42,980
Like go surfing, go diving, go driving, go flying to a different place

1275
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:48,980
Like go drinking, go partying, go dancing, even if I'm the only one

1276
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:53,980
Cause I just haven't heard too many times

1277
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:00,980
I'm giving it all just getting nothing back

1278
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:06,980
I was lost in the dark and too hurt to even see

1279
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:12,980
See the world how it flows, what is yours, will never let go

1280
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:20,980
So I'll take my time to reignite

1281
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:25,980
The love that I should deserve

1282
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:33,980
When the time is right and you realize

1283
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:38,980
That it will be alright

1284
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:44,980
Cause I just haven't heard too many times

1285
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:51,980
I'm giving it all just getting nothing back

1286
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:58,980
I was lost in the dark and too hurt to even see

1287
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:04,980
See the world how it flows, what is yours, will never let go

1288
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:11,980
So I'll take my time to reignite

1289
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:16,980
The love that I should deserve

1290
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:23,980
When the time is right and you realize

1291
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:28,980
That it will be alright
