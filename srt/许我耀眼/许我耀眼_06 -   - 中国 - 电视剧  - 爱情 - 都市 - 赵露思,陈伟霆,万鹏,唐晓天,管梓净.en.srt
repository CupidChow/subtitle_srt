By the way,
there's something I want to tell you.

30
00:02:10,915 --> 00:02:11,755
I'm getting married.

31
00:02:15,074 --> 00:02:15,674
Marry whom?

32
00:02:16,755 --> 00:02:20,554
Is it someone you knew from London?

33
00:02:21,315 --> 00:02:21,995
No, it's not.

34
00:02:22,634 --> 00:02:24,234
I'll introduce you two later.

35
00:02:24,794 --> 00:02:25,715
Go back early.

36
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:54,234
Sir.

37
00:02:54,394 --> 00:02:55,475
Sorry I'm late.

38
00:02:55,954 --> 00:02:57,595
- Hurry.
- Okay.

39
00:03:06,035 --> 00:03:07,035
Excuse me, may I ask

40
00:03:07,315 --> 00:03:08,435
what dishes to cook today?

41
00:03:08,954 --> 00:03:09,794
Garden salad.

42
00:03:13,195 --> 00:03:14,634
Haven't we met before?

43
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:17,875
Jinda Group.

44
00:03:19,595 --> 00:03:20,554
Do we know each other?

45
00:03:22,354 --> 00:03:23,715
We met once at the company.

46
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:26,195
Hi, I'm Xu Yan.

47
00:03:27,595 --> 00:03:28,995
Hello, I'm Fang Lei.

48
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:30,674
I'm Shen Haoming's fiancée.

49
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:38,755
His junior schoolmate.

50
00:03:40,755 --> 00:03:42,114
We attended school together

51
00:03:42,554 --> 00:03:43,514
when we were in London.

52
00:03:44,195 --> 00:03:47,995
And our families have been
close friends for generations.

53
00:03:49,915 --> 00:03:50,755
In that case,

54
00:03:50,794 --> 00:03:52,155
you've known each other for years.

55
00:03:53,554 --> 00:03:54,394
Sixteen years old.

56
00:03:56,514 --> 00:03:57,634
Since sixteen years old.

57
00:04:00,595 --> 00:04:01,794
So like his little sister.

58
00:04:04,234 --> 00:04:05,275
Come visit us often.

59
00:04:05,595 --> 00:04:06,514
We can go shopping.

60
00:04:07,954 --> 00:04:08,475
Alright.

61
00:04:43,395 --> 00:04:46,674
Lei, you're so good at it.

62
00:04:46,715 --> 00:04:48,275
This looks so appetizing.

63
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:54,035
Can I try some?

64
00:04:56,314 --> 00:04:58,395
- Of course.
- Thanks.

65
00:05:09,794 --> 00:05:10,635
Delicious.

66
00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:12,194
Are you busy later?

67
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,194
Let's have a meal,

68
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,354
so you can teach me.

69
00:05:16,794 --> 00:05:17,354
Okay.

70
00:05:23,754 --> 00:05:25,794
Xu Yan, thank you for treating me.

71
00:05:27,754 --> 00:05:28,595
Between you and me,

72
00:05:28,674 --> 00:05:29,635
no need to be so formal.

73
00:05:30,314 --> 00:05:31,434
Let's meet up more often.

74
00:05:36,915 --> 00:05:37,515
I'm glad

75
00:05:37,994 --> 00:05:38,915
you care for me.

76
00:05:39,595 --> 00:05:40,475
When I was abroad,

77
00:05:40,754 --> 00:05:41,515
I was so young.

78
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,994
Haoming always worried I'd get homesick

79
00:05:45,234 --> 00:05:46,715
and feared foreigners might bully me,

80
00:05:47,035 --> 00:05:49,515
so he visited whenever he had time.

81
00:05:51,915 --> 00:05:52,915
You're like his sister,

82
00:05:52,955 --> 00:05:54,114
so it's natural.

83
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,395
He should've done even better.

84
00:06:02,035 --> 00:06:03,674
I just started at Jinda Group,

85
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:06,354
and Haoming put me on his project.

86
00:06:07,314 --> 00:06:09,114
Now I have to bother him again.

87
00:06:12,035 --> 00:06:13,234
Do your job well,

88
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:15,194
then you won't trouble him, right?

89
00:06:19,794 --> 00:06:21,595
Lei, don't drink that much.

90
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,395
Let's eat. They're delicious.

91
00:06:28,754 --> 00:06:30,434
Seeing Haoming marry someone

92
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,835
so beautiful and accomplished,

93
00:06:33,754 --> 00:06:34,955
I'm really happy for him.

94
00:06:37,395 --> 00:06:38,635
This is my first time

96
00:06:42,075 --> 00:06:43,475

You're such a well-matched couple.

192
00:11:38,794 --> 00:11:39,995
- Congratulations!
- Thanks.

193
00:11:39,995 --> 00:11:40,755
Since we met here,

194
00:11:40,794 --> 00:11:41,794
if you don't mind,

195
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:43,434
come join us.

196
00:11:44,755 --> 00:11:46,434
Would it bother you?

197
00:11:46,674 --> 00:11:47,035
No.

198
00:11:47,155 --> 00:11:47,915
Please, come in.

199
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:48,954
This way, please.

200
00:11:49,355 --> 00:11:49,674
Please.

201
00:11:49,755 --> 00:11:51,035
- What's your surname?
- Xu.

202
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,355
Same surname to Xu Yan.

203
00:11:53,474 --> 00:11:55,314
Exactly, I'm also a Xu.

204
00:11:56,194 --> 00:11:56,554
Surprise.

205
00:11:56,594 --> 00:11:56,915
Hello.

206
00:11:57,474 --> 00:11:58,474
Yan, I'll take him in.

207
00:11:58,954 --> 00:11:59,314
Alright.

208
00:12:00,035 --> 00:12:00,355
Come on.

209
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:02,800
Come on.

210
00:12:08,235 --> 00:12:08,875
Thank you, Dad.

211
00:12:09,594 --> 00:12:10,275
Thank you, Mom.

212
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:11,594
Thanks.

213
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:12,594
Thank you, Ms. Ma.

214
00:12:13,235 --> 00:12:13,674
Thank you.

215
00:12:13,755 --> 00:12:14,395
Cheers.

216
00:12:14,515 --> 00:12:14,995
Thank you.

217
00:12:20,635 --> 00:12:21,554
Have a toast.

218
00:12:22,794 --> 00:12:23,115
Here.

219
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:24,834
Come on.

220
00:12:25,515 --> 00:12:26,515
Haoming. Congratulations!

221
00:12:26,594 --> 00:12:27,434
- Cheers!
- Thanks!

222
00:12:27,794 --> 00:12:29,515
Haoming, what a wonderful wedding.

223
00:12:29,794 --> 00:12:31,594
You're a workaholic.

224
00:12:32,115 --> 00:12:34,074
Was all this prepared by Yan?

225
00:12:35,035 --> 00:12:36,875
So this toast shouldn't go to you.

226
00:12:37,275 --> 00:12:39,275
To our beautiful and capable Yan!

227
00:12:39,314 --> 00:12:40,434
To Yan!

228
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,235
Xu Yan has already had enough drink.

229
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:43,275
No more drink.

230
00:12:43,515 --> 00:12:45,074
I'll take this drink for her.

231
00:12:45,954 --> 00:12:46,554
Liquor?

232
00:12:47,074 --> 00:12:47,995
Drink three glasses.

233
00:12:48,794 --> 00:12:49,834
Yes, three glasses!

234
00:12:50,235 --> 00:12:50,594
Come on.

235
00:12:50,794 --> 00:12:51,635
Three glasses it is!

236
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:52,194
Good.

237
00:12:52,235 --> 00:12:53,035
First!

238
00:12:54,954 --> 00:12:55,875
Impressive!

239
00:12:56,194 --> 00:12:56,794
Another one!

240
00:12:58,594 --> 00:12:59,235
Second!

241
00:13:00,434 --> 00:13:01,474
- Amazing!
- Good!

242
00:13:01,594 --> 00:13:02,355
One more to go!

243
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:05,474
Alright.

244
00:13:05,594 --> 00:13:06,395
Last one!

245
00:13:06,395 --> 00:13:06,995
Third one!

246
00:13:07,115 --> 00:13:08,314
- Another!
- The final one!

247
00:13:09,074 --> 00:13:09,515
Mr. Shen.

248
00:13:09,714 --> 00:13:10,275
Mr. Xu.

249
00:13:10,275 --> 00:13:10,674
Mr. Xu.

250
00:13:10,714 --> 00:13:11,915
Honored to attend

251
00:13:11,915 --> 00:13:12,656
Xu Yan's wedding.

252
00:13:12,995 --> 00:13:13,554
We two...

253
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:14,474
Enjoy your drinks.

254
00:13:15,474 --> 00:13:16,434
Thank you.

255
00:13:17,035 --> 00:13:17,875
Thank you, everyone.

256
00:13:17,995 --> 00:13:18,515
Alright.

257
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:19,594
Next table.

258
00:13:20,035 --> 00:13:20,474
Come on.

259
00:13:21,074 --> 00:13:22,635
Mr. Xu, you came to Jingzhou for...

260
00:13:22,794 --> 00:13:23,355
For vacation.

261
00:13:23,995 --> 00:13:24,875
Stay for a few days,

262
00:13:25,194 --> 00:13:26,115
then go to hometown.

263
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:27,635
Why the rush?

264
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:28,995
Stay in Jingzhou longer.

265
00:13:30,474 --> 00:13:32,074
I'm reaching retirement age,

266
00:13:32,155 --> 00:13:33,314
planning to return and settle

267
00:13:33,995 --> 00:13:36,515
back in my hometown.

268
00:13:37,035 --> 00:13:37,755
Great.

269
00:13:38,074 --> 00:13:39,954
The medical facilities, shopping,

270
00:13:40,035 --> 00:13:41,355
and everything is much better.

271
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:45,456
Mr. Xu, what do you do overseas?

272
00:13:45,456 --> 00:13:46,314
Architecture studies.

273
00:13:46,635 --> 00:13:47,594
Construction?

274
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:49,755
Then you're in the same field
as my in-law.

275
00:13:50,434 --> 00:13:50,995
Really?

276
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:55,115
What a double fate!

277
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:56,554
Cheers!

278
00:13:59,696 --> 00:14:00,877
You look gorgeous.

279
00:14:00,995 --> 00:14:01,834
One more.

280
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:02,714
Cheers!

281
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:04,194
Thank you.

282
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:05,395
Come on.

283
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:05,875
Yan.

284
00:14:06,794 --> 00:14:07,794
Your classmate's parents

285
00:14:07,995 --> 00:14:09,074
came here first time.

286
00:14:09,794 --> 00:14:10,714
Go greet them.

287
00:14:12,314 --> 00:14:13,794
Okay, I'll be right back.

288
00:14:16,194 --> 00:14:17,434
Your dress looks lovely.

289
00:14:18,635 --> 00:14:19,115
Come on.

290
00:14:19,915 --> 00:14:20,674
How many more?

291
00:14:21,434 --> 00:14:22,115
One last glass.

292
00:14:22,155 --> 00:14:22,594
One glass.

293
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:23,275
I'll drink.

294
00:14:23,594 --> 00:14:24,275
He has

295
00:14:24,594 --> 00:14:27,275
deep expertise in architecture,

296
00:14:27,355 --> 00:14:28,635
even wrote a book,

297
00:14:28,674 --> 00:14:29,714
called... something...

298
00:14:29,954 --> 00:14:31,594
Sustainable Building Design.

299
00:14:34,035 --> 00:14:35,155
My father specializes in

300
00:14:35,194 --> 00:14:36,714
sustainable building research.

301
00:14:39,074 --> 00:14:41,594
My research focuses
on architectural mechanics.

302
00:14:42,035 --> 00:14:44,194
Though in the same field,
our focuses differ.

303
00:14:44,794 --> 00:14:46,714
Let's chat if you have time.

304
00:14:47,314 --> 00:14:48,115
Absolutely.

305
00:14:48,395 --> 00:14:49,115
Mr. Xu.

306
00:14:49,554 --> 00:14:51,074
We've finally gathered today.

307
00:14:51,115 --> 00:14:52,275
Why don't we take a photo?

308
00:14:52,355 --> 00:14:53,954
You can show it to Jiajia. How's it?

309
00:14:54,115 --> 00:14:54,755
Great idea.

310
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:55,235
Come on.

311
00:14:55,275 --> 00:14:55,554
Okay.

312
00:14:55,554 --> 00:14:56,115
Take a photo.

313
00:14:56,235 --> 00:14:56,755
Alright.

314
00:14:56,794 --> 00:14:57,714
Take a photo.

315
00:14:57,755 --> 00:14:58,834
I'll get Haoming.

316
00:14:59,434 --> 00:14:59,794
Alright.

317
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:00,474
Let's be here.

318
00:15:00,474 --> 00:15:00,834
Alright?

319
00:15:00,915 --> 00:15:01,474
This way.

320
00:15:01,594 --> 00:15:02,194
This way.

321
00:15:02,275 --> 00:15:02,915
This spot, okay?

322
00:15:04,275 --> 00:15:04,915
You silly!

323
00:15:04,915 --> 00:15:06,155
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

324
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:06,915
Sorry, sorry.

325
00:15:06,915 --> 00:15:07,434
Let me.

326
00:15:08,035 --> 00:15:08,915
Look at this mess.

327
00:15:08,915 --> 00:15:09,674
Here.

328
00:15:09,995 --> 00:15:10,954
So sorry.

329
00:15:11,115 --> 00:15:12,515
I'm sorry.

330
00:15:12,755 --> 00:15:13,554
It's fine.

331
00:15:14,035 --> 00:15:14,635
I'm so sorry.

332
00:15:14,674 --> 00:15:15,434
I live upstairs.

333
00:15:16,074 --> 00:15:16,915
I'll go change.

334
00:15:17,235 --> 00:15:18,194
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

335
00:15:18,194 --> 00:15:19,355
We'll cover the dry cleaning.

336
00:15:19,474 --> 00:15:20,915
We're so sorry.

337
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:21,834
Don't mind it.

338
00:15:21,915 --> 00:15:22,794
The wedding matters.

339
00:15:22,794 --> 00:15:23,235
See you.

340
00:15:23,474 --> 00:15:23,954
Alright.

341
00:15:24,074 --> 00:15:25,275
I'm sorry.

342
00:15:26,194 --> 00:15:26,714
This way.

343
00:15:35,554 --> 00:15:36,554
I'm really sorry.

344
00:15:36,755 --> 00:15:37,635
I'll have them get you

345
00:15:37,674 --> 00:15:38,314
a new suit.

346
00:15:38,314 --> 00:15:38,875
No need.

347
00:15:38,995 --> 00:15:40,035
I have one upstairs.

348
00:15:41,035 --> 00:15:41,395
Okay.

349
00:15:41,995 --> 00:15:42,794
Your turn.

350
00:15:43,515 --> 00:15:43,995
Haoming.

351
00:15:44,355 --> 00:15:44,954
Happy wedding!

352
00:15:45,355 --> 00:15:45,714
Thanks.

353
00:15:45,755 --> 00:15:47,035
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

354
00:15:47,674 --> 00:15:48,594
Let me introduce you.

355
00:15:48,954 --> 00:15:51,474
She's my sister,
just graduated from law school.

356
00:15:52,954 --> 00:15:53,834
- Impressive!
- Great.

357
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:54,714
You know what?

358
00:15:55,194 --> 00:15:56,035
She's still single.

359
00:15:56,714 --> 00:15:57,474
Be proactive.

360
00:15:58,434 --> 00:15:59,395
What a coincidence!

361
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,194
Haoming and I go way back.

362
00:16:01,515 --> 00:16:02,074
I'm single.

363
00:16:03,155 --> 00:16:03,755
Add my WeChat.

364
00:16:04,155 --> 00:16:06,115
Haoming, what's her name?

365
00:16:06,915 --> 00:16:07,474

366
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:09,155
Miss Fang.

367
00:16:09,515 --> 00:16:10,035
Add me.

368
00:16:10,074 --> 00:16:10,515

Add my WeChat too.

371
00:16:16,635 --> 00:16:20,395
Miss Fang, hello.

372
00:16:20,794 --> 00:16:23,035
I'm Han Weiping, from legal department
of Jinda Group.

373
00:16:24,155 --> 00:16:25,155
Can I add your WeChat?

374
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:27,155
It'd better

375
00:16:27,515 --> 00:16:28,194
to keep in touch.

376
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:29,275

00:16:29,554 --> 00:16:30,074
Okay, okay.

00:16:34,115 --> 00:16:34,434
Done.

Miss Fang, add me.

386
00:16:40,554 --> 00:16:41,008
Okay.

387
00:17:09,155 --> 00:17:10,115
(At the infinity pool.)

388
00:17:28,034 --> 00:17:29,274
(Think drunk people)

389
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:30,795
(drown easily?)

390
00:18:15,555 --> 00:18:16,954
Being drunk in a pool isn't safe.

391
00:18:17,474 --> 00:18:18,032
Come up!

392
00:18:20,595 --> 00:18:21,555
I don't want to go back.

393
00:18:22,155 --> 00:18:23,754
I need to sober up here.

394
00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:26,194
Suit yourself.

395
00:18:26,795 --> 00:18:28,835
Aren't you afraid
I'll drown like my sister did?

396
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,595
Don't ever say that.

397
00:18:41,234 --> 00:18:41,994
It brings bad luck.

398
00:18:43,274 --> 00:18:44,274
This is my wedding day.

399
00:18:44,555 --> 00:18:46,034
Is this drama necessary?

400
00:19:04,635 --> 00:19:05,355
Haoming.

401
00:19:07,315 --> 00:19:08,875
Remember our first meeting?

402
00:19:13,714 --> 00:19:14,674
I remember very clearly

403
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:18,835
what color you're wearing that day.

404
00:19:19,954 --> 00:19:21,434
Even the sunlight that day

405
00:19:22,674 --> 00:19:24,315
and the scent in the air,

406
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:29,795
I remember every single detail.

407
00:19:36,795 --> 00:19:38,915
I thought I could let you go,

408
00:19:43,034 --> 00:19:44,555
but seeing you get married today,

409
00:19:45,754 --> 00:19:47,395
watching you walk down the aisle,

410
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:49,474
I realize

411
00:19:50,994 --> 00:19:52,555
I can never let you go.

412
00:19:57,474 --> 00:19:58,315
Shen Haoming,

413
00:20:00,635 --> 00:20:01,315
I love you.

414
00:20:05,635 --> 00:20:06,434
I'm married now.

415
00:20:07,434 --> 00:20:08,075
Back off.

416
00:20:10,034 --> 00:20:11,155
You mean that woman?

417
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,835
Don't think she's that naive.

418
00:20:15,155 --> 00:20:16,795
She pretended to be close with me

419
00:20:16,835 --> 00:20:17,514
once we met,

420
00:20:17,954 --> 00:20:19,434
just to figure out our relationship.

421
00:20:20,674 --> 00:20:22,355
That Xu Yan is calculating.

422
00:20:23,714 --> 00:20:25,034
Why marry her?

423
00:20:26,355 --> 00:20:28,034
Your performance at the wedding today

424
00:20:29,355 --> 00:20:30,315
was quite dramatic.

425
00:20:31,274 --> 00:20:32,155
No need

426
00:20:32,514 --> 00:20:34,514
to overthink anything.

427
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:35,514
Just drop it.

428
00:20:36,315 --> 00:20:37,075
Once sobered up,

429
00:20:38,194 --> 00:20:38,954
go home.

430
00:21:00,754 --> 00:21:01,795
Won't we miss our flight?

431
00:21:02,155 --> 00:21:02,595
Relax.

432
00:21:03,315 --> 00:21:03,835
Haoming.

433
00:21:04,315 --> 00:21:04,915
Yan.

434
00:21:07,514 --> 00:21:08,954
Leaving for your honeymoon now?

435
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:10,355
Yes.

436
00:21:12,274 --> 00:21:14,034
You drank so much for me yesterday.

437
00:21:14,915 --> 00:21:15,754
Feeling okay?

438
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,395
I was completely drunk.

439
00:21:18,514 --> 00:21:19,434
Don't even remember

440
00:21:19,474 --> 00:21:20,555
how I got home.

441
00:21:21,835 --> 00:21:22,315
Right.

442
00:21:22,754 --> 00:21:23,915
Last night,

443
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,674
did I cause any trouble?

444
00:21:26,274 --> 00:21:26,635
No.

445
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:29,635
Glad to hear that.

446
00:21:33,395 --> 00:21:33,915
Yan.

447
00:21:34,635 --> 00:21:35,315
You two talk.

448
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:36,635
I'll wait in the car.

449
00:21:41,315 --> 00:21:42,155
Haoming said

450
00:21:42,194 --> 00:21:43,395
you're honeymooning in London.

451
00:21:44,194 --> 00:21:46,194
There's a great steakhouse over there.

452
00:21:46,795 --> 00:21:49,034
Haoming used to take me there often.

453
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:56,395
What places did Haoming

454
00:21:56,434 --> 00:21:57,194
take you before?

455
00:21:58,915 --> 00:22:00,395
Please sort it out and send it to me.

456
00:22:03,075 --> 00:22:04,514
Don't go in the pool after drinking.

457
00:22:06,234 --> 00:22:07,155
You could be drowned.

458
00:22:46,434 --> 00:22:46,994
Mr. Shen.

459
00:22:47,395 --> 00:22:47,875
Yan.

460
00:22:48,674 --> 00:22:49,474
You're finally back.

461
00:22:49,954 --> 00:22:50,835
We've missed you!

462
00:22:52,115 --> 00:22:53,714
We brought souvenirs for everyone.

463
00:22:54,034 --> 00:22:55,115
The driver'll bring them up

464
00:22:55,355 --> 00:22:55,875
to you.

465
00:22:57,234 --> 00:22:57,635
Got it.

466
00:22:58,075 --> 00:22:58,635
Thank you.

467
00:23:06,075 --> 00:23:06,835
Han Weiping,

468
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:09,915
Jinda Group's
newly hired legal consultant,

469
00:23:10,674 --> 00:23:11,555
young and capable.

470
00:23:12,595 --> 00:23:14,234
They met at our wedding.

471
00:23:15,754 --> 00:23:16,875
Lei has good taste.

472
00:23:18,595 --> 00:23:19,155
Let's go.

473
00:23:22,155 --> 00:23:24,714
By the way,
let's go visit Grandma in a few days.

474
00:23:26,395 --> 00:23:27,474
But we just got back.

475
00:23:27,714 --> 00:23:29,514
It's fine. It won't affect work.

476
00:23:30,155 --> 00:23:31,234
I've asked for leave.

477
00:23:35,674 --> 00:23:36,075
Okay.

478
00:23:37,355 --> 00:23:39,434
We can bring Grandma her gifts.

479
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:40,115
Alright.

Yan.

488
00:24:01,835 --> 00:24:02,915
You fell asleep?

489
00:24:02,994 --> 00:24:04,994
I really miss you!

490
00:24:05,075 --> 00:24:06,075
Let me see.

491
00:24:06,555 --> 00:24:07,595
You've lost weight!

492
00:24:07,674 --> 00:24:08,395
Again?

493
00:24:08,434 --> 00:24:09,595
Haven't you been eating well?

494
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,034
You're the one who's lost weight.

495
00:24:11,754 --> 00:24:13,315
No way. You...

496
00:24:14,595 --> 00:24:15,194
Hello, Grandma.

497
00:24:15,355 --> 00:24:17,315
I'm your grandson-in-law, Shen Haoming.

498
00:24:17,595 --> 00:24:18,674
I brought you some gifts.

499
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,595
What a handsome man!

500
00:24:23,835 --> 00:24:24,875
Welcome home.

501
00:24:24,915 --> 00:24:25,395
Come in.

502
00:24:25,395 --> 00:24:26,194
Come in.

503
00:24:26,595 --> 00:24:28,595
You didn't need to bring

504
00:24:28,674 --> 00:24:30,355
so many gifts to me.

505
00:24:30,434 --> 00:24:32,355
I can't possibly eat all this by myself.

506
00:24:32,395 --> 00:24:35,355
I brought glucosamine for you.

507
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:37,434
It helps prevent osteoporosis.

508
00:24:37,635 --> 00:24:38,234
Too much!

509
00:24:38,315 --> 00:24:39,234
Haoming said

510
00:24:39,355 --> 00:24:41,514
you need to keep taking this fish oil.

511
00:24:41,595 --> 00:24:44,075
It helps lower your cholesterol.

512
00:24:44,075 --> 00:24:45,264
Do you know?

513
00:24:51,555 --> 00:24:52,034
Grandma.

514
00:24:52,434 --> 00:24:53,355
It smells wonderful.

515
00:24:54,115 --> 00:24:54,754
What's this?

516
00:24:55,234 --> 00:24:56,075
This...

517
00:24:56,395 --> 00:24:57,395
Fresh greens.

518
00:24:57,434 --> 00:24:59,234
You city folks can't get this.

519
00:24:59,635 --> 00:25:00,555
I picked them fresh

520
00:25:00,595 --> 00:25:02,434
at the vegetable patch this afternoon.

521
00:25:02,795 --> 00:25:04,555
You city people always talk about

522
00:25:04,835 --> 00:25:06,274
green and eco-friendly,

523
00:25:06,754 --> 00:25:07,754
and pollution-free.

524
00:25:09,555 --> 00:25:10,875
What's that dish then?

525
00:25:10,915 --> 00:25:13,075
Oxtail and taro stew.

526
00:25:14,115 --> 00:25:15,155
Nourishing.

527
00:25:17,234 --> 00:25:19,514
Grandma, you live here alone.

528
00:25:20,034 --> 00:25:22,034
So Yan's parents...

529
00:25:22,155 --> 00:25:22,754
Grandma.

530
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:24,635
This one.

531
00:25:25,115 --> 00:25:26,835
I brought your favorite photo.

532
00:25:27,434 --> 00:25:28,875
I'll hang it...

533
00:25:29,355 --> 00:25:30,234
In the bedroom

534
00:25:30,514 --> 00:25:31,754
where I can easily see.

535
00:25:32,714 --> 00:25:33,635
Go on!

536
00:25:33,754 --> 00:25:34,795
It's all greasy smoke.

537
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:35,994
- Don't stay here.
- Come.

538
00:25:36,915 --> 00:25:37,456
Right.

539
00:25:38,234 --> 00:25:39,115
Serve it up!

540
00:25:44,234 --> 00:25:44,795
Look.

541
00:25:45,994 --> 00:25:46,595
Is this okay?

542
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,434
It seems slightly tilted to the left.

543
00:25:59,714 --> 00:26:00,274
Yan.

544
00:26:00,915 --> 00:26:01,555
Is this okay?

545
00:26:03,994 --> 00:26:04,555
Good.

546
00:26:09,514 --> 00:26:10,194
Perfect.

547
00:26:30,915 --> 00:26:31,674
Yan,

548
00:26:32,315 --> 00:26:34,194
I prepared a room for you

549
00:26:34,315 --> 00:26:36,234
with a double bed.

550
00:26:36,474 --> 00:26:37,674
Why don't you sleep there

551
00:26:37,954 --> 00:26:40,355
but squeeze into my bed instead?

552
00:26:40,674 --> 00:26:42,115
I rarely come back.

553
00:26:42,155 --> 00:26:43,635
I want to sleep with you.

554
00:26:44,555 --> 00:26:46,395
You insist on sleeping with me.

555
00:26:46,674 --> 00:26:48,075
You don't come back often.

556
00:26:48,075 --> 00:26:50,994
Just sleep with him, will you?

557
00:26:51,555 --> 00:26:53,155
Why sleep with me?

558
00:26:53,555 --> 00:26:54,514
- Let me.
- It seems...

559
00:26:55,075 --> 00:26:56,075
Hand over your hand.

560
00:26:57,555 --> 00:26:58,274
It's that simple?

561
00:27:00,635 --> 00:27:02,835
I can't make it right.

562
00:27:03,954 --> 00:27:04,635
Let me help you.

563
00:27:15,395 --> 00:27:16,194
Yan,

564
00:27:18,674 --> 00:27:21,075
there's something

565
00:27:21,115 --> 00:27:22,714
I need to tell you.

566
00:27:25,595 --> 00:27:29,555
Your father hasn't been well recently,

567
00:27:29,595 --> 00:27:30,635
and he did a body checkup.

568
00:27:31,514 --> 00:27:32,635
The test results

569
00:27:32,674 --> 00:27:35,474
said there's a tumor in his lung.

570
00:27:46,115 --> 00:27:47,994
Is it benign?

571
00:27:48,595 --> 00:27:50,434
It appears benign for now.

572
00:27:50,474 --> 00:27:51,714
But the doctor said

573
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:52,915
he mustn't overexert himself

574
00:27:52,954 --> 00:27:54,315
from now on.

575
00:27:55,155 --> 00:27:56,474
As for whether this benign state

576
00:27:57,315 --> 00:27:58,274
might turn malignant,

577
00:27:58,835 --> 00:28:00,234
the doctor can't guarantee.

578
00:28:05,115 --> 00:28:08,434
I know how you think of him.

579
00:28:09,474 --> 00:28:10,875
But you didn't invite him

580
00:28:11,595 --> 00:28:13,395
to your wedding.

581
00:28:15,434 --> 00:28:16,674
Now that he's ill,

582
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:18,474
I think

583
00:28:19,194 --> 00:28:20,835
you should

584
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:22,194
go visit him.

585
00:28:26,434 --> 00:28:27,674
Is this length okay?

586
00:28:28,115 --> 00:28:28,514
Perfect.

587
00:28:28,754 --> 00:28:29,875
Okay, switch hands.

588
00:28:34,274 --> 00:28:36,274
If you don't want to go alone,

589
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,434
I can go with you.

590
00:28:48,474 --> 00:28:49,315
I understand.

591
00:28:51,674 --> 00:28:52,514
Listen.

592
00:28:52,915 --> 00:28:53,355
See?

593
00:28:53,954 --> 00:28:55,115
When trimming nails,

594
00:28:55,555 --> 00:28:57,474
you must cut the edges

595
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:58,355
like this.

596
00:28:59,194 --> 00:28:59,875
Like this.

597
00:29:00,754 --> 00:29:02,075
Otherwise, you'll get paronychia.

598
00:29:02,194 --> 00:29:03,514
T-This is so difficult.

599
00:29:03,674 --> 00:29:04,754
I always use

600
00:29:04,795 --> 00:29:05,994
small scissors

601
00:29:06,034 --> 00:29:06,954
to trim them.

602
00:29:25,194 --> 00:29:26,034
Shen,

603
00:29:26,795 --> 00:29:28,194
got up so early?

604
00:29:30,115 --> 00:29:31,795
Work habits keep me rising early.

605
00:29:32,714 --> 00:29:34,795
Come grocery shopping with me?

606
00:29:35,034 --> 00:29:36,155
Okay, let's go.

607
00:29:38,274 --> 00:29:39,915
You young people

608
00:29:40,274 --> 00:29:41,555
run big companies

609
00:29:41,674 --> 00:29:43,075
and chase grand career.

610
00:29:43,954 --> 00:29:45,795
You need to balance work and rest.

611
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:49,875
Health should be your top priority.

612
00:29:49,994 --> 00:29:51,234
Only when you're well-rested,

613
00:29:51,234 --> 00:29:52,754
and well-fed

614
00:29:53,115 --> 00:29:56,474
can you achieve great things.

615
00:29:57,234 --> 00:29:59,234
Come visit more often.

616
00:29:59,315 --> 00:30:01,474
The fresh air here does wonders.

617
00:30:02,555 --> 00:30:04,075
Okay, I'll do it.

618
00:30:05,234 --> 00:30:07,434
You know, Yan cares about you

619
00:30:07,795 --> 00:30:09,115
most, Grandma.

620
00:30:10,474 --> 00:30:11,635
You're getting old,

621
00:30:12,234 --> 00:30:13,674
and it's hard to live alone.

622
00:30:13,954 --> 00:30:15,915
Move to Jingzhou with us, okay?

623
00:30:16,194 --> 00:30:17,075
No, no.

624
00:30:17,555 --> 00:30:19,434
My legs still work fine.

625
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:21,355
I've lived here for my life.

626
00:30:21,434 --> 00:30:23,674
I can't get used to the city life.

627
00:30:24,635 --> 00:30:27,155
Don't worry about me.

628
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:28,674
Rest assured.

629
00:30:29,274 --> 00:30:30,514
If you need anything,

630
00:30:30,915 --> 00:30:32,075
tell us anytime.

631
00:30:34,234 --> 00:30:36,555
Before you leave,

632
00:30:37,714 --> 00:30:40,474
I want to say something to you.

633
00:30:41,355 --> 00:30:41,915
Go ahead.

634
00:30:43,234 --> 00:30:45,514
Every time Yan called,

635
00:30:46,115 --> 00:30:47,514
she praised you,

636
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:48,994
saying you're great

637
00:30:49,234 --> 00:30:50,915
and treating her well.

638
00:30:52,595 --> 00:30:54,194
After I've met you,

639
00:30:55,474 --> 00:30:57,954
you're exactly as she said.

640
00:30:59,954 --> 00:31:00,714
I really like you.

641
00:31:02,434 --> 00:31:03,514
We're a married couple.

642
00:31:04,075 --> 00:31:05,474
I should treat her well.

643
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:10,595
Shen,

644
00:31:12,234 --> 00:31:15,474
I've raised Yan since she was a kid.

645
00:31:16,714 --> 00:31:18,674
I'm just an old country woman,

646
00:31:18,714 --> 00:31:20,835
couldn't teach her much.

647
00:31:21,514 --> 00:31:22,555
She might have

648
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:26,835
some bad habits or whatnot.

649
00:31:29,075 --> 00:31:32,315
If she makes mistakes,

650
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:35,994
can you be more forgiving?

651
00:31:37,234 --> 00:31:38,000
Okay.

652
00:31:38,474 --> 00:31:41,155
Give her a chance to improve.

653
00:31:41,954 --> 00:31:42,795
Okay?

654
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:45,315
Absolutely, Grandma.

655
00:31:46,315 --> 00:31:47,274
I remember every word

656
00:31:48,034 --> 00:31:48,954
you said.

657
00:31:49,915 --> 00:31:50,896
Rest assured.

658
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:53,835
What do we buy later?

659
00:31:54,795 --> 00:31:55,875
What would you like to eat?

660
00:31:56,075 --> 00:31:57,555
I want oysters.

661
00:31:59,555 --> 00:32:01,274
There aren't oysters here.

662
00:32:01,395 --> 00:32:02,954
But we have fresh fish here.

663
00:32:03,514 --> 00:32:04,034
Fish?

664
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,274
(For your treatment.)

665
00:32:24,994 --> 00:32:26,448
(Password is Qiao Lin's birthday.)

666
00:33:12,754 --> 00:33:13,194
We're here.

667
00:33:38,714 --> 00:33:39,754
What do you think?

668
00:33:46,835 --> 00:33:47,835
Blue bricks, gray tiles,

669
00:33:48,635 --> 00:33:49,595
and bamboo groves.

670
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,075
Every inch of this space
seems to whisper

671
00:33:52,474 --> 00:33:54,315
tales of tranquility and peace.

672
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,555
That's why
it's called Jingzhou's retreat.

673
00:34:00,194 --> 00:34:01,994
As expected from
a top journalism student,

674
00:34:02,395 --> 00:34:03,034
so eloquent.

675
00:34:04,234 --> 00:34:05,274
Stop teasing me.

676
00:34:05,915 --> 00:34:07,915
I just feel that in such spaces

677
00:34:08,315 --> 00:34:10,034
we should speak poetically

678
00:34:10,514 --> 00:34:11,994
to suit the vibe here.

679
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,634
In this vast city,

680
00:34:17,954 --> 00:34:19,355
having such a serene corner

681
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:22,434
instantly soothes all anxieties.

682
00:34:23,675 --> 00:34:24,514
It's truly wonderful.

683
00:34:25,795 --> 00:34:27,795
I think in a completely different way.

684
00:34:28,355 --> 00:34:29,634
Alright, tell me,

685
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:30,634
what do you think?

686
00:34:31,395 --> 00:34:32,195
Here, look.

687
00:34:32,994 --> 00:34:34,074
All the plumbing and wiring

688
00:34:34,675 --> 00:34:35,675
needs renovation.

689
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:37,994
Behind you is the kitchen.

690
00:34:38,835 --> 00:34:39,715
The bathroom

691
00:34:40,434 --> 00:34:40,915
needs to get

692
00:34:41,315 --> 00:34:42,355
the waterproofing repairs.

693
00:34:42,434 --> 00:34:43,875
Why do you know this place so well?

694
00:34:44,114 --> 00:34:44,634
You.

695
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:49,875
You'll be the lady of this retreat.

696
00:34:50,634 --> 00:34:53,074
Work connections help you meet guests

697
00:34:53,554 --> 00:34:54,514
and expand your network.

698
00:34:55,074 --> 00:34:55,675
That's good.

699
00:34:56,434 --> 00:34:58,875
But mere show interactions

700
00:34:58,915 --> 00:35:00,355
aren't enough for real connections.

701
00:35:00,835 --> 00:35:02,195
Off-camera relationships

702
00:35:02,275 --> 00:35:03,074
require

703
00:35:03,514 --> 00:35:04,434
maintenance too.

704
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:12,034
The location is excellent,

705
00:35:12,634 --> 00:35:14,994
private and secure.

706
00:35:16,235 --> 00:35:17,154
Perfect for hosting

707
00:35:17,474 --> 00:35:19,235
gatherings with friends.

708
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:22,715
This will benefit your career.

709
00:35:27,474 --> 00:35:29,554
Yan, listen.

710
00:35:30,114 --> 00:35:30,954
The better you work,

711
00:35:31,514 --> 00:35:32,915
the more influence

712
00:35:32,994 --> 00:35:34,315
you'll gain at the network.

713
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:37,715
It'll benefit your anchor application.

714
00:35:43,034 --> 00:35:44,154
You think I don't know

715
00:35:44,755 --> 00:35:48,395
you practice broadcasting at 5 AM?

716
00:35:52,034 --> 00:35:56,154
You're my wife now.

717
00:35:57,594 --> 00:35:59,195
Whatever dreams you have,

718
00:35:59,994 --> 00:36:02,154
I'll help you make them real.

719
00:36:08,994 --> 00:36:09,634
Go check inside.

720
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:11,715
Come on.

721
00:36:19,795 --> 00:36:21,074
Is it enough for a dining area?

722
00:36:21,395 --> 00:36:22,235
More than sufficient.

723
00:36:22,915 --> 00:36:24,675
In such prime location,

724
00:36:25,355 --> 00:36:27,355
this space is sufficient.

725
00:36:28,554 --> 00:36:30,034
I think we should

726
00:36:30,634 --> 00:36:32,395
put cabinets here.

727
00:36:32,634 --> 00:36:33,994
And dining area's here.

728
00:36:34,034 --> 00:36:36,395
But these white walls seem too plain.

729
00:36:36,434 --> 00:36:36,795
So...

730
00:36:42,544 --> 00:36:45,840
(Soon, I'll be as tall as Dad)

731
00:36:48,954 --> 00:36:51,114
The previous owners left

732
00:36:51,355 --> 00:36:53,315
their child's height markings

733
00:36:53,514 --> 00:36:54,195
on the frame.

734
00:36:54,395 --> 00:36:55,074
How adorable.

735
00:36:57,634 --> 00:36:59,034
When I was little,

736
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:02,355
Dad measured my height like this too.

737
00:37:03,034 --> 00:37:04,074
These are precious,

738
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:06,074
so I kept them intact.

739
00:37:10,034 --> 00:37:11,034
(You kid!)

740
00:37:11,154 --> 00:37:12,994
(Stand still. Dad's measuring.)

741
00:37:12,994 --> 00:37:13,594
Come here.

742
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:14,755
Do it again.

743
00:37:17,474 --> 00:37:18,315
- No cheating.
- Hey!

744
00:37:18,355 --> 00:37:18,994
Do it again.

745
00:37:19,074 --> 00:37:19,755
Ready? Okay.

746
00:37:19,795 --> 00:37:20,594
Stand straight.

747
00:37:21,154 --> 00:37:21,634
There.

748
00:37:21,755 --> 00:37:22,355
Move.

749
00:37:23,235 --> 00:37:23,554
Come.

750
00:37:23,634 --> 00:37:24,275
Come to me.

751
00:37:27,434 --> 00:37:28,434
Last time was 133cm.

752
00:37:28,474 --> 00:37:29,395
Now it's 134cm.

753
00:37:29,434 --> 00:37:31,074
How much did you grow?

754
00:37:32,395 --> 00:37:33,074
One centimeter.

755
00:37:33,514 --> 00:37:36,235
Let's celebrate Lin's growth!

756
00:37:36,434 --> 00:37:38,235
I'll cook you delicious dishes, okay?

757
00:37:45,915 --> 00:37:46,554
I remember too.

758
00:37:53,795 --> 00:37:54,474
Have a lipstick?

759
00:38:06,275 --> 00:38:06,835
Stand still.
