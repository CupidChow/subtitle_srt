Hit me!

It's all my fault.

Let go!

Let go!

Let go!

00:02:14,122 --> 00:02:16,161
Actually, I have one more merit.

43
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:17,881
I'm a sincere person,

44
00:02:18,122 --> 00:02:19,682
especially to relationships.

45
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,481
If one gives me a favor,

46
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:23,122
I'll repay him tenfold.

47
00:02:23,242 --> 00:02:24,282
- Mr. Liang.
- I...

48
00:02:24,522 --> 00:02:25,641
You really have many merits.

49
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:27,161
I'm home.

50
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:28,242
Go to bed early.

51
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:28,802
Thank you.

52
00:02:29,002 --> 00:02:29,641
Xu Yan.

53
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:31,522
I really enjoy

54
00:02:31,522 --> 00:02:32,802
spending time alone with you.

55
00:02:33,522 --> 00:02:35,122
This feeling is unprecedented.

56
00:02:38,802 --> 00:02:41,641
Yuanhang has many projects,

57
00:02:42,682 --> 00:02:45,041
yet you still put effort in Yan Studio.

58
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,321
I really appreciate it.

59
00:02:47,962 --> 00:02:49,402
So I want to find an opportunity

60
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:50,562
to express my gratitude.

61
00:02:51,402 --> 00:02:52,362
Today,

62
00:02:52,362 --> 00:02:53,402
I can let you feel relaxed

63
00:02:53,441 --> 00:02:54,721
despite your busy schedule.

64
00:02:55,402 --> 00:02:56,362
It makes me happy too.

65
00:02:59,002 --> 00:03:00,161
In that case,

66
00:03:00,921 --> 00:03:02,082
we can only talk

67
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:03,201
about work in the future?

68
00:03:03,441 --> 00:03:03,881
Exactly.

69
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:16,201
Don't be alert.

70
00:03:16,842 --> 00:03:18,201
I'm truly single.

71
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:21,481
But I'm still married.

72
00:03:26,962 --> 00:03:28,002
But I think

73
00:03:28,002 --> 00:03:29,962
there's a huge problem

74
00:03:30,242 --> 00:03:31,441
between you and Shen Haoming.

75
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:33,362
You're aware of this too.

76
00:03:35,601 --> 00:03:36,641
Between him and me,

77
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:38,282
there is indeed a problem to resolve.

78
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:39,761
But that doesn't mean

79
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,562
I can accept another man.

80
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:43,842
Mr. Liang.

81
00:03:45,242 --> 00:03:46,441
Thank you

82
00:03:46,441 --> 00:03:48,522
for sharing
your cinematic world with me.

83
00:03:49,321 --> 00:03:50,402
I can tell

84
00:03:50,402 --> 00:03:53,481
you're someone really romantic,

85
00:03:55,282 --> 00:03:57,082
and never lonely.

86
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,122
But in my mind,

87
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,802
you're an excellent investor.

88
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:05,881
I don't want

89
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:07,881
any emotional entanglement

90
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,481
to affect our current

91
00:04:09,481 --> 00:04:10,962
professional partnership.

92
00:04:11,282 --> 00:04:12,002
What do you think?

93
00:04:12,842 --> 00:04:13,562
I understand.

94
00:04:15,002 --> 00:04:16,962
If a woman rejects a man,

95
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:19,402
it means the man
hasn't done well enough.

96
00:04:20,721 --> 00:04:21,601
I'll take your advice.

97
00:04:23,402 --> 00:04:24,881
I'll focus on being the investor.

98
00:04:26,242 --> 00:04:27,041
I believe

99
00:04:27,962 --> 00:04:30,562
the trust and mutual understanding
built in business

100
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:32,722
will foster more genuine feelings.

101
00:04:33,362 --> 00:04:33,802
Alright.

102
00:04:34,162 --> 00:04:34,641
Bye then.

103
00:04:35,682 --> 00:04:36,201
Yan.

104
00:04:45,002 --> 00:04:46,122
Why do you come back alone?

105
00:04:46,722 --> 00:04:47,641
You should've told me,

106
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:49,042
and I would pick you up.

107
00:04:50,521 --> 00:04:51,362
I brought her home.

108
00:04:55,242 --> 00:04:56,042
Thank you.

109
00:04:57,201 --> 00:04:58,521
After working hard,

110
00:04:58,682 --> 00:05:00,961
you still help me send my wife home.

111
00:05:01,321 --> 00:05:02,002
It's okay.

112
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:04,881
Ms. Xu has moved out.

113
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:07,722
Now you have to shuttle between places.

114
00:05:08,482 --> 00:05:09,521
She's that kind of person.

115
00:05:10,401 --> 00:05:11,881
Once she makes up her mind,

116
00:05:12,321 --> 00:05:14,081
she'll be devoted to it.

117
00:05:15,162 --> 00:05:15,841
It's late now.

118
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,401
I won't invite you to my home then.

119
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:18,961
No need.

120
00:05:19,441 --> 00:05:21,242
Ms. Xu and I will meet again tomorrow.

121
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:23,281
You know, collaboration.

122
00:05:23,602 --> 00:05:24,441
We have to meet.

123
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:25,362
I'm leaving.

124
00:05:25,362 --> 00:05:26,362
Looks like rain's coming.

125
00:05:26,521 --> 00:05:26,922
Bye.

126
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:27,641
See you.

127
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:28,682
Let me tell you.

128
00:05:29,722 --> 00:05:32,242
You're already a notorious playboy.

129
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:35,321
Don't try to be a homewrecker now.

130
00:05:38,362 --> 00:05:38,841
Yan.

131
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:08,641
What do you want?

132
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:10,881
I'm quite happy today.

133
00:06:11,002 --> 00:06:11,922
Does that involve me?

134
00:06:19,802 --> 00:06:21,482
I heard you rejected Jiang Liang.

135
00:06:22,162 --> 00:06:22,881
You even told him

136
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:24,521
our problem could be resolved.

137
00:06:25,002 --> 00:06:25,922
Of course.

138
00:06:26,641 --> 00:06:27,562
With a divorce.

139
00:06:38,162 --> 00:06:38,881
Shen Haoming.

140
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:43,521
Our marriage started without dignity.

141
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,841
Just take what we need.

142
00:06:47,081 --> 00:06:49,441
Now I just want us to part peacefully.

143
00:06:50,881 --> 00:06:51,881
Don't worry.

144
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:53,881
I promised your parents

145
00:06:55,802 --> 00:06:57,401
to minimize public fallout.

146
00:06:58,081 --> 00:06:59,521
I'll keep my word.

147
00:07:00,881 --> 00:07:01,961
I just want us

148
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:04,722
to smoothly obtain
the divorce certificate

149
00:07:04,722 --> 00:07:05,841
in our second attempt.

150
00:07:07,242 --> 00:07:08,081
Please cooperate.

151
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:18,362
Remove your hand.

152
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:32,162
Stop taking up the elevator.

153
00:07:53,362 --> 00:07:53,961
You're back.

154
00:07:54,362 --> 00:07:54,961
You're here.

155
00:07:55,722 --> 00:07:57,682
Got off work early
and help you clean up.

156
00:07:58,122 --> 00:07:59,122
I cut some fruits.

157
00:07:59,122 --> 00:07:59,841
Have some.

158
00:08:00,802 --> 00:08:01,321
Thanks.

159
00:08:03,242 --> 00:08:04,321
I saw from the balcony

160
00:08:04,321 --> 00:08:05,802
you returning with Jiang Liang.

161
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:07,521
You're getting close lately.

162
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:10,281
Not really, just for work.

163
00:08:11,802 --> 00:08:12,242
So,

164
00:08:12,482 --> 00:08:13,641
you feel nothing about him?

165
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:14,281
Nothing.

166
00:08:34,242 --> 00:08:36,162
What about you and Shen Haoming?

167
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:39,562
At the resort,

168
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:40,761
something happened, right?

169
00:08:41,602 --> 00:08:43,281
You're quite nosy.

170
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:47,561
You and Shen Haoming

171
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:49,082
are finalizing the divorce,

172
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:50,521
but I know

173
00:08:50,801 --> 00:08:53,401
you wanted to form a family with him.

174
00:08:54,842 --> 00:08:55,962
You loved him so much,

175
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:57,921
and now you're parting.

176
00:08:58,082 --> 00:08:59,242
You must be sad.

177
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:01,681
All my focus and energy now

178
00:09:02,122 --> 00:09:03,122
are on work.

179
00:09:03,401 --> 00:09:04,561
No time for others.

180
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:07,082
It's good to focus on work,

181
00:09:07,482 --> 00:09:08,521
but I believe

182
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:10,842
even decisive people get confused

183
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:12,801
and don't know what to do sometimes.

184
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:14,842
So I think

185
00:09:15,602 --> 00:09:17,041
you'd better think carefully

186
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,561
and clarify your feelings

187
00:09:18,602 --> 00:09:19,521
before deciding.

188
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:20,561
Strawberries are good.

189
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:21,082
Try one.

190
00:09:21,242 --> 00:09:22,281
I know they're sweet.

191
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:23,881
Am I right?

192
00:09:29,801 --> 00:09:31,082
You're quite right.

193
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,202
You mentioned

194
00:09:32,202 --> 00:09:33,561
the peach blossom makeup concept.

195
00:09:34,002 --> 00:09:34,962
What about the plan?

196
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:36,161
Moreover,

197
00:09:36,561 --> 00:09:37,482
want two assistants,

198
00:09:37,482 --> 00:09:38,002
right?

199
00:09:38,242 --> 00:09:39,122
How's that going?

200
00:09:39,322 --> 00:09:40,362
They are indeed sweet.

201
00:09:40,362 --> 00:09:40,842
I'm leaving.

202
00:09:40,842 --> 00:09:41,881
Check the resumes.

203
00:09:42,761 --> 00:09:44,401
What about your college exams?

204
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:44,801
Right.

205
00:09:44,921 --> 00:09:46,002
Two subjects, right?

206
00:09:46,482 --> 00:09:47,761

Why are you still here?

244
00:12:44,761 --> 00:12:45,801
Get out now!

245
00:12:47,921 --> 00:12:49,761
Look at what you have become.

246
00:12:50,281 --> 00:12:51,602
Learn to love yourself

247
00:12:51,602 --> 00:12:52,561
before loving others.

248
00:12:53,881 --> 00:12:55,362
Be an independent woman

249
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,681

and courage to walk away anytime.

253
00:13:02,962 --> 00:13:04,801
Be a relaxed and independent woman.

254
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,161
Live for yourself.

255
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:10,962
If I can't be with Haoming,

256
00:13:13,761 --> 00:13:15,921
I'd rather stay single forever.

257
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,401
Stay single forever?

258
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:22,962
I thought about this before.

259
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:25,122
Let me show you.

260
00:13:27,442 --> 00:13:28,322
When we get old,

261
00:13:28,962 --> 00:13:31,281
we could find a premium nursing home.

262
00:13:33,002 --> 00:13:33,482
And then,

263
00:13:33,561 --> 00:13:36,161
we could take art and music classes.

264
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:37,681
When we get bored,

265
00:13:37,962 --> 00:13:39,401
go sing karaoke, or dance.

266
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:40,202
Interesting?

267
00:13:41,482 --> 00:13:42,442
Here, look.

268
00:13:44,202 --> 00:13:45,521
This one is run by my friend.

269
00:13:45,842 --> 00:13:46,681
Go visit sometime?

270
00:13:54,082 --> 00:13:55,202
Are you insane?

271
00:13:55,842 --> 00:13:57,561
Who would be in a nursing home with you?

272
00:14:00,082 --> 00:14:00,561
Let go!

273
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:01,482
Let go of me!

274
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:29,521
Thinking?

275
00:14:30,761 --> 00:14:31,681
All these years,

276
00:14:32,401 --> 00:14:34,082
you've been chasing Shen Haoming,

277
00:14:34,602 --> 00:14:36,161
yet he married someone else,

278
00:14:36,881 --> 00:14:38,322
didn't even care about you.

279
00:14:40,161 --> 00:14:41,761
If there's a chance to ruin him,

280
00:14:43,242 --> 00:14:44,242
are you interested?

281
00:14:49,161 --> 00:14:51,002
Why suggest that?

282
00:14:59,082 --> 00:14:59,842
Because of you.

283
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,161
I don't want

284
00:15:04,202 --> 00:15:06,122
you sinking deeper into darkness.

00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:21,962
Still haven't eaten at this hour?

287
00:15:22,842 --> 00:15:24,122
Mr. Shen is out.

288
00:15:24,242 --> 00:15:26,082
He told me to put this in his office.

289
00:15:27,681 --> 00:15:28,242
I'm going.

290
00:15:28,242 --> 00:15:29,041
Want my help?

291
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:31,442
Well,

292
00:15:31,962 --> 00:15:32,602
thanks then.

293
00:15:33,362 --> 00:15:34,202
No need.

294
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:35,041
Go eat now.

(Yan Studio)

298
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:13,242
As you can see,

299
00:16:13,281 --> 00:16:14,641
our first batch of videos

300
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:16,602
exceeds 10,000 views each.

301
00:16:17,122 --> 00:16:18,281
The top video

302
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:19,681
even surpasses 60,000 clicks.

303
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:21,881
Therefore, I think we can move on

304
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:23,161
to production phase.

305
00:16:23,602 --> 00:16:24,362
Fantastic!

306
00:16:24,362 --> 00:16:26,122
Finally reaching phase two.

307
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:27,881
Okay.

308
00:16:28,202 --> 00:16:29,962
Today's meeting is

309
00:16:29,962 --> 00:16:31,281
to finalize first collection

310
00:16:31,322 --> 00:16:32,602
and production quantities.

311
00:16:35,521 --> 00:16:38,041
I've compiled all sample video metrics

312
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,041
for review.

313
00:16:39,122 --> 00:16:40,881
These five pieces
received the most likes

314
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:42,242
and the highest engagement.

315
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:44,401
And the highest number
of positive reviews.

316
00:16:45,002 --> 00:16:45,641
In my opinion,

317
00:16:45,641 --> 00:16:47,362
sometimes we have to trust the netizens.

318
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:49,362
Their taste is as good as mine.

319
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,281
I also think they are the best.

320
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:54,281
Let me share a different perspective.

321
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:56,842
The biggest highlight
of these five pieces

322
00:16:56,881 --> 00:16:58,962
is that they all use brocade fabric.

323
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:02,002
But this also is
their biggest challenge.

324
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,281
Because this brocade fabric

325
00:17:03,281 --> 00:17:06,161
is handwoven by ethnic minorities.

326
00:17:06,362 --> 00:17:07,761
So, it showcases

327
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:10,082
such intricate craftsmanship
and exquisite texture.

328
00:17:10,921 --> 00:17:14,641
However, their output
is extremely limited.

329
00:17:15,482 --> 00:17:16,162
Well,

330
00:17:16,321 --> 00:17:18,041
should we first set up a cooperation

331
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,442
with the producers?

332
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:22,642
But hand-weaving is always

333
00:17:22,682 --> 00:17:24,361
slower compared to machinery.

334
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,922
What if they can't meet our demand?

335
00:17:27,722 --> 00:17:30,081
I've thought about this before.

336
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:33,402
But we're still in the early phase,

337
00:17:34,202 --> 00:17:36,561
so a small-batch
yet high-quality approach

338
00:17:36,561 --> 00:17:37,561
suits us better.

339
00:17:37,841 --> 00:17:38,442
Financially,

340
00:17:38,442 --> 00:17:40,002
it's safer and more secure.

341
00:17:41,202 --> 00:17:42,041
For the first batch,

342
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,536
I want us to focus on

343
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:44,601
excellence,

344
00:17:44,761 --> 00:17:45,361
precision,

345
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:46,642
and reputation.

346
00:17:47,561 --> 00:17:49,281
As for what Yao mentioned,

347
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:51,321
we can transform

348
00:17:51,482 --> 00:17:52,962
the challenge of brocade production

349
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,841
into online marketing
advantages and highlights.

350
00:17:57,882 --> 00:17:59,002
Many niche designer brands

351
00:17:59,002 --> 00:18:00,321
are now adopting

352
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:01,722
a limited edition

353
00:18:01,722 --> 00:18:02,841
plus pre-sale model.

354
00:18:02,922 --> 00:18:04,281
We can consider this approach too.

355
00:18:05,722 --> 00:18:08,442
For the five styles for the first batch,
100 pieces each.

356
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:10,081
If we can achieve this,

357
00:18:10,642 --> 00:18:12,081
it could be a success.

358
00:18:16,841 --> 00:18:17,402
Xiaowan,

359
00:18:17,962 --> 00:18:19,482
any ideas for online promotion?

360
00:18:20,202 --> 00:18:22,761
We could organize
reward-based activities

361
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:23,722
to extend the timeline.

362
00:18:23,761 --> 00:18:26,121
This would buy us time for production.

363
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:30,002
Any other problem to discuss?

364
00:18:31,121 --> 00:18:32,041
Based on Wan's plan,

365
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,922
I'll recruit more influencers

366
00:18:33,962 --> 00:18:35,242
to promote us.

367
00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:37,081
Regarding the fees

368
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:38,801
for these influencers,

369
00:18:38,801 --> 00:18:40,081
could you give me an estimate?

370
00:18:40,242 --> 00:18:40,521
Sure.

371
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:41,361
I'll send it to you.

372
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:42,002
Good.

373
00:18:44,722 --> 00:18:46,841
I can reach out to bloggers,

374
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:48,121
offer them free makeup services,

375
00:18:48,121 --> 00:18:49,962
and let them wear our outfits in posts.

376
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,162
That should help, right?

377
00:18:58,121 --> 00:18:59,202
Why did you ask to meet?

378
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:00,962
Can't I just want to see you?

379
00:19:01,202 --> 00:19:02,561
Join me for afternoon tea?

380
00:19:03,002 --> 00:19:03,922
Sure.

381
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:06,801
How have you been?

382
00:19:07,442 --> 00:19:08,642
Haven't seen you in days.

383
00:19:09,162 --> 00:19:10,442
Focus on work

384
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,442
or on someone?

385
00:19:15,882 --> 00:19:17,841
No one understands me like you do.

386
00:19:18,321 --> 00:19:19,402
Same old me.

387
00:19:20,321 --> 00:19:23,242
I can't stand seeing
female friends suffering,

388
00:19:23,242 --> 00:19:24,561
so I have to help them.

389
00:19:24,761 --> 00:19:25,682
What can I do?

390
00:19:26,402 --> 00:19:29,521
There are too many female friends
you want to help.

391
00:19:30,281 --> 00:19:31,482
Which one this time?

392
00:19:33,482 --> 00:19:33,962
Xu Yan.

393
00:19:36,722 --> 00:19:37,601
Xu Yan?

394
00:19:41,642 --> 00:19:42,801
Are you out of your mind?

395
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,962
Xu Yan is Shen Haoming's wife.

396
00:19:46,361 --> 00:19:47,521
We're in the negotiation.

397
00:19:49,002 --> 00:19:50,002
So what?

398
00:19:50,321 --> 00:19:51,521
I'm her investor.

399
00:19:51,962 --> 00:19:52,561
Besides,

400
00:19:52,561 --> 00:19:53,482
heard the rumors?

401
00:19:53,482 --> 00:19:54,521
They're getting divorced.

402
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:55,801
I don't care about rumors.

403
00:19:56,442 --> 00:19:58,442
But I don't want you to help her.

404
00:20:08,242 --> 00:20:08,962
Haochen.

405
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:11,402
What is it, Coach Lu?

406
00:20:11,682 --> 00:20:12,722
I want to recommend you

407
00:20:12,761 --> 00:20:14,922
for this year's
Junior Equestrian Championship.

408
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:16,121
However,

409
00:20:16,121 --> 00:20:17,841
we need to consult
your family's opinions.

410
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,281
Have your family come over

411
00:20:20,162 --> 00:20:22,682
to discuss your training schedule
for the second half.

412
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:25,361
Just call my sister-in-law.

413
00:20:25,442 --> 00:20:26,922
She handles all my affairs.

414
00:20:27,281 --> 00:20:27,682
Alright.

415
00:20:27,882 --> 00:20:28,841
I'll contact her.

416
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,002
Haoming.

417
00:20:34,202 --> 00:20:35,041
Come here.

418
00:20:35,081 --> 00:20:36,761
I've got amazing news!

419
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,642
If you want to join the championship,

420
00:20:38,642 --> 00:20:41,361
the technical difficulty and
training intensity will both increase.

421
00:20:41,361 --> 00:20:42,922
Haochen is very interested himself.

422
00:20:43,162 --> 00:20:45,321
I wonder what you two think.

423
00:20:48,521 --> 00:20:49,922
Haochen has trained for four years.

424
00:20:50,601 --> 00:20:51,841
If he's interested,

425
00:20:52,081 --> 00:20:53,321
I'll definitely support him.

426
00:20:57,801 --> 00:20:59,202
Honey, what do you think?

427
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:07,482
Coach Lu,

428
00:21:08,402 --> 00:21:09,761
Haochen's records show

429
00:21:09,761 --> 00:21:11,521
he's completed
over 350 training sessions.

430
00:21:14,281 --> 00:21:15,722
If he wants to participate,

431
00:21:15,722 --> 00:21:16,962
we'll definitely support him.

432
00:21:18,682 --> 00:21:19,841
But I have one question.

433
00:21:20,242 --> 00:21:21,561
He's nearly 160 cm tall.

434
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,242
His current horse might be too small.

435
00:21:24,841 --> 00:21:26,002
If it's too small,

436
00:21:26,162 --> 00:21:27,801
jumping obstacles could be dangerous.

437
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:30,722
Yes.

438
00:21:30,882 --> 00:21:31,682
For the competition,

439
00:21:31,682 --> 00:21:33,801
we'll adjust equipment to his height.

440
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:35,242
Glad to hear that.

441
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:35,642
Okay.

442
00:21:36,242 --> 00:21:38,482
I'll start working on the registration.

443
00:21:39,321 --> 00:21:39,882
Thank you.

444
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:41,242
- Thanks.
- Not at all.

445
00:21:41,242 --> 00:21:41,801
Thank you.

446
00:21:48,242 --> 00:21:49,081
Call me anytime.

447
00:21:49,242 --> 00:21:49,761
I'm leaving.

448
00:21:51,121 --> 00:21:52,002
Wait!

449
00:21:54,682 --> 00:21:55,361
Well,

450
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,922
the fresh juices here are tasty.

451
00:21:57,922 --> 00:21:58,841
Want to try some?

452
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:00,801
Sure!

453
00:22:00,801 --> 00:22:01,801
I'll go get you some.

454
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:03,002
Wait for me!

455
00:22:11,561 --> 00:22:12,922
The juice here is pretty good.

456
00:22:15,442 --> 00:22:16,162
I know.

457
00:22:31,722 --> 00:22:32,561
Sit down and wait?

458
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,162
Please tell Haochen

459
00:22:44,841 --> 00:22:46,002
I need to leave now.

460
00:22:46,801 --> 00:22:48,561
I left a meeting halfway to come here.

461
00:22:49,682 --> 00:22:50,081
Okay.

462
00:22:50,761 --> 00:22:51,361
Thanks.

463
00:23:08,601 --> 00:23:09,202
Where's she?

464
00:23:09,841 --> 00:23:11,002
She had work to attend to

465
00:23:11,801 --> 00:23:12,281
and left.

466
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,482
Why are you still sitting here?

467
00:23:15,242 --> 00:23:16,041
Oh my!

468
00:23:18,162 --> 00:23:20,202
You're driving me crazy!

469
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:22,281
Even I know

470
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:23,722
you should fix your mistakes.

471
00:23:23,962 --> 00:23:25,841
You made her mad,

472
00:23:25,922 --> 00:23:27,002
and now she's ignoring you.

473
00:23:27,002 --> 00:23:28,402
You need to do something!

474
00:23:31,642 --> 00:23:33,081
Yan has been sincere

475
00:23:33,722 --> 00:23:35,041
to Haochen.

476
00:23:36,402 --> 00:23:37,281
After all,

477
00:23:37,962 --> 00:23:39,361
it's all for you.

478
00:23:40,601 --> 00:23:42,081
Otherwise, to her,

479
00:23:42,442 --> 00:23:44,281
Haochen is just some random child.

480
00:23:47,561 --> 00:23:49,121
She's always adored Haochen.

481
00:23:49,922 --> 00:23:50,922
Why involves me?

482
00:23:51,361 --> 00:23:52,482
Of course, it involves you.

483
00:23:52,761 --> 00:23:54,002
"Love me, love my dog."

484
00:23:54,722 --> 00:23:56,561
She loves you,

485
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,121
so she values our family.

486
00:24:00,202 --> 00:24:01,642
After you two married,

487
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:03,081
she's treated me,

488
00:24:03,561 --> 00:24:04,321
your father,

489
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:05,121
and Haochen

490
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,642
with sincerity.

491
00:24:07,081 --> 00:24:09,601
Her care has always been tangible.

492
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:11,841
And I truly felt it.

493
00:24:14,761 --> 00:24:17,321
After decades in business,

494
00:24:18,121 --> 00:24:20,601
I've encountered all types of people.

495
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:23,442
But when Yan looks at you,

496
00:24:24,081 --> 00:24:27,321
I can tell how deeply she loves you.

497
00:24:30,442 --> 00:24:31,801
Actually,

498
00:24:31,962 --> 00:24:33,402
it's part of my fault that you two

499
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,442
are getting divorce now.

500
00:24:37,841 --> 00:24:38,922
From the start,

501
00:24:39,202 --> 00:24:41,521
I wanted you to marry someone matched

502
00:24:42,402 --> 00:24:44,601
so I was harsh to Yan,

503
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:46,642
and tried every mean

504
00:24:46,761 --> 00:24:47,801
to drive her away.

505
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,002
I deeply regret that now.

506
00:24:53,002 --> 00:24:54,801
Had I not done those,

507
00:24:55,482 --> 00:24:57,642
she wouldn't have lied
about her family backgrounds

508
00:24:58,482 --> 00:25:00,242
to prove herself.

509
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:04,722
I've no right

510
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:06,361
to blame her for deceiving me.

511
00:25:08,162 --> 00:25:09,081
From the beginning,

512
00:25:10,162 --> 00:25:11,041
I'd already decided

513
00:25:11,882 --> 00:25:13,801
to hide Haochen's background.

514
00:25:16,801 --> 00:25:19,041
Now that you've talked things through,

515
00:25:19,482 --> 00:25:21,922
I think you may get back together.

516
00:25:24,202 --> 00:25:24,801
Haoming.

517
00:25:26,321 --> 00:25:27,242
I truly cherish Yan

518
00:25:27,242 --> 00:25:28,242
as my daughter-in-law.

519
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:33,482
She reminds me of my younger self.

520
00:25:34,882 --> 00:25:35,882
Driven,

521
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:38,121
hardworking,

522
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,321
able to handle both society

523
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,081
and hard labor.

524
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,041
When she did supermarket live streams,

525
00:25:45,841 --> 00:25:46,761
she swallowed her pride

526
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:48,002
and standing on her own.

527
00:25:48,761 --> 00:25:50,321
She made no excuses

528
00:25:50,321 --> 00:25:51,882
for her mistakes,

529
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:54,041
but fight for what she wanted

530
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:56,162
through sheer determination.

531
00:25:57,922 --> 00:25:59,242
That's when I knew

532
00:26:00,002 --> 00:26:02,561
she was meant to be
the hostess of Shen Family.

533
00:26:03,321 --> 00:26:04,121
Just like you,

534
00:26:06,761 --> 00:26:08,761
she's a pillar of our family.

535
00:26:09,482 --> 00:26:10,321
Promise me.

536
00:26:11,081 --> 00:26:12,642
No matter what it takes,

537
00:26:13,482 --> 00:26:15,081
bring Yan back.

538
00:26:17,081 --> 00:26:18,242
When I married her,

539
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:21,361
I vowed to never let go.

540
00:26:24,722 --> 00:26:25,561
You can do this.

541
00:26:42,402 --> 00:26:42,801
Come on.

542
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:43,561
Good job.

543
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:44,922
That's it for today.

544
00:26:47,281 --> 00:26:47,801
Lin.

545
00:26:47,922 --> 00:26:49,041
I'll book you again.

546
00:26:49,402 --> 00:26:49,922
Thank you.

547
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:51,801
See you Friday.

548
00:26:51,841 --> 00:26:52,121
Got it.

549
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:52,841
Bye.

550
00:26:53,402 --> 00:26:53,922
Take care.

551
00:26:59,922 --> 00:27:00,442
Zheng!

552
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:02,121
Are you okay?

553
00:27:02,402 --> 00:27:03,120
Twisted my ankle.

554
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:04,162
Can you move?

555
00:27:04,442 --> 00:27:04,922
It hurts.

556
00:27:05,121 --> 00:27:05,761
I can't move.

557
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:08,002
Let's go to the hospital.

558
00:27:08,561 --> 00:27:09,281
Don't delay.

559
00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:10,041
Let's go.

560
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:10,601
Come on.

561
00:27:10,882 --> 00:27:11,482
Hello, sir.

562
00:27:14,722 --> 00:27:16,801
The doctor let him stay
a few days for observation.

563
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:24,162
Bye.

564
00:27:39,002 --> 00:27:39,761
Scumbag!

565
00:27:40,482 --> 00:27:42,402
I knew you weren't sincere with Lin.

566
00:27:44,002 --> 00:27:44,601
Lin.

567
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:46,642
Come to the hospital cafeteria now.

568
00:27:46,882 --> 00:27:48,281
See what Yu Yiming's been doing

569
00:27:48,281 --> 00:27:49,242
(Jingzhou Yuekang Hospital, Outpatient)
behind your back.

570
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:58,722
Outrageous.

571
00:27:59,121 --> 00:28:00,442
Just now she held his hand.

572
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:02,521
Now he's patting her shoulder.

573
00:28:02,922 --> 00:28:03,882
They've been together

574
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:04,962
for 26 minutes.

575
00:28:05,202 --> 00:28:06,121
In front of me,

576
00:28:06,121 --> 00:28:07,682
he keeps declaring his love for you.

577
00:28:08,002 --> 00:28:08,962
Look what he's doing!

578
00:28:09,402 --> 00:28:11,162
Touchy-feely in public.

579
00:28:11,162 --> 00:28:12,081
No sense of propriety.

580
00:28:12,962 --> 00:28:14,962
He's practically a male coquette!

581
00:28:15,482 --> 00:28:16,242
Shut up!

582
00:28:17,121 --> 00:28:18,162
Stop rambling.

583
00:28:19,841 --> 00:28:21,202
Move away.

584
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:24,761
Lin.

585
00:28:25,202 --> 00:28:25,722
Lin.

586
00:28:26,882 --> 00:28:27,521
Scumbag!

587
00:28:27,601 --> 00:28:28,361
Senior.

588
00:28:30,882 --> 00:28:32,848
This is my first patient

589
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,761
who died since I became a resident.

590
00:28:44,242 --> 00:28:44,922
Wenjin.

591
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:48,642
I've been through these too.

592
00:28:51,081 --> 00:28:52,642
There are patients we want to save

593
00:28:53,962 --> 00:28:54,761
but can't.

594
00:28:55,242 --> 00:28:57,761
When we face their grieving family,
we don't know what to say.

595
00:28:58,761 --> 00:28:59,882
I know

596
00:29:01,002 --> 00:29:02,242
how hard it is

597
00:29:04,121 --> 00:29:05,482
for you.

598
00:29:06,601 --> 00:29:07,761
But as doctors,

599
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:10,242
we must face this and overcome it.

600
00:29:13,321 --> 00:29:15,202
There are other patients waiting for us.

601
00:29:15,561 --> 00:29:16,041
Lin.

602
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:18,081
Lin.

603
00:29:20,002 --> 00:29:20,521
Lin!

604
00:29:22,482 --> 00:29:23,601
Please listen to me.

605
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:24,402
Go ahead.

606
00:29:25,561 --> 00:29:27,121
I know you're hurting.

607
00:29:28,442 --> 00:29:31,761
But you must see his true nature.

608
00:29:33,121 --> 00:29:35,002
Yu Yiming's conditions are good.

609
00:29:36,242 --> 00:29:36,801
I admit that.

610
00:29:38,682 --> 00:29:40,482
But people living in big cities

611
00:29:40,682 --> 00:29:42,321
think realistically.

612
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,601
Your social status, background,

613
00:29:44,601 --> 00:29:45,321
education, and job

614
00:29:45,321 --> 00:29:46,521
are worlds apart from his.

615
00:29:46,722 --> 00:29:48,402
Do you really think he doesn't care?

616
00:29:51,162 --> 00:29:51,482
Lin Tao.

617
00:29:51,482 --> 00:29:52,841
I don't care what you saw.

618
00:29:52,962 --> 00:29:53,841
I just believe

619
00:29:53,841 --> 00:29:55,761
that Yu Yiming is not that kind of man.

620
00:29:56,442 --> 00:29:57,002
Well, Lin.

621
00:29:57,002 --> 00:29:58,761
Why don't you believe me?

622
00:29:58,761 --> 00:30:00,121
I'm the one who truly...

623
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:06,962
Where's that bruise from?

624
00:30:07,442 --> 00:30:08,521
You fought?

625
00:30:08,922 --> 00:30:09,521
Well...

626
00:30:10,402 --> 00:30:12,080
I'm now a sparring partner
at an MMA gym.

627
00:30:13,761 --> 00:30:14,482
Why?

628
00:30:15,202 --> 00:30:15,962
To take punches.

629
00:30:16,642 --> 00:30:17,801
You like hitting people.

630
00:30:18,002 --> 00:30:18,841
No problem.

631
00:30:19,202 --> 00:30:20,482
If hitting me makes you happy,

632
00:30:20,922 --> 00:30:21,962
just do it.

633
00:30:22,162 --> 00:30:22,682
Lin.

634
00:30:23,081 --> 00:30:25,442
I'm ready to be
your punching bag for life.

635
00:30:31,561 --> 00:30:32,202
Lin Tao.

636
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,202
The matter between us

637
00:30:34,761 --> 00:30:36,041
has dragged on long enough.

638
00:30:39,162 --> 00:30:41,081
Can we calmly

639
00:30:41,081 --> 00:30:42,321
talk it through today?

640
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:44,801
Okay.

641
00:30:48,121 --> 00:30:48,682
I know

642
00:30:49,962 --> 00:30:51,242
you gave a lot

643
00:30:52,002 --> 00:30:53,041
to this relationship.

644
00:30:54,002 --> 00:30:55,722
But we've both realized we're not right

645
00:30:55,722 --> 00:30:56,882
for each other.

646
00:30:57,402 --> 00:30:59,041
Breaking up is the best choice.

647
00:31:01,121 --> 00:31:02,962
We're never getting back together.

648
00:31:05,561 --> 00:31:06,442
So,

649
00:31:07,402 --> 00:31:08,722
I hope you can let go.

650
00:31:10,442 --> 00:31:11,801
Don't you want me to be happy?

651
00:31:13,682 --> 00:31:15,722
I am now.

652
00:31:16,601 --> 00:31:17,601
Look,

653
00:31:17,601 --> 00:31:18,521
I've got my sister

654
00:31:18,922 --> 00:31:21,041
and my startup team by my side.

655
00:31:21,601 --> 00:31:23,642
My life is full and busy.

656
00:31:26,121 --> 00:31:27,041
I also hope

657
00:31:28,642 --> 00:31:30,402
that you get back

658
00:31:30,601 --> 00:31:31,922
on your own path.

659
00:31:32,761 --> 00:31:33,321
Lin Tao.

660
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:36,482
I wish you well too.

661
00:31:42,162 --> 00:31:42,642
I'll leave.

662
00:31:54,202 --> 00:31:54,922
Lin.

663
00:31:56,402 --> 00:31:57,552
Take good care of yourself.

664
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:01,922
How's Xu Yan's company

665
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:03,041
doing lately?

666
00:32:03,402 --> 00:32:05,561
They're doing great.

667
00:32:05,962 --> 00:32:07,521
Their newly released short videos

668
00:32:07,601 --> 00:32:08,841
get over 10,000 likes,

669
00:32:09,482 --> 00:32:12,281
all with much better quality.

670
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:14,521
Currently,

671
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:15,761
this market is competitive.

672
00:32:16,002 --> 00:32:17,521
With numerous production stages,

673
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:19,722
achieving such results this fast

674
00:32:20,002 --> 00:32:20,841
is truly remarkable.

675
00:32:22,722 --> 00:32:25,482
No wonder Jiang Liang
has been showing off.

676
00:32:26,281 --> 00:32:27,841
Actually, I think

677
00:32:28,402 --> 00:32:29,922
Yan works hard

678
00:32:30,442 --> 00:32:31,482
just to prove her worth

679
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:32,561
and strength to you.

680
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:34,002
These days

681
00:32:34,281 --> 00:32:37,002
people want equal and balanced love.

682
00:32:37,321 --> 00:32:38,841
She's an independent woman.

683
00:32:39,682 --> 00:32:41,002
Surely she wants to succeed first

684
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:41,801
before returning.

685
00:32:43,722 --> 00:32:44,682
Really?

686
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:45,482
Absolutely.

687
00:32:45,808 --> 00:32:46,642
Think about it.

688
00:32:46,962 --> 00:32:49,801
If she really wanted to cut ties,

689
00:32:50,321 --> 00:32:52,041
why would she agree to the resort trip?

690
00:32:52,442 --> 00:32:53,841
Why would she help you

691
00:32:54,202 --> 00:32:55,482
win over Mr. Baraikin?

692
00:32:58,642 --> 00:32:59,242
Three days.

693
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:00,521
You have to be together

694
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:02,002
all the time,

695
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:03,722
pretending to be close,

696
00:33:04,521 --> 00:33:05,882
even sharing a room.

697
00:33:07,801 --> 00:33:08,642
Let me tell you.

698
00:33:09,402 --> 00:33:11,801
If a woman truly hates a man,

699
00:33:12,081 --> 00:33:13,761
she wouldn't spend
even a second with him.

700
00:33:15,882 --> 00:33:16,882
Remember

701
00:33:17,242 --> 00:33:20,281
the romantic room at Yanbo Resort?

702
00:33:20,722 --> 00:33:21,882
That passionate setup.

703
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:24,321
Yan didn't object at all, right?

704
00:33:27,761 --> 00:33:30,321
You did a good job.

705
00:33:30,561 --> 00:33:33,722
If she truly had no feelings left,
why would she do that?

706
00:33:34,601 --> 00:33:36,482
But she keeps wanting a divorce.

707
00:33:37,162 --> 00:33:38,521
That's just anger talking.

708
00:33:40,321 --> 00:33:42,202
My girlfriend used to threaten breakup

709
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:43,402
when got mad.

710
00:33:43,682 --> 00:33:44,242
Really.

711
00:33:46,962 --> 00:33:49,162
How did you become such a smooth talker?

712
00:33:49,962 --> 00:33:50,482
Sit down.

713
00:33:52,601 --> 00:33:53,162
Keep going.

714
00:33:56,402 --> 00:33:57,561
Now,

715
00:33:57,841 --> 00:33:59,682
to win her back

716
00:33:59,722 --> 00:34:00,801
by direct communication

717
00:34:01,281 --> 00:34:02,361
is hard.

718
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:05,081
But there's a method that always works.

719
00:34:05,162 --> 00:34:05,922
What is it?

720
00:34:06,722 --> 00:34:07,601
Indirect strategy.

721
00:34:08,402 --> 00:34:09,841
Go find her friends.

722
00:34:09,962 --> 00:34:10,801
That would help.

723
00:34:10,922 --> 00:34:11,402
No use.

724
00:34:11,761 --> 00:34:13,482
I tried Qiao Lin, but she refused.

725
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:15,361
What about male friends?

726
00:34:16,002 --> 00:34:16,922
At such times,

727
00:34:17,081 --> 00:34:18,482
men often understand each other.

728
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:22,442
Male friends?

729
00:34:25,762 --> 00:34:26,882
She does have one.

730
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:54,704
Coming!

731
00:34:56,592 --> 00:34:57,872
Qiao Lin. Perfect timing.

732
00:34:57,872 --> 00:34:59,792
I'm making breakfast
and want to bring you some.

733
00:34:59,792 --> 00:35:00,521
Take any seat.

734
00:35:06,561 --> 00:35:07,762
- I'll get you some fruit.
- Wait.

735
00:35:08,362 --> 00:35:09,641
I have something to say.

736
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:11,561
Go ahead.

737
00:35:12,641 --> 00:35:13,521
Sit down.

738
00:35:20,561 --> 00:35:21,201
Yu Yiming.

739
00:35:25,161 --> 00:35:25,882
I like you.

740
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:30,442
- Qiao Lin, actually...
- Let me finish.

741
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:31,161
Okay.

742
00:35:36,081 --> 00:35:39,601
Yes, I always do what I want,

743
00:35:40,161 --> 00:35:41,962
but I'm not that naive.

744
00:35:44,121 --> 00:35:45,282
I'm very aware

745
00:35:45,442 --> 00:35:47,521
of the real differences between us.

746
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:50,201
Those can't be ignored.

747
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,842
I know there are

748
00:35:56,282 --> 00:35:57,681
many outstanding people around you.

749
00:35:57,962 --> 00:35:59,802
Like that female doctor

750
00:35:59,802 --> 00:36:01,081
I saw in the cafeteria.

751
00:36:01,762 --> 00:36:03,081
Realistically,

752
00:36:03,201 --> 00:36:04,681
they're more successful,

753
00:36:04,721 --> 00:36:07,362
and also better matches for you.

754
00:36:07,482 --> 00:36:09,362
You share the same profession

755
00:36:10,161 --> 00:36:11,521
so you'd have more topics

756
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:12,561
and pursuits in common.

757
00:36:13,081 --> 00:36:13,442
However,

758
00:36:14,762 --> 00:36:17,121
I don't think this means

759
00:36:17,121 --> 00:36:18,322
I'm unworthy of liking you.

760
00:36:22,482 --> 00:36:24,041
I believe

761
00:36:24,521 --> 00:36:25,962
you have the right to choose.

762
00:36:27,002 --> 00:36:27,612
So...

763
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,362
If you think

764
00:36:30,362 --> 00:36:32,282
she is more suitable,

765
00:36:34,802 --> 00:36:37,241
I won't force it.

766
00:36:44,842 --> 00:36:45,482
Qiao Lin.

767
00:36:49,121 --> 00:36:50,201
What's with you today?

768
00:36:51,561 --> 00:36:52,762
Did something happen to you?

769
00:36:56,721 --> 00:36:57,882
Yesterday,

770
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,041
at the hospital cafeteria,

771
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:00,521
I saw you with Dr. Xu.

772
00:37:01,402 --> 00:37:02,402
She looked distressed

773
00:37:02,681 --> 00:37:04,121
and you tried to comfort her.

774
00:37:04,201 --> 00:37:05,362
She seemed to need you.

775
00:37:08,282 --> 00:37:09,721
I-I don't know what to say.

776
00:37:11,442 --> 00:37:12,208
Didn't sleep well?

777
00:37:16,161 --> 00:37:17,442
Yesterday,

778
00:37:18,081 --> 00:37:18,922
it was her first time

779
00:37:19,002 --> 00:37:20,241
losing a patient.

780
00:37:20,362 --> 00:37:21,521
So I consoled her.

781
00:37:22,041 --> 00:37:22,922
But rest assured.

782
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,121
There's nothing beyond colleagues.

783
00:37:25,561 --> 00:37:26,041
Really.

784
00:37:28,762 --> 00:37:29,802
I trust you.

785
00:37:30,962 --> 00:37:32,282
Also, I trust your character.

786
00:37:32,721 --> 00:37:35,482
But the reality between us

787
00:37:36,282 --> 00:37:37,521
still exist.

788
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:39,962
I don't know

789
00:37:39,962 --> 00:37:42,081
if it will create obstacles

790
00:37:42,201 --> 00:37:43,241
for us.

791
00:37:44,402 --> 00:37:45,161
So...

792
00:37:46,482 --> 00:37:49,721
Maybe we should

793
00:37:50,161 --> 00:37:51,362
take a week apart

794
00:37:51,442 --> 00:37:52,521
to think it over.

795
00:37:54,402 --> 00:37:55,482
No, Qiao Lin. I don't...

796
00:37:57,521 --> 00:37:58,362
This week,

797
00:37:59,081 --> 00:38:00,002
don't contact me.

798
00:38:07,842 --> 00:38:08,362
Okay.

799
00:38:10,482 --> 00:38:11,762
Once I confirm it,

800
00:38:11,762 --> 00:38:12,681
I'll message you.

801
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:19,402
Alright.

802
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:22,482
How's it going?

803
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:24,322
I've secured cooperation

804
00:38:24,322 --> 00:38:26,842
with three weaving villages
for brocade production.

805
00:38:27,442 --> 00:38:29,282
They'll supply us long-term.

806
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:31,362
That's good.

807
00:38:31,721 --> 00:38:32,882
Now we can send orders

808
00:38:32,882 --> 00:38:33,762
to the factory.

809
00:38:33,962 --> 00:38:34,601
I'll follow up.

810
00:38:34,601 --> 00:38:35,241
Wait a second.

811
00:38:36,442 --> 00:38:37,002
Sit down.

812
00:38:40,962 --> 00:38:42,681
Did something happen?

813
00:38:43,241 --> 00:38:43,962
Look at you.

814
00:38:51,802 --> 00:38:53,282
There are only two people

815
00:38:53,322 --> 00:38:54,442
that can make you

816
00:38:54,601 --> 00:38:56,041
be this shaken.

817
00:38:57,161 --> 00:38:58,402
One is Lin Tao,

818
00:38:59,762 --> 00:39:01,002
the other is Yu Yiming.

819
00:39:01,161 --> 00:39:01,721
Which one?

820
00:39:02,282 --> 00:39:03,721
Yu Yiming, of course.

821
00:39:06,962 --> 00:39:09,081
Young love during school days
was so simple.

822
00:39:09,721 --> 00:39:11,962
No need to think about
the future or the outcomes,

823
00:39:12,002 --> 00:39:13,561
just loved.

824
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:15,561
But now,

825
00:39:15,762 --> 00:39:17,442
the more I want to be with someone,

826
00:39:18,121 --> 00:39:20,721
the more I can't help
thinking about reality.

827
00:39:25,121 --> 00:39:26,322
That means you've grown up.

828
00:39:27,842 --> 00:39:29,161
You used to be so carefree.

829
00:39:29,681 --> 00:39:31,376
How could you ever
ponder over such things?

830
00:39:31,641 --> 00:39:33,241
When I was young,

831
00:39:33,802 --> 00:39:35,561
I thought love was all sweet.

832
00:39:36,081 --> 00:39:37,521
But now I understand

833
00:39:38,322 --> 00:39:39,882
there isn't just sweetness,

834
00:39:39,882 --> 00:39:41,161
but bitterness,

835
00:39:41,521 --> 00:39:42,442
insecurity,

836
00:39:42,762 --> 00:39:43,402
pride,

837
00:39:43,601 --> 00:39:44,282
and pain.

838
00:39:44,842 --> 00:39:49,201
All kinds of contradictions intertwined.

839
00:39:50,002 --> 00:39:51,882
But I just can't let go.

840
00:40:02,521 --> 00:40:04,241
I understand how you feel right now.

841
00:40:10,081 --> 00:40:11,561
But this is what love is.

842
00:40:14,842 --> 00:40:17,081
Everything you just said

843
00:40:17,721 --> 00:40:19,521
is part of love.

844
00:40:21,442 --> 00:40:22,561
Don't run from it.

845
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:24,041
You can't run anyway.

846
00:40:25,561 --> 00:40:27,802
So you could try to accept it,

847
00:40:28,442 --> 00:40:29,161
understand it,

848
00:40:29,922 --> 00:40:30,762
and feel it.

849
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:33,482
Maybe in that process,

850
00:40:34,121 --> 00:40:35,681
you'll find the answers you seek.

851
00:40:36,962 --> 00:40:38,802
No need to drain yourself like this.

852
00:40:40,241 --> 00:40:41,241
That's true.

853
00:40:45,081 --> 00:40:45,922
I'll think about it.

854
00:40:46,121 --> 00:40:46,681
I'm leaving.

855
00:40:49,282 --> 00:40:49,842
Wait.

856
00:40:50,641 --> 00:40:51,601
Well...

857
00:40:52,081 --> 00:40:54,121
Don't forget the makeup class.

858
00:40:56,681 --> 00:40:57,201
Okay.

859
00:40:57,362 --> 00:40:57,882
Bye.

860
00:40:59,002 --> 00:40:59,842
Goodbye.

861
00:41:09,498 --> 00:41:13,360
(Yan Studio)

862
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:18,282
Yu Yiming.

863
00:41:22,681 --> 00:41:23,760
You're here for my sister?

864
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:25,962
Yes.

865
00:41:27,561 --> 00:41:28,561
Your coworkers said

866
00:41:28,802 --> 00:41:29,721
she isn't here.

867
00:41:30,601 --> 00:41:31,681
So I'm waiting here.

868
00:41:35,002 --> 00:41:36,362
Does she not want to see me?

869
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:39,601
She really isn't here.

870
00:41:40,161 --> 00:41:42,442
This morning she had makeup class,

871
00:41:42,721 --> 00:41:44,362
this afternoon a beauty launch event.

872
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:46,802
She's looking for the newest products

873
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,521
and preparing for the entrance exams.

874
00:41:49,201 --> 00:41:50,041
She's busy.

875
00:41:50,322 --> 00:41:51,201
Even I barely see her.

876
00:41:51,762 --> 00:41:53,482
Don't overthink it.
She really isn't here.

877
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:56,442
Got it.

878
00:41:57,322 --> 00:41:58,641
Qiao Lin has told me

879
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,762
about you two.

880
00:42:01,121 --> 00:42:02,521
I think she's right.

881
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:05,041
If you ignore

882
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:07,041
these differences now,

883
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:09,041
bigger issues might arise later.

884
00:42:09,882 --> 00:42:11,402
So you both should calm down

885
00:42:11,561 --> 00:42:12,601
and think carefully

886
00:42:12,962 --> 00:42:14,641
whether you can accept it.

887
00:42:16,681 --> 00:42:17,521
She's more rational

888
00:42:17,962 --> 00:42:19,081
than before.

889
00:42:19,802 --> 00:42:21,296
That means you're important to her.

890
00:42:21,922 --> 00:42:23,081
Do you get me?

891
00:42:25,081 --> 00:42:25,882
Okay, I understand.

892
00:42:27,882 --> 00:42:28,802
I'll wait patiently.

893
00:42:30,482 --> 00:42:31,521
These flowers...

894
00:42:31,641 --> 00:42:32,521
I'll give them to her.

895
00:42:33,721 --> 00:42:34,322
Thank you.

896
00:42:35,322 --> 00:42:35,922
I'm leaving.

897
00:42:37,322 --> 00:42:37,922
Take care.

898
00:42:52,561 --> 00:42:53,002
Hello?

899
00:42:54,922 --> 00:42:55,762
I'm Shen Haoming.

900
00:42:57,002 --> 00:42:57,922
Shen Haoming?

901
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:11,521
What's up?

902
00:43:13,402 --> 00:43:13,922
Have a seat.

903
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,161
Thank you.

904
00:43:25,922 --> 00:43:27,282
You like Xu Yan, don't you?

905
00:43:30,282 --> 00:43:31,482
Don't get me wrong.

906
00:43:32,041 --> 00:43:32,641
Yes.

907
00:43:33,882 --> 00:43:35,282
I had feelings for her,

908
00:43:36,402 --> 00:43:37,882
but that was many years ago.

909
00:43:38,442 --> 00:43:39,802
I admit when I saw her again,

910
00:43:40,402 --> 00:43:41,362
I still had a soft spot.

911
00:43:42,601 --> 00:43:44,041
But I know that's not love.

912
00:43:45,561 --> 00:43:47,241
Besides, I'm now with Qiao Lin.

913
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:53,402
I know you're not involved with her.

914
00:43:54,322 --> 00:43:55,402
I asked you here today

915
00:43:56,362 --> 00:43:57,482
to request your help.

916
00:43:58,322 --> 00:43:59,201
How can I help?

917
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,442
You've known her since childhood.

918
00:44:02,201 --> 00:44:03,721
You must understand her well, right?

919
00:44:05,201 --> 00:44:06,962
I hope you can help me win her back.

920
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:10,521
You're mistaken.

921
00:44:11,002 --> 00:44:13,081
Qiao Lin and I have problems too.

922
00:44:14,922 --> 00:44:16,081
I don't know how to help you.

923
00:44:16,802 --> 00:44:18,041
Where are things now?

924
00:44:18,521 --> 00:44:19,632
Breakup cooling-off period.

925
00:44:22,282 --> 00:44:22,802
And you?

926
00:44:23,402 --> 00:44:24,560
Divorce cooling-off period.

927
00:44:24,721 --> 00:44:25,402
Let me toast you.

928
00:44:29,201 --> 00:44:30,362
So you're saying

929
00:44:31,561 --> 00:44:35,641
you used to think you didn't love her,
but now you've fallen for her again?

930
00:44:36,282 --> 00:44:36,962
No.

931
00:44:37,081 --> 00:44:38,762
After we broke up...

932
00:44:39,641 --> 00:44:40,802
It's not "fallen again".

933
00:44:42,201 --> 00:44:43,482
I've always loved her.

934
00:44:50,002 --> 00:44:52,282
But I've never felt this lost before.

935
00:44:52,962 --> 00:44:54,721
I don't know what to do

936
00:44:54,721 --> 00:44:56,282
to get her back.

937
00:44:56,842 --> 00:44:58,041
I only know one thing.

938
00:44:59,041 --> 00:45:00,081
I won't let her go.

939
00:45:00,362 --> 00:45:01,442
Let me tell you.

940
00:45:03,402 --> 00:45:04,362
I hadn't seen Xu Yan

941
00:45:04,402 --> 00:45:05,641
since high school graduation.

942
00:45:06,322 --> 00:45:08,081
When we met again in Jingzhou,

943
00:45:08,442 --> 00:45:09,721
she told me she was married.

944
00:45:10,121 --> 00:45:11,161
The way she said it

945
00:45:11,201 --> 00:45:12,482
was overflowing

946
00:45:12,802 --> 00:45:13,922
with happiness.

947
00:45:14,922 --> 00:45:15,962
The radiance

948
00:45:17,121 --> 00:45:18,161
on her face

949
00:45:19,561 --> 00:45:21,081
was something I'd never seen.

950
00:45:21,922 --> 00:45:22,641
Really?

951
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:23,681
You got married?

952
00:45:27,241 --> 00:45:27,922
Yes, last month.

953
00:45:30,041 --> 00:45:30,962
Though it's a bit late,

954
00:45:32,201 --> 00:45:33,081
congratulations.

955
00:45:34,842 --> 00:45:36,762
I could tell she was truly happy then.

956
00:45:38,041 --> 00:45:38,882
It's all my fault.

957
00:45:39,402 --> 00:45:41,121
I've always been slow

958
00:45:41,121 --> 00:45:42,402
to express myself.

959
00:45:43,442 --> 00:45:44,681
Always realize things too late.

960
00:45:45,922 --> 00:45:46,922
You think you're alone?

961
00:45:50,521 --> 00:45:51,521
I'm the same.

962
00:45:52,002 --> 00:45:53,402
After I met Qiao Lin again,

963
00:45:54,322 --> 00:45:55,561
she's always by my side,

964
00:45:57,561 --> 00:45:58,402
supporting,

965
00:45:59,241 --> 00:46:00,081
encouraging,

966
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:02,641
and caring.

967
00:46:06,442 --> 00:46:07,922
And it still takes me so long

968
00:46:09,201 --> 00:46:10,601
to realize that I like her.

969
00:46:17,802 --> 00:46:18,762
Let's team up.

970
00:46:19,641 --> 00:46:21,362
The women we love are sisters.

971
00:46:22,482 --> 00:46:23,442
Our love lives

972
00:46:24,721 --> 00:46:26,161
are just as bumpy.

973
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,282
We need to help each other.

974
00:46:29,241 --> 00:46:29,762
Makes sense.

975
00:46:29,962 --> 00:46:30,882
When Lin ignores me,

976
00:46:31,442 --> 00:46:32,521
you can reach her for me.

977
00:46:32,842 --> 00:46:33,922
When Xu Yan avoids you,

978
00:46:34,521 --> 00:46:35,842
I can speak to her.

979
00:46:36,161 --> 00:46:36,882
That's...

980
00:46:38,561 --> 00:46:39,482
strength in numbers.

981
00:46:40,282 --> 00:46:41,962
Two are better than one.

982
00:46:42,322 --> 00:46:43,121
You're right.

983
00:46:43,802 --> 00:46:44,464
Brother-in-law.

984
00:46:44,882 --> 00:46:45,520
Brother-in-law.

985
00:46:47,442 --> 00:46:48,176
Brother-in-law.

986
00:46:48,402 --> 00:46:49,072
