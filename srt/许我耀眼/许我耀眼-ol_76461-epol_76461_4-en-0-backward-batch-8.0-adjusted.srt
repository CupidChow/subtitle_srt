of Dayun County.

32
00:01:45,232 --> 00:01:46,031
Now, Dayun County

has developed well.

34
00:01:49,232 --> 00:01:50,232

By the way,

41
00:02:02,072 --> 00:02:03,871
didn't you stay longer
on your business trip?

42
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:04,632
No,

43
00:02:04,632 --> 00:02:05,671
I only cut the ribbon.

44
00:02:05,711 --> 00:02:06,671
It was a quick trip.

45
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:10,151
Don't watch the news.
I want to watch cartoons.

47
00:02:11,952 --> 00:02:12,831
do you have time now?

48
00:02:13,232 --> 00:02:14,431
I want to talk about

50
00:02:15,671 --> 00:02:16,431
Sure.

51
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:18,391
Talk over there.

54
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:24,151
I've told you many times

00:02:25,551 --> 00:02:26,551
it will damage your eyes.

- Ms. Sha, getting a perm?

61
00:02:44,752 --> 00:02:45,312
Yes.

62
00:02:46,312 --> 00:02:46,831
Yazhen,

63
00:02:47,312 --> 00:02:49,111
Qiao is quite popular now.

64
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:50,752
On TV,

65
00:02:50,792 --> 00:02:52,151
he spoke so eloquently,

66
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:54,352
even upstaging the county mayor!

67
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:56,551
Of course.

68
00:02:57,192 --> 00:02:58,352

be the merchant representative.

I had to do my best.

71
00:03:01,711 --> 00:03:02,232
Right?

72
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:04,391
No wonder you raised
such good daughters.

73
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:06,512
The younger one

74
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:07,192
is working now?

75
00:03:10,711 --> 00:03:11,671
What's the point?

76
00:03:12,632 --> 00:03:13,912
She never calls,

77
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,391
and only sends a text

78
00:03:15,952 --> 00:03:16,991
during holidays.

79
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:18,792
Lin is better.

80
00:03:19,111 --> 00:03:19,871
She stays

81
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:20,912
with us.

82
00:03:21,271 --> 00:03:23,151
She is our sweet daughter.

83
00:03:24,632 --> 00:03:24,991
Right.

84
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,032
Is Lin

85
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,072
about to marry soon?

86
00:03:27,912 --> 00:03:28,632
Very soon.

87

88
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,671

Beauty.

90
00:03:35,271 --> 00:03:36,752

91
00:03:36,831 --> 00:03:38,352
largest fertilizer factory.

92
00:03:39,111 --> 00:03:41,711

group purchase benefits.

93
00:03:44,352 --> 00:03:45,352
Add me on WeChat.

94
00:03:45,591 --> 00:03:46,591

95
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:47,192
I'll tell you.

96
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:49,032
Feel free to come

97
00:03:49,032 --> 00:03:50,151
to our counter.

98
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:51,352
Take this.

99
00:03:53,871 --> 00:03:55,032
You are so rigid.

100
00:03:55,032 --> 00:03:56,431
How can you make money?

101
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:58,831
Many salesgirls want my contact,

102
00:03:58,952 --> 00:03:59,871
yet they can't get it.

103
00:04:02,671 --> 00:04:04,072
Your hands are so fair.

104
00:04:05,151 --> 00:04:06,032
Are you insane?

105
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:08,391
I'll pick you up after work.

106
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:10,992
Are you insane?

107
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:12,351
You!

108
00:04:12,391 --> 00:04:13,031
Stop there!

109
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:15,271
Don't touch me.

110
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:16,432
Honey.

111
00:04:17,112 --> 00:04:17,992
She hit me!

112
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:19,192
Why did you hit him?

113
00:04:19,312 --> 00:04:20,231
Why did you hit me?

114
00:04:20,271 --> 00:04:21,391
You wretch!

115
00:04:21,432 --> 00:04:22,672
Are you insane?

116
00:04:22,711 --> 00:04:23,271
Let go of me!

117
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:23,952
What's going on?

118
00:04:23,952 --> 00:04:24,552
Let go of me!

119
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:25,791
Let go!

120
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:26,831
I'll report you!

121
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,904
(Police)

122
00:04:34,512 --> 00:04:34,952
Lin.

123
00:04:35,552 --> 00:04:35,872
Lin.

124
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:39,231
We agreed to discuss
the wedding at my place.

125
00:04:46,432 --> 00:04:47,031
Dad. Mom.

126
00:04:47,271 --> 00:04:47,992
We're back.

127
00:04:53,231 --> 00:04:54,031
Troublemaker.

128
00:04:54,391 --> 00:04:55,271
How dare you come!

129
00:04:55,591 --> 00:04:56,072
Auntie. I...

130
00:04:56,072 --> 00:04:56,512
Lin.

131
00:05:01,632 --> 00:05:02,072
Dad.

132
00:05:03,312 --> 00:05:03,752
Here.

133
00:05:04,432 --> 00:05:05,151
Have some fruits.

134
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:10,112
Dad.

135
00:05:10,512 --> 00:05:11,552
This is the money from you

136
00:05:11,632 --> 00:05:13,031
(Details of wedding costs)
and my mom for our marriage.

137
00:05:13,351 --> 00:05:15,072
Excluding the betrothal money
for Lin family,

138
00:05:15,312 --> 00:05:15,911
wedding rings,

139
00:05:16,112 --> 00:05:17,312
and other

140
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:18,312
expenses,

141
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:21,711
there is still 98,654 yuan.

142
00:05:22,192 --> 00:05:23,072
I'll ask one question.

143
00:05:23,672 --> 00:05:25,151
What about the cash gifts?

144
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:27,351
You'll have it.
Lin and I agreed on this.

145
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:32,591
Let me break it down.

146
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:36,031
The wedding photos cost

147
00:05:36,151 --> 00:05:37,271
9,588 yuan.

148
00:05:37,872 --> 00:05:38,872
I chose a moderately

149
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,112
priced wedding planner,

150
00:05:40,432 --> 00:05:41,432
costing 18,800 yuan.

151
00:05:42,151 --> 00:05:43,831
For accommodation
for out-of-town guests,

152
00:05:44,112 --> 00:05:45,271
I booked 20 standard rooms.

153
00:05:45,591 --> 00:05:47,552
Each room costs 288 yuan,

154
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:49,992
totaling 5,760 yuan.

155
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:51,552
About the return gifts,

156
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:52,591
we'll prepare them.

157
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:54,512
15,000 yuan should suffice.

158
00:05:54,872 --> 00:05:56,432
I booked 20 banquet tables.

159
00:05:56,632 --> 00:05:57,512
Each table costs

160
00:05:57,512 --> 00:05:58,672
1,288 yuan.

161
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:00,231
20 tables?

162
00:06:00,271 --> 00:06:01,391
That's not enough.

163
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:02,672
Mom.

164
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,512
Our bank has rules.

165
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,112
For weddings,
not more than 20 tables are allowed.

166
00:06:07,312 --> 00:06:07,992
No exceptions.

167
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:09,591
Otherwise, my superior and I

168
00:06:09,591 --> 00:06:10,591
would be affected.

169
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:12,391
Did your bank mention

170
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,351
if your fiancee frequently visiting

171
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:14,992
police stations

172
00:06:15,112 --> 00:06:16,192
would affect your career?

173
00:06:21,512 --> 00:06:21,791
Auntie.

174
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,031
Get straight to the point.

175
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:24,231
Stop being so sarcastic,

176
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:24,711
okay?

177
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,151
I'm being sarcastic?

178
00:06:27,432 --> 00:06:28,992
As a young woman,

179
00:06:29,351 --> 00:06:30,872
you always cause trouble.

180
00:06:31,752 --> 00:06:32,632
Why don't you

181
00:06:32,632 --> 00:06:33,872
think of the consequences?

182
00:06:34,231 --> 00:06:34,872
Do you live

183
00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:35,872
in the police station?

184
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,711
You go there many times a month!

185
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:39,791
Auntie.

186
00:06:40,031 --> 00:06:41,312
This wasn't my fault!

187
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:42,672
Today, that man

188
00:06:42,672 --> 00:06:43,791
harassed me first.

189
00:06:43,992 --> 00:06:44,471
Enough!

190
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:46,992
Be quiet.

191
00:06:49,112 --> 00:06:49,791
Qiao Lin.

192
00:06:50,351 --> 00:06:51,911
You're Lin Tao's fiancee.

193
00:06:52,872 --> 00:06:53,952
Our town is small.

194
00:06:54,432 --> 00:06:55,791
If you keep causing trouble

195
00:06:56,192 --> 00:06:57,151
and word gets out,

196
00:06:57,312 --> 00:06:58,831
it'll affect Tao's career.

197
00:06:59,112 --> 00:06:59,711
Understand?

198
00:07:00,151 --> 00:07:01,312
If his career gets affected,

199
00:07:01,711 --> 00:07:02,672
you'll be affected too.

200
00:07:02,992 --> 00:07:03,831
My son

201
00:07:04,112 --> 00:07:05,672
graduated from a top university

202
00:07:05,752 --> 00:07:06,872
with a master's degree.

203
00:07:07,271 --> 00:07:08,911
He's a bank client manager now,

204
00:07:09,072 --> 00:07:11,112
and will become a department head,

205
00:07:11,312 --> 00:07:13,072
branch manager, and even bank president!

206
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:14,711
Look at you.

207
00:07:14,952 --> 00:07:16,391
You're ruining my son's

208
00:07:16,432 --> 00:07:17,552
bright future!

209
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:18,831
We are to blame

210
00:07:18,911 --> 00:07:20,312
for accepting your marriage.

211
00:07:35,552 --> 00:07:39,911
Lin. I've calculated it.

212
00:07:40,151 --> 00:07:40,632
We still

213
00:07:40,632 --> 00:07:41,911
have 17,866 yuan.

214
00:07:42,151 --> 00:07:42,791
It's enough

215
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:43,591
for our honeymoon.

216
00:07:44,952 --> 00:07:45,752
Enjoy it yourself.

217
00:07:47,952 --> 00:07:48,432
Lin.

218
00:08:04,632 --> 00:08:11,072
(- What're you doing?)
(- At work. What's wrong?)

219
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:17,632
(Nothing.)

220
00:08:19,312 --> 00:08:20,471
(When will you come home?)

221
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:27,432
Lin.

222
00:08:27,631 --> 00:08:28,272
Have an apple.

223
00:08:28,392 --> 00:08:29,471
Thanks, Dad.

224
00:08:42,511 --> 00:08:42,991
Dad.

225
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:46,432
Have you used the betrothal money

226
00:08:46,432 --> 00:08:47,192
from Lin Tao?

227
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:48,511
Yes.

228
00:08:48,991 --> 00:08:50,231
We agreed to use

229
00:08:50,591 --> 00:08:52,991
the money for renovating the new store.

230
00:08:54,312 --> 00:08:55,471
After we sell the old store,

231
00:08:55,511 --> 00:08:56,672
we'll return it to you.

232
00:08:57,432 --> 00:08:57,991
What now?

233
00:08:58,552 --> 00:08:59,511
Did Lin Tao's parents

234
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:00,312
say anything?

235
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:01,711
Not exactly.

236
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:02,672
I'm Just asking.

237
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:05,552
How's your wedding

238
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:06,792
preparations going?

239
00:09:07,511 --> 00:09:08,631
He's been busy with work.

240
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:10,591
I've been busy lately too.

241
00:09:21,831 --> 00:09:22,231
Right.

242
00:09:23,111 --> 00:09:24,672
I need to go on a business trip soon.

243
00:09:25,552 --> 00:09:26,912
A study trip

244
00:09:26,912 --> 00:09:27,672
in Jingzhou.

245
00:09:28,392 --> 00:09:29,111
To Jingzhou?

246
00:09:30,471 --> 00:09:31,272
How long?

247
00:09:31,711 --> 00:09:32,672
Have you told Lin Tao?

248
00:09:33,432 --> 00:09:33,831
Not yet.

249
00:09:34,111 --> 00:09:34,432
Wait.

250
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:35,351
Lin.

251
00:09:35,432 --> 00:09:36,591
You should at least

252
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:38,471
inform Lin Tao about the trip.

253
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,552
Lin Tao is a key talent

254
00:09:40,552 --> 00:09:41,471
at the bank now.

255
00:09:41,471 --> 00:09:42,672
He has his pride.

256
00:09:43,032 --> 00:09:44,192
You need to get along well.

257
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:45,231
Exactly.

258
00:09:45,312 --> 00:09:46,792
You're about to get married.

259
00:09:46,952 --> 00:09:47,991
You should be considerate.

260
00:09:48,072 --> 00:09:48,591
Understand?

261
00:09:48,792 --> 00:09:49,591
You should

262
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:51,152
discuss everything with Lin Tao.

263
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:52,032
You hear me?

264
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:52,831
Yes.

265
00:09:53,231 --> 00:09:53,831
Right.

266
00:09:54,032 --> 00:09:55,192
You two should live

267
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:56,432
a peaceful life together.

268
00:09:56,831 --> 00:09:57,672
Just stay

269
00:09:57,672 --> 00:09:59,032
with us.

270
00:09:59,672 --> 00:10:00,792
Don't be like your sister.

271
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:01,711
This daughter

272
00:10:01,711 --> 00:10:02,711
is like she never exists.

♪I'll make you adore me,

The list and procedures
of the Family Feast

281
00:10:41,471 --> 00:10:42,591
need double-checking.

282
00:10:42,952 --> 00:10:44,312
Contact me immediately

283
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:45,392

284
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:46,351
Alright.

285
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:48,152
Yan.

286
00:10:48,591 --> 00:10:49,152
We have

287
00:10:49,152 --> 00:10:50,032
a gathering tonight.

288
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:50,672
Want to join us?

289
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,312
I'll pass.

290
00:10:52,511 --> 00:10:53,432
My boyfriend will come.

291
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:54,751
Boyfriend?

292
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:56,272
He is your fiance, right?

293
00:10:57,152 --> 00:10:58,432
Go home early tonight, alright?

294
00:10:58,711 --> 00:10:59,111
Okay.

295
00:10:59,432 --> 00:11:00,991
Have a good date tonight.

296
00:11:01,072 --> 00:11:01,631
I'm leaving.

297
00:11:15,272 --> 00:11:15,751
Yan.

298
00:11:17,032 --> 00:11:17,711
Qiao Yan!

299
00:11:23,312 --> 00:11:25,792
I am so lucky today, meeting you
right after work.

300
00:11:25,871 --> 00:11:26,351
Otherwise,

301
00:11:26,392 --> 00:11:27,231
I couldn't find you.

302
00:11:33,831 --> 00:11:36,192
- Why are you here?
- I called off the wedding.

303
00:11:37,312 --> 00:11:39,032
I'm now free from all worries,

304
00:11:39,351 --> 00:11:40,711
so I thought to try my luck

305
00:11:40,912 --> 00:11:41,751
in a big city.

306
00:11:42,272 --> 00:11:43,351
I haven't found a place.

307
00:11:43,511 --> 00:11:44,432
Can I go to your place?

308
00:11:50,591 --> 00:11:51,552
There's a cafe opposite.

309
00:11:52,072 --> 00:11:52,831
Let's talk there.

310
00:11:54,072 --> 00:11:54,711
Alright.

311
00:11:54,831 --> 00:11:55,952
No need for cafe.

312
00:11:55,991 --> 00:11:56,552
What a waste.

313
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:56,991
Let's go.

314
00:11:57,111 --> 00:11:57,751
We can talk

315
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,111
in your place.

316
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:08,312
Yan.

317
00:12:16,072 --> 00:12:16,831
Your boyfriend?

318
00:12:23,032 --> 00:12:24,152
My future brother-in-law?

319
00:12:24,192 --> 00:12:24,711
Hi.

320
00:12:27,392 --> 00:12:27,952
This is...

321
00:12:27,952 --> 00:12:28,231
I'm...

322
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:28,912
My cousin.

323
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:30,552
She came to me.

324
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:33,392
Hello.

325
00:12:34,192 --> 00:12:35,672
I'm picking her up for dinner.

326
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,511
Want to join us?

327
00:12:37,111 --> 00:12:38,111
She just arrived,

328
00:12:38,511 --> 00:12:39,272
and is a bit tired.

329
00:12:39,511 --> 00:12:40,272
I'll find a hotel

330
00:12:40,312 --> 00:12:41,072
to settle her in.

331
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:41,912
Alright.

332
00:12:42,672 --> 00:12:43,032
Alright.

333
00:12:44,032 --> 00:12:45,991
We can only
go to the restaurant another day.

334
00:12:46,152 --> 00:12:46,552
Okay?

335
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:46,991
Okay.

336
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,072
Go home then.

337
00:12:49,032 --> 00:12:49,591
I'll call you

338
00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:50,871
when I get home.

339
00:12:54,751 --> 00:12:55,152
Go.

340
00:12:56,272 --> 00:12:56,991
Bye then.

341
00:12:58,591 --> 00:12:59,072
Be careful.

342
00:12:59,192 --> 00:12:59,991
Drive safely.

343
00:13:24,912 --> 00:13:27,552
The place is great
with convenient transportation.

344
00:13:28,511 --> 00:13:30,552
Qiao Yan. Why did you say
I'm your cousin?

345
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,792
There's a refrigerator.
A convenience store is nearby.

346
00:13:34,831 --> 00:13:35,711
I can see it now.

347
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:36,792
Your boyfriend

348
00:13:36,831 --> 00:13:37,672
is well-off,

349
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:38,591
so you look down on

350
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:39,511
me, a loser,

351
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:39,912
right?

352
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:40,871
Go back soon.

353
00:13:41,511 --> 00:13:42,591
What do you mean?

354
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,231
You canceled the wedding,

355
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:46,552
and didn't tell our parents.

356
00:13:47,272 --> 00:13:48,392
They'll search for you.

357
00:13:49,672 --> 00:13:49,991
Right.

358
00:13:50,432 --> 00:13:51,392
After I get settled,

359
00:13:51,432 --> 00:13:52,392
I'll tell them then.

360
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:53,072
It's the same.

361
00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:54,751
Wait, get back to the point.

362
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:55,392
I'm asking you

363
00:13:55,511 --> 00:13:56,991
why you didn't tell your boyfriend

364
00:13:57,072 --> 00:13:58,312
I'm your elder sister.

365
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:16,111
Grandma and I share
a household registration.

366
00:14:16,631 --> 00:14:17,432
My surname is Xu,

367
00:14:18,351 --> 00:14:19,152
not Qiao.

368
00:14:20,032 --> 00:14:20,711
So,

369
00:14:20,751 --> 00:14:21,471
you should know

370
00:14:22,312 --> 00:14:23,072
my only family

371
00:14:23,351 --> 00:14:23,991
is Grandma.

372
00:14:26,272 --> 00:14:26,631
Right.

373
00:14:27,511 --> 00:14:28,552
I know you've never been

374
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:29,751
close with our parents.

375
00:14:30,111 --> 00:14:31,111
But I never thought

376
00:14:31,192 --> 00:14:31,912
we weren't family.

377
00:14:31,952 --> 00:14:32,672
Only you think so.

378
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:41,631
Qiao Lin.

379
00:14:42,072 --> 00:14:43,272
You came here

380
00:14:43,312 --> 00:14:44,111
without telling me.

381
00:14:45,231 --> 00:14:46,432
What I've done for you

382
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:49,351
is already more than enough.

383
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,312
Go home after running

384
00:14:50,511 --> 00:14:51,432
out of money.

385
00:14:51,912 --> 00:14:52,871
Don't make them worry.

386
00:14:55,072 --> 00:14:56,432
You can stay if you want,

387
00:14:59,111 --> 00:15:01,272
but I'm not obligated

388
00:15:01,312 --> 00:15:02,231
to take care of you.

389
00:15:04,231 --> 00:15:04,711
Qiao Yan.

390
00:15:04,952 --> 00:15:05,991
Had I known it,

391
00:15:06,032 --> 00:15:06,591
I would've

392
00:15:06,631 --> 00:15:07,432
never come to you.

393
00:15:07,432 --> 00:15:07,912
Understand?

394
00:15:13,751 --> 00:15:14,552
My surname is Xu.

395
00:15:15,392 --> 00:15:16,032
Xu Yan.

396
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,032
You are Qiao Yan.

397
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:22,272
You are Qiao Yan! Qiao...

398
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,034
(Transfer to Qiao Lin)

399
00:15:43,312 --> 00:15:44,831
(The price of your heartlessness.)

400
00:16:13,751 --> 00:16:14,471
So heartless!

401
00:16:16,152 --> 00:16:17,792
I shouldn't have saved you back then!

402
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:25,552
- Wild child!
- Wild child!

403
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:26,792
Wild child.

404
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:28,152
Wild child!

405
00:16:28,312 --> 00:16:29,312
- Wild child!
- Wild child!

406
00:16:29,351 --> 00:16:31,432
Move! Let me go home!

407
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:34,591
Qiao Yan, unwanted one.

408
00:16:34,751 --> 00:16:37,351
Wild child, without parents!

409
00:16:40,672 --> 00:16:43,032
How dare you push me?

410
00:16:44,152 --> 00:16:45,552
None of your business!

411
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,032
Who dares bully my sister?

412
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,312
Do you dare?

413
00:16:50,912 --> 00:16:52,511
- No.
- No.

414
00:16:57,152 --> 00:16:58,432
You're my sister now.

415
00:17:03,592 --> 00:17:04,271
Yan is old enough

416
00:17:04,311 --> 00:17:05,632
to start elementary school,

417
00:17:06,912 --> 00:17:08,471
and she must start studying.

418
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:10,991
You must find her

419
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,311
a primary school in the county.

420
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:13,912
All these years,

421
00:17:14,672 --> 00:17:15,832
as parents,

422
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:17,471
you've never fulfilled

423
00:17:17,551 --> 00:17:18,592
your responsibilities.

424
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:23,832
But regarding the school enrollment,

425
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:25,071
both of you must

426
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:26,271
make every effort

427
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,432
to make it right.

428
00:17:28,832 --> 00:17:30,112
Right, Mom.

429
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:31,672
We came here

430
00:17:31,872 --> 00:17:34,352
to take Yan back
for attending the school.

431
00:17:34,672 --> 00:17:35,632
All these years,

432
00:17:36,231 --> 00:17:37,751
you've been raising her alone,

433
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:39,912
and it's been hard.

434
00:17:40,112 --> 00:17:40,751
Enough!

435
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:41,991
Save your sweet talk.

436
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:43,071
Do you even know

437
00:17:43,672 --> 00:17:44,471
what Yan tells

438
00:17:44,511 --> 00:17:45,192
the neighborhood

439
00:17:45,352 --> 00:17:46,352
and kids?

440
00:17:47,471 --> 00:17:48,592
She says her parents

441
00:17:48,952 --> 00:17:49,751
are abroad.

442
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:51,471
How did such a young child

443
00:17:51,592 --> 00:17:53,231
learn to lie?

444
00:17:55,231 --> 00:17:56,791
After having Lin,

445
00:17:56,832 --> 00:17:58,751
you insisted on trying for a boy.

446
00:17:59,271 --> 00:18:00,352
You knew perfectly well

447
00:18:00,632 --> 00:18:01,991
Yazhen has poor health.

448
00:18:02,551 --> 00:18:03,152
These years

449
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,592
her health is completely ruined.

450
00:18:06,872 --> 00:18:08,192
Now you've got a girl,

451
00:18:08,311 --> 00:18:09,511
with congenital heart disease,

452
00:18:09,952 --> 00:18:11,432
and you don't like her.

453
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,791
Won't you even

454
00:18:12,832 --> 00:18:13,632
save her life?

455
00:18:14,112 --> 00:18:15,231
As parents,

456
00:18:15,471 --> 00:18:17,271
don't you feel any guilt?

457
00:18:20,231 --> 00:18:20,672
Mom.

458
00:18:21,912 --> 00:18:22,392
Mom.

459
00:18:22,432 --> 00:18:23,751
We know we were wrong.

460
00:18:24,592 --> 00:18:25,952
We will treat Yan well

461
00:18:25,991 --> 00:18:26,991
and make it up for her

462
00:18:27,872 --> 00:18:29,872
after taking her back.

463
00:18:29,991 --> 00:18:30,511
Mom.

464
00:18:39,672 --> 00:18:40,392
Be careful.

465
00:18:41,511 --> 00:18:41,991
Alright.

466
00:18:42,071 --> 00:18:42,592
We're home.

467
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:43,912
Come in.

468
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:46,912
This is Mom and Dad's home.

469
00:18:47,112 --> 00:18:48,511
From now on, it's yours too.

470
00:18:49,271 --> 00:18:49,952
From today on,

471
00:18:49,991 --> 00:18:50,791
share this room

472
00:18:50,832 --> 00:18:51,791
with your elder sister.

473
00:18:51,991 --> 00:18:52,632
Okay?

474
00:18:53,192 --> 00:18:54,231
I will bring in

475
00:18:54,271 --> 00:18:55,071
your luggage.

476
00:18:59,352 --> 00:19:00,751
I packed these pretty clothes

477
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,071
for you.

478
00:19:03,432 --> 00:19:04,672
At Mom and Dad's place,

479
00:19:04,952 --> 00:19:07,031
be sensible and obedient.

480
00:19:08,392 --> 00:19:09,471
Do things yourself

481
00:19:09,511 --> 00:19:10,592
whenever possible.

482
00:19:11,711 --> 00:19:13,311
I also packed these things you like

483
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:14,791
for you.

484
00:19:18,231 --> 00:19:19,311
At mealtimes,

485
00:19:19,632 --> 00:19:21,071
don't fight with your sister.

486
00:19:22,392 --> 00:19:22,952
Understand?

487
00:19:25,872 --> 00:19:27,551
I will miss you.

488
00:19:38,672 --> 00:19:39,392
Take a look.

489
00:19:40,071 --> 00:19:41,231
This is your home now.

490
00:19:44,031 --> 00:19:45,071
Alright, it's late.

491
00:19:45,432 --> 00:19:46,751
Let's bathe and sleep.

492
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:47,912
Come on, I will bathe you.

493
00:19:48,471 --> 00:19:50,352
Mom, I can bathe myself.

494
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,872
Alright.

495
00:19:54,632 --> 00:19:55,872
You can bathe yourself.

496
00:19:56,231 --> 00:19:56,832
Then,

497
00:19:56,952 --> 00:19:57,872
take off the clothes

498
00:19:57,912 --> 00:19:59,031
and I will wash them. Okay?

499
00:19:59,551 --> 00:20:01,711
Mom, I can wash my clothes.

500
00:20:55,311 --> 00:20:56,711
Why is the smell of gas so strong?

501
00:21:06,311 --> 00:21:06,791
Lin!

502
00:21:07,991 --> 00:21:08,471
Lin!

503
00:21:10,872 --> 00:21:11,352
Lin!

504
00:21:19,952 --> 00:21:21,751
Wake up! Don't scare me!

505
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:22,192
What?

506
00:21:22,192 --> 00:21:22,832
Help!

507
00:21:23,071 --> 00:21:23,872
Help! Help!

508
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,071
What's going on?

509
00:21:25,071 --> 00:21:25,952
Gas poisoning!

510
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:27,432
Lin, wake up!

511
00:21:27,672 --> 00:21:28,112
Lin!

512
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:29,592
Call the ambulance!

513
00:21:29,592 --> 00:21:30,791
Okay, stay calm.

514
00:21:30,952 --> 00:21:31,392
Lin!

515
00:21:31,392 --> 00:21:32,751
Wake up! Wake up!

516
00:21:32,872 --> 00:21:34,311
Don't scare me.

517
00:21:34,311 --> 00:21:34,791
Lin.

518
00:21:35,271 --> 00:21:36,751
Wake up, wake up. Lin!

519
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:37,751
Lin!

520
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:38,991
What's going on?

521
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:39,791
Qiao?

522
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:40,592
Lin has poisoned...

523
00:21:41,231 --> 00:21:42,192
Where have you been?

524
00:21:42,231 --> 00:21:43,672
You didn't turn off the gas.

525
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:44,392
Lin!

526
00:21:44,592 --> 00:21:45,551
Lin, are you okay?

527
00:21:45,592 --> 00:21:46,271
Stop shouting!

528
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:48,071
Go call an ambulance!

529
00:21:49,352 --> 00:21:49,872
Qiao!

530
00:21:50,432 --> 00:21:51,031
Where's Yan?

531
00:21:54,912 --> 00:21:55,432
Yan!

532
00:21:56,311 --> 00:21:57,271
Another one?

533
00:21:57,592 --> 00:21:58,152
Yan!

534
00:21:59,311 --> 00:21:59,872
Help out!

535
00:22:01,872 --> 00:22:02,991
It is all my fault.

536
00:22:03,311 --> 00:22:04,511
I'm so sorry.

537
00:22:04,672 --> 00:22:05,511
My daughter.

538
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:08,031
Here.

539
00:22:09,231 --> 00:22:09,952
Have a banana.

540
00:22:10,551 --> 00:22:11,711
Let Dad feed you.

541
00:22:12,751 --> 00:22:13,632
Open your mouth.

542
00:22:14,271 --> 00:22:16,071
One more bite. A big bite.

543
00:22:16,112 --> 00:22:16,672
Come on.

544
00:22:20,511 --> 00:22:21,071
Good girl.

545
00:22:21,511 --> 00:22:22,551
I will make you

546
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:23,872
your favorite braised pork.

547
00:22:24,192 --> 00:22:24,711
Okay?

548
00:22:28,272 --> 00:22:30,640
(Qiao Yan: 12 years old,
Qiao Lin: 14 years old)

549
00:22:39,352 --> 00:22:39,872
Yan!

550
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:40,952
Perfect timing.

551
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,551
Lin got into a fight.

552
00:22:42,711 --> 00:22:43,711
We need to go there.

553
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:45,152
You can have instant noodles.

554
00:22:45,952 --> 00:22:47,071
Qiao, hurry up!

555
00:22:49,311 --> 00:22:52,991
(Happy birthday)
♪Happy birthday to you♪

556
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:57,432
♪Happy birthday to you♪

557
00:22:58,152 --> 00:23:01,112
♪Happy birthday♪

558
00:23:06,112 --> 00:23:07,751
Yan? Is that you?

559
00:23:08,311 --> 00:23:09,471
Happy birthday.

560
00:23:09,912 --> 00:23:11,071
Grandma.

561
00:23:14,711 --> 00:23:16,392
Alright, don't cry.

562
00:23:16,991 --> 00:23:17,751
Come to my place.

563
00:23:17,991 --> 00:23:19,271
I'll make you delicious food.

564
00:23:19,872 --> 00:23:20,551
Okay?

565
00:23:29,952 --> 00:23:30,711
You are

566
00:23:31,112 --> 00:23:32,872
always getting into fights.

567
00:23:33,271 --> 00:23:34,711
You even fought with a boy!

568
00:23:37,432 --> 00:23:38,471
That's your classmate.

569
00:23:38,511 --> 00:23:39,872
What if you hurt him?

570
00:23:40,672 --> 00:23:41,112
See?

571
00:23:41,231 --> 00:23:41,952
The teacher

572
00:23:41,991 --> 00:23:42,912
always calls us in

573
00:23:43,432 --> 00:23:44,311
to apologize.

574
00:23:44,352 --> 00:23:44,952
Keep quiet.

575
00:23:45,751 --> 00:23:46,311
She's asleep.

576
00:23:47,672 --> 00:23:48,551
Compensate them,

577
00:23:48,952 --> 00:23:50,112
treat them meals,

578
00:23:50,912 --> 00:23:51,952
(Mom, Dad, I'm going to bed.)
and apologize!

579
00:23:51,952 --> 00:23:52,976
(I've eaten. Don't worry.)

580
00:23:53,152 --> 00:23:53,791
See?

581
00:23:54,271 --> 00:23:55,192
Yan is well-behaved.

582
00:23:55,471 --> 00:23:55,991
But you

583
00:23:56,071 --> 00:23:57,432
spend all day fighting,

584
00:23:57,551 --> 00:23:58,711
not giving us a break.

585
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:00,271
Mom, I'm hungry.

586
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:01,071
Alright.

587
00:24:01,112 --> 00:24:01,872
You're hungry.

588
00:24:02,071 --> 00:24:03,311
We're busy apologizing,

589
00:24:03,471 --> 00:24:04,392
and haven't eaten.

590
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:05,231
Here.

591
00:24:05,392 --> 00:24:06,311
I'll reheat this.

592
00:24:07,031 --> 00:24:07,471
Come here.

593
00:24:07,551 --> 00:24:08,711
What do you want? Noodles?

594
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:09,271
Okay.

595
00:24:09,471 --> 00:24:09,991
I'm hungry.

596
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:10,471
Take a bath.

597
00:24:10,471 --> 00:24:10,791
Mom.

598
00:24:10,912 --> 00:24:11,711
Eat after your bath.

599
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:12,672
I'm hungry.

600
00:24:16,592 --> 00:24:17,231
Bathe yourself.

601
00:24:18,912 --> 00:24:20,432
I need to wash these clothes.

602
00:24:20,471 --> 00:24:21,632
You need them tomorrow.

603
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:27,112
Wrap yourself up.

604
00:24:27,152 --> 00:24:27,991
Don't catch a cold.

605
00:24:37,751 --> 00:24:39,152
(Qiao Yan: 18 years old)
Qiao Yan obtained great scores

606
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:40,392
(Qiao Lin: 20 years old)
in recent mock exams.

607
00:24:40,592 --> 00:24:42,031
She's ranked top 30 in her grade.

608
00:24:42,551 --> 00:24:44,271
She can get into a top college
in Jingzhou.

609
00:24:45,031 --> 00:24:46,432
As for the major,

610
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:47,071
you should

611
00:24:47,071 --> 00:24:48,231
discuss it with her,

612
00:24:48,632 --> 00:24:49,751
and guide her.

613
00:24:53,912 --> 00:24:55,311
She can obtain

614
00:24:55,352 --> 00:24:56,352
such outstanding results,

615
00:24:56,751 --> 00:24:59,192
thanks to your dedicated guidance.

616
00:25:00,551 --> 00:25:03,912
But, she won't attend
the college entrance exam.

617
00:25:04,352 --> 00:25:05,912
We have other plans for her.

618
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:07,912
What?

619
00:25:09,392 --> 00:25:10,751
Given her academic performance,

620
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:12,751
it would be a pity.

621
00:25:13,551 --> 00:25:14,112
Have you

622
00:25:14,352 --> 00:25:15,471
discussed this with her?

623
00:25:16,192 --> 00:25:17,112
What does she think?

624
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:20,432
A child can't understand

625
00:25:20,471 --> 00:25:21,551
our family's hardships.

626
00:25:22,832 --> 00:25:23,632
I can decide this

627
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:24,991
for her.

628
00:25:27,271 --> 00:25:28,991
Why forbid me from attending the exam?

629
00:25:31,471 --> 00:25:32,832
I'm talking with your teacher.

630
00:25:32,952 --> 00:25:33,551
Why forbid me

631
00:25:33,592 --> 00:25:35,152
from attending the exam?

632
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:40,271
Because I'm your dad!

633
00:25:40,751 --> 00:25:42,071
I'm the head of our family!

634
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:46,071
Sorry, Miss.

635
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:46,551
Sorry

636
00:25:46,551 --> 00:25:47,511
for the embarrassment.

637
00:25:48,952 --> 00:25:50,152
This decision is final.

638
00:25:50,872 --> 00:25:51,432
Go home.

639
00:25:58,592 --> 00:26:00,791
Why won't you let me attend the college?

640
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,511
Dad!

641
00:26:02,592 --> 00:26:05,511
Why won't you let me attend the college?

642
00:26:09,751 --> 00:26:11,192
Dad, wait for me!

643
00:26:11,511 --> 00:26:12,751
Wait!

644
00:26:14,711 --> 00:26:16,432
Wait!

645
00:26:16,632 --> 00:26:18,511
Wait for me!

646
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:24,711
Why?

647
00:26:24,872 --> 00:26:25,791
Why?

648
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:27,192
Why?

649
00:26:27,952 --> 00:26:28,912
Why?

650
00:26:29,912 --> 00:26:31,152
Because we're poor.

651
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:32,952
Because the expenses

652
00:26:33,031 --> 00:26:33,872
for college are high,

653
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,991
and we can't support

654
00:26:34,991 --> 00:26:36,112
two college students.

655
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:37,432
So we choose

656
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:39,071
to let Lin go to college.

657
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:42,231
Dad, what about me?

658
00:26:44,392 --> 00:26:45,711
What about me?

659
00:26:48,912 --> 00:26:50,271
After you finish high school,

660
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:53,672
we'll help you find a job.

661
00:26:54,392 --> 00:26:56,392
This way, you can stay with us.

662
00:26:56,432 --> 00:26:58,672
And we can take care of you.

663
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:00,471
Wait.

664
00:27:01,192 --> 00:27:01,672
I...

665
00:27:02,392 --> 00:27:03,632
I want to know why...

666
00:27:06,231 --> 00:27:08,311
Why have you always been

667
00:27:08,352 --> 00:27:09,991
so biased all the time?

668
00:27:13,952 --> 00:27:17,471
Why does Qiao Lin
get all the good things?

669
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:19,271
Am I...

670
00:27:19,311 --> 00:27:21,632
Am I not your biological child?

671
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:26,711
Why do you always make me feel

672
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:29,192
that you don't love me?

673
00:27:32,592 --> 00:27:35,031
I thought if I kept lying to myself

674
00:27:35,231 --> 00:27:37,471
and kept studying hard,

675
00:27:37,511 --> 00:27:38,632
behaving well,

676
00:27:38,672 --> 00:27:39,952
and listening to you,

677
00:27:40,031 --> 00:27:42,152
you'd finally love me.

678
00:27:43,592 --> 00:27:47,551
Why can't I keep lying to myself now?

679
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:47,991
What...

680
00:27:49,352 --> 00:27:51,432
What have I ever wronged you?

681
00:27:51,872 --> 00:27:52,952
We've provided you

682
00:27:53,311 --> 00:27:55,392
everything you needed,

683
00:27:56,071 --> 00:27:58,112
so why can't you be considerate?

684
00:27:58,192 --> 00:27:59,991
You forbid me from attending the college

685
00:28:00,071 --> 00:28:02,311
without consulting me!

686
00:28:03,832 --> 00:28:05,711
What you're doing is theft!

687
00:28:06,432 --> 00:28:07,872
What you're doing is robbery!

688
00:28:07,872 --> 00:28:09,751
How dare you speak
to your dad like this!

689
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,152
So outrageous!

690
00:28:11,952 --> 00:28:14,912
You will only be an ungrateful child

691
00:28:15,031 --> 00:28:16,352
even with a college degree!

692
00:28:17,432 --> 00:28:19,592
How horrible am I?

693
00:28:23,432 --> 00:28:26,311
What terrible thing have I done?

694
00:28:28,231 --> 00:28:29,832
I don't understand.

695
00:28:32,551 --> 00:28:33,592
I don't understand

696
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:37,711
why you have to prove

697
00:28:37,952 --> 00:28:40,551
how much you don't love me.

698
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:42,112
Why?

699
00:28:42,392 --> 00:28:44,912
Why do I have to be your daughter?

700
00:29:53,832 --> 00:29:54,751
Grandma.

701
00:29:57,751 --> 00:29:58,551
Grandma.

702
00:29:58,672 --> 00:29:59,471
Coming.

703
00:30:02,311 --> 00:30:02,991
Yan.

704
00:30:03,872 --> 00:30:04,271
You...

705
00:30:05,031 --> 00:30:05,592
Grandma.

706
00:30:09,511 --> 00:30:10,352
I know

707
00:30:10,832 --> 00:30:11,952
you've been wronged.

708
00:30:15,192 --> 00:30:17,952
Look, you're all wet.

709
00:30:51,024 --> 00:30:52,929
(Incoming call from Shen Haoming)

710
00:31:00,912 --> 00:31:01,751
Hello, Haoming.

711
00:31:02,632 --> 00:31:06,192
- What are you doing?
- I'm on my way home.

712
00:31:07,352 --> 00:31:09,632
Can you come to my studio?

713
00:31:10,832 --> 00:31:11,471
Now?

714
00:31:12,152 --> 00:31:12,551
Yes.

715
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:13,271
Hurry.

716
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:14,231
Okay.

717
00:31:19,271 --> 00:31:20,511
Change the address, please.

718
00:31:29,952 --> 00:31:30,511
What's wrong?

719
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:40,192
A flower stalk has grown?

720
00:31:44,432 --> 00:31:45,711
This plant is sixty years old.

721
00:31:47,112 --> 00:31:48,071
I think

722
00:31:48,511 --> 00:31:49,432
tonight

723
00:31:49,592 --> 00:31:50,511
it will bloom.

724
00:31:52,432 --> 00:31:54,031
If it does bloom,

725
00:31:55,112 --> 00:31:56,832
this will undoubtedly be

726
00:31:56,872 --> 00:31:57,991
its most glorious moment.

727
00:31:58,952 --> 00:32:00,551
I want to witness this with you.

728
00:32:06,672 --> 00:32:08,672
I remember you once mentioned

729
00:32:09,672 --> 00:32:13,031
the agave only blooms
once in its lifetime.

730
00:32:14,912 --> 00:32:17,192
So after blooming,

731
00:32:18,832 --> 00:32:19,632
it will die.

732
00:32:23,592 --> 00:32:24,592
After blooming,

733
00:32:26,352 --> 00:32:28,031
it will wither rapidly

734
00:32:29,672 --> 00:32:30,592
and drain

735
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:32,432
until

736
00:32:33,112 --> 00:32:33,872
returning to dust.

737
00:32:35,832 --> 00:32:37,311
It has exhausted all the nutrients

738
00:32:37,432 --> 00:32:38,872
throughout its life

739
00:32:40,672 --> 00:32:41,832
and endured hardship

740
00:32:43,632 --> 00:32:45,551
just for this moment to bloom.

741
00:32:47,471 --> 00:32:48,311
This is truly

742
00:32:48,311 --> 00:32:49,311
its swan song.

743
00:32:57,192 --> 00:32:57,711
What's wrong?

744
00:33:00,031 --> 00:33:01,231
I just feel

745
00:33:03,112 --> 00:33:04,392
it is pitiful.

746
00:33:06,832 --> 00:33:08,952
Its whole life
is spent battling hardships,

747
00:33:08,991 --> 00:33:09,952
and growing tenaciously,

748
00:33:10,471 --> 00:33:12,031
just for a single moment to bloom.

749
00:33:15,751 --> 00:33:17,071
Because it has no choice.

750
00:33:20,471 --> 00:33:21,392
It must

751
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:22,632
stay stronger,

752
00:33:22,832 --> 00:33:23,551
work harder,

753
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:25,152
and endure more

754
00:33:26,952 --> 00:33:28,071
than others to achieve

755
00:33:28,152 --> 00:33:29,112
their beautiful endings.

756
00:33:30,031 --> 00:33:31,192
Waiting for long

757
00:33:32,071 --> 00:33:33,912
and suffering the torment

758
00:33:34,271 --> 00:33:35,791
are all the price it pays.

759
00:33:48,711 --> 00:33:50,192
Blossoming, fruiting,

760
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,672
aging, and being reborn

761
00:33:54,952 --> 00:33:55,952
happen in cycles.

762
00:33:56,711 --> 00:33:57,751
This is the law of nature.

763
00:33:59,551 --> 00:34:01,591
But when each agave

764
00:34:01,631 --> 00:34:02,671
blooms,

765
00:34:03,432 --> 00:34:04,111
its pollen

766
00:34:04,191 --> 00:34:05,912
scatters around,

767
00:34:07,151 --> 00:34:08,712
and meets another agave.

768
00:34:10,232 --> 00:34:11,631
They cross-pollinate

769
00:34:11,832 --> 00:34:13,752
and produce more seeds.

770
00:34:15,031 --> 00:34:16,031
These seeds

771
00:34:16,671 --> 00:34:17,511
become

772
00:34:17,511 --> 00:34:18,432
their legacy

773
00:34:18,872 --> 00:34:19,952
in this world,

774
00:34:20,872 --> 00:34:22,031
just like humans.

775
00:34:24,151 --> 00:34:24,792
Meeting,

776
00:34:25,471 --> 00:34:26,111
loving,

777
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:28,912
marrying, and having children.

778
00:34:30,511 --> 00:34:31,832
A century later,

779
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:33,952
though the people

780
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:34,991
may be gone,

781
00:34:36,511 --> 00:34:38,272
their love endures.

782
00:34:44,191 --> 00:34:46,191
When two agaves meet,

783
00:34:47,712 --> 00:34:48,872
they do everything

784
00:34:51,392 --> 00:34:52,551
for each other,

785
00:34:53,232 --> 00:34:54,712
even at the cost of their lives.

786
00:34:55,712 --> 00:34:56,912
Because they know

787
00:34:57,232 --> 00:34:57,952
their love

788
00:34:59,392 --> 00:34:59,912
is worth it.

789
00:35:00,792 --> 00:35:01,872
They never regret it.

790
00:35:02,671 --> 00:35:03,591
Just like you and me.

791
00:35:04,312 --> 00:35:05,272
Meeting you

792
00:35:07,752 --> 00:35:08,872
and being with you.

793
00:35:10,752 --> 00:35:11,631
No matter what price

794
00:35:11,671 --> 00:35:12,671
I must pay,

795
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:16,272
I will never

796
00:35:18,471 --> 00:35:19,471
regret it.

797
00:35:22,792 --> 00:35:23,272
And you?

798
00:35:25,551 --> 00:35:26,752
Think it carefully.

799
00:35:28,352 --> 00:35:29,912
I do regret...

800
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:36,912
I regret getting married next month.

801
00:35:37,832 --> 00:35:39,912
