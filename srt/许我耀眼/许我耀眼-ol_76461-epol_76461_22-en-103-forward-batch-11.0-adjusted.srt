Sorry!

Hit me!

It's all my fault.

Let go!

Let go!

Let go!

Let go!

00:02:13,122 --> 00:02:15,161
Actually, I have one more merit.

43
00:02:15,441 --> 00:02:16,881
I'm a sincere person,

44
00:02:17,122 --> 00:02:18,682
especially to relationships.

45
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:20,481
If one gives me a favor,

46
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:22,122
I'll repay him tenfold.

47
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,282
- Mr. Liang.
- I...

48
00:02:23,522 --> 00:02:24,641
You really have many merits.

49
00:02:25,601 --> 00:02:26,161
I'm home.

50
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:27,242
Go to bed early.

51
00:02:27,282 --> 00:02:27,802
Thank you.

52
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:28,641
Xu Yan.

53
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:30,522
I really enjoy

54
00:02:30,522 --> 00:02:31,802
spending time alone with you.

55
00:02:32,522 --> 00:02:34,122
This feeling is unprecedented.

56
00:02:37,802 --> 00:02:40,641
Yuanhang has many projects,

57
00:02:41,682 --> 00:02:44,041
yet you still put effort in Yan Studio.

58
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,321
I really appreciate it.

59
00:02:46,962 --> 00:02:48,402
So I want to find an opportunity

60
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:49,562
to express my gratitude.

61
00:02:50,402 --> 00:02:51,362
Today,

62
00:02:51,362 --> 00:02:52,402
I can let you feel relaxed

63
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:53,721
despite your busy schedule.

64
00:02:54,402 --> 00:02:55,362
It makes me happy too.

65
00:02:58,002 --> 00:02:59,161
In that case,

66
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:01,082
we can only talk

67
00:03:01,082 --> 00:03:02,201
about work in the future?

68
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:02,881
Exactly.

69
00:03:14,282 --> 00:03:15,201
Don't be alert.

70
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:17,201
I'm truly single.

71
00:03:19,201 --> 00:03:20,481
But I'm still married.

72
00:03:25,962 --> 00:03:27,002
But I think

73
00:03:27,002 --> 00:03:28,962
there's a huge problem

74
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,441
between you and Shen Haoming.

75
00:03:31,321 --> 00:03:32,362
You're aware of this too.

76
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:35,641
Between him and me,

77
00:03:35,641 --> 00:03:37,282
there is indeed a problem to resolve.

78
00:03:37,321 --> 00:03:38,761
But that doesn't mean

79
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:40,562
I can accept another man.

80
00:03:42,321 --> 00:03:42,842
Mr. Liang.

81
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:45,441
Thank you

82
00:03:45,441 --> 00:03:47,522
for sharing
your cinematic world with me.

83
00:03:48,321 --> 00:03:49,402
I can tell

84
00:03:49,402 --> 00:03:52,481
you're someone really romantic,

85
00:03:54,282 --> 00:03:56,082
and never lonely.

86
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,122
But in my mind,

87
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,802
you're an excellent investor.

88
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:04,881
I don't want

89
00:04:05,002 --> 00:04:06,881
any emotional entanglement

90
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:08,481
to affect our current

91
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:09,962
professional partnership.

92
00:04:10,282 --> 00:04:11,002
What do you think?

93
00:04:11,842 --> 00:04:12,562
I understand.

94
00:04:14,002 --> 00:04:15,962
If a woman rejects a man,

95
00:04:16,682 --> 00:04:18,402
it means the man
hasn't done well enough.

96
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:20,601
I'll take your advice.

97
00:04:22,402 --> 00:04:23,881
I'll focus on being the investor.

98
00:04:25,242 --> 00:04:26,041
I believe

99
00:04:26,962 --> 00:04:29,562
the trust and mutual understanding
built in business

100
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:31,722
will foster more genuine feelings.

101
00:04:32,362 --> 00:04:32,802
Alright.

102
00:04:33,162 --> 00:04:33,641
Bye then.

103
00:04:34,682 --> 00:04:35,201
Yan.

104
00:04:44,002 --> 00:04:45,122
Why do you come back alone?

105
00:04:45,722 --> 00:04:46,641
You should've told me,

106
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:48,042
and I would pick you up.

107
00:04:49,521 --> 00:04:50,362
I brought her home.

108
00:04:54,242 --> 00:04:55,042
Thank you.

109
00:04:56,201 --> 00:04:57,521
After working hard,

110
00:04:57,682 --> 00:04:59,961
you still help me send my wife home.

111
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:01,002
It's okay.

112
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:03,881
Ms. Xu has moved out.

113
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:06,722
Now you have to shuttle between places.

114
00:05:07,482 --> 00:05:08,521
She's that kind of person.

115
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:10,881
Once she makes up her mind,

116
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:13,081
she'll be devoted to it.

117
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:14,841
It's late now.

118
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:17,401
I won't invite you to my home then.

119
00:05:17,521 --> 00:05:17,961
No need.

120
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:20,242
Ms. Xu and I will meet again tomorrow.

121
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:22,281
You know, collaboration.

122
00:05:22,602 --> 00:05:23,441
We have to meet.

123
00:05:23,841 --> 00:05:24,362
I'm leaving.

124
00:05:24,362 --> 00:05:25,362
Looks like rain's coming.

125
00:05:25,521 --> 00:05:25,922
Bye.

126
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:26,641
See you.

127
00:05:26,881 --> 00:05:27,682
Let me tell you.

128
00:05:28,722 --> 00:05:31,242
You're already a notorious playboy.

129
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:34,321
Don't try to be a homewrecker now.

130
00:05:37,362 --> 00:05:37,841
Yan.

131
00:06:06,841 --> 00:06:07,641
What do you want?

132
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,881
I'm quite happy today.

133
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:10,922
Does that involve me?

134
00:06:18,802 --> 00:06:20,482
I heard you rejected Jiang Liang.

135
00:06:21,162 --> 00:06:21,881
You even told him

136
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,521
our problem could be resolved.

137
00:06:24,002 --> 00:06:24,922
Of course.

138
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:26,562
With a divorce.

139
00:06:37,162 --> 00:06:37,881
Shen Haoming.

140
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:42,521
Our marriage started without dignity.

141
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:44,841
Just take what we need.

142
00:06:46,081 --> 00:06:48,441
Now I just want us to part peacefully.

143
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:50,881
Don't worry.

144
00:06:51,641 --> 00:06:52,881
I promised your parents

145
00:06:54,802 --> 00:06:56,401
to minimize public fallout.

146
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:58,521
I'll keep my word.

147
00:06:59,881 --> 00:07:00,961
I just want us

148
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:03,722
to smoothly obtain
the divorce certificate

149
00:07:03,722 --> 00:07:04,841
in our second attempt.

150
00:07:06,242 --> 00:07:07,081
Please cooperate.

151
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:17,362
Remove your hand.

152
00:07:29,881 --> 00:07:31,162
Stop taking up the elevator.

153
00:07:52,362 --> 00:07:52,961
You're back.

154
00:07:53,362 --> 00:07:53,961
You're here.

155
00:07:54,722 --> 00:07:56,682
Got off work early
and help you clean up.

156
00:07:57,122 --> 00:07:58,122
I cut some fruits.

157
00:07:58,122 --> 00:07:58,841
Have some.

158
00:07:59,802 --> 00:08:00,321
Thanks.

159
00:08:02,242 --> 00:08:03,321
I saw from the balcony

160
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:04,802
you returning with Jiang Liang.

161
00:08:05,002 --> 00:08:06,521
You're getting close lately.

162
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:09,281
Not really, just for work.

163
00:08:10,802 --> 00:08:11,242
So,

164
00:08:11,482 --> 00:08:12,641
you feel nothing about him?

165
00:08:12,641 --> 00:08:13,281
Nothing.

166
00:08:33,242 --> 00:08:35,162
What about you and Shen Haoming?

167
00:08:37,602 --> 00:08:38,562
At the resort,

168
00:08:38,562 --> 00:08:39,761
something happened, right?

169
00:08:40,602 --> 00:08:42,281
You're quite nosy.

170
00:08:45,161 --> 00:08:46,561
You and Shen Haoming

171
00:08:46,561 --> 00:08:48,082
are finalizing the divorce,

172
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,521
but I know

173
00:08:49,801 --> 00:08:52,401
you wanted to form a family with him.

174
00:08:53,842 --> 00:08:54,962
You loved him so much,

175
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:56,921
and now you're parting.

176
00:08:57,082 --> 00:08:58,242
You must be sad.

177
00:08:58,281 --> 00:09:00,681
All my focus and energy now

178
00:09:01,122 --> 00:09:02,122
are on work.

179
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:03,561
No time for others.

180
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:06,082
It's good to focus on work,

181
00:09:06,482 --> 00:09:07,521
but I believe

182
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:09,842
even decisive people get confused

183
00:09:09,921 --> 00:09:11,801
and don't know what to do sometimes.

184
00:09:12,921 --> 00:09:13,842
So I think

185
00:09:14,602 --> 00:09:16,041
you'd better think carefully

186
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,561
and clarify your feelings

187
00:09:17,602 --> 00:09:18,521
before deciding.

188
00:09:18,602 --> 00:09:19,561
Strawberries are good.

189
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:20,082
Try one.

190
00:09:20,242 --> 00:09:21,281
I know they're sweet.

191
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:22,881
Am I right?

192
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,082
You're quite right.

193
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:31,202
You mentioned

194
00:09:31,202 --> 00:09:32,561
the peach blossom makeup concept.

195
00:09:33,002 --> 00:09:33,962
What about the plan?

196
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:35,161
Moreover,

197
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:36,482
want two assistants,

198
00:09:36,482 --> 00:09:37,002
right?

199
00:09:37,242 --> 00:09:38,122
How's that going?

200
00:09:38,322 --> 00:09:39,362
They are indeed sweet.

201
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:39,842
I'm leaving.

202
00:09:39,842 --> 00:09:40,881
Check the resumes.

203
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:43,401
What about your college exams?

204
00:09:43,521 --> 00:09:43,801
Right.

205
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:45,002
Two subjects, right?

206
00:09:45,482 --> 00:09:46,761

Why are you still here?

244
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:44,801
Get out now!

245
00:12:46,921 --> 00:12:48,761
Look at what you have become.

246
00:12:49,281 --> 00:12:50,602
Learn to love yourself

247
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:51,561
before loving others.

248
00:12:52,881 --> 00:12:54,362
Be an independent woman

249
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:55,681
who stays clear-headed.

and courage to walk away anytime.

253
00:13:01,962 --> 00:13:03,801
Be a relaxed and independent woman.

254
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,161
Live for yourself.

255
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:09,962
If I can't be with Haoming,

256
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:14,921
I'd rather stay single forever.

257
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,401
Stay single forever?

258
00:13:20,281 --> 00:13:21,962
I thought about this before.

259
00:13:23,401 --> 00:13:24,122
Let me show you.

260
00:13:26,442 --> 00:13:27,322
When we get old,

261
00:13:27,962 --> 00:13:30,281
we could find a premium nursing home.

262
00:13:32,002 --> 00:13:32,482
And then,

263
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,161
we could take art and music classes.

264
00:13:35,761 --> 00:13:36,681
When we get bored,

265
00:13:36,962 --> 00:13:38,401
go sing karaoke, or dance.

266
00:13:38,641 --> 00:13:39,202
Interesting?

267
00:13:40,482 --> 00:13:41,442
Here, look.

268
00:13:43,202 --> 00:13:44,521
This one is run by my friend.

269
00:13:44,842 --> 00:13:45,681
Go visit sometime?

270
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,202
Are you insane?

271
00:13:54,842 --> 00:13:56,561
Who would be in a nursing home with you?

272
00:13:59,082 --> 00:13:59,561
Let go!

273
00:13:59,761 --> 00:14:00,482
Let go of me!

274
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:28,521
Thinking?

275
00:14:29,761 --> 00:14:30,681
All these years,

276
00:14:31,401 --> 00:14:33,082
you've been chasing Shen Haoming,

277
00:14:33,602 --> 00:14:35,161
yet he married someone else,

278
00:14:35,881 --> 00:14:37,322
didn't even care about you.

279
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:40,761
If there's a chance to ruin him,

280
00:14:42,242 --> 00:14:43,242
are you interested?

281
00:14:48,161 --> 00:14:50,002
Why suggest that?

282
00:14:58,082 --> 00:14:58,842
Because of you.

283
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:01,161
I don't want

284
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,122
you sinking deeper into darkness.

286
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:20,962
Still haven't eaten at this hour?

287
00:15:21,842 --> 00:15:23,122
Mr. Shen is out.

288
00:15:23,242 --> 00:15:25,082
He told me to put this in his office.

289
00:15:26,681 --> 00:15:27,242
I'm going.

290
00:15:27,242 --> 00:15:28,041
Want my help?

291
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:30,442
Well,

292
00:15:30,962 --> 00:15:31,602
thanks then.

293
00:15:32,362 --> 00:15:33,202
No need.

294
00:15:33,401 --> 00:15:34,041
Go eat now.

(Yan Studio)

298
00:16:11,281 --> 00:16:12,242
As you can see,

299
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:13,641
our first batch of videos

300
00:16:14,442 --> 00:16:15,602
exceeds 10,000 views each.

301
00:16:16,122 --> 00:16:17,281
The top video

302
00:16:17,281 --> 00:16:18,681
even surpasses 60,000 clicks.

303
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:20,881
Therefore, I think we can move on

304
00:16:20,881 --> 00:16:22,161
to production phase.

305
00:16:22,602 --> 00:16:23,362
Fantastic!

306
00:16:23,362 --> 00:16:25,122
Finally reaching phase two.

307
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:26,881
Okay.

308
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:28,962
Today's meeting is

309
00:16:28,962 --> 00:16:30,281
to finalize first collection

310
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,602
and production quantities.

311
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:37,041
I've compiled all sample video metrics

312
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,041
for review.

313
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,881
These five pieces
received the most likes

314
00:16:39,881 --> 00:16:41,242
and the highest engagement.

315
00:16:41,681 --> 00:16:43,401
And the highest number
of positive reviews.

316
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:44,641
In my opinion,

317
00:16:44,641 --> 00:16:46,362
sometimes we have to trust the netizens.

318
00:16:46,842 --> 00:16:48,362
Their taste is as good as mine.

319
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,281
I also think they are the best.

320
00:16:51,161 --> 00:16:53,281
Let me share a different perspective.

321
00:16:53,921 --> 00:16:55,842
The biggest highlight
of these five pieces

322
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,962
is that they all use brocade fabric.

323
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:01,002
But this also is
their biggest challenge.

324
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,281
Because this brocade fabric

325
00:17:02,281 --> 00:17:05,161
is handwoven by ethnic minorities.

326
00:17:05,362 --> 00:17:06,761
So, it showcases

327
00:17:06,761 --> 00:17:09,082
such intricate craftsmanship
and exquisite texture.

328
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:13,641
However, their output
is extremely limited.

329
00:17:14,482 --> 00:17:15,162
Well,

330
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:17,041
should we first set up a cooperation

331
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,442
with the producers?

332
00:17:19,841 --> 00:17:21,642
But hand-weaving is always

333
00:17:21,682 --> 00:17:23,361
slower compared to machinery.

334
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,922
What if they can't meet our demand?

335
00:17:26,722 --> 00:17:29,081
I've thought about this before.

336
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,402
But we're still in the early phase,

337
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:35,561
so a small-batch
yet high-quality approach

338
00:17:35,561 --> 00:17:36,561
suits us better.

339
00:17:36,841 --> 00:17:37,442
Financially,

340
00:17:37,442 --> 00:17:39,002
it's safer and more secure.

341
00:17:40,202 --> 00:17:41,041
For the first batch,

342
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,536
I want us to focus on

343
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:43,601
excellence,

344
00:17:43,761 --> 00:17:44,361
precision,

345
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:45,642
and reputation.

346
00:17:46,561 --> 00:17:48,281
As for what Yao mentioned,

347
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:50,321
we can transform

348
00:17:50,482 --> 00:17:51,962
the challenge of brocade production

349
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:55,841
into online marketing
advantages and highlights.

350
00:17:56,882 --> 00:17:58,002
Many niche designer brands

351
00:17:58,002 --> 00:17:59,321
are now adopting

352
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:00,722
a limited edition

353
00:18:00,722 --> 00:18:01,841
plus pre-sale model.

354
00:18:01,922 --> 00:18:03,281
We can consider this approach too.

355
00:18:04,722 --> 00:18:07,442
For the five styles for the first batch,
100 pieces each.

356
00:18:07,601 --> 00:18:09,081
If we can achieve this,

357
00:18:09,642 --> 00:18:11,081
it could be a success.

358
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:16,402
Xiaowan,

359
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,482
any ideas for online promotion?

360
00:18:19,202 --> 00:18:21,761
We could organize
reward-based activities

361
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:22,722
to extend the timeline.

362
00:18:22,761 --> 00:18:25,121
This would buy us time for production.

363
00:18:27,242 --> 00:18:29,002
Any other problem to discuss?

364
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:31,041
Based on Wan's plan,

365
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,922
I'll recruit more influencers

366
00:18:32,962 --> 00:18:34,242
to promote us.

367
00:18:34,521 --> 00:18:36,081
Regarding the fees

368
00:18:36,242 --> 00:18:37,801
for these influencers,

369
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:39,081
could you give me an estimate?

370
00:18:39,242 --> 00:18:39,521
Sure.

371
00:18:39,561 --> 00:18:40,361
I'll send it to you.

372
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:41,002
Good.

373
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,841
I can reach out to bloggers,

374
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:47,121
offer them free makeup services,

375
00:18:47,121 --> 00:18:48,962
and let them wear our outfits in posts.

376
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,162
That should help, right?

377
00:18:57,121 --> 00:18:58,202
Why did you ask to meet?

378
00:18:58,722 --> 00:18:59,962
Can't I just want to see you?

379
00:19:00,202 --> 00:19:01,561
Join me for afternoon tea?

380
00:19:02,002 --> 00:19:02,922
Sure.

381
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:05,801
How have you been?

382
00:19:06,442 --> 00:19:07,642
Haven't seen you in days.

383
00:19:08,162 --> 00:19:09,442
Focus on work

384
00:19:09,442 --> 00:19:11,442
or on someone?

385
00:19:14,882 --> 00:19:16,841
No one understands me like you do.

386
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:18,402
Same old me.

387
00:19:19,321 --> 00:19:22,242
I can't stand seeing
female friends suffering,

388
00:19:22,242 --> 00:19:23,561
so I have to help them.

389
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:24,682
What can I do?

390
00:19:25,402 --> 00:19:28,521
There are too many female friends
you want to help.

391
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:30,482
Which one this time?

392
00:19:32,482 --> 00:19:32,962
Xu Yan.

393
00:19:35,722 --> 00:19:36,601
Xu Yan?

394
00:19:40,642 --> 00:19:41,801
Are you out of your mind?

395
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,962
Xu Yan is Shen Haoming's wife.

396
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:46,521
We're in the negotiation.

397
00:19:48,002 --> 00:19:49,002
So what?

398
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,521
I'm her investor.

399
00:19:50,962 --> 00:19:51,561
Besides,

400
00:19:51,561 --> 00:19:52,482
heard the rumors?

401
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,521
They're getting divorced.

402
00:19:53,601 --> 00:19:54,801
I don't care about rumors.

403
00:19:55,442 --> 00:19:57,442
But I don't want you to help her.

404
00:20:07,242 --> 00:20:07,962
Haochen.

405
00:20:09,321 --> 00:20:10,402
What is it, Coach Lu?

406
00:20:10,682 --> 00:20:11,722
I want to recommend you

407
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:13,922
for this year's
Junior Equestrian Championship.

408
00:20:14,521 --> 00:20:15,121
However,

409
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:16,841
we need to consult
your family's opinions.

410
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,281
Have your family come over

411
00:20:19,162 --> 00:20:21,682
to discuss your training schedule
for the second half.

412
00:20:22,761 --> 00:20:24,361
Just call my sister-in-law.

413
00:20:24,442 --> 00:20:25,922
She handles all my affairs.

414
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:26,682
Alright.

415
00:20:26,882 --> 00:20:27,841
I'll contact her.

416
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:33,002
Haoming.

417
00:20:33,202 --> 00:20:34,041
Come here.

418
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:35,761
I've got amazing news!

419
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,642
If you want to join the championship,

420
00:20:37,642 --> 00:20:40,361
the technical difficulty and
training intensity will both increase.

421
00:20:40,361 --> 00:20:41,922
Haochen is very interested himself.

422
00:20:42,162 --> 00:20:44,321
I wonder what you two think.

423
00:20:47,521 --> 00:20:48,922
Haochen has trained for four years.

424
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:50,841
If he's interested,

425
00:20:51,081 --> 00:20:52,321
I'll definitely support him.

426
00:20:56,801 --> 00:20:58,202
Honey, what do you think?

427
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:06,482
Coach Lu,

428
00:21:07,402 --> 00:21:08,761
Haochen's records show

429
00:21:08,761 --> 00:21:10,521
he's completed
over 350 training sessions.

430
00:21:13,281 --> 00:21:14,722
If he wants to participate,

431
00:21:14,722 --> 00:21:15,962
we'll definitely support him.

432
00:21:17,682 --> 00:21:18,841
But I have one question.

433
00:21:19,242 --> 00:21:20,561
He's nearly 160 cm tall.

434
00:21:21,482 --> 00:21:23,242
His current horse might be too small.

435
00:21:23,841 --> 00:21:25,002
If it's too small,

436
00:21:25,162 --> 00:21:26,801
jumping obstacles could be dangerous.

437
00:21:29,281 --> 00:21:29,722
Yes.

438
00:21:29,882 --> 00:21:30,682
For the competition,

439
00:21:30,682 --> 00:21:32,801
we'll adjust equipment to his height.

440
00:21:33,361 --> 00:21:34,242
Glad to hear that.

441
00:21:34,321 --> 00:21:34,642
Okay.

442
00:21:35,242 --> 00:21:37,482
I'll start working on the registration.

443
00:21:38,321 --> 00:21:38,882
Thank you.

444
00:21:39,682 --> 00:21:40,242
- Thanks.
- Not at all.

445
00:21:40,242 --> 00:21:40,801
Thank you.

446
00:21:47,242 --> 00:21:48,081
Call me anytime.

447
00:21:48,242 --> 00:21:48,761
I'm leaving.

448
00:21:50,121 --> 00:21:51,002
Wait!

449
00:21:53,682 --> 00:21:54,361
Well,

450
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,922
the fresh juices here are tasty.

451
00:21:56,922 --> 00:21:57,841
Want to try some?

452
00:21:59,402 --> 00:21:59,801
Sure!

453
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:00,801
I'll go get you some.

454
00:22:01,081 --> 00:22:02,002
Wait for me!

455
00:22:10,561 --> 00:22:11,922
The juice here is pretty good.

456
00:22:14,442 --> 00:22:15,162
I know.

457
00:22:30,722 --> 00:22:31,561
Sit down and wait?

458
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:43,162
Please tell Haochen

459
00:22:43,841 --> 00:22:45,002
I need to leave now.

460
00:22:45,801 --> 00:22:47,561
I left a meeting halfway to come here.

461
00:22:48,682 --> 00:22:49,081
Okay.

462
00:22:49,761 --> 00:22:50,361
Thanks.

463
00:23:07,601 --> 00:23:08,202
Where's she?

464
00:23:08,841 --> 00:23:10,002
She had work to attend to

465
00:23:10,801 --> 00:23:11,281
and left.

466
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,482
Why are you still sitting here?

467
00:23:14,242 --> 00:23:15,041
Oh my!

468
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:19,202
You're driving me crazy!

469
00:23:19,442 --> 00:23:21,281
Even I know

470
00:23:21,361 --> 00:23:22,722
you should fix your mistakes.

471
00:23:22,962 --> 00:23:24,841
You made her mad,

472
00:23:24,922 --> 00:23:26,002
and now she's ignoring you.

473
00:23:26,002 --> 00:23:27,402
You need to do something!

474
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,081
Yan has been sincere

475
00:23:32,722 --> 00:23:34,041
to Haochen.

476
00:23:35,402 --> 00:23:36,281
After all,

477
00:23:36,962 --> 00:23:38,361
it's all for you.

478
00:23:39,601 --> 00:23:41,081
Otherwise, to her,

479
00:23:41,442 --> 00:23:43,281
Haochen is just some random child.

480
00:23:46,561 --> 00:23:48,121
She's always adored Haochen.

481
00:23:48,922 --> 00:23:49,922
Why involves me?

482
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:51,482
Of course, it involves you.

483
00:23:51,761 --> 00:23:53,002
"Love me, love my dog."

484
00:23:53,722 --> 00:23:55,561
She loves you,

485
00:23:56,002 --> 00:23:58,121
so she values our family.

486
00:23:59,202 --> 00:24:00,642
After you two married,

487
00:24:01,121 --> 00:24:02,081
she's treated me,

488
00:24:02,561 --> 00:24:03,321
your father,

489
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:04,121
and Haochen

490
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:05,642
with sincerity.

491
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:08,601
Her care has always been tangible.

492
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,841
And I truly felt it.

493
00:24:13,761 --> 00:24:16,321
After decades in business,

494
00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:19,601
I've encountered all types of people.

495
00:24:20,962 --> 00:24:22,442
But when Yan looks at you,

496
00:24:23,081 --> 00:24:26,321
I can tell how deeply she loves you.

497
00:24:29,442 --> 00:24:30,801
Actually,

498
00:24:30,962 --> 00:24:32,402
it's part of my fault that you two

499
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:34,442
are getting divorce now.

500
00:24:36,841 --> 00:24:37,922
From the start,

501
00:24:38,202 --> 00:24:40,521
I wanted you to marry someone matched

502
00:24:41,402 --> 00:24:43,601
so I was harsh to Yan,

503
00:24:44,402 --> 00:24:45,642
and tried every mean

504
00:24:45,761 --> 00:24:46,801
to drive her away.

505
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,002
I deeply regret that now.

506
00:24:52,002 --> 00:24:53,801
Had I not done those,

507
00:24:54,482 --> 00:24:56,642
she wouldn't have lied
about her family backgrounds

508
00:24:57,482 --> 00:24:59,242
to prove herself.

509
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:03,722
I've no right

510
00:25:04,121 --> 00:25:05,361
to blame her for deceiving me.

511
00:25:07,162 --> 00:25:08,081
From the beginning,

512
00:25:09,162 --> 00:25:10,041
I'd already decided

513
00:25:10,882 --> 00:25:12,801
to hide Haochen's background.

514
00:25:15,801 --> 00:25:18,041
Now that you've talked things through,

515
00:25:18,482 --> 00:25:20,922
I think you may get back together.

516
00:25:23,202 --> 00:25:23,801
Haoming.

517
00:25:25,321 --> 00:25:26,242
I truly cherish Yan

518
00:25:26,242 --> 00:25:27,242
as my daughter-in-law.

519
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:32,482
She reminds me of my younger self.

520
00:25:33,882 --> 00:25:34,882
Driven,

521
00:25:35,561 --> 00:25:37,121
hardworking,

522
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:39,321
able to handle both society

523
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:41,081
and hard labor.

524
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,041
When she did supermarket live streams,

525
00:25:44,841 --> 00:25:45,761
she swallowed her pride

526
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:47,002
and standing on her own.

527
00:25:47,761 --> 00:25:49,321
She made no excuses

528
00:25:49,321 --> 00:25:50,882
for her mistakes,

529
00:25:51,601 --> 00:25:53,041
but fight for what she wanted

530
00:25:53,321 --> 00:25:55,162
through sheer determination.

531
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:58,242
That's when I knew

532
00:25:59,002 --> 00:26:01,561
she was meant to be
the hostess of Shen Family.

533
00:26:02,321 --> 00:26:03,121
Just like you,

534
00:26:05,761 --> 00:26:07,761
she's a pillar of our family.

535
00:26:08,482 --> 00:26:09,321
Promise me.

536
00:26:10,081 --> 00:26:11,642
No matter what it takes,

537
00:26:12,482 --> 00:26:14,081
bring Yan back.

538
00:26:16,081 --> 00:26:17,242
When I married her,

539
00:26:18,761 --> 00:26:20,361
I vowed to never let go.

540
00:26:23,722 --> 00:26:24,561
You can do this.

541
00:26:41,402 --> 00:26:41,801
Come on.

542
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:42,561
Good job.

543
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:43,922
That's it for today.

544
00:26:46,281 --> 00:26:46,801
Lin.

545
00:26:46,922 --> 00:26:48,041
I'll book you again.

546
00:26:48,402 --> 00:26:48,922
Thank you.

547
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:50,801
See you Friday.

548
00:26:50,841 --> 00:26:51,121
Got it.

549
00:26:51,321 --> 00:26:51,841
Bye.

550
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:52,922
Take care.

551
00:26:58,922 --> 00:26:59,442
Zheng!

552
00:27:00,121 --> 00:27:01,121
Are you okay?

553
00:27:01,402 --> 00:27:02,120
Twisted my ankle.

554
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:03,162
Can you move?

555
00:27:03,442 --> 00:27:03,922
It hurts.

556
00:27:04,121 --> 00:27:04,761
I can't move.

557
00:27:06,002 --> 00:27:07,002
Let's go to the hospital.

558
00:27:07,561 --> 00:27:08,281
Don't delay.

559
00:27:08,601 --> 00:27:09,041
Let's go.

560
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:09,601
Come on.

561
00:27:09,882 --> 00:27:10,482
Hello, sir.

562
00:27:13,722 --> 00:27:15,801
The doctor let him stay
a few days for observation.

563
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:23,162
Bye.

564
00:27:38,002 --> 00:27:38,761
Scumbag!

565
00:27:39,482 --> 00:27:41,402
I knew you weren't sincere with Lin.

566
00:27:43,002 --> 00:27:43,601
Lin.

567
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:45,642
Come to the hospital cafeteria now.

568
00:27:45,882 --> 00:27:47,281
See what Yu Yiming's been doing

569
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:48,242
(Jingzhou Yuekang Hospital, Outpatient)
behind your back.

570
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:57,722
Outrageous.

571
00:27:58,121 --> 00:27:59,442
Just now she held his hand.

572
00:27:59,841 --> 00:28:01,521
Now he's patting her shoulder.

573
00:28:01,922 --> 00:28:02,882
They've been together

574
00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:03,962
for 26 minutes.

575
00:28:04,202 --> 00:28:05,121
In front of me,

576
00:28:05,121 --> 00:28:06,682
he keeps declaring his love for you.

577
00:28:07,002 --> 00:28:07,962
Look what he's doing!

578
00:28:08,402 --> 00:28:10,162
Touchy-feely in public.

579
00:28:10,162 --> 00:28:11,081
No sense of propriety.

580
00:28:11,962 --> 00:28:13,962
He's practically a male coquette!

581
00:28:14,482 --> 00:28:15,242
Shut up!

582
00:28:16,121 --> 00:28:17,162
Stop rambling.

583
00:28:18,841 --> 00:28:20,202
Move away.

584
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:23,761
Lin.

585
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:24,722
Lin.

586
00:28:25,882 --> 00:28:26,521
Scumbag!

587
00:28:26,601 --> 00:28:27,361
Senior.

588
00:28:29,882 --> 00:28:31,848
This is my first patient

589
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,761
who died since I became a resident.

590
00:28:43,242 --> 00:28:43,922
Wenjin.

591
00:28:45,801 --> 00:28:47,642
I've been through these too.

592
00:28:50,081 --> 00:28:51,642
There are patients we want to save

593
00:28:52,962 --> 00:28:53,761
but can't.

594
00:28:54,242 --> 00:28:56,761
When we face their grieving family,
we don't know what to say.

595
00:28:57,761 --> 00:28:58,882
I know

596
00:29:00,002 --> 00:29:01,242
how hard it is

597
00:29:03,121 --> 00:29:04,482
for you.

598
00:29:05,601 --> 00:29:06,761
But as doctors,

599
00:29:07,081 --> 00:29:09,242
we must face this and overcome it.

600
00:29:12,321 --> 00:29:14,202
There are other patients waiting for us.

601
00:29:14,561 --> 00:29:15,041
Lin.

602
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:17,081
Lin.

603
00:29:19,002 --> 00:29:19,521
Lin!

604
00:29:21,482 --> 00:29:22,601
Please listen to me.

605
00:29:22,962 --> 00:29:23,402
Go ahead.

606
00:29:24,561 --> 00:29:26,121
I know you're hurting.

607
00:29:27,442 --> 00:29:30,761
But you must see his true nature.

608
00:29:32,121 --> 00:29:34,002
Yu Yiming's conditions are good.

609
00:29:35,242 --> 00:29:35,801
I admit that.

610
00:29:37,682 --> 00:29:39,482
But people living in big cities

611
00:29:39,682 --> 00:29:41,321
think realistically.

612
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,601
Your social status, background,

613
00:29:43,601 --> 00:29:44,321
education, and job

614
00:29:44,321 --> 00:29:45,521
are worlds apart from his.

615
00:29:45,722 --> 00:29:47,402
Do you really think he doesn't care?

616
00:29:50,162 --> 00:29:50,482
Lin Tao.

617
00:29:50,482 --> 00:29:51,841
I don't care what you saw.

618
00:29:51,962 --> 00:29:52,841
I just believe

619
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:54,761
that Yu Yiming is not that kind of man.

620
00:29:55,442 --> 00:29:56,002
Well, Lin.

621
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,761
Why don't you believe me?

622
00:29:57,761 --> 00:29:59,121
I'm the one who truly...

623
00:30:04,722 --> 00:30:05,962
Where's that bruise from?

624
00:30:06,442 --> 00:30:07,521
You fought?

625
00:30:07,922 --> 00:30:08,521
Well...

626
00:30:09,402 --> 00:30:11,080
I'm now a sparring partner
at an MMA gym.

627
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:13,482
Why?

628
00:30:14,202 --> 00:30:14,962
To take punches.

629
00:30:15,642 --> 00:30:16,801
You like hitting people.

630
00:30:17,002 --> 00:30:17,841
No problem.

631
00:30:18,202 --> 00:30:19,482
If hitting me makes you happy,

632
00:30:19,922 --> 00:30:20,962
just do it.

633
00:30:21,162 --> 00:30:21,682
Lin.

634
00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:24,442
I'm ready to be
your punching bag for life.

635
00:30:30,561 --> 00:30:31,202
Lin Tao.

636
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:33,202
The matter between us

637
00:30:33,761 --> 00:30:35,041
has dragged on long enough.

638
00:30:38,162 --> 00:30:40,081
Can we calmly

639
00:30:40,081 --> 00:30:41,321
talk it through today?

640
00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:43,801
Okay.

641
00:30:47,121 --> 00:30:47,682
I know

642
00:30:48,962 --> 00:30:50,242
you gave a lot

643
00:30:51,002 --> 00:30:52,041
to this relationship.

644
00:30:53,002 --> 00:30:54,722
But we've both realized we're not right

645
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:55,882
for each other.

646
00:30:56,402 --> 00:30:58,041
Breaking up is the best choice.

647
00:31:00,121 --> 00:31:01,962
We're never getting back together.

648
00:31:04,561 --> 00:31:05,442
So,

649
00:31:06,402 --> 00:31:07,722
I hope you can let go.

650
00:31:09,442 --> 00:31:10,801
Don't you want me to be happy?

651
00:31:12,682 --> 00:31:14,722
I am now.

652
00:31:15,601 --> 00:31:16,601
Look,

653
00:31:16,601 --> 00:31:17,521
I've got my sister

654
00:31:17,922 --> 00:31:20,041
and my startup team by my side.

655
00:31:20,601 --> 00:31:22,642
My life is full and busy.

656
00:31:25,121 --> 00:31:26,041
I also hope

657
00:31:27,642 --> 00:31:29,402
that you get back

658
00:31:29,601 --> 00:31:30,922
on your own path.

659
00:31:31,761 --> 00:31:32,321
Lin Tao.

660
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:35,482
I wish you well too.

661
00:31:41,162 --> 00:31:41,642
I'll leave.

662
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:53,922
Lin.

663
00:31:55,402 --> 00:31:56,552
Take good care of yourself.

664
00:31:59,962 --> 00:32:00,922
How's Xu Yan's company

665
00:32:00,922 --> 00:32:02,041
doing lately?

666
00:32:02,402 --> 00:32:04,561
They're doing great.

667
00:32:04,962 --> 00:32:06,521
Their newly released short videos

668
00:32:06,601 --> 00:32:07,841
get over 10,000 likes,

669
00:32:08,482 --> 00:32:11,281
all with much better quality.

670
00:32:12,682 --> 00:32:13,521
Currently,

671
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:14,761
this market is competitive.

672
00:32:15,002 --> 00:32:16,521
With numerous production stages,

673
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:18,722
achieving such results this fast

674
00:32:19,002 --> 00:32:19,841
is truly remarkable.

675
00:32:21,722 --> 00:32:24,482
No wonder Jiang Liang
has been showing off.

676
00:32:25,281 --> 00:32:26,841
Actually, I think

677
00:32:27,402 --> 00:32:28,922
Yan works hard

678
00:32:29,442 --> 00:32:30,482
just to prove her worth

679
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:31,561
and strength to you.

680
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:33,002
These days

681
00:32:33,281 --> 00:32:36,002
people want equal and balanced love.

682
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:37,841
She's an independent woman.

683
00:32:38,682 --> 00:32:40,002
Surely she wants to succeed first

684
00:32:40,002 --> 00:32:40,801
before returning.

685
00:32:42,722 --> 00:32:43,682
Really?

686
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:44,482
Absolutely.

687
00:32:44,808 --> 00:32:45,642
Think about it.

688
00:32:45,962 --> 00:32:48,801
If she really wanted to cut ties,

689
00:32:49,321 --> 00:32:51,041
why would she agree to the resort trip?

690
00:32:51,442 --> 00:32:52,841
Why would she help you

691
00:32:53,202 --> 00:32:54,482
win over Mr. Baraikin?

692
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:58,242
Three days.

693
00:32:58,521 --> 00:32:59,521
You have to be together

694
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:01,002
all the time,

695
00:33:01,482 --> 00:33:02,722
pretending to be close,

696
00:33:03,521 --> 00:33:04,882
even sharing a room.

697
00:33:06,801 --> 00:33:07,642
Let me tell you.

698
00:33:08,402 --> 00:33:10,801
If a woman truly hates a man,

699
00:33:11,081 --> 00:33:12,761
she wouldn't spend
even a second with him.

700
00:33:14,882 --> 00:33:15,882
Remember

701
00:33:16,242 --> 00:33:19,281
the romantic room at Yanbo Resort?

702
00:33:19,722 --> 00:33:20,882
That passionate setup.

703
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:23,321
Yan didn't object at all, right?

704
00:33:26,761 --> 00:33:29,321
You did a good job.

705
00:33:29,561 --> 00:33:32,722
If she truly had no feelings left,
why would she do that?

706
00:33:33,601 --> 00:33:35,482
But she keeps wanting a divorce.

707
00:33:36,162 --> 00:33:37,521
That's just anger talking.

708
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:41,202
My girlfriend used to threaten breakup

709
00:33:41,521 --> 00:33:42,402
when got mad.

710
00:33:42,682 --> 00:33:43,242
Really.

711
00:33:45,962 --> 00:33:48,162
How did you become such a smooth talker?

712
00:33:48,962 --> 00:33:49,482
Sit down.

713
00:33:51,601 --> 00:33:52,162
Keep going.

714
00:33:55,402 --> 00:33:56,561
Now,

715
00:33:56,841 --> 00:33:58,682
to win her back

716
00:33:58,722 --> 00:33:59,801
by direct communication

717
00:34:00,281 --> 00:34:01,361
is hard.

718
00:34:01,841 --> 00:34:04,081
But there's a method that always works.

719
00:34:04,162 --> 00:34:04,922
What is it?

720
00:34:05,722 --> 00:34:06,601
Indirect strategy.

721
00:34:07,402 --> 00:34:08,841
Go find her friends.

722
00:34:08,962 --> 00:34:09,801
That would help.

723
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:10,402
No use.

724
00:34:10,761 --> 00:34:12,482
I tried Qiao Lin, but she refused.

725
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:14,361
What about male friends?

726
00:34:15,002 --> 00:34:15,922
At such times,

727
00:34:16,081 --> 00:34:17,482
men often understand each other.

728
00:34:19,561 --> 00:34:21,442
Male friends?

729
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:25,882
She does have one.

730
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:53,704
Coming!

731
00:34:55,592 --> 00:34:56,872
Qiao Lin. Perfect timing.

732
00:34:56,872 --> 00:34:58,792
I'm making breakfast
and want to bring you some.

733
00:34:58,792 --> 00:34:59,521
Take any seat.

734
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,762
- I'll get you some fruit.
- Wait.

735
00:35:07,362 --> 00:35:08,641
I have something to say.

736
00:35:09,842 --> 00:35:10,561
Go ahead.

737
00:35:11,641 --> 00:35:12,521
Sit down.

738
00:35:19,561 --> 00:35:20,201
Yu Yiming.

739
00:35:24,161 --> 00:35:24,882
I like you.

740
00:35:28,002 --> 00:35:29,442
- Qiao Lin, actually...
- Let me finish.

741
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:30,161
Okay.

742
00:35:35,081 --> 00:35:38,601
Yes, I always do what I want,

743
00:35:39,161 --> 00:35:40,962
but I'm not that naive.

744
00:35:43,121 --> 00:35:44,282
I'm very aware

745
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,521
of the real differences between us.

746
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:49,201
Those can't be ignored.

747
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:54,842
I know there are

748
00:35:55,282 --> 00:35:56,681
many outstanding people around you.

749
00:35:56,962 --> 00:35:58,802
Like that female doctor

750
00:35:58,802 --> 00:36:00,081
I saw in the cafeteria.

751
00:36:00,762 --> 00:36:02,081
Realistically,

752
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,681
they're more successful,

753
00:36:03,721 --> 00:36:06,362
and also better matches for you.

754
00:36:06,482 --> 00:36:08,362
You share the same profession

755
00:36:09,161 --> 00:36:10,521
so you'd have more topics

756
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:11,561
and pursuits in common.

757
00:36:12,081 --> 00:36:12,442
However,

758
00:36:13,762 --> 00:36:16,121
I don't think this means

759
00:36:16,121 --> 00:36:17,322
I'm unworthy of liking you.

760
00:36:21,482 --> 00:36:23,041
I believe

761
00:36:23,521 --> 00:36:24,962
you have the right to choose.

762
00:36:26,002 --> 00:36:26,612
So...

763
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,362
If you think

764
00:36:29,362 --> 00:36:31,282
she is more suitable,

765
00:36:33,802 --> 00:36:36,241
I won't force it.

766
00:36:43,842 --> 00:36:44,482
Qiao Lin.

767
00:36:48,121 --> 00:36:49,201
What's with you today?

768
00:36:50,561 --> 00:36:51,762
Did something happen to you?

769
00:36:55,721 --> 00:36:56,882
Yesterday,

770
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,041
at the hospital cafeteria,

771
00:36:58,041 --> 00:36:59,521
I saw you with Dr. Xu.

772
00:37:00,402 --> 00:37:01,402
She looked distressed

773
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:03,121
and you tried to comfort her.

774
00:37:03,201 --> 00:37:04,362
She seemed to need you.

775
00:37:07,282 --> 00:37:08,721
I-I don't know what to say.

776
00:37:10,442 --> 00:37:11,208
Didn't sleep well?

777
00:37:15,161 --> 00:37:16,442
Yesterday,

778
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:17,922
it was her first time

779
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:19,241
losing a patient.

780
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,521
So I consoled her.

781
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:21,922
But rest assured.

782
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:24,121
There's nothing beyond colleagues.

783
00:37:24,561 --> 00:37:25,041
Really.

784
00:37:27,762 --> 00:37:28,802
I trust you.

785
00:37:29,962 --> 00:37:31,282
Also, I trust your character.

786
00:37:31,721 --> 00:37:34,482
But the reality between us

787
00:37:35,282 --> 00:37:36,521
still exist.

788
00:37:37,882 --> 00:37:38,962
I don't know

789
00:37:38,962 --> 00:37:41,081
if it will create obstacles

790
00:37:41,201 --> 00:37:42,241
for us.

791
00:37:43,402 --> 00:37:44,161
So...

792
00:37:45,482 --> 00:37:48,721
Maybe we should

793
00:37:49,161 --> 00:37:50,362
take a week apart

794
00:37:50,442 --> 00:37:51,521
to think it over.

795
00:37:53,402 --> 00:37:54,482
No, Qiao Lin. I don't...

796
00:37:56,521 --> 00:37:57,362
This week,

797
00:37:58,081 --> 00:37:59,002
don't contact me.

798
00:38:06,842 --> 00:38:07,362
Okay.

799
00:38:09,482 --> 00:38:10,762
Once I confirm it,

800
00:38:10,762 --> 00:38:11,681
I'll message you.

801
00:38:17,922 --> 00:38:18,402
Alright.

802
00:38:20,842 --> 00:38:21,482
How's it going?

803
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:23,322
I've secured cooperation

804
00:38:23,322 --> 00:38:25,842
with three weaving villages
for brocade production.

805
00:38:26,442 --> 00:38:28,282
They'll supply us long-term.

806
00:38:29,442 --> 00:38:30,362
That's good.

807
00:38:30,721 --> 00:38:31,882
Now we can send orders

808
00:38:31,882 --> 00:38:32,762
to the factory.

809
00:38:32,962 --> 00:38:33,601
I'll follow up.

810
00:38:33,601 --> 00:38:34,241
Wait a second.

811
00:38:35,442 --> 00:38:36,002
Sit down.

812
00:38:39,962 --> 00:38:41,681
Did something happen?

813
00:38:42,241 --> 00:38:42,962
Look at you.

814
00:38:50,802 --> 00:38:52,282
There are only two people

815
00:38:52,322 --> 00:38:53,442
that can make you

816
00:38:53,601 --> 00:38:55,041
be this shaken.

817
00:38:56,161 --> 00:38:57,402
One is Lin Tao,

818
00:38:58,762 --> 00:39:00,002
the other is Yu Yiming.

819
00:39:00,161 --> 00:39:00,721
Which one?

820
00:39:01,282 --> 00:39:02,721
Yu Yiming, of course.

821
00:39:05,962 --> 00:39:08,081
Young love during school days
was so simple.

822
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,962
No need to think about
the future or the outcomes,

823
00:39:11,002 --> 00:39:12,561
just loved.

824
00:39:13,521 --> 00:39:14,561
But now,

825
00:39:14,762 --> 00:39:16,442
the more I want to be with someone,

826
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:19,721
the more I can't help
thinking about reality.

827
00:39:24,121 --> 00:39:25,322
That means you've grown up.

828
00:39:26,842 --> 00:39:28,161
You used to be so carefree.

829
00:39:28,681 --> 00:39:30,376
How could you ever
ponder over such things?

830
00:39:30,641 --> 00:39:32,241
When I was young,

831
00:39:32,802 --> 00:39:34,561
I thought love was all sweet.

832
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,521
But now I understand

833
00:39:37,322 --> 00:39:38,882
there isn't just sweetness,

834
00:39:38,882 --> 00:39:40,161
but bitterness,

835
00:39:40,521 --> 00:39:41,442
insecurity,

836
00:39:41,762 --> 00:39:42,402
pride,

837
00:39:42,601 --> 00:39:43,282
and pain.

838
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:48,201
All kinds of contradictions intertwined.

839
00:39:49,002 --> 00:39:50,882
But I just can't let go.

840
00:40:01,521 --> 00:40:03,241
I understand how you feel right now.

841
00:40:09,081 --> 00:40:10,561
But this is what love is.

842
00:40:13,842 --> 00:40:16,081
Everything you just said

843
00:40:16,721 --> 00:40:18,521
is part of love.

844
00:40:20,442 --> 00:40:21,561
Don't run from it.

845
00:40:21,922 --> 00:40:23,041
You can't run anyway.

846
00:40:24,561 --> 00:40:26,802
So you could try to accept it,

847
00:40:27,442 --> 00:40:28,161
understand it,

848
00:40:28,922 --> 00:40:29,762
and feel it.

849
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:32,482
Maybe in that process,

850
00:40:33,121 --> 00:40:34,681
you'll find the answers you seek.

851
00:40:35,962 --> 00:40:37,802
No need to drain yourself like this.

852
00:40:39,241 --> 00:40:40,241
That's true.

853
00:40:44,081 --> 00:40:44,922
I'll think about it.

854
00:40:45,121 --> 00:40:45,681
I'm leaving.

855
00:40:48,282 --> 00:40:48,842
Wait.

856
00:40:49,641 --> 00:40:50,601
Well...

857
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:53,121
Don't forget the makeup class.

858
00:40:55,681 --> 00:40:56,201
Okay.

859
00:40:56,362 --> 00:40:56,882
Bye.

860
00:40:58,002 --> 00:40:58,842
Goodbye.

861
00:41:08,498 --> 00:41:12,360
(Yan Studio)

862
00:41:16,601 --> 00:41:17,282
Yu Yiming.

863
00:41:21,681 --> 00:41:22,760
You're here for my sister?

864
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:24,962
Yes.

865
00:41:26,561 --> 00:41:27,561
Your coworkers said

866
00:41:27,802 --> 00:41:28,721
she isn't here.

867
00:41:29,601 --> 00:41:30,681
So I'm waiting here.

868
00:41:34,002 --> 00:41:35,362
Does she not want to see me?

869
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:38,601
She really isn't here.

870
00:41:39,161 --> 00:41:41,442
This morning she had makeup class,

871
00:41:41,721 --> 00:41:43,362
this afternoon a beauty launch event.

872
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:45,802
She's looking for the newest products

873
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:47,521
and preparing for the entrance exams.

874
00:41:48,201 --> 00:41:49,041
She's busy.

875
00:41:49,322 --> 00:41:50,201
Even I barely see her.

876
00:41:50,762 --> 00:41:52,482
Don't overthink it.
She really isn't here.

877
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:55,442
Got it.

878
00:41:56,322 --> 00:41:57,641
Qiao Lin has told me

879
00:41:57,641 --> 00:41:58,762
about you two.

880
00:42:00,121 --> 00:42:01,521
I think she's right.

881
00:42:03,041 --> 00:42:04,041
If you ignore

882
00:42:04,241 --> 00:42:06,041
these differences now,

883
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:08,041
bigger issues might arise later.

884
00:42:08,882 --> 00:42:10,402
So you both should calm down

885
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:11,601
and think carefully

886
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:13,641
whether you can accept it.

887
00:42:15,681 --> 00:42:16,521
She's more rational

888
00:42:16,962 --> 00:42:18,081
than before.

889
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:20,296
That means you're important to her.

890
00:42:20,922 --> 00:42:22,081
Do you get me?

891
00:42:24,081 --> 00:42:24,882
Okay, I understand.

892
00:42:26,882 --> 00:42:27,802
I'll wait patiently.

893
00:42:29,482 --> 00:42:30,521
These flowers...

894
00:42:30,641 --> 00:42:31,521
I'll give them to her.

895
00:42:32,721 --> 00:42:33,322
Thank you.

896
00:42:34,322 --> 00:42:34,922
I'm leaving.

897
00:42:36,322 --> 00:42:36,922
Take care.

898
00:42:51,561 --> 00:42:52,002
Hello?

899
00:42:53,922 --> 00:42:54,762
I'm Shen Haoming.

900
00:42:56,002 --> 00:42:56,922
Shen Haoming?

901
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:10,521
What's up?

902
00:43:12,402 --> 00:43:12,922
Have a seat.

903
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:23,161
Thank you.

904
00:43:24,922 --> 00:43:26,282
You like Xu Yan, don't you?

905
00:43:29,282 --> 00:43:30,482
Don't get me wrong.

906
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:31,641
Yes.

907
00:43:32,882 --> 00:43:34,282
I had feelings for her,

908
00:43:35,402 --> 00:43:36,882
but that was many years ago.

909
00:43:37,442 --> 00:43:38,802
I admit when I saw her again,

910
00:43:39,402 --> 00:43:40,362
I still had a soft spot.

911
00:43:41,601 --> 00:43:43,041
But I know that's not love.

912
00:43:44,561 --> 00:43:46,241
Besides, I'm now with Qiao Lin.

913
00:43:50,161 --> 00:43:52,402
I know you're not involved with her.

914
00:43:53,322 --> 00:43:54,402
I asked you here today

915
00:43:55,362 --> 00:43:56,482
to request your help.

916
00:43:57,322 --> 00:43:58,201
How can I help?

917
00:43:58,762 --> 00:44:00,442
You've known her since childhood.

918
00:44:01,201 --> 00:44:02,721
You must understand her well, right?

919
00:44:04,201 --> 00:44:05,962
I hope you can help me win her back.

920
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:09,521
You're mistaken.

921
00:44:10,002 --> 00:44:12,081
Qiao Lin and I have problems too.

922
00:44:13,922 --> 00:44:15,081
I don't know how to help you.

923
00:44:15,802 --> 00:44:17,041
Where are things now?

924
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:18,632
Breakup cooling-off period.

925
00:44:21,282 --> 00:44:21,802
And you?

926
00:44:22,402 --> 00:44:23,560
Divorce cooling-off period.

927
00:44:23,721 --> 00:44:24,402
Let me toast you.

928
00:44:28,201 --> 00:44:29,362
So you're saying

929
00:44:30,561 --> 00:44:34,641
you used to think you didn't love her,
but now you've fallen for her again?

930
00:44:35,282 --> 00:44:35,962
No.

931
00:44:36,081 --> 00:44:37,762
After we broke up...

932
00:44:38,641 --> 00:44:39,802
It's not "fallen again".

933
00:44:41,201 --> 00:44:42,482
I've always loved her.

934
00:44:49,002 --> 00:44:51,282
But I've never felt this lost before.

935
00:44:51,962 --> 00:44:53,721
I don't know what to do

936
00:44:53,721 --> 00:44:55,282
to get her back.

937
00:44:55,842 --> 00:44:57,041
I only know one thing.

938
00:44:58,041 --> 00:44:59,081
I won't let her go.

939
00:44:59,362 --> 00:45:00,442
Let me tell you.

940
00:45:02,402 --> 00:45:03,362
I hadn't seen Xu Yan

941
00:45:03,402 --> 00:45:04,641
since high school graduation.

942
00:45:05,322 --> 00:45:07,081
When we met again in Jingzhou,

943
00:45:07,442 --> 00:45:08,721
she told me she was married.

944
00:45:09,121 --> 00:45:10,161
The way she said it

945
00:45:10,201 --> 00:45:11,482
was overflowing

946
00:45:11,802 --> 00:45:12,922
with happiness.

947
00:45:13,922 --> 00:45:14,962
The radiance

948
00:45:16,121 --> 00:45:17,161
on her face

949
00:45:18,561 --> 00:45:20,081
was something I'd never seen.

950
00:45:20,922 --> 00:45:21,641
Really?

951
00:45:22,041 --> 00:45:22,681
You got married?

952
00:45:26,241 --> 00:45:26,922
Yes, last month.

953
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:29,962
Though it's a bit late,

954
00:45:31,201 --> 00:45:32,081
congratulations.

955
00:45:33,842 --> 00:45:35,762
I could tell she was truly happy then.

956
00:45:37,041 --> 00:45:37,882
It's all my fault.

957
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,121
I've always been slow

958
00:45:40,121 --> 00:45:41,402
to express myself.

959
00:45:42,442 --> 00:45:43,681
Always realize things too late.

960
00:45:44,922 --> 00:45:45,922
You think you're alone?

961
00:45:49,521 --> 00:45:50,521
I'm the same.

962
00:45:51,002 --> 00:45:52,402
After I met Qiao Lin again,

963
00:45:53,322 --> 00:45:54,561
she's always by my side,

964
00:45:56,561 --> 00:45:57,402
supporting,

965
00:45:58,241 --> 00:45:59,081
encouraging,

966
00:46:00,842 --> 00:46:01,641
and caring.

967
00:46:05,442 --> 00:46:06,922
And it still takes me so long

968
00:46:08,201 --> 00:46:09,601
to realize that I like her.

969
00:46:16,802 --> 00:46:17,762
Let's team up.

970
00:46:18,641 --> 00:46:20,362
The women we love are sisters.

971
00:46:21,482 --> 00:46:22,442
Our love lives

972
00:46:23,721 --> 00:46:25,161
are just as bumpy.

973
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:27,282
We need to help each other.

974
00:46:28,241 --> 00:46:28,762
Makes sense.

975
00:46:28,962 --> 00:46:29,882
When Lin ignores me,

976
00:46:30,442 --> 00:46:31,521
you can reach her for me.

977
00:46:31,842 --> 00:46:32,922
When Xu Yan avoids you,

978
00:46:33,521 --> 00:46:34,842
I can speak to her.

979
00:46:35,161 --> 00:46:35,882
That's...

980
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:38,482
strength in numbers.

981
00:46:39,282 --> 00:46:40,962
Two are better than one.

982
00:46:41,322 --> 00:46:42,121
You're right.

983
00:46:42,802 --> 00:46:43,464
Brother-in-law.

984
00:46:43,882 --> 00:46:44,520
Brother-in-law.

985
00:46:46,442 --> 00:46:47,176
Brother-in-law.

986
00:46:47,402 --> 00:46:48,072
