[Episode 4]

00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,850
[Lyv's Residence]

4
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,680
Shao,

5
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,750
do you really want to go back?

6
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,920
In this palace,

7
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,030
everyone is unpredictable.

8
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:49,610
You...

9
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,480
Xun,

10
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,560
you've always been protective of me in the past.

11
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,800
Now Shao wants to protect you too.

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,480
But you've always been so innocent.

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,040
I am Empress Dowager.

14
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,120
She's just a concubine.

15
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,160
What can she do to me?

16
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,520
Oh, you.

17
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:08,640
Yuzhu.

18
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,580
[Lyv's Residence]

19
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:09,430
Yes.

20
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,930
You must take good care of Empress Dowager.

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,960
If anything happens,

22
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,850
report to me immediately.

23
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:13,780
Yes, Your Highness.

24
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,440
I will not allow that bitch Wen Zhao

25
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,320
to harm Empress Dowager.

26
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,920
Where did this cat come from?

27
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,350
Come here.

28
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,450
Found it.

29
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,450
Be careful, Empress Dowager.

30
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,320
Shao,

31
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,650
I thought you were afraid of cats.

32
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,930
I used to be.

33
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,370
But the palace is a lonely place.

34
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,600
I'm always alone.

35
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:51,039
If it weren't for these little creatures coming to me for food at night,

36
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,590
I don't know how I'd get through it.

37
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,600
It's my fault.

38
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,860
I have received your letter.

39
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,950
Find a way to bring Wen Zhao to meet me.

40
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:17,350
A'Man.

41
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,960
I need to switch bodies

42
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,410
with Wen Zhao as quickly as possible.

43
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,280
Wen Zhao.

44
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,030
You are really afraid of cats.

45
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,910
Why is she so calm?

46
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,829
Did she plan everything?

47
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,220
You should now call me Imperial Mother.

48
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,980
Paying respects to Empress Dowager.

49
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,800
Lyu Shao.

50
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,490
What are you doing?

51
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,300
Did you scheme all these things?

52
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,040
What have you done to A'Man?

53
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,530
Answer me, or I'll kill you.

54
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,480
Kill me.

55
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,079
You don't want to switch back?

56
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,120
Good.

57
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,510
Then I'll use your body,

58
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,329
and bring down the Wen family with His majesty.

59
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,520
Lyu Shao,

60
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,360
if you dare to harm the Wen family,

61
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,360
I'll haunt you even as a ghost.

62
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,950
Let's see about that.

63
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,800
The emperor has arrived.

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,600
Your Majesty.

65
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,640
Empress Dowager has just waken up.

66
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,800
What are you doing now?

67
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,820
Have you recovered?

68
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,680
Your Majesty,

69
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,280
Wen Zhao has colluded with enemies,

70
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,079
and intended to rebel.

71
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,000
According to the law, she should be executed.

72
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,680
I need to be alone with Wen Zhao.

73
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,420
Your Majesty, I am guilty.

74
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,480
What Empress Dowager just said

75
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,670
is all true.

76
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,370
My father and brother,

77
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,210
together with all uncles in the Wen family,

78
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,360
are all worried that Your Majesty might lose your throne.

79
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,040
They forced me to bewitch Your Majesty,

80
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,850
while secretly colluding with foreign powers.

81
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,050
They intended to steal your power.

82
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,960
You...

83
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,159
Minister Wen has been an upright official.

84
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,250
He's loyal to His Majesty and the country.

85
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,100
How dare you slander him with baseless accusations?

86
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,940
I am my father's daughter.

87
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,290
Every word I say is the truth.

88
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,680
Empress Dowager never concerned herself with state affairs.

89
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,000
How does she know whether my father is loyal or treacherous?

90
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:54,680
You...

91
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:57,610
Shao.

92
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,640
I shall put loyalty before family.

93
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,790
Your Majesty, please strip Minister Wen of his title,

94
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,150
imprison everyone in the Wen family,

95
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,770
and send me to the Cold Palace to prevent troubles.

96
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,530
You've lost your mind.

97
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,970
Your Majesty,

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,630
she must have lost her mind to speak such nonsense.

99
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,040
Please execute this bitch immediately.

100
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,960
I beseech Your Majesty to make a wise judgment.

101
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,120
Why is Shao so aggressive today?

102
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,540
But Wen Zhao has indeed gone too far.

103
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,930
I should keep her away from Shao.

104
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,630
Noble Consort Wen's behavior today was outrageous,

105
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,360
and lunatic indeed.

106
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,180
Send her to the Cold Palace first.

107
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,320
Wait for my orders.

108
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,400
I can walk by myself.

109
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,860
Your good days are over. Just wait and see.

110
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,450
A'Man, I've managed to enter the Cold Palace.

111
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,680
I'll see you at 9:45 PM today.

112
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,350
From what I know about Wen Zhao,

113
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,540
she will definitely come.

114
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,600
Noble Consort Wen, please eat something before they become cold.

115
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,080
Thank you.

116
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,520
A boring trick.

117
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,280
Please give a message to Empress Dowager.

118
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,480
Empress Dowager, Noble Consort Wen wants to see you.

119
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,080
Alright.

120
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,240
Then let's go to the Cold Palace

121
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,120
to bid Noble Consort Wen a final farewell.

122
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,840
[Hehuan Palace]

123
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,880
Your Majesty, please strip Minister Wen of his title,

124
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,520
and send me to the Cold Palace to prevent troubles.

125
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,400
You must have lost your mind to speak such nonsense.

126
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,720
Please execute this bitch immediately.

127
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,000
Something's wrong.

128
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,840
Both of them are being very strange.

129
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,740
I knew you wouldn't be so easily fooled.

130
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,039
You've prepared a lot.

131
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,950
I'm worried that I may not survive the night.

132
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,700
So I've prepared these things.

133
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,750
It's a farewell gift to myself.

134
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,020
I hope Empress Dowager doesn't find it inauspicious.

135
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,270
That's why I came here.

136
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,640
I heard that Noble Consort Wen intended to take her own life out of guilt.

137
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,980
You're in the prime of your youth.

138
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,340
Please don't do anything foolish.

139
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,310
Empress Dowager, please don't trouble yourself to visit me so often.

140
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,160
Then I'm sure to live a long life.

141
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,460
I have nothing worthy to treat you.

142
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,640
I only have this.

143
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,480
I don't know who sent this.

144
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,340
Three poisoned steamed buns.

145
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,680
You can eat them, Empress Dowager.

146
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,090
Lyu Shao,

147
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,970
you're imprisoned.

148
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,660
How dare you be so rude to me?

149
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,840
Wen Zhao,

150
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,520
be careful. You may fall off

151
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,690
from the Empress Dowager's throne.

152
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:30,670
Is it because you want to switch bodies tonight?

153
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,540
Speaking of that,

154
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,540
these funeral preparations of yours

155
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,920
might actually be useful.

156
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,910
What do you mean?

157
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,270
Are you waiting for her?

158
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,730
A'Man, A'Man.

159
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,160
A'Man, wake up. A'Man.

160
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,040
You are the holy maiden of Miaojiang.

161
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,310
You won't die.

162
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,780
A'Man, A'Man, wake up.

163
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,850
A'Man, A'Man.

164
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,460
Why do you have to be so ruthless?

165
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,450
Because

166
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,810
I want to secure my position as Empress Dowager.

167
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,170
A'Man.

168
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,690
A'Man, I'm sorry.

169
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,870
A'Man, I'm sorry.

170
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,330
Since Noble Consort Wen insists on dying,

171
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,730
I don't know what I can do.

172
00:10:58,770 --> 00:10:59,800
Let go of me!
