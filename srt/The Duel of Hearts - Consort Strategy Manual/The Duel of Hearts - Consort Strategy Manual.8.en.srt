[Episode 8]

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:38,900
Princess Jia.

4
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,890
What right do you have to search my palace?

5
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,160
She doesn't have the right.

6
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,350
But I do, don't I?

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,120
Yuzhu.

8
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:53,420
Search.

9
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,840
I found a secret room here!

10
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,670
That was your

11
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,490
secret room for storing poisons
and hidden weapons.

12
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,580
I merely converted it into a small
Buddhist shrine.

13
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:31,770
to worship Buddha.

14
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,120
Wasn't it a secret room?

15
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:38,670
How did it become a Buddhist shrine?

16
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,140
You're really thoughtful.

17
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,950
You're too kind.

18
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,550
I know nothing.

19
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,160
I saw nothing.

20
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,090
What did you see?

21
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:53,660
I saw nothing.

22
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,400
The Empress Dowager is asking you
a question.

23
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,020
I...

24
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,350
A few days ago, while I was cleaning,

25
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:01,070
I found this.

26
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,810
I have treated you well all along,

27
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,060
yet you're now framing me?

28
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,030
Noble Consort Wen,

29
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,260
do not be insolent.

30
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,090
[Lv Shao, Bing, Zi, Xin, Chou, Gui, Hai, Yi, Mao]

31
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,230
This...

32
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,620
This is Empress Dowager's birth date
in the Chinese zodiac.

33
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,530
It was found under the Noble Consort's bed.

34
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:26,780
[Lv Xun, Bing, Zi, Xin, Chou, Gui, Hai, Yi, Mao] [Geng, Zi, Yi, Wei, Jia, Shen, Jia, Zi]

This is me?

36
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,870
Noble Consort Wen,

37
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,360
what wrong have I and Princess Jia done

38
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,500
for you to do this?

39
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,550
What wrong have I done

40
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,250
for you to go to such lengths to frame me?

41
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,760
You're doomed. Stop being stubborn.

42
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,510
[Hehuan Palace]

43
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,980
I carry the Emperor's baby.

44
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,160
No one can touch me.

45
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,270
You may fool others,

46
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,730
but you can't fool me.

47
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,110
I know better whether
it's a royal baby.

48
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,790
If you don't believe me, just try.

49
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,160
Do it.

50
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,329
Now.

51
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,440
You're cutting off your own escape.

52
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,190
How stubborn can you be?

53
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,530
Full strength.

54
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,800
Easy on her. Just teach her a small lesson.

55
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:59,579
Don't let it escalate to the point of death.

56
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,280
The emperor has arrived.

[Hehuan Palace]

58
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,720
Don't be afraid.

59
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,560
I am here.

60
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,220
Your Majesty, you've come at the right time.

61
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,580
She is practicing black magic in the palace.

62
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,600
She's cursing me.

63
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,190
I don't know how I have offended her.

64
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,730
She keeps accusing me from time to time.

65
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,690
Chan, I will seek justice for you.

66
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,150
Tell His Majesty everything that
just happened

67
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,150
in detail.

68
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,230
What else do you want me to say?

69
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,680
I've already said everything
as instructed by you.

70
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,030
What nonsense are you talking about?

71
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,300
Your Majesty, the Empress Dowager approached me
two days ago,

72
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,930
[Hehuan Palace]

73
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,130
instructing me to place that figurine under
the Noble Consort's pillow,

74
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,720
and to accuse

75
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,020
that the Noble Consort was cursing the Empress Dowager.

76
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,320
Otherwise,

77
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,480
she'll beat me to death.

78
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,140
You...

79
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,040
Why are you plotting against

80
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,490
the Noble Consort?

81
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,250
Are you in cahoots with her,

82
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,120
setting a trap to lure me in?

83
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,460
I'm telling the truth!

84
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,270
Everything I say is true.

85
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,130
I beg you for mercy.

86
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,940
Do you dare to commit violence
in my presence?

87
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,260
I will take you back to the palace.

88
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,310
[Hehuan Palace]

89
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,570
The Empress Dowager has abused her power with
unauthorized punishments.

90
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,590
Her virtue does not befit her position.

91
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,220
From this day forward, she will be demoted.

92
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,060
She will be confined in Shoukang Palace.

93
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,770
Don't get cocky.

94
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,760
This round

95
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,040
is not over yet.

96
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,190
Does it hurt?

97
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,370
No, it doesn't.

98
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,460
Have you forgotten what I told you?

99
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:20,520
Why didn't you

100
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,010
ask a servant inform me about
today's incident?

101
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,480
Chan,

102
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,640
from now on, no matter what happens to
the Noble Consort,

103
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,630
if there's even the slightest
possibility of danger,

104
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,300
report to me immediately.

105
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:33,980
Yes.

106
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,280
I haven't forgotten, Your Majesty.

107
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,670
I had already made arrangements
for this matter.

108
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,860
The Empress Dowager is quite generous,

109
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,670
spending so lavishly to buy your loyalty

110
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,860
and have you frame me.

111
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,290
Please rest assured.

112
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,790
I will never betray you.

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,570
No.

114
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,340
You must betray me.

115
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,430
What are you doing?

116
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,870
When they arrive, you...

117
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,150
She's trying to harm me.

118
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,250
I will not surrender without a fight.

119
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,520
Just...

120
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,100
I never expected Your Majesty
to be so decisive.

121
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,290
The Empress Dowager is unvirtuous.

122
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,020
I have long wanted to deal with her.

123
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,470
Your Majesty despises her so much,

124
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,080
yet treats me so well.

125
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,190
What is truly on your mind?

126
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,680
Should I be frank with her now?

127
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,020
Why have you fallen silent?

128
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,550
I have been thinking

129
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,210
to let the past be the past.

130
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,440
What matters is that I still have you
by my side now.

131
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,880
Your Majesty.

132
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,780
Minister Wen has been waiting for you in
Chengqian Palace.

133
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,020
Please go back first.

134
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,280
Don't keep him waiting.

135
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,450
Let him wait.

136
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:32,789
Yes.

137
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,820
Your Majesty,

138
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,169
He is, after all, my father.

139
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:42,520
Besides, I don't want Your Majesty to be
an incompetent ruler.

140
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,840
Please go, Your Majesty.

141
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,040
Then I will come to see you later.

142
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:14,780
You're truly the apple of his eye.

143
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,500
Is that so?

144
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,080
You think so too?

145
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,620
The matter you entrusted has been taken care of,
please rest assured.

146
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,300
By my calculations, it should
take effect soon.

147
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,200
Your Majesty, please leave Hehuan
Palace immediately.

148
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,360
She has contracted the epidemic.

149
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,620
How could it happen all of a sudden?

150
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,570
I will find out the specific cause.

151
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,960
Please, leave now.

152
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,860
Your Majesty!

153
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,140
Issue my order.

154
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,290
Seal off the entire palace.

155
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,250
No one is allowed to enter or leave
without permission.

156
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,540
Dr. Xu.

157
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,890
Summon all the imperial physicians.

158
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,050
Develop a prescription for the epidemic.

159
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,240
It must be done quickly!

160
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,420
Yes, Your Mejasty.

161
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,450
But you...

162
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,200
A sudden outbreak of an epidemic.

163
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,140
Something is not right.

164
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,100
If I flee now,

165
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,370
it will be difficult to catch those
behind this.

166
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,570
Your Majesty, please!

167
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,000
This epidemic is dangerous.

168
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,150
I hope Your Majesty prioritizes the country
and its people.

169
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:48,850
Your Majesty.

170
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,560
A'Bu.

171
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,560
You only have three days to find out
the cause of this.

172
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,150
Yes. Your Mejasty.

173
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,790
Leave.

174
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,030
Leave now.

175
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,850
Don't worry. I've had these symptoms before.

176
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,410
I know what I'm doing.

177
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,330
I will stay by your side.

178
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,180
There is an epidemic in the palace.

179
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,190
His Majesty has ordered a strict
lockdown of all palaces.

180
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,680
If anyone has a fever,

181
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,280
report it immediately.

182
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,530
Your Highness. It's done.

183
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,250
He lock me here.

184
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,560
Then I will make sure everyone in the imperial city

185
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,680
are locked, too.

186
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,660
Where is that little wench?

187
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,840
I heard from the Imperial
Hospital staff that

188
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,800
she has had a fever for several days.

189
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,610
His Majesty wanted to take care of her
in the Hehuan Palace,

190
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,340
but General Lv tricked him out
with official business.

191
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,690
Now he is making a fuss
and wants to go back.

192
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,650
If he stays there,

193
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,220
it will be difficult for me to act.

194
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,440
Send a message to my brother.

195
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,050
Hold back His Majesty.
