00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,930
[Episode 20]

3
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,360
Don't move.

4
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,430
I still have your two friends in my grasp.

5
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,950
Cooperate and complete the wedding with me.

6
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,750
Why does Ajiao's voice sound so familiar?

7
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:55,960
Chieftain.

8
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,420
Getting married at the auspicious hour today

9
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,880
is a big deal.

10
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,720
Then, let's begin the ceremony.

11
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,940
Take the first bow 
to the great heaven and earth.

12
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,770
Take the second bow to the great parents.

13
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,860
Take the third bow to each other.

14
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,860
[Shoukang Palace]

15
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,860
[The wedding was held 
in the Wu clan village.]

16
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,430
This is truly a second time.

17
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,140
Li Dun and Lyu Shao are getting married.

18
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:28,579
What do you think?

19
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,110
Want to team up with me?

20
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,400
Where's Ajiao?

21
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,600
What time is it now?

22
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,170
He won't stand me up, will he?

23
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,060
No, that's not right.

24
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,490
I shouldn't think like that.

25
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,850
He'll definitely come.

26
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,970
But what if he doesn't?

27
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,780
Ajiao.

28
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,720
Where have you been all day?

29
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,970
Where did you take Shao?

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,300
I just tied her up.

31
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,170
What?

32
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,079
Didn't you promise to marry me on my behalf?

33
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,650
It's almost time.

34
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,780
You'll know when you get there.

35
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,600
Honey.

36
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,430
We can't miss the auspicious time.

37
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,280
Have they consummated the marriage?

38
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,480
Why haven't the candles gone out yet?

39
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,440
The Chieftain is still outside.

40
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,440
We've performed the wedding ceremony.

41
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:01,630
So,

42
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,260
we are now a legitimate married couple.

43
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,210
Shao.

44
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,440
Although today's marriage is fake,

45
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,130
you are more real to me

46
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,810
than countless days and nights before.

47
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,530
Me too.

48
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,600
Your Majesty.

49
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,640
The assassins have 
surrounded the entire mountain.

50
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,090
Stay here. I'll go deal with them.

51
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:58,640
Be careful.

52
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,130
Wait for me here.

53
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,600
Wen Zhao, there are assassins 
everywhere outside.

54
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,520
Hurry and hide!

55
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,140
Here.

56
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,020
I told you I’m still useful.

57
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,590
Your Majesty, they are here!

58
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,490
Shao.

59
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,640
Shao!

60
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,020
Wake up!

61
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,230
Don't scare me.

62
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,280
Return to the palace.

63
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:19,430
Yes.

64
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,540
Abu, give the Chieftain a proper burial.

65
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,880
His Majesty has a decree.

66
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:26,260
[Hehuan Palace]

67
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,020
From this day onward, 
restore the status of Wen Zhao, the legitimate daughter 
of the Wen family, as Noble Consort.

68
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,200
Respect it!

69
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,140
Shao.

70
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,140
It's all my fault!

71
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,310
Knowing that  Mount Yandang is dangerous,

72
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,870
I should have sent more guards.

73
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:41,750
Let me in!

74
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:42,940
Let me in!

75
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,170
What's happening outside?

76
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,830
General Lyu, what are you doing?

77
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,360
Li Dun, 
is this how you take care of my sister?

78
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:49,950
Abu.

79
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,620
Get out.

80
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:52,710
Your Majesty!

81
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,250
Get out!

82
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,780
Lyu Xun.

83
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,790
Are you holding a sword 
in front of me to rebel?

84
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,680
I only regret not rebelling back then.

85
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,970
Otherwise,

86
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,540
Shao wouldn't have fallen into danger.

87
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,960
Shao’s current situation

88
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,040
is indeed my responsibility.

89
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,010
But I will bear it.

90
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,350
How will you bear yours?

91
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,490
You are the emperor,

92
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,350
with many concubines in the harem.

93
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,040
If Shao doesn't wake up for ten years,

94
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,090
can you wait for her for ten years?

95
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,280
Of course I can!

96
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,820
Easy for you to say.

97
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:42,330
I'm taking her with me today.

98
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,530
I allowed you to take her the first time.

99
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,450
But there will be no second time.

100
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,380
What if I insist?

101
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,280
Do you still intend to force her?

102
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,930
Do you think 
she followed me that day for no reason?

103
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,510
I lost my mind that day.

104
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:21,830
She...

105
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,010
Does she hate me?

106
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,960
I don't know.

107
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,120
If you really care about her,

108
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,670
then respect her.

109
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,640
Let’s talk about it once she wakes up.

110
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,740
Shao.

111
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,750
Why is she unconscious?

112
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,260
Yesterday, the people at  Mount Yandang
 were all yours.

113
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,340
How is that possible?

114
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,360
How could I risk Shao‘s life?

115
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,160
[Lyu Xin] [Lyu Guangcai] 
[Lyu Bokao] [Lyu Ling] [Lyu Chao]

116
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,390
Supreme General, this list contains

117
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,910
all the private soldiers under your command.

118
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:55,700
This...

119
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,030
How is this possible?

120
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,900
With Shao’s face,

121
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,910
using your name to mobilize some soldiers

122
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,310
is not difficult for Wen Zhao.

123
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:05,840
I'll go check right away;

124
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,100
and give Shao an explanation.

125
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,220
I have my own plans.

126
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,000
The most important thing now

127
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,400
is to take good care of Shao.
