Your Majesty,

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,130
it is a rare opportunity.

00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,600
Why don't we just kill Lyu Xun?

7
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,260
Let's return to the palace first.

00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:06,950
Why didn't you take A'Bu's advice

11
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,880
and kill my brother?

12
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,650
For A'Bu,

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,800
he is Supreme General who threatens imperial power.

14
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,840
But for me,

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,910
he is your brother,

16
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,400
and also your only family in this world.

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,270
So, for you

18
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,350
I'll never

19
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,340
kill him.

20
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:27,970
Don't worry.

21
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,820
I don't kill him

22
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,780
because I already have military power under my control.

23
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:33,610
I can protect myself.

that the clue about the Wu tribe points to this place.

come here to do business,

95
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,360

I told you. You couldn't do it without me.

113
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,840
I admit my defeat.

114
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,280
Just kill me.

115
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,250
You know Aman, don't you?

116
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,000
So you're Wen Zhao.

117
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,840
Yes,

118
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,120
and no.

119
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,880
Aman left me a message.

120
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,220
She asked me to find Chieftain.

121
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,179
After what you did to my sister,

122
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,390
how could she possibly tell you about us?

123
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:39,980
I...

124
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:43,770
Do you have any poison

125
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,150
or venom on you?

126
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,590
What do you want to do?

127
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,120
Shao, you...

128
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,350
I've already taken the poison.

129
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,880
We mean no harm.

130
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,930
I know you won't believe me no matter what I say,

131
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,210
so give me the antidote after I talk with Chieftain.

132
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,040
How about that?

133
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,150
Shao, are you feeling unwell?

134
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,060
Don't worry.

135
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,210
What kind of poison is this?

136
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,140
Is there an antidote?

137
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,110
Are there any other harmful effects on the body?

138
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,480
Men and women should be separate.

139
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,190
Let me take care of her.

140
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,260
Come with me.

141
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,450
Let me make this clear first.

142
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,270
The Chieftain is not in his right mind.

143
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,680
He may not be able to tell you what you want to know.

144
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,620
We have to try.

145
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,360
Dun.

146
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,720
And you.

147
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,600
Chieftain.

148
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:21,980
All of you, stand up straight.

149
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,600
I'm talking to you.

150
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,460
Everyone, stand up straight.

151
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,880
Listen to me.

152
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,060
These Han people

153
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,340
are cunning and deceitful.

154
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,720
They are especially good at tricking others.

155
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,240
You must never associate with them.

156
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,070
Do you understand?

157
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,110
The Chieftain has become lunatic.

158
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,520
Aman is the holy maiden.

159
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,600
And she's so gifted.

160
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,390
The Chieftain has always hoped she would succeed him.

161
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,090
But after she left,

162
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,320
Chieftain fell seriously ill.

163
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,210
When he woke up, he became like this.

164
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,180
Are you sure

165
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,220
you still want to ask him anything?

166
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,080
You have to run the tea stall and take care of Chieftain all by yourself.

167
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,840
It must be hard.

168
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,100
Aman has helped me a lot.

169
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,540
This is to show my appreciation.

170
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,960
Aman said she has a message for Chieftain.

171
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,460
She said she misses the honey candy from southern region.

172
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,030
Honey candy?

173
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,660
Aman.

174
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,690
Aman, you're back.
