[Episode 1]

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,560
The Empress Dowager wore crimson 
to pay homage to the late Emperor.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,440
The late Emperor would surely be delighted.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,930
[Empress Dowager Lyu Shao]

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,880
The late Emperor passed away.

[Funeral]

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,680
The new Emperor, Li Dun, disregarded 
the opposition of his ministers,

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,640
insisting on confining Empress Dowager Lyu Shao 
in Chengqian Palace.

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,600
How dare you!

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,870
[New Emperor Li Dun]

12
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,040
Then I shall be daring!

13
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,200
To get rid of Li Dun's control,

14
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,480
[Taiji Palace]

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,320
Lyu Shao thought of using 
the Miao witchcraft of body-switching.

16
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,070
[The Duel of Hearts]

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,640
Lyu Xun has a wolfish ambition

18
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,600
and intends to rebel.

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,480
The 300 loyal warriors of the Wen family

20
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,720
are willing to kill the traitor 
for Your Majesty,

21
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,040
enforcing strict discipline in the court.

22
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,420
[Noble Consort Wen Zhao]

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,560
The Empress Dowager seems to disagree.

24
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,680
The Empress Dowager is the sister 
of the sinner, Lyu Xun.

25
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,360
I humbly request the Empress Dowager 
to consecrate the flag

26
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:29,840
for the warriors of the Wen family.

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,479
How do you want to get that done?

28
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,080
Have you heard of human swine, 
Empress Dowager?

29
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,120
It involves gouging out the eyes,

30
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,440
cutting off the tongue,

31
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,280
chopping off the limbs,

32
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,240
and then throwing the person 
into a wine barrel.

33
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,510
Go away!

34
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,600
For everything that happened in the past,

35
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,520
I owe you a great deal.

36
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,560
I suppose you've tortured me enough 
these past three months.

37
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,000
Let me go.

38
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,520
You think this is enough?

39
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,680
Li Dun, have you gone mad?

40
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,560
Mad?

41
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,079
You seduced my father,

42
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,880
becoming his favorite overnight.

43
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,120
Did you ever think that one day I'd go mad?

44
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,120
Your father forced me to marry him.

45
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,880
Your family is helping Dun

46
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,000
plot to usurp the throne,

47
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,120
isn't it?

48
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,400
Either you marry me,

49
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,720
or I'll kill him.

50
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,320
By imperial decree, I am here 
to welcome Imperial Mother to the palace.

51
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,880
But now...

52
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,360
You won't believe anything I say.

53
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,680
Isn't this what you want?

54
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,800
Are you satisfied now?

55
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,080
I am not satisfied.

56
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,080
I owe you an apology.

57
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,520
If you can't let it go,

58
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,080
I am willing to live a life of solitude.

59
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,600
I don't want that.

60
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,800
Because I hate you.

61
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,720
Rest assured,

62
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,640
you won't see me again after tonight.

Your Highness.

66
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,159
The Empress Dowager has disappeared.

67
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,920
We've caught the person 
who helped her escape.

68
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,400
That person was dressed like a Miao shaman.

69
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,360
We didn't dare to act rashly.

70
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,400
It seems you want to leave the palace alive.

72
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:02,840

00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,280
Why can you

77
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,360
effortlessly get everything I desire?

78
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,240
Tonight,

79

A'Man said she would help me switch bodies.

81
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,640
But where has she gone?

00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,560
Imperial Mother, don't you want freedom?

87
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,400
I've come to help you.

88
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,400
Wen Zhao, you want to kill me!

89
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,480
You're the one I'm here to kill.

[Ya Pavilion]

91
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,200
Lyu Shao, I'm sorry.

92

Where am I?

93
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,400
Li Dun, what are you doing?

94
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,080
I'll ask you only once.

95
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,480
Why is the Empress Dowager unconscious?

96
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,360
Am I not perfectly fine?

97
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,040
Let go of me.

Let go of me.

99

You let go of me.

100
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,240
Why is it Wen Zhao's face?

101
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,760
This isn't right.

102
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,630
I don't want to become Wen Zhao.

103
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,920
