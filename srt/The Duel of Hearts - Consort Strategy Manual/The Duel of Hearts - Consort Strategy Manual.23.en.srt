Hurry up.

5
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:45,820
Stop!

7
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,510
All of you may leave now.

9
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,150
That's great.

10
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,550
You're alright.

11
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,650
I owe Wen Zhao a big thank you

12
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,970
for saving me from the Wu tribe,

13
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,960
also got me a position from my cousin.

14
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,740
I arranged Lyu Xun's funeral.

15
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,400
I only realized it after I became the Shang Yi.

16
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,200
There are so many interesting things 
in the world.

17
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,200
Where's the coffin? 
Why isn't my brother's coffin here?

18
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,650
Lyu Xun was a general 
of a different surname.

19
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,979
My cousin allowed me to set up a memorial hall 
for him in the palace.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,280
This is already a tremendous imperial favor.

21
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,520
What more do you want?

22
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,150
Brother.

23
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:43,420
It was Shao who harmed you.

24
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,300
I am sorry.

25
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,170
Why does she seem different from before?

26
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,640
Did you not kill Lyu Xun?

27
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,090
If you were framed,

28
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,800
tell me the truth.

29
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,140
I'll tell my cousin for you.

30
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,070
No.

31
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,000
It was me.

32
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,890
I'm the one who caused my brother's death.

33
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,830
If it weren't for me,

34
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,009
he wouldn't have died.

35
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,150
Let me atone for my sins!

36
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,750
Let me atone for my sins!

37
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,760
Murdering your brother 
is unforgivable and deserves death.

38
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,050
You were supposed to be executed today.

39
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,800
But Noble Consort Wen is with child.

40
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:25,090
My cousin won't let her 
see bloodshed and execution.

41
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,630
So he's sparing your life for now.

42
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,690
You will keep vigil for Lyu Xun here.

43
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,600
For a full forty-nine days.

44
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,120
The incense must not be interrupted.

45
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,440
Nor the candle flame must not go out.

46
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,800
You're only allowed to drink water.

We'll see if you have the luck to make it out alive.

I, the guilty woman Lyu Shao,

for your kindness.

you always take me to play
on the city walls outside the palace?

Shao.

81
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,640
As soon as your brother died,

82
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,670
Minister Wen submitted seven memorials 
in succession.

83
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,360
Lyu Xun's tiger tally is still missing,

84
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,530
so he's set his sights 
on the Lyu family's army.

85
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,390
Such wolfish ambition is truly detestable.

86

to calm down.

Let's hear it.

90
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,100
Minister Wen must think  I am pregnant,

91
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,250
and I will likely give birth to a prince.

92
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,150
That's why he dares to be so unrestrained.

93
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,170
Your Majesty is a genius.

94
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,440
What's the harm of his trap?

95
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,150
We can catch him off guard later,

96

and capture them all in one fell swoop.

97
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:25,470

that will bring disaster.

99
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,410
do you really think

100
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,490
I should hand over the army that Lyu Xun built

101

102

I know Your Majesty has my interests at heart.

103

to bring down Minister Wen.

Rest assured, Your Majesty.

I will collaborate 
under the identity of Wen Zhao.

106

It will surely be foolproof.

although we fought bitterly over Shao,

112
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,700
we were still ruler and subject after all.

disbanding and reorganizing the Lyu family army.

It's unforgivable by heaven's law.

184
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,560
I beg Your Majesty to punish me.

185
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:06,250
[Chengqian Palace]

186
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,490
Sentence me to death.

187
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,860
Please grant me a death sentence.

188
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:11,960
Lyu Xun.

189
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,590
Did you really kill them?

190
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,930
Your Majesty, didn't you hear it that day?

191
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,250
Lyu Xun said it himself.

192
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,100
I was the one who poisoned them.

193
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,420
Wen Zhao.

194
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,700
Wen Zhao?

195
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,570
The real Wen Zhao.

196
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,230
What is spoken by one's own mouth

197
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,210
is not necessarily the truth.

198
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,080
Is the Wen Zhao that Lyu Xun spoke of

199
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:42,890
really you?

200
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,790
No.

201
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,940
It's no me.
