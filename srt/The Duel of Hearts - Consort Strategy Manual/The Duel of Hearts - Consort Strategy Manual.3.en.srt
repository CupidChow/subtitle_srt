[Episode 3]

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,460
Wen Zhao,

4
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,410
why have you been acting so strange lately?

5
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,080
Don't play hard to get.

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,280
You used to

7
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,890
like to be

8
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,900
this intimate with me, didn't you?

9
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,450
I'm just tired, Your Majesty.

10
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,780
I don't mean anything else.

11
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,240
You'd better be honest with me.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,940
As long as you obey my orders,

13
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,280
I won't make things difficult for you.

14
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,700
My ministers,

15
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,259
have you found a way to cure the Empress Dowager?

16
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,680
Your Majesty is filial and benevolent,

17
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,860
but the Empress Dowager is not blessed.

18
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,200
[Wen Dingfu, Prime Minister]

19
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,550
We can't go against her fate.

20
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,080
What do you think we should do?

21
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,440
In my opinion,

22
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,900
Lv Xun's parents died early.

23
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,520
He and the Empress Dowager have no other families in the world.

24
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,710
Once the Empress Dowager dies,

25
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,120
Lv Xun will surely become distraught.

26
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,760
It would be the best chance to take him down.

27
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,620
Minister Wen, you're deeply concerned about this matter.

28
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,250
How about

29
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:23,800
I give my throne to you?

30
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,720
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

31
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,290
Lv Xun is guilty, but he doesn't deserve death.

32
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,390
But you...

33
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,280
you want to kill Empress Dowager today.

34
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,050
Is your next step to kill me?

35
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,710
I am terrified, Your Majesty.

36
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,100
What about the rest of you?

37
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,290
Noble Consort,

38
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,620
His Majesty has gotten into an argument

39
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,090
with ministers over Empress Dowager.

40
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,630
Your Majesty, according to the late emperor's edict,

41
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,329
Empress Dowager should have been buried with him.

42
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,150
Moreover, rumor has it that Empress Dowager caused disruption in the harem.

43
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,270
Whether true or false,

44
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,460
for the sake of the royal family's reputation,

45
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,450
we can't keep her alive, Your Majesty.

46
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,240
You want Empress Dowager dead?

47
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,110
Then I want you dead!

48
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:12,930
Li Dun!

49
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,270

50
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,110
call His Majesty by his name!

51
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,730
If Minister Wen has committed any wrongdoing,

52
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:23,990
Your Majesty should punish him as you see fit.

53
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,910
Innocent officials should not be implicated.

54
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,579
If Empress Dowager were here,

55
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:30,650
she would surely not want to see Your Majesty become like this.

56
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,100
You've finally spoken your true thoughts.

57
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,410
You also want Empress Dowager dead,

58
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,230
don't you?

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,650
