00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,560
Li Dun! Li Dun!

4
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,100
The antidote.

5
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,230
The antidote.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,880
Hurry up.

7
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,330
I'm just fooling them.

8
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,190
You've got to face the music now.

9
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,640
Give me the pouch.

10
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,060
I got it.

11
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,460
You were stalking me.

12
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,660
I was worried about you.

13
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,080
Are you all right?

14
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,260
Li Dun!

15
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:30,210
I'm fine.

16
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,950
Both bowls of wine were poisoned.

17
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,650
I held it in with my internal energy.

18
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,840
Fortunately,

19
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,440
I drank it for you.

20
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,539
Li Dun! Li Dun!

21
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,320
The antidote.

22
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,729
After taking the antidote,

23
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,950
he should be fine now.

24
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,680
Who are you actually looking for?

25
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,479
There is no need to talk about it.

26
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,320
[Shoukang Palace]

27
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,160
The plan was supposed to be foolproof.

28
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,050
I lured her to meet me at the black market

29
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:22,000
and made her willingly drink 
the poisoned wine.

30
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,800
But someone showed up out of nowhere.

31
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,710
The Emperor said he would drink it for her,

32
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,360
and you just let him do it?

33
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,320
Speaking of which,

34
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,440
how did you manage to

35
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,040
handle Chuchenzi so easily

36
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,550
and impersonate him?

37
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,210
How did you manage to do that?

38
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,600
Could it be

39
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,820
that you couldn't bear to kill 
your former Master?

40
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,750
Is that so?

41
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,290
I wouldn't dare.

42
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,730
I have never seen her as my Master.

43
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,010
You've always been my only Master.

44
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,830
Is the Emperor dead?

45
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,600
He seems to have taken the antidote already.

46
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,590
Master,

47
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,770
what about my antidote?

48
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,870
You've messed things up like this

49
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,020
and you still expect the antidote?

50
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,710
Master.

51
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,360
Master.

52
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,110
I haven't fully recovered from the poison.

53
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,670
And my arms feel weak.

54
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,560
Feed me.

55
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,270
With your mouth.

56
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,770
Are you going to drink it or not?

57
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,650
Yes.

58
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,560
Yes, I'll drink it.

59
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,720
What's wrong?

60
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,920
I've told Chan to prepare some hot water.

61
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,780
You can take a bath later.

62
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,140
How about we take a bath together?

63
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,090
I won't go. It's too cold.

64
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,760
Unless you bathe me.

65
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,710
With the sun blazing in the sky,

66
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,770
you're telling me it's cold?

67
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,159
I don't care.

68
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,490
Throughout the day,

69
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,990
I can't be apart from you for even a moment.

70
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:12,890
Then I'll bring water to wipe you down.

71
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,620
Sounds good.

72
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,659
Here comes the water.

73
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,920
A little to the left.

74
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,520
A bit higher.

75
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,930
Yes, yes, just like that.

76
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,870
Gently, gently.

77
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,010
More gently, please.

78
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,300
Shao,

79
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,240
why has your strength increased so much?

80
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,760
Alright then.

81
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,480
Wipe here instead.

82
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,850
Wipe slowly.

83
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,370
This way

84
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,000
you'll be able to feel my heart.

85
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,540
How come it's you?

86
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,740
Who did Your Majesty think it would be?

87
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,640
Your Majesty, since your poison 
has been cleared,

88
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,490
you should return to the palace soon.

89
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,970
I will take care of Shao.

90
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,670
You already know who she is?

91
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,430
Thank you for reminding me, Your Majesty.

92
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,500
Then presumably you just saw

93
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,360
that Shao and I have already...

94
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,650
I didn't see anything, Your Majesty.

95
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,950
I only know that Shao is tired of 
palace intrigues

96
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,380
and wishes to return home to live with me.

97
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,590
Lyu Xun.

98
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,659
If I were born into an ordinary family,

99
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,050
I would have to call you brother-in-law.

100
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,380
What do you mean by that, Your Majesty?

101
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,409
Shao is already my Noble Consort.

102
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,270
That's impossible.

103
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,420
She is your Imperial Mother.

104
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,310
She's merely occupying Wen Zhao's body.

105
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,300
Nominally, she's already 
my Noble Consort.

106
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,820
But she's a deposed consort now.

107
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,270
Xun.

108
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,040
An elder brother is like a father.

109
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,240
I hope you can give your blessing 
to Shao and me.

110
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,050
Your Majesty, please address me 
as Supreme General.

111
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,910
Shao married the late Emperor to save you.

112
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,030
Now the late Emperor has passed away.

113
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,640
You should have set her free 
a long time ago.

114
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,040
What did you say?

115
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,320
The late Emperor somehow saw

116
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,550
a portrait of Shao hunting

117
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,490
and wanted to make her his consort.

118
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,190
Shao steadfastly refused

119
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,370
until she was threatened with your life.

120
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:00,450
Shao!

121
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,960
I thought Shao was just kind-hearted,

122
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,620
afraid that you would die unjustly.

123
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,340
I didn't expect that you two 
already had a secret affair.

124
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,070
It was I who brought Shao into trouble.

125
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,550
Your Majesty, it's not too late 
to make amends now.

126
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,360
You and Shao are not meant to be together.

127
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,170
It's better to let her leave the palace 
and live with me.

128
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,450
If Your Majesty has thought it out,

129
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,560
please return to the palace today.

130

[Lyu Mansion]

131
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,710
[Mount Yandang]

132
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,680
Mount Yandang.

133
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,260
Mount Yandang is a hard-to-reach wilderness,

134
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,650
where wild beasts frequently haunt.

135
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,270
How could A'Man's tribe live there?

136
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,950
His Majesty should return to the palace today.

137
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,860
So soon. Has he fully recovered?

138
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,320
You don't know it.

139
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,890
His Majesty's poison was cleared long ago.

140
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,530
He's been faking it for these past few days.

141
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:26,860
I...

142
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,910
I know it.

143
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,520
I've been troubling you these days.

144
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,810
I will find another place to stay.

145
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:32,490
That won't be necessary.

146
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,360
You can always stay at my residence.

147
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,540
It's lacking a hostess.

148
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,460
What do you mean by this, General?

149
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,130
To be honest,

150
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,790
I want His Majesty to grant us marriage.

151
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,920
General, be careful with your words.

152
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,600
I am His Majesty's consort.

153
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,440
If someone with ill intentions 
overheard you,

154
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,230
it would cause great turmoil.

155
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,210
You may wish to spend your life with him,

156
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,650
but he is, after all, the Emperor.

157
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,500
You won't be the only woman in his palace.

158
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,610
As his consort, you have to stay in the palace.

159
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,430
Are you truly content with that?

160
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,160
I'm not content.

161
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,310
Then marry me.

162
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,000
I can give you what you want.

163
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,000
I am already His Majesty's consort.

164
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,510
I know you've already been deposed.

165
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,430
His Majesty has always wanted the military power.

166
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,490
I can offer the tiger tally as an exchange.

167
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,880
You're going to trade the military power 
for me?

168
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,820
Yes.

169
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,280
General, isn't there a woman

170
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,760
whom you've deeply loved for many years?

171
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,470
Just consider me easily swayed by beauty.

172
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,740
Whenever I see you,

173
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,500
I forget about her.
