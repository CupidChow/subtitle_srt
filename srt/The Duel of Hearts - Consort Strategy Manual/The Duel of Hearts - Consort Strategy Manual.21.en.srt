[Episode 21]

3
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:42,790
Shao!

4
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:44,840
Shao.

5
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:47,670
Shao, you're finally awake.

6
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,900
Your Majesty.

7
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,260
Why are you here?

8
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,440
I know you didn't want to come back.

9
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,500
But you were unconscious.

10
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,050
The old chieftain was dead.

11
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,030
I had no other choice.

12
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:07,210
It's alright.

13
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:08,840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

14
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:09,880
Shao.

15
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,140
Are you hungry?

16
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,090
I'll have Chan make you something to eat.

17
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:15,670
I'm not hungry.

18
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,170
Then you rest well.

19
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,380
I'll be right here,

20
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:22,780
keeping you company.

21
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:25,770
Your Majesty.

22
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,789
Please go back first.

23
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,830
I wish to be alone for a while.

24
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,700
Alright.

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,770
I'll be off then.

26
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,560
I, Wen Zhao, am back.

27
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,940
Come with me.

28
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,320
Chieftain.

29
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,700
Chieftain.

30
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,510
Chieftain, are you alright?

31
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,300
I know you are not A'Man.

32
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,740
And the one who married you was not A'jiao.

33
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,390
She left.

34
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,950
She was determined to leave the Wu tribe.

35
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,050
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,090
I...

37
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,610
A'Man

38
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,960
really told you

39
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,660
she missed the honey candy from Miaojiang?

40
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,020
She

41
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,160
was homesick.

42
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,320
Since you are someone A'Man trusts,

43
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,910
then you are a friend of our tribe.

44
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,120
Don't worry.

45
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,090
I will help you

46
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,290
fulfill your wish.

47
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:58,840
Thank you.

48
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,710
Your Highness, His Mejasty has personally
prepared some soup for you.

49
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,050
He asked you to drink some of it.

50
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,530
He will be here shortly.

51
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,300
I need to think carefully.

52
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,080
How can I not let you down

53
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,680
with my return?

54
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,300
The emperor has arrived.

55
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:49,840
Your Majesty.

56
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,420
Shao,

57
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,330
I am so happy.

58
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,530
What's the matter, Your Majesty?

59
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,550
I'm going to have a child.

60
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,120
We're going to have a child.

61
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,710
A child?

62
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,820
Stop pretending. If it weren't
for Dr. Xu telling me,

63
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,070
I’d still be in the dark.

64
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,150
I just didn't know how to bring it up.

65
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,480
Dr. Xu told me.

66
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,390
The first three months are the most crucial.

67
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,060
During this time, don't think
about anything.

68
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,480
Just focus on your rest.

69
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,440
I'm not that delicate.

70
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,620
I wanna go check on Zhao.

71
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,170
I heard she suddenly fell into a coma.

72
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,710
It's been three days already.

73
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,140
The imperial physicians are there
to treat her.

74
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,710
Shao, don't worry about anything.

75
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,530
But she is still occupying
my body after all.

76
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,780
I still wanna go check on her.

77
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:42,860
Alright.

78
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:44,940
I'll go with you.

79
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,190
Your Majesty,

80
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,610
you should stay in the palace.

81
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,580
You're the one who needs to rest.

82
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,970
You must be exhausted these days.

83
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,040
I'm not tired.

84
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,520
If you go by yourself.

85
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,830
I'm not at ease.

86
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,660
Zhao is in a coma now.

87
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,960
Even if she wakes up,

88
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,110
I'm not afraid of her.

89
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,220
I have you to back me up, don't I?

90
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,360
Of course.

91
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,240
Moreover,

92
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,690
I still have the Wen family in my grasp.

93
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,340
Zhao wouldn't dare to harm me.

94
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,930
Finally, you've learned to be smart.

95
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,520
To deal with her, you need to
strike at her weakness.

96
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,820
Zhao values her family more than
her own life.

97
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,800
She wouldn't dare to risk her family.

98
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,090
Your Majesty, rest well.

99
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,550
I'll be back soon.

100
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,090
Alright.

101
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,200
You must be very careful.

102
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,409
[Shoukang Palace]

103
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,780
In the end, you will still die by my hand.

104
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,720
How dare you, servant!

105
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:16,890
Your Highness.

106
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,900
What are you doing?

107
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,720
I heard that Empress Dowager is in a coma.

108
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,000
I've come to bring her medicine.

109
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,860
She is not in a coma.

110
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,460
She's just been sleeping for a long time.

111
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,789
You've had conflicts with
Empress Dowager before.

112
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:36,679
You choose this moment to seek revenge

113
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,090
is rather dishonorable.

114
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,169
Yuzhu,

115
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,570
don't you want the antidote anymore?

116
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,130
I don't know anything about an antidote.

117
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,160
If you have no other business,

118
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,540
please leave Shoukang Palace immediately.

119
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,290
Fine.

120
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,540
Wait for your death.

121
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,130
You're right.

122
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,190
Killing her now

123
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,000
would be too easy on her.

124
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,000
Lv Shao.

125
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,940
This time, I will protect you with my life.

[Chengqian Palace]

127
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,820
I have urgent matters to discuss
with His Majesty.

128
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,690
His Majesty is busy with
state affairs today.

129
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,270
He has ordered not to see anyone.

130
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,120
A'Bu!

131
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,500
I really do have important matters.

132
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,410
You're the last person His Majesty
wants to see.

133
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,980
Why are you doing this?

134
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,480
Then please inform His Majesty,

135
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,620
tell him I have something
to discuss with him.

137
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:42,880
Empress Dowager!

138
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:43,540
You...
