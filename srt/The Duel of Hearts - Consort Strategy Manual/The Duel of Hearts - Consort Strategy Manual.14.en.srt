[Episode 14]

3
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,310
[Lyv's Residence]

4
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,230
Noble Consort Wen, you're awake.

5
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,090
Jin Zhi.

6
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,420
How does Noble Consort know my name?

7
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,850
Where is your general?

8
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,980
A painting in my sister’s chamber was accidentally burned.

9
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,430
I've heard that the Noble Consort is skilled in painting.

10
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,740
Could you help me restore it?

11
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,940
I would be honored to do that.

12
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:48,060
♫ I once prayed for a snowfall, ♫

13
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,710
♫ To silence the flames of war spreading across the land... ♫

14
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,500
♫ When will the displaced find their way home? ♫

15
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:04,950
♫ When will the world return to its golden age? ♫

16
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,830
I’ll get a new one.

17
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:08,840
♫ The sins buried beneath the Bodhi tree, will soon come to an end... ♫

18
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:09,690
No need.

19
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,010
♫ If war ceases and ice melts away,♫

20
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,240
♫ If I die today, let me rest in the wilderness ♫

21
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,210
♫ If my heart wasn’t tied to the world’s suffering ♫

22
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,800
♫ Why would I fear life and death ♫

23
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,350
♫ When peace reigns and the full moon rises ♫

24
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,430
♫ Then I shall drink with you under the lantern light, sword in hand ♫

25
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,110
♫ A warrior dares to lead the way ♫

26
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,390
♫ Leaving behind all worldly attachments ♫

27
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,630
♫ If fate is cruel, then let a single kiss be our farewell ♫

28
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,140
It really looks almost identical to Shao’s painting.

29
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,340
[The pine-filled courtyard, a retreat for quiet study—perfect for one seeking peace.]

30
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,370
Now my brother should finally believe me.

31
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,950
♫ The sins buried beneath the Bodhi tree, will soon come to an end... ♫

32
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,680
♫ If war ceases and ice melts away♫

33
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:29,000
♫ If I die today, let me rest in the wilderness ♫

34
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,470
She really is Shao.

35
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,880
What exactly is going on?

36
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,820
♫ If my heart wasn’t tied to the world’s suffering ♫

37
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,079
These eyes… they don’t look like my General’s.

38
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,860
♫ Why would I fear life and death ♫

39
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,050
♫ When peace reigns and the full moon rises ♫

40
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,950
Do they not? I think they look quite similar.

41
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,170
♫ I’ll spar with you once more under the lantern’s glow ♫

42
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:43,990
♫ A warrior dares to lead the way ♫

43
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,560
Noble Consort Wen is talented.

44
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,120
♫ Leaving behind all worldly attachments ♫

45
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,520
But compared to Shao

46
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,030
still lacking.

47
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,250
♫ We'll part after a kiss.♫

48
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,490
I’ll find another chance.

49
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,000
I understand, Your Majesty.

50
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,060
[The returning bird flies home at dawn.]

51
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,480
The "returning bird" refers to Norble Consort,

52
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,410
And the "clouds" refer to you.

53
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,070
This poem is a message for Norble Consort.

54
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,089
[Beyond the ends of the earth, it finds rest upon distant peaks.]

55
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,600
The world outside is vast,

56
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,390
She can fly wherever she wishes.

57
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,390
And when she's tired, she can return to you.

58
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,910
It’s a good poem.

59
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,580
However,

60
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,430
It does carry a bit of a resentful husband’s tone.

61
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,670
Oh, what do you know?

62
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,810
Take this to Chan.

63
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,050
And,

64
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,460
Send all the things I prepared for Noble Consort as well.

65
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,390
Aye.

66
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,530
You’ve practically moved the entire palace here for me.

67
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,159
Majesty was worried you wouldn’t be used to living in the General’s residence.

68
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,240
These,

69
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,360
were all packed by himself.

70
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,400
Majesty truly missing you

71
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,560
every moment.

72
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,900
[The returning bird flies home at dawn.]

73
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,280
Majesty knows you desire freedom,

74
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,190
So he temporarily stripped you of your title,

75
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:21,120
[Beyond the ends of the earth, it finds rest upon distant peaks.]

76
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,680
To prevent unnecessary criticism.

77
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,760
Don't worry,

78
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,500
you'll be reinstated when you return to the palace later.

79
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,840
[Lyv's Residence]

80
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,010
General, do you have time today?

81
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,710
It’s my day off.

82
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,070
What can I do for you, Your Highness?

83
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:49,070
Would the General be willing to take me to practice archery?

84
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,900
It seems Shao won't give up until I acknowledge her.

85
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,790
But once the truth is out,

86
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,050
We’ll return to being siblings.

87
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,440
I can’t let that happen.

88
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,350
If the Consort wishes so, I would be honored.

89
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,100
General, how’s this?

90
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:38,610
Not quite there yet.

91
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,530
Lower your shoulders, straighten your back.

92
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,850
Grip the bow correctly,

93
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,380
Draw the arrow steadily.

94
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,250
Picture your greatest enemy.

95
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,340
Don’t you hate him?

96
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,190
Aim for his head.

97
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,420
Your Majesty.

98
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,450
If you truly feel nothing for him,

99
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,820
Then do it.

100
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,909
Kill this unfilial traitor for me.

101
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,390
Move aside!

102
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,080
Watch out!

103
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,560
Li Dun has long taken the throne.

104
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,040
No one dares to use him as target practice anymore.

105
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,520
What's wrong?

106
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,850
For a moment,

107
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,030
I mistook him for a living person.

108
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,390
So this is what it feels like to be in love with Shao.

109
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,160
There are peanuts in this.

110
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,400
You’re allergic—you can’t eat it.

111
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,600
How do you know that?

112
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,270
Only Shao knows that.

113
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,050
Brother, I am Shao.

114
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,200
I truly am Shao.

115
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,200
You… you’re really Shao?

116
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,240
Shao is this desperate to be acknowledged—

117
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,440
She must be in trouble.

118
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,720
Nobleb Consort has been staying at the Lyv's Residence for quite some time.

119
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,470
She’s been trying to please us again and again

120
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,820
She must need something.

121
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,280
Why not just say it directly?

122
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,310
Forget it. There’s something more important.

123
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,080
I do have a place I want to go.

124
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,280
In the black market on the west side of the city, there’s a man called Chuchenzi.

125
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,430
They say he knows everything.

126
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,130
Would the General accompany me there?

127
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,770
Why are you looking for him?

128
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,960
I want to find a friend.

129
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:03,960
Perhaps

130
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,090
Through Chuchenzi’s knowledge,

131
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,160
I can uncover the whereabouts of the A'Man people.
