[The Duel of Hearts]

2
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,910
[Episode 19]

3
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,610
Aman asked me 
to deliver a message to the Chieftain.

4
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,390
She said she really misses the honey candy
 from the Southern Regions.

5
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,160
Honey candy.

6
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,870
Aman.

7
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,000
Aman, you're back!

8
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,080
I'm not Aman.

9
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,140
It's good you're back.

10
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,500
Hurry inside.

11
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,600
Come with me please.

12
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,910
Aman is back!

13
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,000
It's good you're back.

14
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,060
You must be exhausted from the journey.

15
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,210
You're not leaving this time, right?

16
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,700
I won't leave if that makes you happy.

17
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,440
That's great.

18
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,320
So,

19
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,760
do you realize your mistake this time?

20
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,390
I do.

21
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:36,440
I shouldn’t have snuck out
 and made you worry.

22
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,280
I won’t do it again.

23
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,950
I promise.

24
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:49,280
Then… can you do me a favor?

25
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,720
You always know how to sweet-talk me.

26
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,610
What favor?

27
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,110
Say it.

28
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,560
I have a friend who swapped bodies
 with someone else by mistake;

29
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,930
and got into a lot of trouble.

30
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,600
Can you help her switch back?

31
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,340
Is that all?

32
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,500
No problem.

33
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,600
However,

34
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,280
you have to promise me one thing in return.

35
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,440
Then tell me first.

36
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,240
I'll see if I can agree.

37
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,420
You and Ajiao should marry;

38
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,820
and continue 
the family line of the Wu tribe.

39
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,740
[Shoukang Palace]

40
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,230
[They have arrived at the Wu tribe.]

41
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,480
They really found it.

42
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,240
Yuzhu.

43
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,570
Go deliver a letter to the general;

44
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,240
and tell him

45
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,010
I’d like him to watch a good show.

46
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,180
But Lyu Xun already knows your identity.

47
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,829
As long as Lyu Xun 
still wants his sister back,

48
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,750
he can be used by me.

49
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,440
As long as I can use him to kill Li Dun,

50
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,810
I will win.

51
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,690
What exactly is it

52
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,420
that you want?

53
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,590
Power.

54
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,320
To win greater power for the Wen family;

55
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,450
and never be at the mercy of others.

56
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,480
Leave

57
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,090
by tomorrow morning.

58
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,490
I won't leave.

59
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,700
You've seen the Chieftain's condition.

60
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,380
He's muddled now.

61
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,840
What are you staying for?

62
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,070
To marry you, of course.

63
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,880
I appreciate your intention

64
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,420
to make the Chieftain happy.

65
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,800
But marriage is a serious matter.

66
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,370
How can it be taken lightly?

67
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,310
Do you think I'm joking?

68
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,060
What are you doing?

69
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,410
Am I not attractive?

70
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,450
I already have someone I care about.

71
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,560
Why can't you take a joke?

72
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,149
You are impossible!

73
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:30,720
You...

74
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,700
When did you come in?

75
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,560
What？Am I disturbing you two

76
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,060
as one-night lovers, huh?

77
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,120
It was just an act.

78
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,810
Are you angry?

79
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,870
The Chieftain is muddled.

80
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,600
We can't really count on him.

81
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,330
Aman is already dead.

82
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,120
The Chieftain is our only hope now.

83
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,590
What if he regains consciousness

84
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,920
in the middle of the wedding banquet 
out of excitement?

85
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,090
What if?

86
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,150
Even if he doesn't regain consciousness,

87
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,540
I still want to fulfill his wish.

88
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,080
It's like paying filial piety 
on behalf of Aman.

89
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:11,810
What about me?

90
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,300
Thirteen.

91
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,400
I don't agree.

92
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,140
Even a fake one is not acceptable.

93
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,820
You said you would help me.

94
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:24,930
I won't help anymore.

95
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,640
I regret it.

96
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,010
Then I regret it too.

97
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,360
Cousin, there are bugs in my room.

98
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,480
I'm so scared.

99
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,100
Please come and help me.

100
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,780
Go, then.

101
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,400
No.

102
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:38,930
Go.

103
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,400
No.

104
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,240
Go!

105
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,210
Come to her side.

106
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,320
Shao.

107
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:45,740
Shao!

108
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,170
Cousin, let's hurry over there.

109
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,750
Let's go.

110
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,300
This tea is actually warm.

111
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,720
Come out.

112
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,200
What's wrong with you?

113
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,820
Nothing, I might have eaten something bad.

114
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,540
Didn't you leave with Princess Jia?

115
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,090
I...

116
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,420
We are just...

117
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,740
Jealous?

118
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,150
Enough. It's late and I'm tired.

119
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,470
What are you doing?

120
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,570
No more talking. 
I'm tired and going to sleep.

121
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,270
Your Majesty.

122
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,760
You've never snored before.

123
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,840
Even a woman with moral integrity 
fears a persistent man.

124
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,060
Abu, you didn't lie to me.

125
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,760
What a lousy place this is？

126
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,070
I can't get used to the food here;

127
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,770
and I can't even sleep well.

128
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,020
I feel uncomfortable no matter what I do.

129
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,780
What's this?

130
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,340
Your wedding dress.

131
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,690
Before tonight,

132
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,110
you must finish embroidering it.

133
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,740
Actually,

134
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,669
I've never been good at needlework 
since I was young.

135
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,150
Then go back.

136
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,400
But for you,

137
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,580
even if I don’t eat or drink, 
I will finish the embroidery.

138
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,000
You...

139
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,990
You're just asking for trouble.

140
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,770
Once you finish embroidering, 
you'll get married.

141
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,750
Keep your mouth shut.

142
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,070
Cousin, I didn't say anything wrong, did I?

143
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,350
Stop arguing.

144
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,310
Later, help me embroider the wedding dress.

145
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,200
I...

146
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,930
You want me to do such menial work?

147
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,260
If not, then please leave right now.

148
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:19,100
I didn't expect you 
to be good at needlework.

149
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,040
My clothes used to tear often.

150
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,370
So I repaired them myself.

151
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:23,890
It was convenient.

152
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,790
In the palace, most people are those 
who flatter the powerful and trample on the weak.

153
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,820
Your birth mother 
wasn't particularly favored.

154
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,240
So...

155
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,750
Do you feel sorry for me?

156
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,340
Then treat me better.

157
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,090
I'm still here.

158
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,230
How do I do this?

159
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,200
Try it.

160
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,000
Stand up.

161
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:16,570
What do you mean?

162
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,880
It's not for me.

163
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,510
It's for you.

164
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,330
Nonsense.

165
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,240
You want His Majesty to be the bride?

166
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,910
If it's not you wearing it,

167
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,440
should I or Princess Jia 
marry someone else?

168
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,720
What does it have to do with me?

169
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,680
If you want to get married, go ahead.

170
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,880
But our body types are different.

171
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,640
Don't worry.

172
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,210
You just sit at the head of the bed 
at that time;

173
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,480
and wait for Ajiao to come in.

174
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,300
I'll arrange everything with Ajiao.

175
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,710
That's not acceptable either.

176
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:58,850
Ajiao.

177
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:01,730
Ajiao?

178
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,130
Ajiao.

179
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,760
Is that you, Ajiao?

180
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,390
I need to talk to you.
