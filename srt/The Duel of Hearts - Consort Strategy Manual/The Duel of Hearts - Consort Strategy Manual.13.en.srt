00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,440
Go towards Xihua Gate.

5
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,520
I’ve already arranged things with the guards there.

6
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,200
Remember, you promised me—

7
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,110
You will never return to the palace in this lifetime.

00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:23,840
Noble Consort，

11
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:25,930
Your Majesty sent us to protect you.

12
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,200
I don’t need his protection.

13
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,450
Since I have left the palace,

14
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,680
I am no longer a consort.

15
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,660
Go back.

16
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:34,759
Noble Consort...

17
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,240
Don’t call me that again.

18
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:38,220
And stop following me.

19
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,000
Go.

I’m back!

25
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:20,970
You really came back.

26
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,200
I'm sorry,

27
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,540
it’s all my fault.

28
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,280
Let’s back to the old time,

29
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,520
Stay together,

30
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,360

33
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,480
Why are you here?

34
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,560

00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,840
I will never return to the palace again.

37
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,200
Noble Consort Wen, please behave yourself.

38
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,690
Although this is outside the palace,

39
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,340
but still have the rules.

40
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,280
You are still Majesty’s beloved consort.

41
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,650
Brother, I am Shao.

42
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,330
I really am Shao.

43
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,580
Li Dun has fallen so low

44
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,490
That he would send his own consort to seduce me?

45
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,110
Isn't this my boudoir?

46
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,200
There used to be a painting here.

47
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,190
Where did it go?

48
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,700
How does she know so much about this household?

49
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,110
Noble Consort, it’s better if you stay in the guest room.

50
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,450
No need, I think this place is just fine.

51
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,680
Supreme General, go ahead and take care of your duties.

52
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,420
I must make my brother recognize me.

53
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,480
Your Majesty.

54
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,620
Noble Consort Wen has followed General Lu into the Lu Residence.

55
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,620
What?

56
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,000
This is the osmanthus wine Shao brewed before entering the palace.

57
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,070
How did you find it?

58
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,000
Wasn’t it hidden in the secret compartment of the study?

59
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:47,630
Mother said we must drink osmanthus wine on Mid-Autumn Festival.

60
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,440
Her demeanor, why does she seem so much like Shao?

61
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,540

62
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,720
Don’t go tattling to our parents again,

64
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,090
Why?

65
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,180
How do you know so much about our past?

66
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,290
You’re hurting me.

67
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,050
Noble Consort, you’d better confess,

68
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,640
Or you’ll suffer for it.

69
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,160

70
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,760
What’s wrong with you?

71
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,440

Greetings, Your Majesty!

77

Lv Xun, what are you doing?

78
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,520
I was merely helping the Noble Consort back to rest.

79
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,460
My consort

80
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,640
Is none of the Supreme General’s concern.

81
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,530
Shao,

82
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:53,920
Come back with me.

83
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,610
I won’t go back to the palace!

84
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,350
Don’t let him take me away!

85
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,190
How can I rest easy

86
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,180
Letting you leave the palace like this?

87
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,120
I don’t want to go back!

89

♫ Old dreams hide in my eyes... ♫

94
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,820
♫ Time passes, yet sorrow remains unsolved... ♫

95
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,000
♫Is it...♫

96
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,370

Your Majesty?

107
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,840
Do you still see me as your emperor?

108
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,720
This “Your Majesty”...

109
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,530
I do not understand.

110
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,960
If Your Majesty wishes for my death,

111
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,310
A decree will suffice.

112
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,190
There is no need for such tricks.

113
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,270
Lv Xun,

114
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,160
We grew up together.

115
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,680
Do you really see me as this despicable?

116
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,730
The Noble Consort came to household on purpose—

117
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,260
What else am I supposed to think?

118
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,650
She is your sister.

119
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,590
Your Majesty, you must be misunderstanding?

120
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,370
My sister, Lv Shao,

121
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,190
Has just been demoted to Imperial Concubine

122
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,960
and is confined in Shoukang Palace.

123
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:37,960
Lv Xun,

124
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,250
You are blind and foolish.

125
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,320
Shao is kindhearted.

126
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,000
Would she really harm people with disease?

127
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,480
Shao is afraid of cats

128
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,320
And yet this “Concubine Lv”...

129
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,960
People change.

130
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,960
Indeed.

131
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,140
I never thought you could be this stupid.

132
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,070
Shao was attacked after leaving the palace today.

133
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,660
I must return to deal with it.

134
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,130
You must take good care of her.

135
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,420
That is an imperial decree.

136
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,310
Yes,

137
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,730
I obey, Your Majesty's.

138
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,090
Brother!

139
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,490
Save me!

140
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,560
I am Shao!

141
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,440
This is the Jade Pendant

142
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,410
You gave me before you went to war.

143
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,930
The one who harmed Shao was you!

144
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,800
Brother, it’s me! I am Shao!

145
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,080
What nonsense are you speaking?

146
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,500
Brother, I am Shao!

147
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,560
There used to be a painting here...

148
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,560
Where did it go?

149
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,560
Osmanthus wine must be drunk on Mid-Autumn Festival...

150
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,830
Could she really be Shao?
