00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,870
[Episode 5]

3
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,930
Since Your Highness are determined to die,

4
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,210
then I am powerless to stop you.

5
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,120
Let go of me!

6
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,890
You can't kill me!

7
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,830
Our lives are linked now.

8
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,120
If I die,

9
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,200
you won't survive either!

10
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,940
Do you really think I'm that easy to fool?

11
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,950
If you don't believe me, then try it.

12
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,870
Fine, let's see.

13
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:24,770
Let go!

14
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,060
Noble Consort Wen has
 overstepped her bounds.

15
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,430
I'm only disciplining her in a fit of anger.

16
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,890
It was my improper words and actions

17
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,690
that angered the Empress Dowager.

18
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,539
I will accept whatever punishment 
the Empress Dowager deems fit.

19
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,180
But

20
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,920
I am carrying the imperial heir.

21
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,130
Please, Empress Dowager, have mercy.

22
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,890
His Majesty and I
 have never consummated our marriage.

23
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,030
We've only swapped bodies
 for merely a month.

24
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,560
How could there be an heir?

25
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,680
The heir is vital to the royal family.

26
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,410
Do you know the consequences of
 deceiving His Majesty?

27
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,270
Since Noble Consort Wen is unwell,

28
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:18,990
she shall return to the palace first.

29
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,870
We will make a decision
 after the investigation.

30
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,020
Your Highness, His Majesty ordered that 
you rest here tonight.

31
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,510
He will question you tomorrow.

32
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,630
I must have gone mad

33
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,690
to help Wen Zhao cover up the lie.

34
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,890
Why on earth did I do that?

35
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,410
A'Man.

36
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:09,750
Don't move.

37
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,590
If you miss, I'll punish you.

38
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,310
Stop it!

39
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,829
Are you alright?

40
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,400
I'm fine.

41
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,329
My Lady!

42
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,070
What's your name?

43
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,900
A'Man.

44
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,330
A'Man, stay with me from now on.

45
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,510
I'll protect you.

46
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,260
How dare you compete with me?

47
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:27,980
A'Man.

48
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,870
If I hadn't 
brought you into the palace back then,

49
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,260
perhaps

50
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,930
you have already 
returned to the southern region.

51
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,200
[Shao]

52
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,270
I didn't expect
 he would still keep this flute.

53
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,930
I'm sorry, Li Dun.

54
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,350
To get you to help me escape,

55
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,310
I have no choice 
but to take this drastic measure.

56
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,550
Do you think I'm cruel and ruthless?

57
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,050
To survive in the harem,

58
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,570
many things are beyond our control.

59
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,070
Indeed.

60
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,070
In the harem,

61
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,860
only the strong deserve to live.

62
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,690
But you are now the Empress Dowager.

63
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,110
You could actually leave here;

64
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,390
and live for yourself.

65
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,910
Yuzhu.

66
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,470
Are you an orphan?

67
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,490
Yes.

68
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,910
My parents and siblings

69
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,520
have passed away.

70
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,500
You don't understand.

71
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,710
Parents, siblings;

72
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,710
relatives and family name

73
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,130
are all ties

74
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,400
that bind me.

75
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,870
I can't go anywhere.

76
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,500
I must win.

77
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,620
Empress Dowager, my antidote...

78
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,460
As long as you perform well,

79
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,700
I will give it to you on time.

80
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,440
Be careful, Your Majesty!

81
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,630
Chan.

82
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,430
Quickly, get the medicine box!

83
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,750
His Majesty has been scratched.

84
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,190
Chan, hurry and bring the medicine box!

85
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:23,830
Yes.

86
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:32,820
Your Majesty.

87
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,670
Your Majesty, did I hurt you?

88
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,190
How do you know

89
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,670
this bandaging method?

90
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,250
I see.

91
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,500
Wen Zhao has been using Shao's methods

92
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,000
to shake my feelings.

93
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,690
I only helped you cover up the lie yesterday

94
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,220
because of the Wen family.

95
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,880
Yet you keep pushing your luck,

96
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,740
testing my limits time and again.

[The Aeom Sutra]

99
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,630
Kneel here;

100
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,500
and recite sutras 
to pray for the Empress Dowager's blessings.

101

[Taiji Palace]

102
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,010
Without my permission,

103
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,950
you are not allowed to stand up.

104
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,580
Li Dun.

105
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,710
You're becoming 
more and more like your father.

106
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,150
And it's making you harder to see through.
