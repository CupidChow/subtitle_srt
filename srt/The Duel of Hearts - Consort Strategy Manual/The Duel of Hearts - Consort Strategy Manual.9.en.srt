00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,160
what are the consequences?

184
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,700
Shao is not such a reckless person.

185
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,520
I've repeatedly told Yuzhu
to handle this carefully.

186
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,210
Look at the entire palace,

187
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,780
isn't it only that little wench who got infected?

188
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,430
Shao,

189
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,320
you've changed.

190
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,110
You have changed too, Xun.

191
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,160
I have you in my heart,

192
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,900
but what about you?

193
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,810
I have been demoted to Empress Dowager

194
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,200
and confined here.

195
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,920
When you came in,
every word was a reproach.

196
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,120
You showed no concern at all.

197
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,680
Shao.

198
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,390
Just go.

199
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,450
Leave me alone

200
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,850
to die in this palace.

201
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,770
Shao,

202
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,450
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

203
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,330
You were so harsh just now.

204
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,380
You don't care for me anymore.

205
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,960
How could I not care for you?

206
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,350
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

207
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,270
Xun,

208
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,270
in this world,

209
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,300
we only have each other, right?

210
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,370
Yes,

211
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,520
I only have you now.

212
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:01,130
[Chengqian Palace]

213
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,470
Noble Consort Wen has repeatedly challenged 
the Empress Dowager.

214
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:05,970
I was momentarily foolish

215
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,380
and stood up for my sister.

216
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,760
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

217
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,740
Don't think I don't know,

218
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,080
you're taking the blame for someone else.

219
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,320
This matter was indeed my doing alone.

220
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:16,450
Lyu Xun,

221
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:17,880
stand up!

222
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,440
Whatever the punishment,

223
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,100
I am willing to accept it.

224
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,590
Think about it.

225
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,940
Are you really protecting your sister?

226
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,490
It is no related to the Empress Dowager.

227
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,360
Hand over the prescription for the epidemic.

228
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,200
I won't pursue the matter further.

229
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,320
Wen Zhao is planted by the Wen family

230
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,520
as Your Majesty's eyes and ears.

231
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:40,740
Her death is no loss!

232
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,420
Wen Zhao's death may be insignificant,

233
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,190
but if you don't save her,

234
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,550
not only will I regret this for a lifetime

235
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
but you will too.

236
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,920
I don't understand, Your Majesty.

237
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,880
I'm merely stating the facts.

238
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:10,200
This prescription will leave side effects after use,

239
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,950
but it is indeed the only solution available at present.
