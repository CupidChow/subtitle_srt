[The Duel of Hearts]

00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,840
[Episode 24]

3
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,820
Is the Wen Zhao that Lyu Xun mentioned really you?

4
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,280
No.

5
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,240
It's not.

6
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:04,950
It's not me.

7
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,230
Who is it?

8
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:12,840
Your Majesty!

9
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:15,680
Your Majesty!

10
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:16,430
Your Majesty.

11
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,720
Why did you kill me?

12
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,950
Protect the Emperor!

13
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,650
Lyu Shao assassinated the Emperor to rebel.

14
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,810
Execute immediately!

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,759
Take her away.

16
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,150
Wen Zhao, you've broken your word.

17
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,410
Li Dun!

18
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,610
Let me go!

19
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,080
Li Dun!

20
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:45,740
Your Majesty.

21
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,080
Li Dun!

22
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,039
[Chengqian Palace]

23
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,530
Li Dun.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,280
Nanming has changed the ruler to Wen.

25
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,130
You can rest in peace now.

26
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,480
Why are you awake?

27
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,480
Don't move.

28
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,670
What's wrong?

29
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,740
How am I still alive?

30
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,810
Do you think you've imitated her well?

31
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,730
When did you find out?

32
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,550
Shao!

33
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,400
Your Majesty.

34
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,550
I am Wen Zhao.

35
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,680
Your expression just now

36
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,670
was too much like Shao.

37
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,640
Maybe it's because

38
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,440
I'm wearing her face.

39
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,990
You are Shao!

40
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,230
No matter how much you deny it,

41
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,000
I know you are Shao!

42
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,280
No.

43
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,190
I am Wen Zhao.

44
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,329
If you are Wen Zhao,

45
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,900
then kill me for your father and brother.

46
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,150
Stab here.

47
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,350
Kill me.

48
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,170
Then I will believe you are Wen Zhao.

49
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,210
Go ahead.

50
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,720
I am...

51
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,310
I am Shao!

52
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,380
I am Shao!

53
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,980
I am Shao.

54
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,210
I am Shao.

55
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,150
Impossible.

56
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,850
Impossible.

57
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,730
Father will be here soon.

58
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,160
Just you wait.

59
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,430
Father will be here soon!

60
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,690
You're all waiting for death!

61
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,800
Minister Wen has long disowned you.

62
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,540
Yet you still keep calling him father.

63
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,700
Today's defeat,

64
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,290
was due to my carelessness.

65
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,890
But I am always father's precious jewel.

66
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,330
What a precious jewel.

67
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,659
Your Majesty killed all rebels this morning.

68
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,080
Before noon,

69
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,840
Minister Wen sent a memorial to the palace.

70
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,230
He said he wants to sever all ties with you.

71
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,850
And expel you from the Wen family.

72
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,740
He even proposed

73
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,490
to have you drawn and quartered,

74
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,909
your bones ground to dust
and scattered to the wind.

75
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,320
I, Wen Dingfu,

76
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,080
will suppress the rebels for Your Majesty.

77
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,970
Wen Zhao,

78
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,680
this evil woman,

79
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,590
should be drawn and quartered,

80
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,520
her bones ground to dust
and scattered to the wind.

81
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,760
I was defeated today.

82
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,550
It's only right for father to disown me.

83
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,040
Otherwise how to protect the Wen's legacy?

84
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,430
Lyu Shao,

85
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,750
you've been an orphan since childhood.

86
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,920
You must be jealous 
that I have a loving father.

87
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,870
You!

88
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,870
Guards!

89
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,030
Noble Consort Wen Zhao raised army 
in rebellion.

90
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,740
Throw her into the death row.

91
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,230
[Zhengwu Gate]

92
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,390
Father,

93
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,830
you've come to save me.

94
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,500
Father.

95
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,350
Zhao'er, you're so foolish!

96
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,990
You're going to bring

97
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,990
complete ruin to the entire Wen clan.

98
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,080
Is this how I taught you?

99
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,240
Father, Zhao'er was wrong.

100
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,430
My plans failed,

101
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,010
and I've implicated you instead.

102
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,450
What's done is done.

103
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,210
Your self-blame is useless now.

104
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,040
I've brought you your favorite plum ginger.

105
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,240
Even if I saw the imperial edict,

106
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,950
even if I recognized Father's handwriting,

107
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,710
I still don't want to believe it.

108
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,170
Father.

109
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,770
Do you have some hidden reason?

110
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,240
Father,

111
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,600
I am Zhao'er.

112
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,480
I am your Zhao'er.

113
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,670
Father, do you want me to die, Father?

114
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,650
Great achievers ignore minor details.

115
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,230
Now,

116
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,380
to save the Wen family,
you must be sacrificed.

117
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,680
I don't want to! I don't want to!

118
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,690
Zhao'er,

119
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,180
don't blame your father for being ruthless.

120
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,750
If you must blame someone,

121
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,190
blame yourself for being incompetent.

122
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,010
The imperial edict has arrived!

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,880
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,320
Looking back on my life,

125
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,220
it's truly laughable.

126
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,750
In the end,

127
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,170
I don't even know what I'm living for.

128
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,290
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,360
I really deserve to die.

130
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,010
You're pregnant.

131
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,700
You shouldn't be overly sad.

132
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,320
If the child in your womb

133
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,840
isn't mine.

134
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,950
I will kill you with one strike.

135
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,250
But as it happens.

136
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,000
Tell me,

137
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,560
what should I do to give the child back?

138
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,710
[Ten years later]

139
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,510
Abu, move aside.

140
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,740
Young Prince, please spare me.

141
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,820
Father.

142
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,250
Wen Zhao gave birth to the Emperor

143
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,840
named Li Zhen.

144
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,080
It means,

145
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,850
to stabilize the position,

146
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,570
and command with steadiness.

147
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,260
After Wen Zhao gave birth,

148
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,030
Emperor Li Dun sent her back to hometown.

149
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,430
She can never return to the capital.

150
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,840
And Lyu Shao,

151
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,080
got freedom as she wished.

152
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,840
Travelling the world.

153
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,270
Unconcerned with details or appearances.

154
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,800
Although she is separated from Li Dun,

155
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,200
but longing is connected.
