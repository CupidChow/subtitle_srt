You would never harm anyone.

184
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,290
But Zhao is constantly trying to harm me.

185
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,240
Can't I fight back?

186
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,690
Brother.

187
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,600
Brother,

188
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,420
please help me.

189
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,370
Will you help me or not?

190
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,840
Thank you, Brother.

191
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,510
Princess Jia has arrived.

192
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,390
I heard that Noble Consort Wen
is with child.

193
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,370
I specially ordered a bowl of medicine
to be prepared

194
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,280
for your pregnancy.

195
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,090
The Empress Dowager sent you here.

196
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,320
How did you know?

197
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,620
Don't let yourself be used as
a pawn every day.

198
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,290
You've just been released from confinement.

199
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,210
You should be more careful.

200
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,280
You're calling me stupid.

201
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,320
Don't want to hear the truth?

202
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,230
Wen Zhao!

203
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,940
Some servants have reported that you
practice black magic,

204
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,300
cursing the Empress Dowager.

205
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,470
Do you admit it?

206
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,770
I advise you to leave immediately.

207
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,370
In the harem,

208
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,000
you are no match for me.

209
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,620
Whether I'm your match or not,

210
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,870
we'll know after a search.

211
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:02,830
Guards!

212
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,260
She doesn't remember it.

213
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,160
Search the palace thoroughly.

214
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,690
Help her recall and

215
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,290
See if she's done anything
she shouldn't have.

216
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,690
Princess Jia.

217
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,620
What right do you have to search my palace?

218
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,830
She doesn't have the right.

219
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,250
But I do, don't I?
