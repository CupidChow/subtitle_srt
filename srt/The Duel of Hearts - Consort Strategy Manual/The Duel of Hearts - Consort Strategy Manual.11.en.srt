You look like my crush.

I can't tell you.

Well, if I tell you,

Okay.

Do you like Li Dun?

Yes, I do.

Do you want to marry him?

But the bad old man doesn't allow it.

Who's the bad old man?

22
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,170
Why doesn't he allow it?

23
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,330
The bad old man said...

24
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,560
He said I can't talk about it.

25
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,940
Otherwise, someone will die!

Stop talking about this. I'm scared!

27
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,320
Stop talking...

28
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,170

36
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,900

00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,140
It's perfect for painting.

164

When you're feeling down,

165
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,640

Yes. After you fainted from being punished to kneel last time,

181

but I don't.

187

Let the past stay in the past.
