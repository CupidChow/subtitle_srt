[Episode 2]

3
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,560
How dare you hurt the Empress Dowager?

4
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,990
Who gave you the audacity?

5
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,880
Tell me!

6
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,690
Why couldn't I hurt her?

7
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,560
Haven't you always hated 
the Empress Dowager?

8
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,960
Stop playing dumb.

9
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,240
I shall wake you up to reality.

10
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,560
I've been accused of killing my mother

11
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,840
and become irreconcilable with General Lyu.

12
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,840
Henceforth, I can only rely on your family.

13
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,200
Isn't this your plan?

14
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,840
I'm warning you.

15
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,580
Don't even think about it.

16
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,520
Do I make myself clear?

17
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,680
Li Dun hates me so much.

18
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:50,140
Now I can't tell him

19
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,240
I am Lyu Shao.

20
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,460
Otherwise,

21
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,410
he'll definitely trap me 
in the palace forever.

22
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,950
[Hehuan Palace]

23
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,120
A'Man said she would help me 
out of the palace.

24
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,200
How did I end up switching bodies 
with Wen Zhao?

25
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,520
A'Man wouldn't betray me.

26
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,720
She must have been in trouble.

27
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,800
I need to find her first.

28
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,920
How is she?

29
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,640
My condolences, Your Majesty.

30
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,810
I'm afraid the Empress Dowager...

31
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:30,480
Shut up! Think carefully before you answer.

32
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,040
Your Majesty.

33
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,120
The Empress Dowager's pulse is not good,

34
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,960
but she's blessed by heaven.

35
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,560
Please allow me to go back 
and think of another plan.

36
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,640
If you can't save her,

37
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,079
I'll ensure the entire Imperial Hospital 
pays the ultimate price.

38
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:46,890
Yes, Your Majesty.

39
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,000
Your Highness.

40
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,240
It's said that the Empress Dowager's pulse 
can still be felt,

41
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,720
but the chances of recovery are slim.

42
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,440
His Majesty said if she couldn't be saved,

43
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,600
the entire Imperial Hospital 
would pay the ultimate price.

44
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,040
If Wen Zhao wakes up,

45
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,080
she'll surely use her new identity 
to harm the Lyu family

46
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,360
and my brother.

47
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,400
I need to switch back to my own body.

48
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,040
Come with me.

49
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,640
What are you doing?

50
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,720
They are all under my command.

51
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,560
I've got everything arranged.

[Supreme General Lyu Xun]

83

General Lyu, why don't you kneel 
before His Majesty?

84
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,940
I implore Your Majesty

85
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,800
to let the Empress Dowager leave the palace.

86
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,750
I do not approve.

87
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,280
Your Majesty, may I ask

88
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,530
why the disapproval?

89
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,350
She is my sister!

90
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,290
She is my Imperial Mother!

93

I implore Your Majesty

94
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,900
to grant her dream of returning home.

95
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,690
Your Majesty, in my opinion,

96
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,280
returning to a familiar environment

97
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,770

If Wen Zhao doesn't wake up,

104

how can I prove my identity to my brother?

105
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,320
Brother.

106
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,220
I was just about to confront you.

107
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,020
You've come to me yourself.

108
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,410
Before you kill me,

109
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,590
may I say something?

110
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,640
Go ahead.

111
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,770
This is the Yuehua jade pendant

112
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,400
you gave me before 
you went off to war,

113
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,860
isn't it?

114
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,620
You have Shao's jade pendant.

115
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,130
You're the one who hurt her!

116
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,440
Brother, it's me. I'm Shao.

117
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,620
What are you talking about?

118
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,040
Today you broke into my residence

119
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,220
with malicious intent.

120
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,540
I can kill you on the spot.

121
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,010
I'll kill you now

122
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,340
to avenge Shao!

123
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,200
Stop!

124
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,800
The Noble Consort intentionally harmed 
the Empress Dowager.

125
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,680
What are you going to do with her, 
Your Majesty?

126
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,460
I'll take no action.

127
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,300
Your Majesty truly favors 
the Noble Consort.

128
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,930
I'm protecting you.

129
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,300
The rumor in the court claims

130
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,280
that you intend to rebel,

131
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,940
so you plan to harm the Noble Consort

132
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,500
and deliberately target the Wen family

133
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,600
to undermine my key support.

134
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,250
Since it's just a rumor,

135
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:11,890
it's not credible.

136
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,180
No.

137
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,060
If the Noble Consort dies,

138
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,410
I'm afraid the rumor will be confirmed.

139
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,490
Back to the palace.

140
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,860
I sent you to offer prayers,

141
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,060
not to cause trouble for me.

142
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,990
Any further malicious intent 
towards the Empress Dowager

143
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,620
will meet with severe consequences!

144
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,900
Your Majesty, the Empress Dowager is dying.

145
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,790
Your Majesty, please spare Lyu Xun.

146
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,550
Noble Consort Wen,

147
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,070
this doesn't sound like something 
you would say.
