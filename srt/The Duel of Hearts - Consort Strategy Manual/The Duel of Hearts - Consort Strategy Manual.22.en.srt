[Episode 22]

3
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,340
What exactly do you want to say?

4
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,780
Who poisoned you?

5
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,420
Wen Zhao.

6
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,240
Wen Zhao?

7
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,700
Your Highness.

8
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,360
Lv Xun.

9
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,039
Xun!

10
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:23,520
Xun!

11
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,720
Xun!

12
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,039
Xun.

13
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:28,930
Xun!

14
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:30,820
Shao.

15
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,220
Li Dun, why did you do this?

16
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,039
Drag her out!

17
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:41,680
Wen Zhao!

18
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,360
Shao!

19
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,840
Stop pretending!

20
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,880
Li Dun, listen to me!

21
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:48,950
I am Shao!

22
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,280
I am the real Shao!

23
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,110
Li Dun!

[Shoukang Palace]

25
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,079
It's you.

26
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,020
You killed my brother.

27
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,020
You killed my brother!

28
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,770
You should at least know who
to take revenge on.

29
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,430
It was Dun who killed him.

30
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,440
Impossible.

31
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,280
Dun would never do such a thing.

32
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,510
What a poor little thing.

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Don't take a man's words too seriously.

34
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,680
How could you believe it?

35
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,780
I'm just looking out for you.

36
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:09,180
So you won't be torn between two men.

37
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,250
Zhao,

38
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,440
you're despicable.

39
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,280
Even if Dun did it,

40
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,570
it must have been at your instigation.

41
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,040
I'll kill you right now.

42
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,460
To avenge my brother!

43
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,460
It'd be two lives with one stroke.

44
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,960
Go ahead and kill me then.

45
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,260
What do you mean?

46
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,710
I'm pregnant.

47
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,770
The child is yours.

48
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:46,990
But it's in my body.

49
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,820
What trick are you trying to pull now?

50
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,890
Whether it's true or not,

51
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,790
you know best.

52
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,960
If you dare to tell Dun

53
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,950
the secret of our body swap,

54
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,370
don't blame me if I can't keep this child.

55
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,000
Don't even think about it.

56
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,310
If it comes to it, I can just give up this child.

57
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,280
If you really don't care about this child,

58
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,850
then go ahead and do it.

59
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,970
Come on.

60
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,659
Kill me!

61
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,120
If you don't want Dun to end up like Xun,

62
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,300
a sudden death.

63
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,590
You'd better keep our secret.

64
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,760
Don't forget I've been restored to the position
of Noble Consort,

65
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,330
and I'm carrying a royal heir.

66
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,760
Once he dies,

67
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,940
I can rightfully become the Empress Dowager.

68
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,680
Okay.

69
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,520
I promise you.

70
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,950
Good girl.

71
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,370
Then I'll spare your life.

72
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,010
Fun.

73
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,010
So much fun.

74
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,190
Shao,

75
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,400
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,150
Although Xun died in Chengqian Hall,

77
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,870
it was not by my hand.

78
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,600
I know.

79
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:28,970
It was Zhao.

80
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,830
Zhao killed my brother.

81
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,570
I thought

82
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,320
you would misunderstand

83
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,540
that I killed Xun.

84
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,520
How could that be?

85
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,010
It's good that you believe me.

86
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,370
You have no idea how anxious I've been
all the way here.

87
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,810
I was so afraid

88
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:01,080
that you would turn against me
because of Xun's death.

89
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,130
We've finally reunited.

90
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,840
How could I not trust you?

91
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,110
Shao,

92
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,860
I didn't expect you'd see me again.

93
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,870
Xun, what are you talking about?

94
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,540
In this world,

95
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,340
you are my only family.

96
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,820
That day...

97
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,460
That day, I was out of my mind.

98
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,590
It will never happen again.

99
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,400
We two depend on each other to live.

100
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,700
I know your feelings for me.

101
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,620
It's just that day...

102
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,580
Shao, no more words.

103
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,370
I will never force you again.

104
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,760
Drink this cup of wine,

105
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,730
and put all of it behind us.

106
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:05,610
Xun,

107
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,520
what's wrong?

108
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,810
If Shao ever

109
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,680
does something to wrong you,

110
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,750
will you blame me?

111
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,200
Never.

112
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,280
Then we'll be just like before,

113
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,210
alright?

114
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,390
Definitely.

115
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,830
Too bad I'm not her.

116
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,400
We don't have a future either.

117
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,660
Shao,

118
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,960
open your eyes and look carefully.

119
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,680
Who is really standing in front of you?

120
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,940
Wen Zhao.

121
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,170
You refused to ally with me back then,

122
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,320
forcing me to resort to such
a despicable act

123
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,260
of poisoning.

124
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,470
I'll tell Dun.

125
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,680
You've already switched back.

126
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,040
Guards!

127
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,460
The Supreme General is drunk
and attempted

128
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,140
to molest me.

129
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,620
Arrest him now!

130
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,400
Whoever captures Lv Xun

131
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,940
will be rewarded a thousand gold!

132
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,940
Useless fools!

133
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,930
I will issue an order tomorrow

134
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,100
to execute Zhao

135
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,180
to console you for the loss of your brother.

136
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,590
Your Majesty, don't.

137
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,290
Spare her life.

138
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,630
Shao,

139
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,940
I know you are kind-hearted,

140
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,710
but Zhao has a heart of venom.

141
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,550
I can't spare her.

142
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,430
It's not that I'm kind-hearted.

143
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:11,460
It's just that I'm carrying the royal heir.

144
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,440
I don't want to smell blood again.

145
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,480
Your Majesty,

146
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,040
I wish to set up a memorial hall
in the palace

147
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,380
for my brother,

148
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,610
so I can pay my respects to him.

149
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:27,510
Let Zhao keep vigil for
my brother instead.

150
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
OK.

151
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:31,860
I'll do as you wish.
