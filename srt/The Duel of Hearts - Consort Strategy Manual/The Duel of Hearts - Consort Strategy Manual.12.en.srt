[Episode 12]

3
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,310
A'Bu,

4
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:38,950
tell me, what did I do wrong?

5
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,980
I...

6
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,660
I get it!

7
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,780
Your Majesty, as the saying goes,

8
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,190
even a fierce woman can't resist a persistent pursuer.

9
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,050
You're still acting too normal.

10
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,100
You need to stick with her all the time.

11
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,040
You haven't done enough.

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,960
I've already demeaned myself so much for her.

13
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:09,390
A'Bu.

14
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,430
You're right.

15
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,980
How should I stick with her?

16
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,200
Tell me.

17
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,610
I think...

18
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,789
What is it? Tell me.

19
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,620
Your Majesty...

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,520
Just tell me!

21
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,130
Your Majesty...

22
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,050
A'Bu, get out.

23
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:32,810
Darling,

24
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,200
what brings you here?

25
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,840
You knew all along,

26
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,500
didn't you?

27
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,289
How long do you plan to keep pretending it?

28
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,280
Is it funny?

29
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:57,970
Yes,

30
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,290
I already knew that you and Wen Zhao had switched bodies.

31
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,880
Then why didn't you expose me?

32
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,610
♫Time flies like light, yet you hold it in your hand♫

33
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,260
You fooled me.

34
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,690
What do you take me for?

35
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,520
♫Look at the blooming flowers♫

36
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,590
I didn't.

37
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,490
I treated you well a few days ago

38
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,120
♫Day after day, how can I mention love?♫

39
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,050
because I really wanted to.

40
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,000
♫Who panicked?♫

41
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,510
Have you forgotten

42
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,490
I'm a heartless person

43
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,030
♫Your thoughts are hard to remember♫

44
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,630
♫I can't write anything in a rush♫

45
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,600
who always curries favor with the powerful?

46
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,840
I believe you had your reasons

47
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,130
for what you did in the past.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,010
♫If you get the wrong idea, time will fade♫

49
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,390
However, now that you've become the Noble Consort,

50
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,290
it is fate that brings us together.

51
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,370
♫Flowers blooming and withering, I have no choice♫

52
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,390
I don't have excuses.

53
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,230
Sorry to let you down, Your Majesty.

54
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,230
♫No matter what fate it is, love and hate will last for years♫

55
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,820
Please issue an edict to depose me.

56
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,910
♫The sea of stars in your eyes. The love I want in my life♫

57
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,790
Minister Wen holds immense power in the court,

58
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,490
and the Wen family is craving for more.

59
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,560
Your Majesty, if you keep Noble Consort Wen in the harem,

60
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,190
♫Time flies, yet I never forget♫

61
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,740
it will surely lead to disaster.

62
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,570
I understand what you mean,

63
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,670
♫In this life, I only want to keep you in heart♫

64
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,720
but the situation of the court

65
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,040
is far less important than what you want.

66
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,280
♫But everything in the world can't be fulfilled♫

67
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,380
Do you truly not wish to stay by my side?

68
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:56,590
♫Countless lovers by the sea beg for destiny in the next life♫

69
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,770
We are not meant to be in this life.

70
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,900
♫I'd rather endure this long calamity♫

71
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,550
Your Majesty, please move on.

72
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,330
♫But the word love in this life  is destined to be unsolvable♫

73
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:10,390
♫You bring endless snow to fall in my heart♫

74
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,570
I've drafted the edict for deposing the consort.

75
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,750
Your Majesty, please affix the imperial seal.

76
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,520
It's precisely because I want to move on

77
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,010
that I have to keep you by my side.

78
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,590
♫Flowers blooming and withering, I have no choice♫

79
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,550
Now you are Wen Zhao

80
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,340
instead of Lyu Shao.

81
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,290
♫No matter what fate it is, love and hate will last for years♫

82
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,340
They can no longer accuse us of incest between mother and son.

83
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,520
Does their silence change our relationship?

84
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,770
♫The sea of stars in your eyes. The love I want in my life♫

85
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,160
Don't forget

86
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,120
♫Time flies, yet I never forget♫

87
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,480
it was you who sent me

88
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,579
to your father's bed.

89
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,470
♫In this life, I only want to keep you in heart♫

90
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,460
You said

91
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,620
you wanted to be a good emperor who cared for the country and the people.

92
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,200
♫But everything in the world can't be fulfilled♫

93
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,150
Throughout history, which emperor wasn't decisive in their actions?

00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:49,390
♫Countless lovers by the sea beg for destiny in the next life♫

95
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,280
Who else would be so immersed in romantic affairs like you?

00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,640
♫I'd rather endure this long calamity♫

Are you still blaming me?

99
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,480
I did misunderstand you in the past.

100
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,440
♫You bring endless snow to fall in my heart♫

101
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,680
I apologize.

102
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,960
I've never blamed you, Your Majesty.

103
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,019
Your Majesty, please affix the imperial seal

104
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,580
and allow me to leave the palace.

105
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,990
Whether you blame me or not,

106
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,300
by no means will I let you leave today.

107
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,560
Put me down!

108
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,060
Where are you taking me?

109
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,680
Put me down!

110
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,520
If I can't get your heart,

111
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,810
I'll get your body!

112
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,390
Stop it! I am Lyu Shao,

113
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,530
your Imperial Mother.

114
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,170
My father is already dead.

115
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,820
Are you still unwilling?

116
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,150
Stay back.

117
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,040
Stay back!

118
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,650
Go away!

119
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,930
Put the knife down.

120
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,950
I won't come closer.

121
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,220
Don't hurt yourself.

122
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,800
I made a mistake last night.

123
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:33,990
You can hit or scold me

124
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,480
as you want.

125
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,000
I only have one wish.

126
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,730
Let me leave the palace.

127
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,550
Let me leave the palace!

128
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,650
I can fulfill

129
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,100
all your wishes,

130
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,200
except for this.

131
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,590
If you want to stab me, go ahead.

132
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:01,600
Stay back.

133
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,830
Vent your anger on me.

134
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,580
Go away! Go away!

135
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,030
-Your Majesty!
-Your Highness!

136
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,290
-What happened, Your Highness?
-Your Majesty!

137
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,400
Your Majesty!

138
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,440
What happened to you?

139
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,500
-Don't scare me!
-A'Bu,

140
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,040
summon the imperial doctor! Hurry!

141
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,720
Princess Jia has arrived.

142
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,679
I can help you get out.

143
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,030
Why are you helping me?

144
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,410
I also want you to leave.

145
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,490
I'm just helping myself.

146
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,700
Don't be foolish.

147
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,000
Even if I'm gone,

148
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,910
His Majesty still won't love you.

149
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,200
My cousin doesn't care about

150
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,780
anyone else but you.

151
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,320
You're so proud, aren't you?

152
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:16,690
Listen,

153
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,670
don't get carried away.

154
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,090
My cousin and I were childhood sweethearts.

155
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,820
If you hadn't meddled in this,

156
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,520
he would've made me a consort a long time ago!

157
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,150
It's a big wide world

158
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,730
with plenty of good men.

159
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,940
Why do you have to be so obsessed with him?

160
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,480
Do you really want to

161
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,270
spend the rest of your life in the deserted palace?

162
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,850
That's none of your concern, Your Highness.

163
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,900
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival,

164
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,120
and my cousin has ordered them to lock down the entire imperial city.

165
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:45,930
Only I

166
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,770
can get you out of the palace.

167
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,400
Tell me,

168
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,060
what do you want?

169
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,520
Once you get out,

170
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,850
don't ever come back in this lifetime.
