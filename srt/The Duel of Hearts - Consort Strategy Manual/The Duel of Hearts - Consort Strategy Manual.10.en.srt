00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,350
[Shoukang Palace]

4
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,050
What's wrong? Who bullied you?

5
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,560
Xun,

6
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,270
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,900
Everything was fine, why you apologize?

8
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,350
Then why haven't you come to see me?

9
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,260
Aren't you still mad at me?

10
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:19,730
How could that be?

11
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,140
I've just been really busy lately.

12
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:25,270
Then when His Majesty summoned you,

13
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,320
did he punish you?

14
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,180
Did he say something harsh?

15
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,289
Neither.

16
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,310
I gave His Majesty the prescription.

17
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,250
He promised not to pursue further.

18
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:37,310
The Wen family has always been against you.

19
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,530
Why did you help them?

20
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:41,670
Otherwise, why did they lift your restraint?

21
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,820
Wenzhao plots against me at every turn.

22
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,979
She gets off really easy.

23
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,530
Don't worry, even if she wakes up,

24
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,700
she won't be able to oppose you for a while.

25
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,900
Why?

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,840
Is it because of that prescription?

27
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,840
Is there something wrong with it?

28
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,150
That prescription is dangerously potent,

29
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,970
ordinary people might not withstand it,

30
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,130
and could be left with lingering effects.

31
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,270
I see.

32
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,590
Then I can rest easy.

33
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,070
I've prepared some good wine.

34
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,900
Stay with me, Xun.

35
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,550
It's getting late now.

36
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,310
I...

37
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,640
Xun, you won't stay with me?

38
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,760
You're still angry with Shao, aren't you?

39
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:23,210
What can I do with you?

40
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,640
Let's drink.

41
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:43,500
Shao is happiest when with you.

42
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,780
It's the most joyful time.

43
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,280
Shao loves you the most.

44
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:02,990
Cheers.

45
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,100
Shao.

46
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,000
We can't drink anymore.

47
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,690
It's already very late.

48
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,930
I need to go back now.

49
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,710
Xun, don't go.

50
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,010
Have one more drink with Shao, please.

51
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,290
If I don't go back now,

52
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,710
the palace gates will be locked soon.

53
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,920
The hall doors will be locked too.

54
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,170
Xun,

55
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,990
we've grown up together since childhood.

56
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,000
We're not actually blood siblings.

57
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,200
You're awake.

58
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,010
Are you feeling uncomfortable anywhere?

59
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:52,770
Are you cold?

60
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,130
Or hot?

61
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,190
Do you have a headache or feel dizzy?

62
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,300
I am not dizzy.

63
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:57,860
Then it's fine.

64
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,600
I'll have the servants serve some food.

65
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,220
Don't leave me.

66
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,210
You're not allowed to leave.

67
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,410
Alright,

68
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:09,950
I won't leave.

69
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,090
I'm just having someone

70
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,670
make some delicious food for you.

71
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,810
Okay?

72
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,780
Liar.

73
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,710
You said the same 
before the last expedition.

74
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,210
But you didn't come back for two years.

75
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,580
Do you... do you know who I am?

76
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,480
Of course I do.

77
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,880
You're my brother.

78
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,540
Then do you know who you are?

79
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,960
I'm your little sister.

80
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,630
Could this be a side effect?

81
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,659
Alright.

82
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,590
You stay here.

83
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,620
I'll go prepare some food for you.

84
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,710
And take you to fly a kite.

85
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,500
No.

86
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,150
Don't worry, I promise I won't leave.

87
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,720
Pinky swear?

88
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:02,810
Okay.

89
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,590
Pinky swear, cross my heart.

90
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,480
And hope to die if I lie.

91
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,510
It's flying! It's flying!

92
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,280
Look, it's flying!

93
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,760
The string is broken.

94
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,040
Stay here. I'll go pick it up.

95
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,080
She really has become stupid.

96
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,190
I heard that after she woke up,

97
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,020
she kept calling His Majesty 'brother',

98
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,970
I wonder if she's faking it.

99
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,060
Why don't we test her to find out?

100
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,970
I've picked it up.

101
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,320
Who are you?

102
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,680
I'm your big sister.

103
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,010
Big sister?

104
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,110
You're hurting me.

105
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,770
I don't want to play with you.

106
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,810
Pay respects to the Empress Dowager.

107
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,190
Princess Jia.

108
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,020
That's not right.

109
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,370
You should be addressed as Empress Dowager.

110
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,860
You just tried to push her into the water.

111
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,300
How can Princess make such false accusation?

112
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,920
I saw it just now.

113
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,390
Don't you want to?

114
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,650
If she doesn't die,

115
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,730
Your Majesty will never see you.

116
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,070
She's already lost her mind.

117
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,240
Empress Dowager, 
there's no need to be so ruthless.

118
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,910
To cut the grass, you must remove the roots.

119
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,210
Otherwise, if she suddenly regains clarity.

120
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,750
you'll never have another chance.

121
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,390
Even so, I wouldn't take advantage 
of her vulnerability.

122
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,190
I found it.

123
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,110
Brother.

124
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,680
Your Majesty is right there.

125
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,570
Are you sure you want to do this?

126
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,100
Brother.

127
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,080
I picked up the kite for you.

128
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,200
How are you going to thank me?

129
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,280
Do you usually

130
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,740
kiss your brother like this?

131
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,310
You're not my brother.

132
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,800
You're more handsome than my brother.

133
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,090
That's true indeed.

134
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,200
Let me tell you a secret.

135
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,360
You look like someone I like.

136
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,120
Who do you like?
