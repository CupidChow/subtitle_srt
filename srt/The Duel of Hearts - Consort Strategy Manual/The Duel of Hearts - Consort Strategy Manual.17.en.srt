00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,950
[Episode 17]

3
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,840
General Lyu, haven't you loved

4
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,080
a woman for many years?

5
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,200
As soon as I see you,

6
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,310
I forget about her.

7
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,800
General Lyu, it's not a good place for talking.

8
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,020
Let's go somewhere else.

9
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:52,850
No.

10
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,020
Let's talk right here.

11
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,330
Lyu Xun,

12
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,700
how dare you!

13
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,190
Are you alright?

14
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:04,239
Don't worry.

15
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,280
Since Your Majesty is here,

16
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,120
I have something to report.

17
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,590
No need to say anything. I don't allow it.

18
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,080
I admire the grace of the daughter

19
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,930
in the Wen family, Wen Zhao.

20
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:18,560
And I want to take her as my wife.

21
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,160
Your Majesty, please grant this marriage.

22
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,190
Please fulfill my earnest desire.

23
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,520
So this is why you asked me to free Noble Consort.

24
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,940
You had such despicable intentions.

25
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,680
Your Majesty is yearning

26
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,759
to reclaim the tiger tally without bloodshed.

27
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,880
I am willing to exchange the tiger tally with Your Majesty.

28
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,400
You want to trade military power for Noble Consort?

29
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,340
I think you're dreaming.

30
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,310
Your Majesty,

31
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,410
please return first.

32
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:50,350
I want to talk with General Lyu in private.

33
00:01:58,770 --> 00:01:59,570
General Lyu,

34
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,560
have you heard of astral projection?

35
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,700
It's like switching bodies.

36
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,880
For example,

37
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,490
the body standing before you is Wen Zhao,

38
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,240
but my soul is Lyu Shao.

39
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,630
I've heard His Majesty mention this.

40
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,380
But I've never believed in such things.

41
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,480
It's all superstitious nonsense.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,230
The palace is too oppressive.

43
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,579
You've been here for too long.

44
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,010
No wonder you think about odd things.

45
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,079
If you live in the general's residence,

46
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,780
you'll surely feel more at ease.

47
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,740
No, my brother has already recognized me.

48
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,600
I need to force him to admit it to settle everything.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,320
Thank you for your admiration, General Lyu.

50
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,570
However, I am the daughter of the Prime Minister.

51
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:39,900
Your actions today are rather reckless.

52
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,230
If you sincerely want to marry me,

53
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,600
according to our dynasty's customs,

54
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,490
you should first pay respects to your ancestors,

55
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,690
and then present betrothal gifts and ask for my age and birthday.

56
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,010
I was being too impatient

57
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,060
and rude.

58
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,660
I'll prepare right away.

59
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,730
You are not allowed to see him alone.

60
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,580
He is my brother.

61
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:05,890
He won't do anything to me.

62
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,960
He is your brother,

63
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,520
but he is also a man.

64
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,000
I know better than you what he's thinking.

65
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,600
You're being completely unreasonable.

66
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,160
He has known for a long time that you are Lyu Shao.

67
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,880
I know.

68
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,760
I'll go talk to him now and clear things up.

69
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,600
Wait a second.

70
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,980
Did my father

71
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,840
want to take you as his concubine

72
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,590
because of this painting?

73
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,650
And you entered the palace to save me,

74
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,360
right?

75
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,800
♫Stars hanging in the night sky♫

76
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,570
My brother told you this?

77
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:47,480
Yes.

78
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:53,610
♫And sometimes sparkle in the dark♫

79
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,780
It's water under the bridge.

80
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Why bring it up?

81
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,760
♫The wind is blowing♫

82
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,300
♫The old dream is hidden in my eyes♫

83
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,740
Shao,

84
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,040
♫Time passes, but the thousand sorrows remain unresolved♫

85
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,370
why did you deceive me?

86
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,280
If I hadn't deceived you,

87
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,790
how could you willingly let me marry your father?

88
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,080
♫Is it true♫

89
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,460
And how could your father spare you?

90
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,450
♫If I get through today,  there will be countless days ahead♫

91
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,050
♫Trekking thousands of miles, there's still no end♫

92
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,870
Shao,

93
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,760
I'm sorry.

94
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,340
♫Thousands of yearning are hard to hold hands. I'll grow old with you.♫

95
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,130
I have wronged you.

96
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,650
I shouldn't have misunderstood you.

97
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,910
♫Is it true♫

98
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,010
I shouldn't have done those unforgivable things.

99
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,230
♫That the past is always in my mind♫

100
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,740
♫It's no different from walking against the water♫

101
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:30,690
What's past is past.

102
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,420
There's no use in talking about it.

103
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,900
♫ No matter how many days I count, we still can't be together♫

104
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,300
Please give me another chance.

105
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,920
I will make it up to you.

106
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,260
♫Recollections lingering,  how can I easily let go?♫

107
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,540
How will you make it up?

108
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,470
By taking me back to the palace?

109
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,230
♫My love for you endures through storms♫

110
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,570
Making me Empress?

111
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,920
So I can have the high position

112
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,900
and great wealth?

113
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,120
♫I have to accept your choice to leave♫

114
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,490
Li Dun, imperial power and wealth

115

♫Taking all thoughts and sorrows, 
how can I easily let go?♫

116
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,170
are never what I want.

117
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:01,550
♫Missing you chokes me, 
and it's a lifelong wait♫

118
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:07,830
♫It will continue because of you♫

119
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,600
I am Lyu Xun.

120
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,360
I bring the daughter of the Wen family, Wen Zhao, to pay respects to ancestors.

121
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,960
We seek the blessings of our ancestors.

122
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,400
You said you want to marry me.

123
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,040
We need to clarify something in advance.

124
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,409
You said you have loved a woman.

125
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,190
Who is this woman?

126
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:48,050
Is it your sister, Lyu Shao?

127
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,820
This is the ancestral hall of the Lyu family.

128
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,120
Don't speak nonsense.

129
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,240
Since you know where we are,

130
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,520
and that we shouldn't speak nonsense here,

131
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,630
why don't you reveal my true identity?

132
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,640
Why don't you let all the ancestors in this hall

133
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,800
know that I am Lyu Shao?

134
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,280
You recognized me long ago.

135
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,320
Shao.

136
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,790
They all said you love me.

137
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,360
I didn't believe it.

138
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,360
Li Dun said you knew I am Lyu Shao,

139
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,400
yet you still asked to marry me.

140
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,540
I didn't believe that either.

141
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,080
But now it seems,

142
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,810
everything they said is true.

143
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:30,940
Yes,

144
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,850
it's true.

145
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,340
Lyu Xun,

146
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,450
we are siblings.

147
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,040
You are now Wen Zhao.

148
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,310
By the way, I should thank Li Dun.

149
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,650
If it weren't for him,

150
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,000
I would still be trapped by ethics.

151
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,920
If he can break the rules,

152
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,730
why can't I?

153
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,770
Our parents' memorial tablets are still here.

154
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,920
Are you really going to be this absurd?

155
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,000
Our parents?

156
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,750
Where are they?

157
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,420
Where are our ancestors?

158
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,750
Call them.

159
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,330
Will they answer you?

160
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,080
Don't come any closer. Stay away!

161
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,070
Shao,

162
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,630
I've spoiled you before.

163
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,360
I've spoiled you too much.

164
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,700
If you get hurt,

165
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,690
it would break my heart.

166
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,540
If I'm heartbroken,

167
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,450
who knows what I might do to Li Dun.

168
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,140
What do you mean?

169
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,550
I have control over one hundred thousand Yulin Guards.

170
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,520
Even Li Dun's Imperial Guards are at my command.

171
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,260
He's at my mercy now.

172
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,040
So you truly have treasonous intentions.

173
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,010
Not before.

174
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,640
But he'd better not compete with me.

175
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,990
If I want him dead tonight,

176
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,960
he won't be alive tomorrow.

177
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,560
Big talk.

178
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,140
General Lyu just said His Majesty has no military power.

179
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,970
Look around you.

180
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,560
Troops have surrounded the Lyu's Residence.

181
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,370
Release Noble Consort immediately.

182
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,370
I have the tiger tally.

183
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,360
How did you mobilize the Yulin Guards?

184
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,179
That's a long story.

185
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,929
