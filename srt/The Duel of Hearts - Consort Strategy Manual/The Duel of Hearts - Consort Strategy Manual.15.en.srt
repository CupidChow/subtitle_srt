[The Duel of Hearts]

00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,950
[Episode 15]

3
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,710
General Lyu is really deeply in love.

4
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,650
Your Highness, do you know whom he loves?

5
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:44,920
You know it?

6
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,030
It's our arch-enemy, Empress Dowager Lyu.

7
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,270
You mean Lyu Shao?

8
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,430
Impossible. They are siblings.

9
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,830
Why is it impossible?

10
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,950
Empress Dowager Lyu has been in the palace 
for so long,

11
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,240
yet General Lyu still keeps 
her maiden chamber intact.

12
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,990
He arranges for daily cleaning

13
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,160
and a constant supply of fresh flowers.

14
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,550
If this isn't love, what is it?

15
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,000
It's normal for siblings 
to have deep feelings for each other.

16
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,310
General Lyu wields immense power.

17
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,039
He can obtain any woman he wants.

18
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,410
However, because that woman married 
someone else,

19
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,920
he regrets it to this day.

20
00:01:22,289 --> 00:01:23,990
There's only one possibility for this.

21
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,920
This woman married someone

22
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,310
even more powerful than General Lyu.

23
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,450
He couldn't compete with that person.

24
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,970
Throughout the entire Nanming,

25
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,039
only the late Emperor could surpass him.

26
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,910
If General Lyu had such a beloved woman,

27
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,240
how could there be no rumors at all?

28
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,030
The Lyu family has poor moral standards.

29
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,520
He is into his sister!

30
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,240
Stop spreading baseless rumors!

31
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:48,440
Watch your tongue.

32
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,970
Over the years,

33
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,550
there have been many matchmaking attempts.

34
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,790
Generals of the same age as General Lyu

35
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,670
now have kids old enough to attend school.

36
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:35,980
Brother.

37
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,640
There's ink on your face.

38
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,670
Just wipe it off.

39
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,100
No, there isn't.

40
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,540
I might have been mistaken.

41
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,470
Among the noble ladies of Nanming,

42
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,700
who wouldn't want to marry the General?

43
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,800
But General Lyu has always remained single.

44
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,200
Everyone says he remains celibate 
for his sister.

45
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,350
Impossible.

46
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,100
Absolutely impossible!

47
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:17,579
Your Majesty.

48
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,960
Go ahead.

49
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,440
A spy hidden in the Lyu mansion reported

50
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,610
that General Lyu took the Noble Consort 
to the black market in the west of the city

51
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,320
to find someone called Chuchenzi.

52
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,210
Chuchenzi...

53
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,500
Perhaps Shao is investigating A'Man's tribe.

[Lyu Mansion]

55
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,030
Chan. Chan.

56
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,290
Come help me!

57
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:45,940
General.

58
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,620
Don't move.

59
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,720
This is your brother.

60
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,700
Why are you avoiding him?

61
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,850
Why is his gaze so weird?

62
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,930
Is there something wrong?

63
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:19,380
There's nothing wrong.

64
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,390
You're graceful and elegant.

65
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,280
You look even more beautiful 
in men's attire.

66
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,530
General, are you serious?

67
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,560
It's getting late.

68
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,320
Let's go.

69
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,390
Who is it?

70
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:50,980
Follow me.

71
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,110
Don't be afraid.

72
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,020
Come on.

73
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,450
Place your final bets!

74
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,320
Alright.

75
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,860
Come on, place your bets!

76
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,590
It's small!

77
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,710
Give me the money, quickly!

Place your final bets!

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,510
I'm looking for Master Chuchenzi.

84
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,159
Everyone who comes here 
is looking for Chuchenzi.

85
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,080
However,

86
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,110
you need to win ten rounds in a row 
to enter the room.

87
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,230
-Place your bets.
-Come on.

88
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,340
Come on.

89

Let's continue.

90
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,320
Come on.

91
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,740
I never expected that the renowned Chuchenzi

92
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,420
would turn out to be a woman.

93
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,540
Chuchenzi is a woman?

94
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,310
How did you recognize me?

95
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,090
To get here, we must walk through a bit of mud.

96
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,800
We all got muddy shoes.

97
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,840
Only your shoes and his are clean.

98
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,420
Perhaps I'm just talking to you

99
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,130
on behalf of Chuchenzi.

100
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,710
Impossible.

101
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,159
Because that's not even a human inside.

102
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,110
What isn't a human?

103
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,090

105
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
It's not a human?

106
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,320
It's really a scarecrow.

107
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,520
You're truly clever.

108
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,100
What you want is in this pouch.

109
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,280
As per the old rules,

110
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,920
it's a life-or-death bet.

111
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,690
One of these 20 bowls of wine is poisoned.

112
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,580
Let's drink in turns, 
one for you, one for me.

113
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,160
If we finish them all

114
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,200
and you're not poisoned,

115
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,300
the pouch is yours.

116
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,320
What if I'm poisoned?

117
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,910
I'll ensure your remains are whole.

118
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,510
No need to waste words with her.

119
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,260
I'll have this place razed to the ground 
right now.

120
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,500
General, you must not resort to violence,

121
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,770
in case it spreads

122
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,250
and tarnishes your reputation.

123
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,780
Then I'll drink it for you.

124
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,180
Don't worry.

125
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,640
I have a way to get out of this unscathed.

126
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,409
Let's start.

127
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,380
This guy is really lucky.

128
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,330
Nine bowls down and he's still fine.

129
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,650
There's still one bowl left.

130
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,380
I'll drink it for you.

131
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,410
No need.

132
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,920
I'll drink it for him.

133
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:27,980
Who is it?

134
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,250
Who is this man?

135
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,940
Yeah, who is it?

136
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,159
He looks handsome and decent,

137
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,220
so I'm willing to try it for him.

138
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,230
Do you flirt with everyone like this?

139
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,350
If you're attracted to your own sex,

140
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,230
at least find someone you'll enjoy being with.

141
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,230
This poison is known as Three-Step Collapse.

142
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,760
If taken, it will cause instant death.

143
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,720
Is it worth dying for someone

144
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,510
as unrelated to you as me?

145
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,860
I get to decide if it's worth it.

146
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,740
Don't you want to hear my final words?

147
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,130
No, I don't.

148
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,550
Since you're so eager to know,

149
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,480
I'll tell you.

150
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,540
I only wish that my Shao

151
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,900
may achieve all her desires,

152
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,230

live in peace and happiness

154

for her whole life.

155
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,570
Then I shall die without regrets.

Don't drink it, Li Dun!

157
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,000

158
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,140

165

to end your life.

166
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,080
Just a servant girl,

trying to fight me?

168
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,430
Even without the antidote,

169
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,800
the poison in him will wear off in 4 hours.

170
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,580
Lyu Shao, I will definitely help you this time.
