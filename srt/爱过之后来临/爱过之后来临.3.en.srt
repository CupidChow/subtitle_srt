1
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:06,829
- Thank you.
- Itâ€™s my pleasure.

2
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,739
(Min Jun)

3
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,529
(Min Jun)

4
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,120
Hong, did it go well?

5
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:32,750
Yes, it just ended.

6
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:36,880
You must be exhausted. You sound tired.

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,709
Yes, I haven't worked as
an interpreter in a long time.

8
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,799
I guess it tired me out.

9
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:46,710
You're off tomorrow, right?

10
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:48,508
I don't have to work late today.

11
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:50,069
How about a drink in the neighbourhood?

12
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,179
Sure. I'll call you when I get home.

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,600
All right.

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,608
(Hong)

15
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:00,689
Hey, Hong. What
happened? Are you all right?

16
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:02,570
What happened, Hong?

17
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:04,189
Hong.

18
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:35,560
Hong, did you bump into something?

19
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,650
No.

20
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:42,519
Hong, what happened?

21
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,530
I'm fine.

22
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,780
Nothing happened.

23
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,250
Are you sure you're okay?

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,040
Yes.

25
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:03,040
I'll call you back.

26
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:26,879
Why aren't you saying anything?

27
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,719
If you have something to say, just say it.

28
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,310
There was something I wanted to ask you.

29
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:45,860
I thought I'd ask you about it...

30
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,569
if we were to meet again.

31
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:50,240
But...

32
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:52,860
I don't think it's necessary anymore.

33
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,450
I forgot what it was that
I wanted to ask you...

34
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:58,909
and whether or not I had
something to say to you.

35
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:04,419
It has long been forgotten.

36
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:15,050
Beni.

37
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:18,560
I don't know where to start...

38
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,780
even though there are so many things...

39
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:24,689
that I want to say to you.

40
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:30,019
I know...

41
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,279
that the years we've been apart...

42
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,990
created this huge distance between us.

43
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,620
No matter what I say,

44
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:49,459
my words won't reach you.

45
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,990
I also know that us meeting
again coincidentally like this...

46
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:00,680
is my last chance.

47
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,438
And that's why I don't
want to lose this chance.

48
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,599
That I can tell you for sure.

49
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:12,230
I mean it.

50
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:18,110
Beni.

51
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:22,990
If there is any misunderstanding,

52
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:25,409
I want to clear it up.

53
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,660
Mr. Sasae.

54
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,670
Too much time has passed.

55
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,629
- Beni.
- I'm...

56
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:37,220
getting married soon.

57
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,889
So, please...

58
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,519
don't say anything else.

59
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,879
I didn't know that I wouldn't
be able to forget him.

60
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:08,350
The truth is...

61
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,850
I knew I wouldn't be able to forget him,

62
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:16,860
but I didn't know I wouldn't
be able to forget him...

63
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,110
for this long.

64
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,779
Why did you have to...

65
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:26,370
show up now?

66
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,329
(Min Jun)

67
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:45,639
(It's nothing... Really...)

68
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:55,899
(What Comes After Love)

69
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,819
Look how pretty this is.

70
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:05,159
Hong is skinny, so a mermaid
wedding dress won't suit her.

71
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,720
Should she wear a princess-style dress?

72
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,619
What about the shoulders?
It'd be better to show them, right?

73
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,860
I should go with her and
help her pick out the best one.

74
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:14,750
You're talking like you're
the one getting married.

75
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:16,959
I'd do it, if I could.

76
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,839
Mom, I'm all for it.

77
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:23,300
Mom, your mood swings
are caused by loneliness.

78
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,550
You should start dating first.

79
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,349
Take your own advice, will you?

80
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,759
Hey, go away.

81
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
My goodness.

82
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:38,360
- I'm home.
- Hi!

83
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,769
Hey, my gosh...

84
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,669
Hong, why do you look so tired?

85
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,299
Min Jun called and said
he couldn't reach you.

86
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:07,929
Did something happen?

87
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:11,220
No. I'm just a little tired. That's all.

88
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,679
I'm going to get changed.

89
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,230
Here.

90
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:18,099
Why are you giving me this?

91
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,860
Well, I read it because
Dad recommended the book.

92
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,399
The story reminds me of
someone I know very well.

93
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,140
But then again, I could be wrong.

94
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,320
Read it. It's pretty good.

95
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,320
Good night.

96
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
("What Comes After Love")

97
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:48,929
- We hope to see you again.
- Thank you.

98
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,639
I wanted to ask him...

99
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:58,139
why he left me alone when I was crying...

100
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,980
and why he didn't try to stop me.

101
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:06,899
He neither tried to stop me...

102
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,950
nor looked for me,

103
00:10:12,909 --> 00:10:15,789
so I wanted to ask him why
he came here after all this time.

104
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,289
- Hey.
- Hong.

105
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,960
Hey. You're here too, Min Jun.

106
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,879
Hong, why do you look so weary?

107
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:30,049
What?

108
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:32,090
What's going on? Where's your stuff?

109
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,220
Oh, I got on the plane in a rush.

110
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,519
I see.

111
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,149
I'm glad you're back.

112
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,680
You said you were very busy
these days because of your exams.

113
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,279
What's with you? I thought
you'd be really happy to see me.

114
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,330
Of course, I'm happy to see you.

115
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,300
Let's go and see Dad in the hospital first.

116
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,039
In the hospital?

117
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,000
(Nurses in Charge)
(Im Cho Min, Do Kyung Seo)

118
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,350
Dad.

119
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:19,929
My daughter, you're here.

120
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,558
Are you okay?

121
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:24,940
Of course, I'm okay.

122
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,820
- I'm not terminally ill.
- Why are you here?

123
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,740
You acted like you'd never come back.

124
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,528
Even so, you should've told me about this.

125
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:34,239
Did you tell us when
you packed up and left?

126
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,870
Why are you being like this again?

127
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,199
We haven't seen her in so long.

128
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,749
Who's worried about whom here?

129
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,870
Honey, stop. That's enough.

130
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:47,039
Welcome back. Have you eaten yet?

131
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,840
Hong.

132
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,720
Have some coffee.

133
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:55,970
Thanks.

134
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Is my dad really going to be okay?

135
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,440
Thankfully, he has
passed the critical stage.

136
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:10,190
If he sticks to his treatment
plan, he'll recover soon.

137
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:12,029
Thanks.

138
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,279
Rok told me everything.

139
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,130
She said you took care of everything...

140
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,659
when my dad collapsed.

141
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,039
I feel like that was my job.

142
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:24,500
Come on. I didn't even do much.

143
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,628
Your parents totally took care of me...

144
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:28,878
after my parents moved to
the US. Compared to that,

145
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,210
it was nothing at all.

146
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,259
In any case, thanks a lot.

147
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:39,970
Hong.

148
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:42,019
Yes?

149
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,399
Did something happen in Japan?

150
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:47,899
What?

151
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,440
One moment.

152
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,700
Sorry, they need me in the ER.

153
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,700
You must be tired. Go
home and get some rest.

154
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:00,870
I'll call you.

155
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:02,450
All right.

156
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,600
- Sign here and here.
- Okay.

157
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:21,308
Like you said, I put in...

158
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:23,469
an application with the publishing
house building as collateral,

159
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,058
but we'd have to wait to find out...

160
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:26,940
whether the loan application
would be approved.

161
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,808
Look at everything you have
to worry about because of me.

162
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,730
Yes, it's too much.

163
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,898
So you have to recover quickly.

164
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:35,440
You brat. All right, I will.

165
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,909
Anyway, what's that manuscript?

166
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,120
Writer Han gave me a new manuscript.

167
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,658
Again?

168
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:45,710
The employees have all
left, so I'm editing it again.

169
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,739
Hey, you must be starving.

170
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,489
You've been working until
now without eating anything?

171
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,360
The fridge is empty.

172
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,028
Hurry up and dig in.

173
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:22,370
Thanks for the food.

("What Comes After Love")

175
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,350
I told myself...

176
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:47,480
that it was all over...

177
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,019
and that it was...

178
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:52,480
just a fleeting moment in the past.

179
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,700
But we were both trying so hard.

180
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,450
He was trying hard to run into me...

181
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,080
while I was trying to avoid him.

182
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,099
Hello, you're early.

183
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,440
I just got here too.

184
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,308
I'm really sorry about yesterday.

185
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:37,610
Don't worry about it. All went
well, thanks to Ms. Choi's help.

186
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,149
Oh, right.

187
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:45,319
She'll be your interpreter starting today.

188
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,909
Meet Ms. Miyazawa Hiroko.

189
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,788
Hello, Mr. Sasae.

190
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:50,700
It's a pleasure to meet you.

191
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,960
The pleasure is mine.

192
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,709
Personally, I thought it
was very memorable...

193
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,839
to see the poem by
Yun Dong Ju in the story.

194
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,878
Is there a poem by Yun
Dong Ju or any specific line...

195
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:03,179
from his poem that you love?

196
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,298
She thought it was
memorable to see the poem...

197
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,308
by Yun Dong Ju in the story.

198
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:10,928
Is there a poem by Yun Dong Ju...

199
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:12,889
or any specific line from
his poem that you love?

200
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,610
Mr. Sasae?

201
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,080
I'm sorry. What was the question again?

202
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,288
Yes, for sure.

203
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,080
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

204
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,909
- This way.
- Okay.

205
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,340
You did very well.

206
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,839
We have about an hour
before the next interview.

207
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,590
Would you like a cup of coffee?

208
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:47,970
Sure, thank you.

209
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,600
- Wait, but...
- Yes, what is it?

210
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:55,190
Is the person who helped me
yesterday not coming back?

211
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,309
You mean, Ms. Choi Hong?

212
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,370
Did you need to talk to her or something?

213
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,200
No, it's okay.

214
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,279
Wait.

215
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,450
Would it be possible to get
Ms. Choi's phone number?

216
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,450
Ms. Choi's number?

217
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:14,910
Yes.

218
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,500
I'm sorry,

219
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:23,298
but I'll have to ask her to
see if she'd be okay with it.

220
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:24,970
I see.

221
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:27,970
Then can you at least
tell me where she lives?

222
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,180
I think she lives in Bundang.

223
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,480
- Did you say "Bundang?"
- Yes.

224
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,019
I heard she lived near a lake in Bundang,

225
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,029
but I don't know her actual address.

226
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,450
I see.

227
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,000
A lake...

228
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:01,880
Jungo.

229
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:16,849
What's with him?

230
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,650
I heard he got dumped.

231
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,358
Why are you looking at me?

232
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:26,319
I dumped him a long time ago.

233
00:18:26,569 --> 00:18:27,859
Right?

234
00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:30,529
I was wondering if you
guys were back together.

235
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,409
You know, some couples break up
and get back together after a while.

236
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,578
Right.

237
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:36,410
I guess he's surrounded
by girls these days.

238
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:38,910
No wonder he has no time to write.

239
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:43,630
I'm still struggling even
though I write every single day,

240
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,880
but he's busy dating around.

241
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,429
I bet he's too busy
to even sit at his desk.

242
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,589
Yes, exactly.

243
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,220
Writing isn't important at all.

244
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,470
I want to date too.

245
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:21,119
Can I have one?

246
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,940
This hurts a bit.

247
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,439
You didn't take it this hard...

248
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,519
when we broke up.

249
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:48,779
We didn't break up?

250
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,940
Does she think so too?

251
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,660
If you're hurting that much,

252
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:58,659
shouldn't you be doing
something to try to get her back?

253
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,539
You don't know anything.

254
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:03,119
I do know.

255
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,710
That you miss her so
much but are unable to...

256
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,799
say a single thing or make a single call.

257
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,599
Jungo.

258
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:25,849
If it hurts that much...

259
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,069
Will you come back to me?

260
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:42,329
You must be busy. Why are you here?

261
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:45,670
You're our company's star writer.

262
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,750
I was bothered to send you alone.

263
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,670
This Korean promotion...

264
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,630
is important to us too.

265
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,929
People from the Korean publisher...

266
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:58,759
take good care of me, so
you didn't have to worry.

267
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,470
Even so.

268
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,679
I thought you'd be...

269
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,230
pleased to see me if I
made a sudden appearance.

270
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,980
Can't you even pretend to be pleased?

271
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,730
I am pleased.

272
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:15,608
I must fly to Fukuoka on Tuesday...

273
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:17,069
to see Mr. Gudo.

274
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:21,200
I'll look after you until then.

275
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:24,829
Thanks.

276
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,459
Please tell Mr. Gudo I said hi.

277
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,539
Okay.

278
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,000
After the interview,

279
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,170
shall we go eat something nice?

280
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:37,548
Hello. Are you Ms. Kobayashi?

281
00:21:37,549 --> 00:21:39,258
- Yes.
- Nice to meet you.

282
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:41,758
I'm Lee Min Jae from
Sodam Publishing House.

283
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,179
It's a pleasure to meet you.

284
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,729
We had a few meetings online,

285
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,558
and I'm glad to meet you in person.

286
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,190
I'm pleased too.

287
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:55,859
Thank you for taking
good care of Mr. Sasae.

288
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,410
I should thank you.

289
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,700
He means a great deal to me too.

290
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:05,250
Please look out for him for me.

291
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,460
Wouldn't this be nicer
than something too thick?

292
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,220
What?

293
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:20,589
Yes.

294
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:24,930
Then I'll take this tux.

295
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:28,390
Which tie would you like to match with it?

296
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:32,058
A bow tie would suit you better
than a neck tie. What do you think?

297
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,690
What tie should I go with?

298
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,490
- Hey.
- What?

299
00:22:41,369 --> 00:22:44,829
Oh. I'm okay with both.

300
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:48,118
Right. He'd look good in anything,

301
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:49,750
so it's hard to pick, isn't it?

302
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,500
Min Jun, you're so pretty to look at.

303
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,088
Would you like to try
on the bow tie and shirt...

304
00:22:58,089 --> 00:23:00,508
- with the second suit?
- Yes.

305
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:02,140
Please come with me.

306
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,149
Hey. What's wrong with you?

307
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,690
Is this for my wedding?

308
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:16,940
If you don't like the suit, say so.

309
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,108
It's not that.

310
00:23:19,109 --> 00:23:21,068
Then what? You don't like the guy?

311
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:24,160
Hey. Why would you say something like that?

312
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:25,950
Why...

313
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,829
Why the sudden overreaction?

314
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,868
My gosh.

315
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,829
Miss, it's your turn now.

316
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:40,670
Hong, what's taking so long?

317
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,930
You don't like it?

318
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:45,098
Even if you don't, at least let us see?

319
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:48,059
Do you think she saw her reflection
and fainted at her own beauty?

320
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,439
Should I object to this marriage?

321
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,099
What? Why?

322
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,439
The thought of Hong
having to put up with...

323
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,399
your sense of humour for
the rest of her life is a bit...

324
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,490
I see.

325
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:03,019
But you're jealous, aren't you?

326
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,359
What?

327
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:13,670
Look at yourself in the mirror.

328
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,750
Is the dress too uncomfortable?

329
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:22,420
Is this what it's usually like?

330
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,349
Most brides struggle at first
because they're not used to it.

331
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,259
But it's perfect on you.

332
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:31,768
This dress is hard to pull off,

333
00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:33,389
but it looks tailor-made for you.

334
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,099
It suits you so amazingly.

335
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:38,400
I'll wait outside.

336
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,369
You know your first reaction
is most important, right?

337
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,619
Yes. I know that.

338
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,799
I regret it.

339
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:07,259
During these five years,

340
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:14,180
I have never once forgotten about her.

341
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,460
It's so beautiful.

342
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,179
Trying on wedding
dresses is tiring, isn't it?

343
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,548
Are you very tired?

344
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,309
No, I had fun.

345
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,480
The dress just didn't fit well.

346
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,349
No. I didn't like this place much either.

347
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:40,769
I'll find another place.

348
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:44,190
Let's call it a day and eat something nice.

349
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,190
We haven't had beef intestines in a while.

350
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:48,900
Your favourite.

351
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,569
Beef intestines?

352
00:26:51,529 --> 00:26:54,450
Sorry, but you can't eat it, so you're out.

353
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:58,078
I'd like to spend time with
Hong and have some intestines.

354
00:26:58,079 --> 00:26:59,119
Do you mind?

355
00:27:00,329 --> 00:27:02,289
No, not at all.

356
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,460
You two can have a great time.

357
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:07,008
Thank you.

358
00:27:07,009 --> 00:27:08,548
I'll borrow her just for today.

359
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:09,549
Okay.

360
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:12,009
It's okay. Go ahead.

361
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,180
Let's go.

362
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,099
- See you again.
- Bye.

363
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,529
This is so good.

364
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:32,359
Wedding dresses are nicer when
they show the shoulder, right?

365
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,068
It was so pretty.

366
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,740
What should I do about my upper arms?

367
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,949
I'll eat just until today,
then start fasting.

368
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:42,210
How dare you talk about upper
arms when you're stick thin?

369
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:45,250
Hey. If you're going to
be like this, just don't do it.

370
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,710
- Don't do what?
- Get married.

371
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,298
He's handsome and has a great job.

372
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:52,469
When your dad passed
out, he was as good as a son.

373
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,929
Men like him are rare these days.

374
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:57,139
But your eyes were so red each
time you got into a new dress.

375
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,390
Are you going to slaughter?

376
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:02,190
Give up the whole thing.

377
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:04,649
I bet women at his hospital are lined up...

378
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,309
hoping to marry him.

379
00:28:10,069 --> 00:28:11,069
What's going on?

380
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,319
You're not reacting
at all. That's worrying.

381
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:17,029
Hey.

382
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,839
What's that look?

383
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,349
Is something actually wrong?

384
00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:43,390
Ji Hee.

385
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:45,190
Yes?

386
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,690
He's...

387
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:52,819
in Korea.

388
00:28:54,029 --> 00:28:56,279
Him? Who do you mean?

389
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,160
Jungo.

390
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,680
Jungo was hardworking.

391
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:18,140
I'd never seen him...

392
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:20,509
not do anything.

393
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:26,059
Are you okay?

394
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:27,980
I'm okay.

395
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,529
But I never...

396
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:40,119
wanted to be apart from him.

397
00:29:41,619 --> 00:29:43,700
I wanted to know all about him...

398
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:45,500
and be involved with everything.

399
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:49,289
That's why I wanted to be a part of him.

400
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,420
I made you wait a while.

401
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,420
I told you to go ahead.

402
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,339
It's okay.

403
00:29:56,549 --> 00:29:59,799
We haven't gone home together
in a long time and I love it.

404
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:02,720
- Has it been a long time?
- Yes.

405
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,769
I'm hungry.

406
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,916
Shall we eat something
at the convenience store?

407
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,019
Yes.

408
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,069
Okay, then. Let's go.

409
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,460
- Is it tasty?
- Yes.

410
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,420
- Beni.
- Yes?

411
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,839
Can I have a bite?

412
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,259
You pig.

413
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:40,890
Back then,

414
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,809
I didn't know what it meant.

415
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:49,559
I just thought being in
love allowed me to do that.

416
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,319
Goodbye.

417
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,569
Are you sure you can manage without me?

418
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:03,829
Why is it so hard to leave you behind?

419
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,990
I'm sorry to leave without you.

420
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:07,750
Don't be sorry.

421
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:10,750
Life is something you live alone.

422
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:13,420
Hong.

423
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,839
Don't do that.

424
00:31:16,339 --> 00:31:17,960
Pretending not to be sad when you are.

425
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,900
Pretending not to suffer when you are.

426
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:26,349
It's okay to tell me you're
not okay if you aren't.

427
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,640
I really am okay.

428
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,730
You act like you're so cool.

429
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,690
Call when you reach Seoul.

430
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,150
Hong.

431
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,029
I trust Jungo will look after you.

432
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,869
Don't cry because you miss me.

433
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,419
I won't. Get on the bus already.

434
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,420
See you.

435
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,730
Jungo.

436
00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:13,190
Finish up quickly and join us for a drink.

437
00:32:13,769 --> 00:32:15,189
Well, I'd rather...

438
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,979
The first train isn't until a while later.

439
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,150
- I have plans for tomorrow.
- It's just one drink.

440
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,319
Jungo.

441
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:24,450
It's Nana's birthday today.

442
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,990
Join us and help me get closer to her.

443
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,038
Jungo. Come over and have a drink.

444
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,460
- Yes. Come over.
- Join us.

445
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,130
- Let's have a toast.
- Get over here already.

446
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,799
Come on, will you?

447
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,819
(4:01am, Thursday, June 27, 2019)

448
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:08,279
Back then, I was bad at everything,

449
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,240
and I was rash.

450
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,460
So? What about the apartment?

451
00:33:24,009 --> 00:33:25,509
We'll move soon.

452
00:33:26,259 --> 00:33:27,259
Where to?

453
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,509
To Bundang.

454
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:32,390
Isn't that too far away
from your university?

455
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:33,980
A trip to class...

456
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:35,849
will take at least three hours.

457
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,559
Oh, I don't know.

458
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,609
I want to move out like you did.

459
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:45,650
What...

460
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,369
- did Dad say?
- Not much.

461
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,410
The company he ran
his whole life might close.

462
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:55,160
He has too much on his mind already.

463
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:01,589
How did your grad school entrance exam go?

464
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,170
What?

465
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:05,130
You don't know the result yet?

466
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,180
No.

467
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,139
I didn't get in.

468
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:16,519
You must be so upset.

469
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:18,139
It's for the best.

470
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,269
The tuition is expensive.

(Letter of Acceptance, Doshisha University)

472
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,070
Miss!

473
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:15,539
Aren't you always jogging alone?

474
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:17,619
How you have a drink with us?

475
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:21,329
Hold on, miss. I won't ask
you to drink more than this can.

476
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,750
Hey! Come on!

477
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,460
Are you okay?

478
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:29,260
Miss! Have a drink with us.

479
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,219
Don't run away!

480
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,150
Excuse me!

481
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:47,320
What's wrong?

482
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:52,739
Are you all right?

483
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,250
Ma'am.

484
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,670
I still can't get in
touch with your friend.

485
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,929
Would you like to
wait a little longer here?

486
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,889
No.

487
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,469
I'm fine now.

488
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:19,179
Thank you.

489
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:21,679
Can you really go home alone?

490
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:23,980
Yes, don't worry.

491
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:36,159
Thank you.

(Ishigami Hospital)

493
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,429
Fortunately, it's not that serious.

494
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:59,928
Going home with a soft cast won't be easy.

495
00:36:59,929 --> 00:37:01,559
Did your guardian come with you?

496
00:37:03,269 --> 00:37:04,559
Please give me a moment.

00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,280
Welcome. Please come in, sir.

499
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,780
Here. It's this way.

500
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,489
Three customers.

501
00:37:19,449 --> 00:37:20,449
Can you still drink more?

(Beni)

503
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,090
- Here's 30,000 yen.
- Thank you.

504
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,920
I received 30,000 yen.

505
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:40,010
Your change is 120 yen.

508
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:48,730
Please take care on your way.

509
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,690
Thank you.

510
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,650
Good. Okay.

511
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:56,699
I'm sorry.

512
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,280
I caused you inconvenience
when you must've been busy.

513
00:38:00,409 --> 00:38:02,869
Don't say that. You didn't
cause any inconvenience.

514
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:05,409
Don't worry about it. I'll
put your medicine here.

515
00:38:05,539 --> 00:38:07,170
Thank you so much.

516
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:10,590
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

517
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:50,170
Did you lose your phone?

518
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,460
No.

519
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,879
I had a lot of customers at work today.

520
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,139
Of course, you did.

521
00:39:01,469 --> 00:39:03,929
You're always busy
because of your part-time job.

522
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:08,230
Work always comes before me, right?

523
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:11,019
Beni. What are you saying?

524
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,480
But it's the truth.

525
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,979
Do you know what I've been thinking...

526
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,570
or what's been going on with me lately?

527
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,030
I'm...

528
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:21,489
really sorry about today.

529
00:39:22,659 --> 00:39:23,820
"About today?"

530
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:31,329
Then quit all of your
part-time jobs this instant.

531
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:33,329
Beni...

532
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,039
Part-time jobs are...

533
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,379
life lessons to aspiring writers like me.

534
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,380
You know that, don't you?

535
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,510
And if I don't work, I
can't attend university.

536
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:44,800
What about me?

537
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:49,429
What am I in your life?

538
00:39:51,309 --> 00:39:52,980
Are you saying me going to...

539
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,109
the police substation...

540
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:56,569
or the hospital has
nothing to do with your life?

541
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,859
That's not it, Beni.

542
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,650
Why must I always be alone?

543
00:40:01,489 --> 00:40:03,659
What do you mean you're always alone?

544
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,030
We go to bed and wake up
together every day, don't we?

545
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:07,369
I...

546
00:40:10,829 --> 00:40:11,960
Because...

547
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:14,670
I want to be with you,

548
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:17,630
I'm working hard and doing my best.

549
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,719
I don't get it.

550
00:40:22,929 --> 00:40:25,179
I don't get what you're doing your best in.

551
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:28,889
I'm sick of it now.

552
00:40:30,309 --> 00:40:32,389
Sick of the fact that the only person...

553
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,769
I can get mad at is you.

554
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:48,280
Desolation makes people anxious.

555
00:40:53,539 --> 00:40:54,750
Loneliness...

556
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,210
weakens love.

557
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,960
And...

558
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,050
with youth added to them,

559
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,429
everything...

560
00:41:07,889 --> 00:41:09,179
becomes unstable.

561
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:13,730
Hong. You did it.

562
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:17,150
You're done. Everything is over.

563
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,610
That guy...

564
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:22,229
You told that handsome guy flatly, right?

565
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,279
That you were soon getting married.

566
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,409
Yes. I so did that.

567
00:41:26,989 --> 00:41:29,079
- I told him.
- Good job.

568
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:32,079
Either way, you won't see him ever again.

569
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:33,408
That's right.

570
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:35,670
Unless the interpreter
doesn't show up again...

571
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,710
or we bump into each other on the street,

572
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,589
we won't ever meet again.

573
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,420
- Okay!
- Okay.

574
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,968
Let's drink some more!

575
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:46,760
All right. I'm in!

576
00:41:47,179 --> 00:41:48,219
Sir.

577
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:52,719
Please let us off at
that food stall over there.

578
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:56,099
- Auntie! We're here.
- Ta-da.

579
00:41:56,269 --> 00:41:58,308
Good grief. My princesses are here.

580
00:41:58,309 --> 00:42:00,519
- It's been a while, right?
- Yes.

581
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,820
- What is it?
- What?

582
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:07,199
- Min Jun!
- Min Jun?

583
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,909
Hong.

584
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,029
I need to go home for a bit.

585
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,618
You two can drink first.

586
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:15,579
What? Why are you suddenly going home?

587
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:18,000
"Why?" A delivery.

588
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,339
I forgot I had to receive a delivery.

589
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,419
- What?
- And it's an important delivery.

590
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,050
I can't believe it slipped my mind.

591
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:27,010
Anyway, I need to leave.

592
00:42:28,469 --> 00:42:30,639
- It's an urgent business.
- Ji Hee?

593
00:42:30,929 --> 00:42:32,010
Bye!

594
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,189
I knew it. We're meant to be.

595
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:47,319
What's this? How can you
eat good food without me?

596
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,570
Gosh, I left some for you. Look.

597
00:42:51,619 --> 00:42:52,699
Here.

598
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:56,288
Auntie. Give us another bottle of soju.

599
00:42:56,289 --> 00:42:57,369
- Sure.
- Thank you.

600
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,960
Pour me a glass, will you?

601
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,039
Yes, ma'am.

602
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:14,929
Eating a delicious dinner together...

603
00:43:15,139 --> 00:43:17,849
and having this date
in a while feels great.

604
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:20,599
Yun Oh.

605
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,480
"Yun Oh?"

606
00:43:26,481 --> 00:43:28,360
What do you think? Nice, isn't it?

607
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:33,820
Jungo's name is Yun Oh
when pronounced in Korean.

608
00:43:34,659 --> 00:43:36,659
The interpreter told me earlier.

609
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,130
What have you been thinking for a while?

610
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:50,129
"For a while?"

611
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:53,679
Yes. I wonder if you're worrying
about something I'm unaware of.

612
00:43:56,559 --> 00:43:58,849
You always know...

613
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,139
what's on my mind.

614
00:44:01,269 --> 00:44:02,900
That's not true.

615
00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:07,360
I never knew...

616
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:11,280
what you were thinking. Only you.

617
00:44:17,369 --> 00:44:21,210
That could be why I'm concerned about you.

618
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:25,710
You know, too, don't you?

619
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:28,340
About what?

620
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:32,050
That I didn't come here because of work.

621
00:44:34,929 --> 00:44:36,010
Actually,

622
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,969
I...

623
00:44:40,099 --> 00:44:41,679
came to get you.

624
00:44:43,269 --> 00:44:44,559
I've been...

625
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:48,110
waiting for you to love me again...

626
00:44:52,699 --> 00:44:54,110
for five years.

627
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,670
Could it be...

628
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:16,090
you met...

629
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,269
that person?

630
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,170
What is it?

631
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,170
Why do you keep staring at me like that?

632
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,750
I feel at ease only when I watch you.

633
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,130
Looking at you...

634
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,590
Let's see.

635
00:46:01,809 --> 00:46:03,179
Reminds me of a lake.

636
00:46:05,139 --> 00:46:06,230
"A lake?"

637
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:11,110
Since...

638
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:15,780
when did you think of me as a lake?

639
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:21,159
We were friends at first.

640
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:36,800
The day you arrived at the airport.

641
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,929
Hong.

642
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:42,469
I'm glad you're back.

643
00:46:43,429 --> 00:46:45,849
I decided to muster up my courage.

644
00:46:47,389 --> 00:46:48,480
Really?

645
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:53,230
Goodness. I looked the worst that day.

646
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,530
True.

647
00:46:58,610 --> 00:46:59,780
But...

648
00:47:00,989 --> 00:47:05,159
I must've missed you tons
when you were in Japan.

649
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:07,789
Your being back in Korea...

650
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:12,130
was enough to make me extremely happy.

651
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:19,590
Min Jun.

652
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:21,090
Yes?

653
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:22,800
I...

654
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,599
might be quite a bad person.

655
00:47:28,889 --> 00:47:29,980
Is that so?

656
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,570
I'm looking forward to it.

657
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,369
- Thank you.
- No worries.

658
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:51,170
Listen.

659
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,460
To be honest, I...

660
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:54,750
Here.

661
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:00,090
Have some snacks before it gets cold.

662
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:05,599
Just enjoy the food and drinks.

663
00:48:05,929 --> 00:48:07,349
That's the best right now.

664
00:48:09,059 --> 00:48:10,349
One day,

665
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:14,230
your feelings might change,

666
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,820
and you might even forget
what you were trying to say.

667
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,860
They say feelings change.

668
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:28,289
That's how we live life.

669
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:36,920
You must be tired.

670
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,000
Get a good rest.

671
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:42,170
What about you?

672
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:46,760
I don't think I'll be able
to sleep at this rate.

673
00:48:46,889 --> 00:48:48,809
I'll have a drink at that
bar and then go back.

674
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:52,349
Is that so? Then excuse me first.

675
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:54,349
Jungo.

676
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:57,309
Yes?

677
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,530
I...

678
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:03,989
Seeing someone lingering
in the past breaks my heart.

679
00:49:08,659 --> 00:49:09,699
Goodnight.

680
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:28,760
Thanks.

681
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:30,719
Be careful on your way back.

682
00:49:31,349 --> 00:49:32,349
Okay.

683
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:36,519
Even if it's a hassle, take a
warm shower before bed...

684
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:37,940
so as not to catch a cold.

685
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:41,110
Okay. I will.

686
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:44,070
- Bye.
- Bye.

There was something I wanted to ask...

691
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,880
I thought I'd ask you about it...

692
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:24,460
if we were to meet again.

693
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,420
But I don't think it's necessary anymore.

694
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,340
I forgot what it was that
I wanted to ask you...

695
00:51:31,429 --> 00:51:33,389
and whether or not I had
something to say to you.

696
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:38,929
