00:00:33,853 --> 00:00:37,422
(It never existed between us. Love that never changes.)

2
00:00:55,374 --> 00:00:57,853
It never existed between us.

3
00:00:58,294 --> 00:00:59,773
Love that never changes.

4
00:01:05,474 --> 00:01:07,113
And we knew...

5
00:01:07,513 --> 00:01:10,324
it didn't exist...

6
00:01:11,474 --> 00:01:13,074
anywhere in the world.

7
00:01:18,524 --> 00:01:21,833
I'm going back to where I should be.

8
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:30,843
If I don't leave this place now,

9
00:01:31,914 --> 00:01:34,014
I'll probably end up resenting you for the rest of my life.

10
00:01:39,043 --> 00:01:40,774
Do me a favour, for one last time.

11
00:01:41,293 --> 00:01:44,904
Please send my things to the address below.

12
00:01:55,814 --> 00:01:58,624
Goodbye, Jungo.

13
00:02:00,444 --> 00:02:05,693
(If I had said something...)

14
00:02:05,694 --> 00:02:10,883

("Sky, Wind, and Stars" by Yun Dong Ju)

17
00:03:28,903 --> 00:03:30,084
Yun Oh.

18
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:49,813
The book I gave you as a gift.

19
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,024
You haven't even started reading it.

20
00:03:52,473 --> 00:03:53,783
When are you going to read it?

21
00:04:01,354 --> 00:04:03,913
Sorry, I'll read it soon.

22
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:07,273
You should read it. You'll love the book.

23
00:04:07,274 --> 00:04:10,503
Just like me. You have to read it, okay?

24
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:14,174
Okay. I'll read it, for sure.

25
00:04:15,743 --> 00:04:17,304
Will you be home late again?

26
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:20,554
Well...

27
00:04:20,584 --> 00:04:22,643
I think I'll be done sometime after midnight again.

28
00:04:23,254 --> 00:04:25,434
You work too much, Yun Oh.

29
00:04:26,584 --> 00:04:28,143
Can't you cut down on work?

30
00:04:28,504 --> 00:04:29,893
Well...

31
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:35,073
Please understand just until I graduate.

32
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:39,153
I promise I'll stay home all day and just write once I graduate.

33
00:04:40,103 --> 00:04:45,034
Then we can be together all day every day, Beni.

(I'm so happy to be with you.)

37
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,802
Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be arriving...

38
00:05:20,803 --> 00:05:23,744
at Incheon International Airport shortly.

39
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:28,563
Please place your baggage under the seat...

40
00:05:28,564 --> 00:05:30,664
or in the overhead compartment.

("Sky, Wind, and Stars" by Yun Dong Ju)

42
00:05:51,504 --> 00:05:53,063
All my life,

43
00:05:54,923 --> 00:05:56,234
I never believed in things...

44
00:05:57,923 --> 00:06:00,234
like fate or miracles.

45
00:06:02,223 --> 00:06:03,494
I just thought...

46
00:06:05,353 --> 00:06:08,664
they were a nice way of making coincidences look meaningful.

47
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:25,184
But...

48
00:06:27,504 --> 00:06:29,184
there she was,

49
00:06:33,923 --> 00:06:35,273
like a miracle.

50
00:06:48,144 --> 00:06:49,284
Jungo?

51
00:06:52,774 --> 00:06:53,874
Oh, hello.

52
00:06:55,194 --> 00:06:56,674
Mr. Sasae?

53
00:07:02,744 --> 00:07:04,133
I'm sorry.

54
00:07:05,283 --> 00:07:06,513
Mr. Sasae.

55
00:07:06,744 --> 00:07:11,893
I'm Choi Hong, your interpreter for the day.

56
00:07:12,043 --> 00:07:15,984
And this is Mr. Lee Min Jae, your editor.

57
00:07:17,213 --> 00:07:18,864
Nice to meet you, Mr. Sasae.

58
00:07:19,053 --> 00:07:21,523
Welcome to Korea.

59
00:07:25,303 --> 00:07:27,244
All right, then. Shall we, Ms. Choi?

60
00:07:28,223 --> 00:07:29,414
Shall we?

61
00:07:57,293 --> 00:07:58,693
Beni looks...

62
00:07:59,754 --> 00:08:02,943
so different now, almost like a different person.

63
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,073
The radiance...

64
00:08:07,434 --> 00:08:09,703
I saw in her eyes that day is now gone.

65
00:08:11,274 --> 00:08:12,494
Would Beni...

66
00:08:13,434 --> 00:08:15,874
still remember my confession that day?

67
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,564
Are you all right?

68
00:08:44,344 --> 00:08:45,484
No.

69
00:08:47,014 --> 00:08:48,114
To be honest,

70
00:08:48,803 --> 00:08:50,153
I'm not all right.

71
00:08:52,313 --> 00:08:53,454
I can't do this.

72
00:08:55,644 --> 00:08:56,834
I knew I couldn't do this.

73
00:08:57,943 --> 00:09:00,964
I can't run. I just can't do it.

74
00:09:04,323 --> 00:09:07,344
When they made us run a marathon back in school,

75
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,224
I feigned illness...

76
00:09:11,244 --> 00:09:12,643
because I didn't want to run.

77
00:09:13,413 --> 00:09:14,643
Really?

78
00:09:14,913 --> 00:09:18,183
Then why did you say you'd run with me?

79
00:09:27,303 --> 00:09:28,574
I...

80
00:09:30,764 --> 00:09:32,494
wanted to tell you, but...

81
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:38,204
I'm just more nervous than I thought I'd be.

82
00:09:38,943 --> 00:09:40,084
What?

83
00:09:41,653 --> 00:09:42,753
Hong.

84
00:09:45,073 --> 00:09:46,844
There's something...

85
00:09:48,403 --> 00:09:50,423
I want to tell you today.

86
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:57,433
That day,

87
00:09:58,413 --> 00:09:59,854
I said...

88
00:10:01,793 --> 00:10:03,104
I believed...

89
00:10:04,844 --> 00:10:06,273
it'd be out there somewhere.

90
00:10:11,094 --> 00:10:14,033
Do you believe in love that doesn't change?

91
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:21,253
That's a tough question.

92
00:10:25,403 --> 00:10:28,964
Don't you think it'll be out there somewhere?

93
00:10:32,703 --> 00:10:34,263
With you,

94
00:10:36,624 --> 00:10:38,393
I think I can find it,

95
00:10:41,543 --> 00:10:42,734
wherever...

96
00:10:45,754 --> 00:10:47,023
it may be.

97
00:11:28,923 --> 00:11:30,064
Ouch, no.

98
00:11:32,094 --> 00:11:33,194
Are you okay?

99
00:11:35,514 --> 00:11:36,704
Let me see.

100
00:11:39,774 --> 00:11:41,413
Are you really okay?

101
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:45,293
No, I'm not.

102
00:11:46,484 --> 00:11:48,084
I must be losing my mind.

103
00:11:50,073 --> 00:11:52,094
What are you doing? I'm heavy!

104
00:11:52,653 --> 00:11:55,053
What are you doing? Put me down!

105
00:12:59,803 --> 00:13:01,244
Is this a dream?

106
00:13:03,313 --> 00:13:04,834
If it is,

107
00:13:07,234 --> 00:13:08,753
I don't want to wake up.

108
00:13:14,864 --> 00:13:16,553
It's not a dream.

109
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:25,724
I'll always be...

110
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,183
right by your side.

111
00:13:47,943 --> 00:13:49,253
Jungo.

112
00:13:52,734 --> 00:13:55,503
- "Writer." - Yes.

113
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:57,923
"Famous."

114
00:13:58,033 --> 00:14:00,743
"Highway."

115
00:14:00,744 --> 00:14:02,173
Aren't the Korean and Japanese words so similar?

116
00:14:02,453 --> 00:14:05,513
Can you believe they're two completely different languages?

117
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,604
(Beni)

118
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:15,773
Beni.

119
00:14:16,464 --> 00:14:17,864
- "Beni?" - Yes.

120
00:14:18,134 --> 00:14:21,494
That's what your name, Hong, is in Japanese. Beni.

121
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:24,033
- Beni. - Yes.

122
00:14:28,774 --> 00:14:31,562
(Beni, Yun Oh)

123
00:14:31,563 --> 00:14:32,753
Yun Oh.

124
00:14:32,984 --> 00:14:34,874
- Yun Oh? - Yes.

125
00:14:35,114 --> 00:14:38,594
That's what your name, Jungo, is in Korean. Yun Oh.

126
00:14:39,364 --> 00:14:41,322
I see, Yun Oh.

127
00:14:41,323 --> 00:14:42,513
Yes, Yun Oh.

128
00:14:42,913 --> 00:14:44,263
Yun Oh.

129
00:14:45,874 --> 00:14:48,053
Beni and Yun Oh.

130
00:14:48,913 --> 00:14:50,143
I love it.

131
00:14:58,514 --> 00:15:00,234
Okay. Here's the passport.

132
00:15:01,224 --> 00:15:03,593
He'll be staying for five nights, right?

133
00:15:03,594 --> 00:15:04,682
Yes, five nights.

134
00:15:04,683 --> 00:15:06,204
Okay. One moment, please.

135
00:15:10,894 --> 00:15:12,494
It's been five years.

136
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:18,173
Yes.

137
00:15:21,703 --> 00:15:23,263
Did you come to the airport,

138
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:25,553
knowing I was Sasae Hikari?

139
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:28,763
Certainly not.

140
00:15:33,254 --> 00:15:34,564
Had I known it was you,

141
00:15:37,384 --> 00:15:38,564
I wouldn't have come.

142
00:15:42,303 --> 00:15:43,614
Sorry to keep you waiting.

143
00:15:43,974 --> 00:15:45,994
Go up to your room and get settled in first.

144
00:15:46,183 --> 00:15:48,494
We'll start the interview in half an hour.

145
00:15:49,774 --> 00:15:51,663
You can go up to your room and get settled in.

146
00:15:51,813 --> 00:15:54,163
The interview will begin in half an hour.

147
00:15:56,524 --> 00:15:57,714
This way.

148
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:58,923
Okay.

149
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,183
Back then,

150
00:16:58,004 --> 00:17:01,273
we couldn't stand being apart even for a moment.

151
00:17:13,313 --> 00:17:15,534
Beni!

152
00:17:18,563 --> 00:17:19,794
Yun Oh!

153
00:17:20,484 --> 00:17:21,710
What's going on?

154
00:17:21,734 --> 00:17:23,173
Don't you have your shift?

155
00:17:23,444 --> 00:17:25,423
Beni, I'll come down.

156
00:17:25,654 --> 00:17:26,844
Wait there!

157
00:17:27,363 --> 00:17:28,963
Okay!

158
00:17:56,603 --> 00:17:57,953
All right.

159
00:17:58,603 --> 00:17:59,913
Enjoy.

160
00:18:01,944 --> 00:18:04,463
So, this is jjajangmyeon?

161
00:18:04,654 --> 00:18:06,794
- Yes, try it. - Okay.

162
00:18:07,194 --> 00:18:08,804
Thank you for the food.

163
00:18:20,123 --> 00:18:21,314
It's good.

164
00:18:22,504 --> 00:18:25,483
In Korea, you order and eat jjajangmyeon on your moving day.

165
00:18:25,754 --> 00:18:28,524
Some give out rice cakes to their new neighbours too.

166
00:18:29,133 --> 00:18:30,403
I see.

167
00:18:30,724 --> 00:18:33,653
In Japan, they gave out soba noodles.

168
00:18:33,974 --> 00:18:36,074
I mean, back in the old days.

169
00:18:36,224 --> 00:18:38,163
- Really? Why? - Yes.

170
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:39,743
Well...

171
00:18:39,774 --> 00:18:41,983
I heard the soba signifies a long and pleasant relationship,

172
00:18:41,984 --> 00:18:44,523
just like the soba's long and thin form suggests.

173
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:45,834
- Is that right? - Yes.

174
00:18:46,113 --> 00:18:47,713
All right, then I should do it too.

175
00:18:47,863 --> 00:18:51,463
Please be good to me for many, many years!

176
00:18:52,073 --> 00:18:53,243
Me too.

177
00:18:53,244 --> 00:18:57,304
Please be good to me for many years to come!

178
00:18:59,123 --> 00:19:00,354
Wait a moment.

179
00:19:06,593 --> 00:19:08,864
Ta-da.

180
00:19:13,184 --> 00:19:14,574
Yun Oh.

181
00:19:15,803 --> 00:19:17,163
Thank you.

182
00:19:17,514 --> 00:19:18,743
I'm so happy!

183
00:19:29,944 --> 00:19:31,133
Yun Oh.

184
00:19:34,704 --> 00:19:37,223
Wake up, Yun Oh. You'll be late.

185
00:19:39,664 --> 00:19:41,104
I'm sleepy.

186
00:19:41,373 --> 00:19:43,683
I'm sleepy.

187
00:19:45,004 --> 00:19:47,443
No. You have to get up.

188
00:19:49,843 --> 00:19:51,024
Hey.

189
00:20:10,323 --> 00:20:13,304
You really have to get up now.

190
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,423
You'll be late for class.

191
00:20:42,934 --> 00:20:46,044
- Hello. Draft beer for two, please. - Draft beer, coming up.

192
00:21:16,053 --> 00:21:17,943
- That was great. - Lovely.

193
00:21:19,643 --> 00:21:22,284
Well, thank you so much.

194
00:21:23,393 --> 00:21:26,243
Thanks, everyone. Are you having fun?

195
00:21:27,484 --> 00:21:31,334
Thanks, Yun Oh. This place is amazing.

196
00:21:31,573 --> 00:21:34,254
I'm really happy right now.

197
00:21:36,113 --> 00:21:38,764
I thought you'd like this place.

198
00:21:42,373 --> 00:21:44,643
Isn't it expensive here?

199
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:48,104
It's expensive.

200
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,314
But it's okay.

201
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:54,274
- How so? - I'll clean extra plates later.

202
00:21:55,633 --> 00:21:57,403
Hey, what's up?

203
00:21:58,383 --> 00:21:59,483
You.

204
00:22:01,893 --> 00:22:03,913
Beni, say hello.

205
00:22:04,264 --> 00:22:06,584
This is my father...

206
00:22:06,684 --> 00:22:08,874
and the boss of this bar.

207
00:22:12,313 --> 00:22:15,630
- It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too.

208
00:22:15,654 --> 00:22:17,423
My girlfriend Beni.

209
00:22:18,454 --> 00:22:19,839
- Your girlfriend? - Yes.

210
00:22:19,863 --> 00:22:20,963
For real?

211
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:26,723
She's way too cute to be your girlfriend.

212
00:22:26,914 --> 00:22:28,854
Why are you dating this guy?

213
00:22:29,793 --> 00:22:33,092
Jungo's way too cool to be my boyfriend.

214
00:22:33,093 --> 00:22:37,024
My gosh. She's humble too.

215
00:22:37,303 --> 00:22:41,574
Oh, put him to work as much as you want.

216
00:22:41,803 --> 00:22:44,453
And if he doesn't do as he's told,

217
00:22:45,143 --> 00:22:49,374
tell me and I'll beat him up for you.

218
00:22:50,194 --> 00:22:52,653
Yes, boss. Understood.

219
00:22:52,654 --> 00:22:54,193
Oh, okay.

220
00:22:54,194 --> 00:22:56,883
Hang on. Dad, please.

221
00:22:57,573 --> 00:23:01,713
I'm on your side from now on, Beni.

222
00:23:03,664 --> 00:23:05,349
Hey, you.

223
00:23:05,373 --> 00:23:09,854
That nasty witch who dumped you.

224
00:23:10,373 --> 00:23:13,713
- She's much nicer than... - Dad?

225
00:23:13,714 --> 00:23:16,173
- Okay. Would you like a drink? - No.

226
00:23:16,174 --> 00:23:19,403
- You go back behind the bar. - Why?

227
00:23:20,224 --> 00:23:21,403
Good luck.

228
00:23:27,103 --> 00:23:28,493
"That nasty witch?"

229
00:23:36,774 --> 00:23:38,584
Why did you break up?

230
00:23:39,363 --> 00:23:41,094
With that nasty witch.

231
00:23:41,613 --> 00:23:42,804
What?

232
00:23:45,164 --> 00:23:46,883
She just dumped me.

233
00:23:48,043 --> 00:23:50,723
For real? Without a reason?

234
00:23:50,914 --> 00:23:52,014
Right.

235
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,604
She called me suffocating.

236
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:57,693
That I sometimes clammed up.

237
00:24:03,053 --> 00:24:05,743
There are a lot of things you can't put into words.

238
00:24:07,353 --> 00:24:10,824
You want to put those things in writing.

239
00:24:12,853 --> 00:24:14,453
Your writing...

240
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:17,334
contains something special that's just you.

241
00:24:18,654 --> 00:24:20,044
That's why I like it.

242
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:27,054
I'm sure you'll become a great writer.

243
00:24:33,623 --> 00:24:34,854
Thank you.

244
00:24:36,123 --> 00:24:37,314
Beni.

245
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:41,354
Yun Oh.

246
00:24:42,764 --> 00:24:44,443
Yesterday, today,

247
00:24:45,303 --> 00:24:46,743
and tomorrow too.

248
00:24:47,264 --> 00:24:49,574
I'm able to love you.

249
00:24:51,393 --> 00:24:54,703
And for that, I'm so very happy.

250
00:25:06,823 --> 00:25:08,220
Hello?

251
00:25:08,244 --> 00:25:09,423
Have you arrived yet?

252
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:12,554
Yes, a short while ago.

253
00:25:14,373 --> 00:25:15,764
How is Seoul?

254
00:25:16,793 --> 00:25:19,483
Well, I'm not sure yet.

255
00:25:21,043 --> 00:25:23,104
I should've come with you.

256
00:25:24,974 --> 00:25:28,284
Jungo. I just got the author's proof.

257
00:25:28,803 --> 00:25:30,864
I'd like you to go through it.

258
00:25:32,184 --> 00:25:34,243
Can't I do that when I get back?

259
00:25:37,944 --> 00:25:39,084
Okay.

260
00:25:40,274 --> 00:25:42,544
Oh, right. I'm going to Fukuoka next week.

261
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:44,423
For Mr. Gudo's lecture.

262
00:25:45,033 --> 00:25:46,112
Okay.

263
00:25:46,113 --> 00:25:49,423
Fukuoka's pretty close to Korea, right?

264
00:25:49,823 --> 00:25:51,133
It is.

265
00:25:52,704 --> 00:25:54,854
Jungo. Is something wrong?

266
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:57,764
You don't sound too happy.

267
00:25:59,924 --> 00:26:03,274
No. I have an interview. I should go.

268
00:26:04,093 --> 00:26:05,193
Got it.

269
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:07,524
- Good luck with the interview. - Thanks.

270
00:26:30,283 --> 00:26:31,383
Okay.

271
00:26:32,623 --> 00:26:33,764
Nice.

272
00:26:37,254 --> 00:26:39,933
Sorry, but can you look to the right?

273
00:26:40,714 --> 00:26:42,774
Look to your right this time.

274
00:26:47,093 --> 00:26:49,024
Okay, very nice.

275
00:26:49,593 --> 00:26:50,983
I like them.

276
00:26:51,184 --> 00:26:52,324
Okay.

277
00:26:59,143 --> 00:27:02,834
Can he fix his sweater collar?

278
00:27:03,103 --> 00:27:06,294
Mr. Sasae. Fix your sweater collar.

279
00:27:13,414 --> 00:27:16,094
Ms. Choi, you do it for him.

280
00:27:26,214 --> 00:27:27,524
Excuse me.

281
00:28:48,214 --> 00:28:49,643
Are you all right?

282
00:28:53,343 --> 00:28:55,824
Yes. I'm fine.

283
00:29:04,313 --> 00:29:07,953
I heard you never visited Korea before.

284
00:29:08,234 --> 00:29:10,713
Do you know any Korean?

285
00:29:11,274 --> 00:29:14,383
I heard this is your first visit to Korea.

286
00:29:14,613 --> 00:29:16,804
Do you know any Korean?

287
00:29:19,123 --> 00:29:20,220
Yes.

288
00:29:20,244 --> 00:29:22,269
I know the farewell greetings for when...

289
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:25,264
you're leaving and for when someone else is leaving.

290
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:29,604
The Japanese don't have separate expressions...

291
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:33,733
for when you're parting or leaving someone behind.

292
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:38,034
I felt the consideration for the other person.

293
00:29:39,974 --> 00:29:41,993
The person who taught me that...

294
00:29:43,224 --> 00:29:46,374
is the friend who served as the muse for this novel.

295
00:29:49,904 --> 00:29:52,754
I know the "goodbye" for when you're leaving or staying.

296
00:29:54,944 --> 00:29:57,344
The person who taught me that...

297
00:29:58,154 --> 00:30:00,413
became the model for this novel.

298
00:30:00,414 --> 00:30:02,304
Oh, I see.

299
00:30:02,533 --> 00:30:06,973
Could you tell me about this friend?

300
00:30:09,123 --> 00:30:13,393
Could you tell us about this friend?

301
00:30:17,764 --> 00:30:19,403
I'm sorry,

302
00:30:20,264 --> 00:30:21,993
but about her...

303
00:30:22,803 --> 00:30:23,913
You see,

304
00:30:25,563 --> 00:30:27,284
our ending...

305
00:30:28,853 --> 00:30:32,084
wasn't a happy one like the one in my novel.

306
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:37,633
I'm sorry, but about that person...

307
00:30:39,954 --> 00:30:42,633
Our ending was, unlike the novel,

308
00:30:43,494 --> 00:30:45,264
not a happy ending.

309
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:49,014
Is that person still in Japan?

310
00:30:56,504 --> 00:30:59,740
Ms. Park, we've been here a while.

311
00:30:59,764 --> 00:31:02,653
How about you focus more on his novel?

312
00:31:02,803 --> 00:31:04,403
Shall I do that?

313
00:31:04,434 --> 00:31:05,574
Yes.

314
00:31:07,313 --> 00:31:09,102
In your novel,

315
00:31:09,103 --> 00:31:12,794
Kyoto is where the couple made special memories.

316
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:16,963
Is there a reason you chose Kyoto?

317
00:31:19,073 --> 00:31:22,883
In your novel, Kyoto appears as a place where the couple...

318
00:31:23,164 --> 00:31:24,883
creates special memories.

319
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:28,683
Is there a special meaning as to why you chose Kyoto?

320
00:31:34,714 --> 00:31:36,064
Kyoto is...

321
00:31:43,264 --> 00:31:46,203
(Kyoto Station)

322
00:31:48,524 --> 00:31:49,703
That's amazing.

323
00:31:51,524 --> 00:31:54,124
Kyoto was the first place we visited...

324
00:31:54,194 --> 00:31:56,294
after we moved in together.

325
00:31:56,774 --> 00:32:00,344
Beni had said she really wanted to visit.

326
00:32:01,783 --> 00:32:03,004
Hey.

327
00:32:06,164 --> 00:32:07,164
Here you go.

328
00:32:07,165 --> 00:32:08,683
- Thank you. - Thank you.

329
00:32:09,543 --> 00:32:11,203
We'll take this bike.

330
00:32:11,204 --> 00:32:12,832
- Please. - Got it.

331
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:15,183
- Thank you. - Thank you.

333
00:32:54,504 --> 00:32:55,893
My gosh.

334
00:32:57,714 --> 00:32:58,814
How beautiful.

335
00:33:10,224 --> 00:33:12,829
- Thank you. - Thank you.

336
00:33:12,853 --> 00:33:14,493
- That's 1,000 yen, please. - Right.

337
00:33:16,234 --> 00:33:18,193
- Here's the exact sum. - Thank you.

338
00:33:18,194 --> 00:33:19,504
- Thank you. - Thank you.

340
00:33:27,704 --> 00:33:29,264
It's nice here.

341
00:33:29,533 --> 00:33:30,973
It sure is.

342
00:33:35,543 --> 00:33:37,933
- It's not raining anymore. - Great.

343
00:33:40,254 --> 00:33:42,314
- Is it over there? - Yes.

344
00:33:45,133 --> 00:33:46,233
We're here.

345
00:33:47,803 --> 00:33:48,993
Yes, we are.

346
00:33:50,184 --> 00:33:51,802
I've always wanted to come here.

Yes.

What is it about?

359
00:34:38,433 --> 00:34:39,544
Let's see.

360
00:34:40,313 --> 00:34:42,374
It's quite hard to explain.

361
00:34:43,313 --> 00:34:45,924
It's about a student feeling lonely...

while studying abroad.

363
00:34:49,324 --> 00:34:50,763
Just like me.

364
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:55,013
Do you feel lonely, Beni?

365
00:34:55,953 --> 00:34:57,393
Sometimes.

00:36:11,114 --> 00:36:12,254
Good grief.

375
00:36:17,993 --> 00:36:19,433
- Beni. - Yes?

376
00:36:40,643 --> 00:36:41,783
Yun Oh.

377
00:36:42,024 --> 00:36:43,163
Yes?

378
00:36:43,893 --> 00:36:45,294
I have a favour to ask.

379
00:36:46,024 --> 00:36:47,624
This is out of the blue.

380
00:36:48,234 --> 00:36:51,424
How about we stay the night here?

381
00:36:51,984 --> 00:36:53,754
- In Kyoto? - Yes.

382
00:36:55,034 --> 00:36:56,803
There's someone I want to meet.

383
00:37:24,433 --> 00:37:27,044
Good evening. Pardon our intrusion.

384
00:37:27,484 --> 00:37:28,964
Welcome.

385
00:37:29,404 --> 00:37:30,924
I have bad news.

386
00:37:31,074 --> 00:37:33,033
You've come all the way here,

387
00:37:33,034 --> 00:37:36,634
but we're already closed for the day. I'm sorry.

388
00:37:37,743 --> 00:37:41,433
I'm Choi Hong, Choi Han's daughter.

389
00:37:57,384 --> 00:38:00,283
Kyoto is famous for its cuisine.

390
00:38:00,683 --> 00:38:03,573
But I'm not that good at cooking.

391
00:38:03,933 --> 00:38:05,073
Here.

392
00:38:05,143 --> 00:38:09,703
I'm not sure if it'll be to your taste, but please dig in.

393
00:38:10,444 --> 00:38:11,812
Please don't worry about it.

394
00:38:11,813 --> 00:38:14,634
Thank you so much for even serving us food.

395
00:38:20,913 --> 00:38:25,013
I don't think I asked who the man you came with is.

396
00:38:25,293 --> 00:38:26,763
He's my boyfriend.

397
00:38:26,793 --> 00:38:27,973
Is that so?

398
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:30,643
You two look great together.

399
00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:35,404
Our apologies for dropping by without any advance notice.

400
00:38:37,513 --> 00:38:40,073
Before I came to Japan,

401
00:38:40,344 --> 00:38:43,113
my dad told me your address.

402
00:38:43,143 --> 00:38:46,493
He told me to visit you if I ever travelled to Kyoto.

403
00:38:46,813 --> 00:38:48,624
I see.

404
00:38:50,944 --> 00:38:52,544
Your father and I...

405
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:55,504
attended Doshisha University together.

406
00:38:55,824 --> 00:38:58,693
Despite being an international student,

407
00:38:58,694 --> 00:39:00,843
Han was the president of the college newspaper club.

408
00:39:01,203 --> 00:39:04,513
Regardless of his nationality, I admired him the most.

409
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:08,433
Goodness. Please dig in.

410
00:39:08,663 --> 00:39:11,893
I'm sorry. I talked about our old days for too long.

411
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:14,593
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

412
00:39:14,594 --> 00:39:15,774
Go ahead.

413
00:39:19,804 --> 00:39:22,823
By the way, where are you staying for the night?

414
00:39:24,393 --> 00:39:27,033
We're looking for a nearby place to stay.

415
00:39:27,893 --> 00:39:31,544
Finding a place right now won't be easy.

416
00:39:31,853 --> 00:39:34,754
Most places require a reservation these days.

417
00:39:37,194 --> 00:39:39,964
If you're okay with it, how about staying at my place?

418
00:39:40,074 --> 00:39:42,634
There's nothing here, but make yourself at home.

419
00:39:42,784 --> 00:39:43,992
- May we? - No, we...

420
00:39:43,993 --> 00:39:45,202
Thank you.

421
00:39:45,203 --> 00:39:47,893
It has always been a dream to sleep in such a house.

422
00:39:52,424 --> 00:39:54,643
Here. Try the food.

423
00:40:10,683 --> 00:40:13,243
Yun Oh. Are you asleep?

424
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:22,044
You look cuter when sulking.

425
00:40:23,614 --> 00:40:25,174
I can't stop looking at you.

426
00:40:47,304 --> 00:40:48,404
Yun Oh.

427
00:40:50,433 --> 00:40:51,703
Are you angry at me?

428
00:40:52,563 --> 00:40:53,703
Yes.

429
00:40:55,654 --> 00:40:59,544
Why? Because I wanted to stay the night here?

430
00:41:01,904 --> 00:41:03,044
Yes.

431
00:41:04,364 --> 00:41:05,504
But why?

432
00:41:06,743 --> 00:41:09,513
It's nice how we can save money here.

433
00:41:10,743 --> 00:41:14,104
And Ms. Shizuko asked if we would like to stay here first.

434
00:41:17,543 --> 00:41:21,194
That was out of politeness.

435
00:41:22,844 --> 00:41:25,944
She must've been surprised when you took up her offer.

436
00:41:26,594 --> 00:41:30,993
She might think we lack common courtesy now.

437
00:41:39,774 --> 00:41:40,924
Whatever.

438
00:41:43,074 --> 00:41:44,384
Don't go.

439
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:55,643
For a long time,

440
00:41:57,293 --> 00:41:58,973
I've wondered...

441
00:42:01,754 --> 00:42:03,354
what she is like.

442
00:42:06,634 --> 00:42:07,823
Why?

443
00:42:10,804 --> 00:42:12,033
Ms. Shizuko...

444
00:42:13,263 --> 00:42:15,374
is my dad's first love.

445
00:42:18,194 --> 00:42:20,203
- Really? - Yes.

446
00:42:23,944 --> 00:42:26,593
But in the end,

447
00:42:28,654 --> 00:42:32,303
they broke up because my grandpa was against her.

448
00:42:34,543 --> 00:42:37,854
After that, he met my mom and got married.

449
00:42:40,674 --> 00:42:44,654
My mom says my dad looks like he sometimes...

450
00:42:46,513 --> 00:42:48,984
misses Ms. Shizuko even to this day.

451
00:42:53,013 --> 00:42:54,453
She believes...

452
00:42:55,063 --> 00:42:57,743
men can't forget their first love.

453
00:43:00,024 --> 00:43:01,584
I see.

454
00:43:03,444 --> 00:43:04,714
Funny, isn't it?

455
00:43:21,504 --> 00:43:23,183
What do you think, Yun Oh?

456
00:43:24,594 --> 00:43:25,774
Do you think,

457
00:43:27,054 --> 00:43:29,113
with time, we'll break up...

458
00:43:31,183 --> 00:43:32,863
one day?

459
00:43:36,603 --> 00:43:37,743
No.

460
00:43:41,813 --> 00:43:43,794
We're different.

461
00:43:46,194 --> 00:43:48,464
We will never break up.

462
00:43:51,824 --> 00:43:53,674
Even if time passes,

463
00:43:55,663 --> 00:43:57,473
the seasons change,

464
00:44:00,754 --> 00:44:02,893
and the world changes,

465
00:44:07,254 --> 00:44:09,814
that will not happen to us.

466
00:44:31,614 --> 00:44:32,884
There's...

467
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:41,933
no special meaning behind Kyoto.

468
00:44:43,583 --> 00:44:45,723
He said there was no special meaning.

469
00:44:46,833 --> 00:44:47,984
I see.

470
00:44:48,424 --> 00:44:50,404
The next question is...

471
00:44:50,714 --> 00:44:54,444
one I've been personally curious about after reading your work.

472
00:44:55,183 --> 00:44:58,613
By any chance, do you still have feelings for her?

473
00:45:01,563 --> 00:45:03,773
I also want to know whether you,

474
00:45:03,774 --> 00:45:07,504
like the male protagonist in your work, believe unchanging love...

475
00:45:07,774 --> 00:45:09,084
exists in reality.

476
00:45:16,953 --> 00:45:18,053
Ms. Choi?

477
00:45:21,873 --> 00:45:23,143
Do you...

478
00:45:26,464 --> 00:45:29,024
still like her?

479
00:45:39,723 --> 00:45:41,203
I regret it.

480
00:45:45,274 --> 00:45:46,834
During these five years,

481
00:45:52,114 --> 00:45:54,134
I have never once forgotten about her.

482
00:45:57,203 --> 00:45:59,803
Could we possibly take a short break? I'm sorry.

483
00:46:22,304 --> 00:46:23,993
During these five years,

484
00:46:25,853 --> 00:46:27,794
I have never once forgotten about her.

485
00:46:37,824 --> 00:46:40,803
- Great work, everyone. - Great work.

486
00:46:41,034 --> 00:46:43,093
Great work, Mr. Sasae.

487
00:46:44,413 --> 00:46:46,973
Mr. Sasae. Great work today.

488
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:48,893
Great work to you, too.

489
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:51,064
I'm in your care tomorrow as well.

490
00:46:52,134 --> 00:46:55,154
A professional interpreter will be here tomorrow.

491
00:46:56,554 --> 00:46:57,900
Mr. Sasae.

492
00:46:57,924 --> 00:47:00,613
It was a great honour to meet you today.

493
00:47:00,933 --> 00:47:03,323
Thank you in advance for the rest of our schedule.

494
00:47:08,433 --> 00:47:10,913
Please take the elevator, Mr. Sasae.

495
00:47:11,734 --> 00:47:13,794
All right. Thank you.

496
00:47:24,663 --> 00:47:26,053
Door closing.

497
00:47:57,694 --> 00:47:58,924
That day,

498
00:47:59,364 --> 00:48:01,924
Hong yelled at me with an expression...

499
00:48:02,534 --> 00:48:04,053
I never saw before.

500
00:48:05,413 --> 00:48:06,513
That day,

501
00:48:07,913 --> 00:48:09,604
I scarred...

502
00:48:10,453 --> 00:48:12,564
my heart with regret.

503
00:48:15,004 --> 00:48:16,143
Jungo.

504
00:48:16,634 --> 00:48:19,734
Let's break up.

505
00:48:31,683 --> 00:48:35,254
Had I not said anything back then,

506
00:48:36,364 --> 00:48:38,964
would I not have lost you?
