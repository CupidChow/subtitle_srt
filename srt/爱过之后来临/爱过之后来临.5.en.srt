- Thank you. - Thank you.

00:00:08,284 --> 00:00:09,595
Hello.

4
00:00:10,245 --> 00:00:11,384
Thank you.

5
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:18,855
- Thank you. - Thank you.

6
00:00:32,435 --> 00:00:33,535
Sir.

7
00:00:36,355 --> 00:00:40,125
Choi Hong. You know her, right?

8
00:00:43,404 --> 00:00:44,544
Yes.

9
00:00:46,775 --> 00:00:48,044
Yes, I know her.

10
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:54,385
Could we talk for a minute?

11
00:00:56,874 --> 00:00:58,014
Okay.

12
00:01:01,414 --> 00:01:02,684
I'm sorry,

13
00:01:02,834 --> 00:01:05,134
but could we take a short break?

14
00:01:05,135 --> 00:01:06,274
Oh, sure.

15
00:01:07,004 --> 00:01:08,944
We'll take a ten-minute break.

16
00:01:09,215 --> 00:01:10,735
Sure, no problem.

17
00:01:18,764 --> 00:01:20,164
How may I help you?

18
00:01:23,185 --> 00:01:26,584
Please stay away from Hong.

19
00:01:29,365 --> 00:01:31,045
She's my fiancee.

20
00:01:37,704 --> 00:01:39,474
There must be some...

21
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:43,854
misunderstanding.

22
00:01:44,665 --> 00:01:46,354
"Misunderstanding?"

23
00:01:46,924 --> 00:01:51,315
There's nothing going on between Hong and me.

24
00:01:52,514 --> 00:01:53,774
It's...

25
00:01:55,514 --> 00:01:56,944
just this book...

26
00:01:59,144 --> 00:02:01,494
that still talks about her.

27
00:02:06,064 --> 00:02:07,375
Indeed,

28
00:02:08,694 --> 00:02:11,294
I could not stand this book.

29
00:02:13,615 --> 00:02:15,384
You're a mere hypocrite.

30
00:02:16,245 --> 00:02:18,134
It's disgusting to me.

31
00:02:19,455 --> 00:02:23,514
No matter why you wrote this book, it doesn't matter anymore!

32
00:02:23,835 --> 00:02:26,935
Please stay away from my Hong.

33
00:02:34,715 --> 00:02:36,944
I'm going to propose to her tonight.

34
00:02:49,654 --> 00:02:51,715
Would you do me a favour?

35
00:02:53,865 --> 00:02:56,924
Please promise me...

36
00:02:57,574 --> 00:02:58,715
that...

37
00:03:01,205 --> 00:03:05,435
you'll never make her feel alone.

38
00:03:07,414 --> 00:03:08,685
Is that it?

39
00:03:11,545 --> 00:03:13,315
It's such an easy one.

40
00:03:17,844 --> 00:03:19,074
I see.

41
00:03:22,854 --> 00:03:24,204
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:26,145 --> 00:03:27,835
But I should get going.

(Book Concert, "What Comes After Love")

44
00:03:46,455 --> 00:03:48,395
Looking back now, it was so obvious.

45
00:03:49,164 --> 00:03:50,935
So, why didn't I notice it...

46
00:03:51,874 --> 00:03:54,275
back then?

47
00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:57,234
Hong...

48
00:03:58,094 --> 00:04:00,655
ran every single day...

49
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:03,905
until the day we broke up.

50
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,035
Here's your beer.

51
00:04:07,395 --> 00:04:10,144
I'll put these here and take your empty glasses.

52
00:04:10,145 --> 00:04:13,614
I don't remember exactly when it began,

53
00:04:13,615 --> 00:04:16,965
but as we started to drift away from each other,

54
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:19,674
Hong started to run longer...

55
00:04:20,285 --> 00:04:22,465
and farther.

56
00:04:25,624 --> 00:04:27,054
You can leave it here.

57
00:04:29,124 --> 00:04:31,434
I need your signature here, please.

58
00:04:32,124 --> 00:04:33,275
Right here.

(50th Inokashira Fireworks Festival to Be Held)

60
00:05:00,905 --> 00:05:02,215
Once,

61
00:05:03,405 --> 00:05:06,885
I asked her why she ran so passionately every single day.

62
00:05:08,915 --> 00:05:09,994
I'm ready to settle up.

63
00:05:09,995 --> 00:05:11,354
Hong said,

64
00:05:12,214 --> 00:05:15,564
"Just because," and said nothing else.

65
00:05:34,694 --> 00:05:36,005
And I...

66
00:05:37,194 --> 00:05:39,374
didn't ask her about it again.

67
00:05:43,245 --> 00:05:46,174
I was afraid to find out why she had to run like that every day.

68
00:06:04,384 --> 00:06:07,285
When I was little, my mom asked me this question...

69
00:06:07,894 --> 00:06:09,205
as she was leaving us.

70
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:11,705
"Do you want to live with your dad?"

71
00:06:12,475 --> 00:06:15,744
"Or do you prefer to live with me?"

72
00:06:15,985 --> 00:06:17,104
"With you, Mom!"

73
00:06:17,105 --> 00:06:20,414
I answered right away, without a second's hesitation.

74
00:06:22,655 --> 00:06:23,845
But...

75
00:06:24,824 --> 00:06:27,845
that wasn't the answer she wanted.

76
00:06:34,624 --> 00:06:38,275
Listen carefully. It'll just be the two of us from now on.

77
00:06:39,084 --> 00:06:40,354
Let's get along.

78
00:06:40,754 --> 00:06:42,604
I regretted it for a long time.

79
00:06:43,254 --> 00:06:46,984
"I shouldn't have said anything."

80
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:48,945
Life...

81
00:06:49,935 --> 00:06:52,535
doesn't really unfold the way you say it should,

82
00:06:53,264 --> 00:06:54,624
and there are times...

83
00:06:55,355 --> 00:06:57,874
when it's better not to say anything.

84
00:06:59,405 --> 00:07:00,715
Thanks to my mom,

85
00:07:01,235 --> 00:07:03,924
I learned these things when I was still a little too young.

89
00:08:04,845 --> 00:08:06,354
Who was that?

90
00:08:07,264 --> 00:08:08,445
Someone you know?

91
00:08:09,925 --> 00:08:13,035
Yes, an acquaintance of someone I know.

92
00:08:14,435 --> 00:08:16,575
How about a drink at the hotel later?

93
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:19,854
Today? This evening, I have to...

94
00:08:19,855 --> 00:08:20,943
I know.

95
00:08:20,944 --> 00:08:23,455
You're going out for dinner with the publishing team.

96
00:08:24,235 --> 00:08:27,255
I have plans too, so let's meet after dinner.

97
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,424
I'll wait for you.

98
00:08:33,324 --> 00:08:34,424
Okay.

99
00:09:01,145 --> 00:09:05,071
(Beni, did you arrive home safely?)

100
00:09:07,444 --> 00:09:08,584
Beni.

101
00:09:09,114 --> 00:09:11,044
Did you arrive home safely?

102
00:09:16,324 --> 00:09:18,184
It's already been a month,

103
00:09:21,334 --> 00:09:22,564
but I feel like...

104
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:26,525
I'm frozen in time, reliving the day you left over and over again.

105
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,804
Why didn't I...

106
00:10:01,994 --> 00:10:05,225
try to understand how lonely you might be feeling?

107
00:10:08,005 --> 00:10:09,275
I shouldn't have...

108
00:10:10,594 --> 00:10:13,115
left you alone like that.

109
00:10:15,885 --> 00:10:17,155
I shouldn't have...

110
00:10:17,765 --> 00:10:20,074
let you go like that.

111
00:10:27,814 --> 00:10:29,294
Why did I...

112
00:10:30,155 --> 00:10:32,635
delude myself into thinking that we were together...

113
00:10:33,785 --> 00:10:36,635
during all those times when I left you alone?

114
00:10:50,005 --> 00:10:51,145
But...

115
00:10:53,094 --> 00:10:54,865
I'm going to...

116
00:10:55,265 --> 00:10:58,155
put my regrets aside for now...

117
00:10:59,974 --> 00:11:01,704
and like the words of Yun Dong Ju, the poet,

118
00:11:02,564 --> 00:11:04,473
in the book you left for me...

119
00:11:04,474 --> 00:11:05,867
("Sky, Wind, and Stars")

120
00:11:07,645 --> 00:11:09,375
I will...

121
00:11:09,564 --> 00:11:12,464
try to move on and walk my path.

122
00:11:15,694 --> 00:11:17,755
I feel like this path...

123
00:11:20,035 --> 00:11:21,385
will lead me to you...

124
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,395
and that we will meet again one day.

125
00:11:25,704 --> 00:11:27,395

You know we're all going out for dinner together this evening, right?

132
00:12:05,827 --> 00:12:06,827
Yes.

133
00:12:06,828 --> 00:12:09,012
Hold on. I don't see Kanna.

134
00:12:09,036 --> 00:12:12,876
Oh, Kanna left earlier because she had other plans.

135
00:12:12,877 --> 00:12:14,057
She did?

136
00:12:14,377 --> 00:12:16,545
Then shall we head back to the office now?

137
00:12:16,546 --> 00:12:17,586
- Sure. - Sure.

138
00:12:17,587 --> 00:12:19,317

Where did you go during your working hours?

141
00:12:36,276 --> 00:12:37,856
Something urgent came up,

142
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,957
so I stepped out with Professor's permission.

143
00:12:40,946 --> 00:12:42,065
Why? Did something happen?

144
00:12:42,066 --> 00:12:43,546
Yes, something big happened.

145
00:12:44,737 --> 00:12:46,427
Like what? Emergency surgery?

146
00:12:46,987 --> 00:12:48,177
No.

147
00:12:49,286 --> 00:12:52,636
I prepared a huge surprise event as your wedding gift.

148
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,266
An event?

149
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,766
What is it? You're making it sound so grand.

150
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:02,607
You'll pass out when you hear it.

151
00:13:03,926 --> 00:13:05,947
I won't pass out, so hurry up and tell me.

152
00:13:07,097 --> 00:13:08,636
I have to go down to the ER.

153
00:13:08,637 --> 00:13:10,156
The director has confirmed it.

154
00:13:12,347 --> 00:13:13,573
Confirmed, what?

155
00:13:13,597 --> 00:13:14,906
You going to the US for your training.

156
00:13:15,357 --> 00:13:16,786
What? The US?

157
00:13:17,977 --> 00:13:20,416
Aren't you grateful? I bet you want to scream "Thank you" now.

Hey.

159
00:13:24,696 --> 00:13:26,655
You should've given me a heads-up.

160
00:13:26,656 --> 00:13:30,386
Hey, that would've ruined the surprise.

161
00:13:30,536 --> 00:13:33,516
You know all the fellows wanted to land this opportunity, right?

162
00:13:33,707 --> 00:13:36,126
My goodness. To make this happen,

163
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,097
I had to curry favour with the director nonstop.

164
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,016
Do you have any idea?

165
00:13:41,877 --> 00:13:44,045
I should tell Hong.

166
00:13:44,046 --> 00:13:46,817
Of course, she'll be thrilled. It's an amazing opportunity.

167
00:13:47,176 --> 00:13:49,366
When you return, she'll have a professor husband.

168
00:13:49,556 --> 00:13:51,577
And you guys can take it easy in Seattle.

169
00:13:53,477 --> 00:13:54,515
You think so?

170
00:13:54,516 --> 00:13:56,996
Yes, for sure. Trust me.

171
00:13:57,357 --> 00:13:59,416
My wife loved it there.

172
00:14:00,146 --> 00:14:01,957
Then I'll tell Professor that you said yes.

173
00:14:03,316 --> 00:14:04,876
Du Yeol, wait.

174
00:14:07,617 --> 00:14:10,837
Sorry, but can I give you an answer by this evening?

175
00:14:11,696 --> 00:14:13,677
I think I should tell Hong first.

176
00:14:14,207 --> 00:14:16,977
Sure. You need your wife's clearance.

177
00:14:17,536 --> 00:14:18,727
Call me later.

178
00:14:19,337 --> 00:14:20,437

But we seem to dream of different things

186

Did those people...

187
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:33,328
suffer from a painful breakup and heartache?

188
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:38,379
Do they look at their calendar for no reason...

189
00:15:39,698 --> 00:15:43,928
only to realize it's the birthday of their past love...

190
00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:46,259
and zone out?

191
00:15:46,749 --> 00:15:51,895
I can only hope it will pass me by

192
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:57,398
So I can remain in comfort

193
00:15:59,798 --> 00:16:03,847
A love that is poor

194
00:16:03,848 --> 00:16:08,489
That is where it ends

195
00:16:19,948 --> 00:16:21,209
Mr. Sasae.

196
00:16:25,948 --> 00:16:27,339
Hello.

197
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:30,599
I'm Choi Han, the CEO of Sodam Publishing House.

198
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:34,558
Thank you so much for coming by.

199
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:37,229
It's a pleasure to meet you.

200
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:40,648
Thank you for the invitation.

201
00:16:41,428 --> 00:16:44,528
Let's talk over some tea in my office.

202
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:46,698
Come this way.

203
00:16:52,688 --> 00:16:55,749
You must be busy in Japan.

204
00:16:56,109 --> 00:17:00,375
Thank you for sparing your precious time to visit Korea...

205
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,668
to promote your book.

206
00:17:04,448 --> 00:17:05,719
Not at all.

207
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:08,509
Thanks to you,

208
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:11,969
I managed to complete everything including today's book signing.

209
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,888
Is this your first time in Korea?

210
00:17:16,879 --> 00:17:17,979
Yes.

211
00:17:18,379 --> 00:17:21,769
It's so close to Japan, but it took me a while.

212
00:17:24,178 --> 00:17:26,858
It can be close, but also very far.

213
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:32,199
You speak such fluent Japanese.

214
00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:36,959
I studied in Japan,

215
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:41,999
and I worked there for five years as a correspondent for a newspaper.

216
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:44,838
You were there for quite a while.

217
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:52,298
Maybe that's why I found your work very moving.

218
00:17:54,248 --> 00:17:55,638
Thank you.

219
00:17:56,129 --> 00:17:57,939
Reading your book...

220
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,899
made me wonder.

221
00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:04,818
Does love actually have an ending?

222
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:09,449
There most definitely is a beginning,

223
00:18:10,218 --> 00:18:13,328
but there doesn't seem to be an end.

224
00:18:17,268 --> 00:18:19,209
I felt...

225
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:22,628
that was what your book was telling me.

226
00:18:26,278 --> 00:18:29,048
I talk too much now that I'm older.

227
00:18:31,488 --> 00:18:33,908
My daughter says...

228
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:36,269
climacterium is to blame.

229
00:18:37,788 --> 00:18:39,308
Please, enjoy your tea.

230
00:18:40,248 --> 00:18:41,558
Thank you.

231
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:35,699
Go upstairs and look around.

232
00:19:36,228 --> 00:19:38,239
The staff should be there.

233
00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:41,409
There's nothing much to see.

234
00:19:53,528 --> 00:19:56,009
I hope we can all get along.

235
00:19:56,248 --> 00:19:58,259
I hope we can get along.

236
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:00,474
- I hope so. - I hope so.

237
00:20:00,498 --> 00:20:02,957
Everyone here is a fan of yours.

238
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,548
I should get an autograph.

239
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:05,838
You're good-looking.

240
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,058
You're handsome.

241
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:11,025
Since you came all this way, can we get your autograph?

242
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:13,989
If you don't mind, they'd like your autograph.

243
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:15,528
Yes, sure.

244
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:17,028
This way, please.

245
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:23,159
Can I sit here?

246
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:25,368
Yes, you can sit here.

247
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:29,499
Please do your best for us.

248
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:31,298
Sure.

249
00:21:47,298 --> 00:21:50,727
(The spring flowers are a reply to the winter snowflakes.)

250
00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:56,878
Are you done, Mr. Sasae?

251
00:21:57,738 --> 00:21:59,679
No, not yet.

252
00:22:01,698 --> 00:22:02,848
Excuse me.

253
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:08,189
Is Ms. Choi Hong not here?

254
00:22:08,589 --> 00:22:12,108
I heard she went out on business.

255
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:18,199
Once you're done, we'll all go to have dinner.

256
00:22:18,758 --> 00:22:20,659
Okay. I understand.

257
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:26,659
The autograph...

258
00:22:31,778 --> 00:22:34,858
Okay. I'll try after the dinner.

259
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:35,959
Okay.

260
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:00,899
Did you visit Writer Han's office?

261
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:03,618
Yes.

262
00:23:04,678 --> 00:23:07,368
Do you know we're taking Mr. Sasae to dinner?

263
00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:10,828
I made plans with Min Jun.

264
00:23:12,649 --> 00:23:14,477
Drop by just for a short while.

265
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:16,499
Tell Min Jun you'll be a bit late.

266
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,298
I'll call to ask Min Jun first.

267
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:23,888
Okay. Mr. Lee said he'd drive me. See you later.

268
00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:46,168
("What Comes After Love")

269
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,348
Mr. Yoon. Can you talk for a while?

270
00:24:12,379 --> 00:24:14,769
Yes, Ms. Choi. What about?

271
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:16,729
I must ask a favour.

272
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:20,318
Thank you.

273
00:24:24,008 --> 00:24:28,278
Is Kichijoji's Harmonica Alley still famous?

274
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:32,449
You went to Harmonica Alley too?

275
00:24:33,609 --> 00:24:34,828
No.

276
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:38,078
Back when my daughter studied in Japan,

277
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:40,419
she lived in Kichijoji.

278
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:43,338
I remember what she told me.

279
00:24:44,698 --> 00:24:45,969
I see.

280
00:24:46,948 --> 00:24:50,888
My daughter works at my company.

281
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:52,997
The day you arrived in Japan,

282
00:24:52,998 --> 00:24:57,189
my older daughter met you at the airport as an interpreter.

283
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:00,479
Yes. I heard.

284
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:09,368
You made it.

285
00:25:15,688 --> 00:25:17,749
Ms. Choi. Sit next to Mr. Choi.

286
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:19,209
Thank you.

287
00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:24,868
Now that she's here too, let's get the cake, Mr. Yoon.

288
00:25:24,869 --> 00:25:26,009
Okay.

289
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,298
We just have to light the candles.

290
00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:30,947
I told you to start without me.

291
00:25:30,948 --> 00:25:33,348
It wouldn't be right if we didn't wait for you.

292
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:44,068
Okay, then.

293
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,149
Shall we?

294
00:25:46,928 --> 00:25:50,278
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

295
00:25:50,389 --> 00:25:53,865
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

296
00:25:53,889 --> 00:25:57,749
- Happy birthday, dear Mr. Sasae - Happy birthday, dear Mr. Sasae

297
00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:01,169
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

298
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:03,669
Happy birthday.

299
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,179
Mr. Sasae. I wish you a happy birthday.

300
00:26:13,869 --> 00:26:16,519
Thank you so very much.

301
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:23,108
Blow out the candles.

302
00:26:24,218 --> 00:26:25,608
Thank you.

303
00:26:35,438 --> 00:26:37,328
I like Mont Blanc cakes.

304
00:26:38,649 --> 00:26:41,578
Ms. Choi picked it out for you.

305
00:26:44,238 --> 00:26:45,959
I see.

306
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:48,338
Mr. Sasae.

307
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:51,588
Can I ask you a question as a fan?

308
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:54,798
She'd like to ask a question as a fan.

309
00:26:56,038 --> 00:26:57,929
Sure. That's fine.

310
00:26:57,998 --> 00:27:02,308
What happened with you and the lady you based your main character on?

311
00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:07,068
What happened between you and the lady you wrote about?

312
00:27:23,188 --> 00:27:25,838
In the novel, the couple has a happy ending.

313
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:31,469
We didn't in reality.

314
00:27:32,698 --> 00:27:36,219
I couldn't understand how lonely she felt,

315
00:27:37,579 --> 00:27:39,558
and she returned to Korea...

316
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:42,888
without a word to me.

317
00:27:59,101 --> 00:28:00,411
(Missed call: Rock)

318
00:28:08,028 --> 00:28:10,419
Hey, Rok, it's me. Is something wrong?

319
00:28:10,448 --> 00:28:12,919
Why didn't you pick up?

320
00:28:12,948 --> 00:28:15,969
Sorry. It's raining and I brought in the washing.

321
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:18,138
We're in trouble. What should we do?

322
00:28:18,909 --> 00:28:21,058
What's wrong? What happened?

323
00:28:21,169 --> 00:28:23,388
What should we do?

324
00:28:23,708 --> 00:28:26,439
I think Dad's company went bankrupt.

325
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:28,058
What?

326
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:31,068
Mom just told me.

327
00:28:31,629 --> 00:28:35,068
Dad filed for bankruptcy yesterday.

328
00:28:35,139 --> 00:28:36,239
What?

329
00:28:37,218 --> 00:28:38,368
Bankruptcy?

330
00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:40,659
I'm so scared.

331
00:28:40,938 --> 00:28:43,788
I can't reach Dad at all.

332
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,618
And Mom...

333
00:28:47,962 --> 00:28:50,022
(Beni)

334
00:28:56,663 --> 00:28:59,476
(Beni)

335
00:29:14,178 --> 00:29:15,949
What am I doing here?

336
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,848
Beni. You're still up?

337
00:29:47,248 --> 00:29:48,388
Yes.

338
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:51,019
I was waiting for you.

339
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:52,769
Today,

340
00:29:53,089 --> 00:29:56,318
one of our main writers suddenly died.

341
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:00,868
I see.

342
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,788
You always have a reason.

343
00:30:05,649 --> 00:30:09,328
And that reason is always more important than me.

344
00:30:10,438 --> 00:30:12,878
It's someone I once visited...

345
00:30:13,069 --> 00:30:15,237
at home for a drink.

346
00:30:15,238 --> 00:30:17,759
It would've been better if you gave me a call. No?

347
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:21,888
I was all over the place to make any calls.

348
00:30:22,248 --> 00:30:24,808
The phone kept ringing from places, including the press.

349
00:30:25,788 --> 00:30:27,848
Everyone was at the funeral house.

350
00:30:28,958 --> 00:30:30,497
I was alone at the office.

351
00:30:30,498 --> 00:30:32,479
Still, you could've given me a call.

352
00:30:33,258 --> 00:30:34,439
Beni...

353
00:30:35,549 --> 00:30:37,638
I was working, wasn't I?

354
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:39,528
Can't you just apologize to me?

355
00:30:40,849 --> 00:30:43,489
Is it that hard to say you're sorry?

356
00:30:43,639 --> 00:30:45,868
Do you know how I feel right now?

357
00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:49,538
You don't, and yet, why do you keep talking about yourself?

358
00:30:50,938 --> 00:30:52,628
All you need to do is apologize.

359
00:30:53,109 --> 00:30:55,878
Will someone punish you for apologizing to me?

360
00:30:56,149 --> 00:30:58,338
Why can't you say that simple word?

361
00:30:58,988 --> 00:31:00,679
- Beni. - What?

362
00:31:00,988 --> 00:31:03,298
Did I say something wrong?

363
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:05,929
No, right?

364
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:09,598
You don't care about me anymore, do you?

365
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:14,769
How I've been doing lately and what has been bothering me.

366
00:31:15,879 --> 00:31:17,528
You know nothing, Jungo.

367
00:31:18,178 --> 00:31:21,007
I was at work until this very hour.

368
00:31:21,008 --> 00:31:23,278
Does that mean you can break our promise?

369
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:27,618
Don't you remember we were going to eat together and have a talk?

370
00:31:28,228 --> 00:31:30,335
Why did you make this promise?

371
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:32,459
You could've just worked.

372
00:31:32,768 --> 00:31:34,749
Why on earth do you make promises?

373
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:38,987
Why must I always be the one worrying and waiting for you?

374
00:31:38,988 --> 00:31:40,798
I'm also tired, okay?

375
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:43,828
Do you think I like the way we live?

376
00:31:43,829 --> 00:31:45,548
But I'll see you when I get home.

377
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:49,457
There are times when I can't keep my promise when work gets busy.

378
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:51,848
Why can't you understand that?

379
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:00,739
So...

380
00:32:01,928 --> 00:32:03,358
In the end...

381
00:32:05,178 --> 00:32:07,278
I'm at fault?

382
00:32:08,268 --> 00:32:10,398
Beni. That's not what I'm saying.

383
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,659
Please.

384
00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:14,038
Can't you just apologize?

385
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:17,288
Do you know what hurts me more?

386
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:20,759
It's making the one who needs to be apologized into a bad person.

387
00:32:20,819 --> 00:32:22,588
You're the one in the wrong.

388
00:32:23,528 --> 00:32:26,548
You didn't take care of me and left me alone.

389
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:28,578
I told you numerous times.

390
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:30,808
I told you not to leave me alone.

391
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:34,189
This is a foreign country to me. I'm alone without you.

392
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:39,689
Why do you leave me alone and make me lonely?

393
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:11,969
Do you know...

394
00:33:13,498 --> 00:33:15,348
what happened today?

395
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:25,649
Did something happen in Korea?

396
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:35,709
Forget it.

397
00:33:44,028 --> 00:33:45,209
Jungo.

398
00:33:47,409 --> 00:33:48,679
Let's...

399
00:33:49,288 --> 00:33:50,759
break up.

400
00:33:54,329 --> 00:33:56,098
- Beni... - I'm...

401
00:33:59,129 --> 00:34:00,649
too tired now.

402
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,028
Any more than this...

403
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:10,779
is unbearable.

404
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:47,149
Not understanding your partner's loneliness.

405
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:52,658
Doesn't that mean your feelings have changed?

406
00:34:57,308 --> 00:34:58,408
No.

407
00:35:02,609 --> 00:35:05,089
My feelings never changed.

408
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:16,888
I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me today.

409
00:35:17,169 --> 00:35:18,638
I have prior plans.

410
00:35:18,788 --> 00:35:20,098
Are you leaving already?

411
00:35:20,129 --> 00:35:21,808
I'm already quite late.

412
00:35:22,549 --> 00:35:23,808
I'm sorry.

413
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:29,029
Mr. Sasae, please continue to work with our publisher.

414
00:35:51,908 --> 00:35:55,855
(The River)

415
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:22,322
(The River)

416
00:36:27,649 --> 00:36:29,459
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

417
00:36:30,029 --> 00:36:33,339
Dad insisted I drop by the team dinner.

418
00:36:33,949 --> 00:36:35,089
It's okay.

419
00:36:35,118 --> 00:36:37,138
- You're hungry, right? - Yes.

420
00:36:38,408 --> 00:36:39,598
What shall we have?

421
00:36:40,618 --> 00:36:43,098
How about your favourite shrimp?

422
00:36:43,248 --> 00:36:44,479
Or scallops?

423
00:36:44,629 --> 00:36:47,729
I'm fine with anything you want to order.

424
00:36:49,089 --> 00:36:51,479
Did something happen at work?

425
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:55,238
No. I'm just not craving anything today.

426
00:36:56,219 --> 00:36:57,368
Is that so?

427
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:59,328
Then I'll decide and make the order.

428
00:36:59,598 --> 00:37:00,738
Okay.

429
00:37:01,036 --> 00:37:03,460
(The River)

430
00:37:07,149 --> 00:37:08,625
It's nice.

431
00:37:08,649 --> 00:37:10,589
Coming to such a place in a while.

432
00:37:10,779 --> 00:37:12,249
It's been tough, right?

433
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:15,629
Work has been busy, and there's even the wedding preparation.

434
00:37:16,118 --> 00:37:17,468
I haven't been busy.

435
00:37:17,618 --> 00:37:21,008
Compared to me, a resident is way busier.

436
00:37:26,748 --> 00:37:27,939
Hong.

437
00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:30,729
I have good news.

438
00:37:31,589 --> 00:37:33,029
"Good news?"

439
00:37:33,759 --> 00:37:35,069
I got selected...

440
00:37:36,179 --> 00:37:37,859
for the US exchange training.

441
00:37:38,969 --> 00:37:40,118
Really?

442
00:37:41,179 --> 00:37:42,279
Yes.

443
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:44,578
Hong.

444
00:37:45,188 --> 00:37:47,118
Let's start a new life...

445
00:37:48,149 --> 00:37:49,629
in a new place.

446
00:38:07,879 --> 00:38:10,058
It's late, but let me propose to you properly.

447
00:38:12,169 --> 00:38:14,229
I'm sorry for putting it off until now,

448
00:38:15,129 --> 00:38:16,859
using my shyness as an excuse.

449
00:38:27,768 --> 00:38:29,169
Marry me.

450
00:38:38,118 --> 00:38:40,049
- Min Jun. - Hong.

451
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,388
All I need is you.

452
00:38:47,748 --> 00:38:49,138
I promise you.

453
00:38:51,049 --> 00:38:53,109
I will never let you feel lonely.

454
00:38:56,589 --> 00:38:58,319
Wherever we are...

455
00:38:59,138 --> 00:39:00,859
at any moment,

456
00:39:02,259 --> 00:39:03,618
I will never...

457
00:39:07,188 --> 00:39:09,249
leave you alone.

458
00:39:17,779 --> 00:39:18,959
Hong?

459
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:29,098
Here.

460
00:39:30,919 --> 00:39:32,689
Don't cry, Hong. What is it?

461
00:39:35,919 --> 00:39:38,529
Was my proposal that moving?

462
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:40,689
I'm sorry.

463
00:39:45,268 --> 00:39:46,488
Min Jun.

464
00:39:51,938 --> 00:39:53,999
I don't know what's wrong with me.

465
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:58,379
This isn't what I'm thinking.

466
00:40:08,658 --> 00:40:10,178
I'm sorry, Min Jun.

467
00:40:14,089 --> 00:40:15,939
But I honestly don't know.

468
00:40:19,429 --> 00:40:21,439
I thought I had forgotten about him completely.

469
00:40:35,228 --> 00:40:36,328
Is that why...

470
00:40:38,279 --> 00:40:40,419
you went to the autograph event today?

471
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:46,758
I was there, too.

472
00:40:52,328 --> 00:40:53,729
The anxiety was killing me.

473
00:41:09,638 --> 00:41:11,198
If...

474
00:41:13,978 --> 00:41:15,828
I had confessed to you...

475
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,669
before you left for Japan,

476
00:41:23,529 --> 00:41:24,919
would things have been different?

477
00:41:30,998 --> 00:41:32,098
Min Jun...

478
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,558
Even if I was dating you...

479
00:41:39,509 --> 00:41:42,019
before I met him...

480
00:41:43,299 --> 00:41:45,279
Even if we were married...

481
00:41:46,219 --> 00:41:48,238
and already had three children,

482
00:41:50,768 --> 00:41:52,279
had I met him,

483
00:41:53,348 --> 00:41:56,038
my heart would've sunk like this.

484
00:41:59,899 --> 00:42:01,288
If he leaves...

485
00:42:02,069 --> 00:42:03,459
and you do, too,

486
00:42:04,949 --> 00:42:06,718
I would be left alone.

487
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:14,678
But I can't fool you in fear of being alone.

488
00:42:23,799 --> 00:42:26,029
And it's because I really like you.

489
00:42:38,649 --> 00:42:40,459
Because you like me.

490
00:42:43,989 --> 00:42:45,589
Because you like me...

491
00:42:48,449 --> 00:42:50,129
I never imagined...

492
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:56,769
those words would feel so cold.

493
00:43:03,299 --> 00:43:06,069
I'm sorry, Min Jun. I'm leaving first.

494
00:43:36,368 --> 00:43:39,729
I don't know why I suddenly started crying.

495
00:43:41,129 --> 00:43:43,519
The moment Min Jun proposed to me,

496
00:43:45,669 --> 00:43:49,939
the thought I should become independent crossed my mind.

497
00:43:52,549 --> 00:43:56,078
No. Rather than crossing my mind, I was enlightened.

498
00:43:59,649 --> 00:44:03,788
And I remembered Jungo's face.

499
00:44:07,069 --> 00:44:09,049
His face still in pain because...

500
00:44:09,739 --> 00:44:12,218
our clumsiness and recklessness...

501
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:21,178
made our love more beautiful and because it stopped midway...

502
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:26,729
as there was no...

503
00:44:27,879 --> 00:44:29,229
proper farewell.

504
00:44:51,545 --> 00:44:55,827
(Mr. Yoon)

505
00:44:55,828 --> 00:44:56,968
Yes, Ms. Choi?

506
00:44:57,578 --> 00:44:58,928
Mr. Yoon.

507
00:44:59,658 --> 00:45:01,304
Are you still at the team dinner?

508
00:45:01,328 --> 00:45:04,168
No. Mr. Sasae seemed exhausted,

509
00:45:04,169 --> 00:45:05,689
so we called it a day early.

510
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,649
I just dropped off Mr. Sasae at the hotel.

511
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:10,109
Is that so?

512
00:45:10,299 --> 00:45:12,279
You did well for the whole day.

513
00:45:12,339 --> 00:45:13,735
Be careful on your way back.

514
00:45:13,759 --> 00:45:15,988
Thank you. Get back home safely.

515
00:46:13,149 --> 00:46:17,669
May I know Mr. Sasae Hikari's room number?

516
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:22,388
I'm afraid I can't tell you his room number, ma'am.

517
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:24,178
I see.

518
00:46:24,368 --> 00:46:26,058
I'm sorry, ma'am.

519
00:46:28,879 --> 00:46:30,189
Ma'am.

520
00:46:31,759 --> 00:46:34,418
I may not be able to tell you his room number,

521
00:46:34,419 --> 00:46:38,698
but he went to the first-floor bar just a while ago.

522
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:40,658
Thank you.
