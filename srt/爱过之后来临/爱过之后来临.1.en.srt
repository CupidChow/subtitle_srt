00:16:05,626 --> 00:16:07,385
Same here.

182
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,054
Hey, boss!

183
00:16:21,058 --> 00:16:23,000
- Are you Korean?
- I am.

184
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,063
I lived in Japan for five years
when I was in elementary school.

185
00:16:26,063 --> 00:16:28,698
So, communication won't be a problem.

186
00:16:31,193 --> 00:16:33,987
And you'll obviously be good at Japanese

187
00:16:33,987 --> 00:16:35,781
since you're a literature major.

188
00:16:35,781 --> 00:16:37,457
Yes, sir.

189
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,119
Not only am I good at Japanese,

190
00:16:41,119 --> 00:16:42,788
but I can speak Korean, too.

191
00:16:42,788 --> 00:16:46,291
So I can serve Korean customers.

192
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:49,503
We do get a lot
of Korean tourists these days.

193
00:16:49,503 --> 00:16:51,512
Can you speak Korean?

194
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:55,349
No, I can't speak Korean.

195
00:16:59,137 --> 00:17:00,514
However,

196
00:17:00,514 --> 00:17:02,849
I've had to work to pay for my tuition,

197
00:17:02,849 --> 00:17:05,018
so I have a lot of experience.

198
00:17:05,018 --> 00:17:07,604
I need the money
to pay for this semester, too.

199
00:17:07,604 --> 00:17:09,447
That must be tough.

200
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:16,530
I need to find work so I can make money

201
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:20,117
to pay for rent each month,
or I'll end up getting kicked out.

202
00:17:20,117 --> 00:17:22,285
And I'm here in Japan all by myself.

203
00:17:22,285 --> 00:17:23,704
Rent...

204
00:17:23,704 --> 00:17:25,789
Yeah, the rent is pretty high around here.

205
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:27,416
It really is!

206
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:30,033
And since I'm an overseas student,

207
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:33,002
I can't even apply for a loan.

208
00:17:34,381 --> 00:17:36,842
All right, I've heard enough.

209
00:17:36,842 --> 00:17:38,719
So, you need money to pay your rent,

210
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:41,013
and you need money for school.

211
00:17:41,013 --> 00:17:42,139
Unfortunately,

212
00:17:42,139 --> 00:17:44,774
we only have one position open.

213
00:17:48,312 --> 00:17:50,272
How about we do it like this?

214
00:17:50,272 --> 00:17:53,658
Why don't you stay for tryouts today?

215
00:17:55,569 --> 00:17:58,279
I'll keep an eye on how you two work

216
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:00,698
and hire the one who does better.

217
00:18:00,698 --> 00:18:02,626
That's fair, isn't it?

218
00:18:02,626 --> 00:18:05,387
All right. Let's do this.

219
00:18:08,758 --> 00:18:10,468
[OPEN]

220
00:18:10,468 --> 00:18:13,554
Thank you for waiting. Please come in.

221
00:18:13,554 --> 00:18:16,173
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

222
00:18:16,173 --> 00:18:17,799
Sorry to keep you waiting.

223
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,926
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

224
00:18:19,926 --> 00:18:22,179
Here you go. One large ramen.

225
00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:24,389
- I'll bring you your rice, too.
- Here you go.

226
00:18:24,389 --> 00:18:26,065
Thank you.

227
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,936
Thank you for waiting.

228
00:18:29,936 --> 00:18:31,605
- I brought the noodles!
- I got it.

229
00:18:31,605 --> 00:18:33,231
One al dente shoyu ramen, ready to serve!

230
00:18:33,231 --> 00:18:35,450
I'm on it. Thank you.

231
00:18:37,861 --> 00:18:39,029
Thank you for waiting.

232
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:40,322
This way, please.

233
00:18:40,322 --> 00:18:43,825
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you. The food was really good.

234
00:18:43,825 --> 00:18:45,953
Thank you for waiting.

235
00:18:45,953 --> 00:18:48,087
Thank you for waiting.

236
00:18:53,794 --> 00:18:56,512
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

237
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,724
Hey! Menu!

238
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:04,353
Here you go, sir.

239
00:19:07,516 --> 00:19:10,811
This is our <i>tonkotsu shio</i> ramen,

240
00:19:10,811 --> 00:19:13,939
and this is our <i>tonkotsu shoyu</i> ramen.

241
00:19:13,939 --> 00:19:17,567
The <i>tonkotsu shio</i> ramen is our best seller.

242
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:21,454
Please take your time
and let me know when you've decided.

243
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:28,753
Is there a waiter who speaks Japanese here?

244
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:33,000
How may I help you, sir?

245
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,169
It's uncomfortable to see
so many foreigners these days

246
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:38,088
waiting tables like this.

247
00:19:38,088 --> 00:19:41,008
In that case, I'll be happy to take your order.

248
00:19:41,008 --> 00:19:44,845
Good. You need to think
of what's best for the customers.

249
00:19:44,845 --> 00:19:48,106
You should teach your staff
to speak Japanese properly.

250
00:19:51,852 --> 00:19:53,903
Sir, I'm going to have to ask you

251
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:57,106
to apologize for what you just said.

252
00:19:57,106 --> 00:19:58,275
What?

253
00:19:58,275 --> 00:19:59,776
You want me to apologize?

254
00:19:59,776 --> 00:20:01,820
Yes, sir.

255
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,072
Please apologize.

256
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:06,582
I'll take your order once you do.

257
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,522
Have you lost your mind?

258
00:20:17,377 --> 00:20:19,804
You've got some guts, kid.

259
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:25,478
You can stare at me all you want,

260
00:20:25,478 --> 00:20:27,654
but I'm not going to apologize.

261
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,357
I'm sorry, sir,

262
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,918
but you need to leave.

263
00:20:32,918 --> 00:20:35,754
You're making the other guests uncomfortable.

264
00:20:35,754 --> 00:20:38,223
Well, I've lost my appetite now.

265
00:20:39,091 --> 00:20:41,226
That's all on you, Mr. Waiter.

266
00:20:57,693 --> 00:21:01,155
I'm sorry about how I acted
in front of that customer.

267
00:21:01,155 --> 00:21:03,073
I'm sorry, sir.

268
00:21:03,073 --> 00:21:04,616
Don't worry.

269
00:21:04,616 --> 00:21:06,201
I'm sorry that it happened.

270
00:21:06,201 --> 00:21:08,203
It's okay.

271
00:21:08,203 --> 00:21:09,663
You.

272
00:21:09,663 --> 00:21:11,464
You'll start tomorrow.

273
00:21:12,141 --> 00:21:13,817
Yes, sir.

274
00:21:15,335 --> 00:21:16,970
Here you go.

275
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,801
You did well today.

276
00:21:22,801 --> 00:21:24,727
Thank you, sir.

277
00:21:43,822 --> 00:21:45,449
That must be it.

278
00:21:45,449 --> 00:21:47,292
I'm telling you!

279
00:21:48,035 --> 00:21:49,711
What do you mean?

280
00:21:51,622 --> 00:21:53,332
What are you saying?

281
00:21:53,332 --> 00:21:55,042
He came to your rescue.

282
00:21:55,042 --> 00:21:56,710
He wanted brownie points.

283
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,670
Don't be ridiculous.

284
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,589
Well, look at you!

285
00:22:00,589 --> 00:22:03,717
You were pretty much forever alone in Korea.

286
00:22:03,717 --> 00:22:06,512
But look at what you've achieved
as soon as you came to Japan.

287
00:22:06,512 --> 00:22:08,722
Come on, I was never forever alone.

288
00:22:08,722 --> 00:22:12,184
I mean, have you ever dated anyone
who was half-decent?

289
00:22:12,184 --> 00:22:14,937
One ghosted you,
and one went to the army.

290
00:22:14,937 --> 00:22:17,356
When did you ever snag a catch?

291
00:22:17,356 --> 00:22:19,875
Then there's Min Jun, who's actually not that bad.

292
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:22,468
But you insist he's just a friend.

293
00:22:23,696 --> 00:22:24,947
Listen.

294
00:22:24,947 --> 00:22:28,659
How many times must I tell you?
He really is just a friend.

295
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:30,703
Sure, whatever.

296
00:22:30,703 --> 00:22:34,415
Did he cry when you left Korea?

297
00:22:34,415 --> 00:22:36,417
Poor Min Jun.

298
00:22:36,417 --> 00:22:40,254
Trust me. I bet he can't stand
being put in the friend zone.

299
00:22:40,254 --> 00:22:43,765
That's enough.
It's not like you're doing any better.

300
00:22:44,425 --> 00:22:46,218
I feel bad for your knight in shining armor.

301
00:22:46,218 --> 00:22:48,011
Doesn't he need money for school?

302
00:22:48,011 --> 00:22:51,948
I think he got a job
at a food truck across the street.

303
00:22:51,948 --> 00:22:53,100
Which is a relief.

304
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,817
A food truck?

305
00:22:58,105 --> 00:22:59,823
Here you go.

306
00:23:29,011 --> 00:23:31,980
[CLOSED]

307
00:23:38,062 --> 00:23:40,947
Sorry for the wait. Thank you for coming!

308
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:45,277
Thank you.

309
00:23:45,277 --> 00:23:46,953
What can I get you?

310
00:23:49,406 --> 00:23:52,493
You're staring at the food truck again.

311
00:23:52,493 --> 00:23:53,660
What?

312
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,287
Who, me?

313
00:23:55,287 --> 00:23:57,581
No, I wasn't.

314
00:23:57,581 --> 00:23:59,458
I was just...

315
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:02,969
checking to see if it was raining outside.

316
00:24:05,589 --> 00:24:07,591
Hong.

317
00:24:07,591 --> 00:24:11,144
- Yes, sir?
- Can you get some hotdogs for us?

318
00:24:14,264 --> 00:24:15,940
Yes, sir.

319
00:24:21,563 --> 00:24:23,148
- Thank you for your waiting!
- Here we go!

320
00:24:23,148 --> 00:24:24,733
Hong finally passes the halfway line

321
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:27,361
and runs straight into the opponent's territory!

322
00:24:27,361 --> 00:24:28,946
Here's the moment we've all been waiting for.

323
00:24:28,946 --> 00:24:31,115
Will Hong finally get to score her first goal?

324
00:24:31,115 --> 00:24:32,783
The suspense is real!

325
00:24:32,783 --> 00:24:34,993
Now, we've got to ask!

326
00:24:34,993 --> 00:24:39,081
Did she really have to go out
with that headwrap on her head?

327
00:24:39,081 --> 00:24:40,791
What a terrible oversight!

328
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:44,628
She's not as level-headed as she usually is.

329
00:24:44,628 --> 00:24:46,839
She must be feeling nervous.

330
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:48,924
Perhaps she's not used to playing such games.

331
00:24:48,924 --> 00:24:51,510
Right, that must be it.

332
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:54,229
Thank you. Please come again.

333
00:24:59,393 --> 00:25:01,186
Hello.

334
00:25:01,186 --> 00:25:02,862
Hello.

335
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:06,048
It's been a while.

336
00:25:10,362 --> 00:25:12,656
Are you here for some hotdogs?

337
00:25:12,656 --> 00:25:14,283
Oh, yes.

338
00:25:14,283 --> 00:25:16,759
Can I have five cheese hotdogs, please?

339
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:17,787
- Five?
- Yes, please.

340
00:25:17,787 --> 00:25:19,505
Five cheese hotdogs.

341
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:30,181
That headwrap looks good on you.

342
00:25:31,091 --> 00:25:33,184
Thank you.

343
00:25:33,927 --> 00:25:35,262
And you, too.

344
00:25:35,262 --> 00:25:37,522
You look good in your apron.

345
00:25:39,475 --> 00:25:41,442
Thank you.

346
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:45,488
Thank you very much.

347
00:25:47,358 --> 00:25:48,942
Here she comes!

348
00:25:48,942 --> 00:25:50,702
Get back to work!

349
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:53,489
Come get your hotdogs!

350
00:25:53,489 --> 00:25:55,540
- Great.
- Thanks.

351
00:25:57,201 --> 00:25:58,835
Here you go.

352
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:01,914
- Thanks.
- Here you go.

353
00:26:01,914 --> 00:26:04,083
Oh, I almost forgot.

354
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:08,420
It's our turn to clean
the shopping district this week.

355
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,714
We've always had the newbies do it.

356
00:26:10,714 --> 00:26:12,591
So, you'll be doing that from now.

357
00:26:12,591 --> 00:26:15,317
It's at 10 a.m. tomorrow.
Do you think you can do it?

358
00:26:15,317 --> 00:26:18,030
Of course. Leave it to me.

359
00:26:18,847 --> 00:26:20,391
Good luck!

360
00:26:20,391 --> 00:26:22,066
Yes, sir!

361
00:26:26,647 --> 00:26:31,318
The stores of the Kichijoji Prosperity Association

362
00:26:31,318 --> 00:26:34,446
work hard to keep the shopping district clean.

363
00:26:34,446 --> 00:26:38,909
We meet every morning
to clean up an area of the district.

364
00:26:38,909 --> 00:26:41,328
We appreciate your cooperation.

365
00:26:41,328 --> 00:26:42,955
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

366
00:26:42,955 --> 00:26:45,222
Let's start by taking attendance.

367
00:26:45,222 --> 00:26:46,682
Ichiro's Ramen?

368
00:26:46,682 --> 00:26:48,210
- Here.
- Thank you.

369
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,420
Murakami Bookstore?

370
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,547
- Here.
- Great.

371
00:26:51,547 --> 00:26:53,882
Inubushi's Food Truck?

372
00:26:53,882 --> 00:26:56,051
Inubushi's Food Truck?

373
00:26:56,051 --> 00:26:58,512
Is there anyone from Inubushi's Food Truck?

374
00:26:58,512 --> 00:27:00,522
I'm here!

375
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,520
- Sorry for being late.
- That's okay.

376
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,981
- Wasabi Store?
- Here.

377
00:27:08,981 --> 00:27:10,524
Eclin Store?

378
00:27:10,524 --> 00:27:11,608
- Present.
- Thank you.

379
00:27:11,608 --> 00:27:13,527
All right. Let's get to work.

380
00:27:13,527 --> 00:27:14,862
Can you get this as well?

381
00:27:14,862 --> 00:27:16,496
Over here.

382
00:27:32,421 --> 00:27:34,055
Oh, that's cold!

383
00:27:50,522 --> 00:27:53,192
- Hong.
- What's up, Rock?

384
00:27:53,192 --> 00:27:55,277
You promised only to call in emergencies.

385
00:27:55,277 --> 00:27:57,154
It's actually an emergency right now.

386
00:27:57,154 --> 00:27:58,955
<i>Hong!</i>

387
00:28:01,033 --> 00:28:02,326
What's wrong with you?

388
00:28:02,326 --> 00:28:04,745
You said you were going to Jeju Island.
What on earth are you doing in Japan?

389
00:28:04,745 --> 00:28:06,705
It's pretty much the same.

390
00:28:06,705 --> 00:28:09,473
It's about as close as Jeju,
and Japan's an island, too.

391
00:28:09,473 --> 00:28:11,293
Come back home right now.

392
00:28:11,293 --> 00:28:14,296
If you're done with college,
you should be thinking about working

393
00:28:14,296 --> 00:28:16,382
instead of running away
like an adolescent child!

394
00:28:16,382 --> 00:28:18,725
Yeah, I'm not a child anymore,
so I moved out.

395
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:22,846
Are you listening to yourself right now?

396
00:28:22,846 --> 00:28:25,766
Stop wasting your time and come back home,

397
00:28:25,766 --> 00:28:27,434
<i>or you'll regret all this later!</i>

398
00:28:27,434 --> 00:28:28,519
Listen, Mom.

399
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:31,021
It's up to me whether I decide
to waste my time or not.

400
00:28:31,021 --> 00:28:32,231
It's my life.

401
00:28:32,231 --> 00:28:36,068
You don't even know why I came here
and what it is that I want to do, do you?

402
00:28:36,068 --> 00:28:38,779
You're always the same.
You dip your toes in this and that,

403
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:41,156
<i>then quit when things don't work out.</i>

404
00:28:41,156 --> 00:28:44,702
I know you ran away
because you're afraid to get a job.

405
00:28:44,702 --> 00:28:46,662
- Mom!
<i>- What?</i>

406
00:28:46,662 --> 00:28:49,047
<i>Am I wrong?</i>

407
00:28:49,915 --> 00:28:51,500
No, you're right.

408
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,336
I did run away.

409
00:28:54,336 --> 00:28:56,095
I ran away from you.

410
00:29:13,564 --> 00:29:15,990
Talk about perfect timing.

411
00:29:48,265 --> 00:29:50,024
I was wondering...

412
00:29:52,436 --> 00:29:57,323
If you're free after work tonight...

413
00:30:01,612 --> 00:30:04,038
do you want to go for a drink?

414
00:30:18,712 --> 00:30:20,847
I see.

415
00:30:21,882 --> 00:30:25,886
So, you might end up staying
in Japan for a while then.

416
00:30:25,886 --> 00:30:29,306
I'm not sure yet.

417
00:30:29,306 --> 00:30:32,650
I'm trying to get ready
to go to graduate school...

418
00:30:33,811 --> 00:30:36,730
but I don't know if I should stay here

419
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:39,274
or just move on.

420
00:30:39,274 --> 00:30:42,035
I'm not even sure if I'll like it here.

421
00:30:44,196 --> 00:30:48,742
You should take your time
and think about it while you're here.

422
00:30:48,742 --> 00:30:50,369
That's all I want.

423
00:30:50,369 --> 00:30:53,163
I want to mull it over and take things slow.

424
00:30:53,163 --> 00:30:55,590
But you know,

425
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:59,677
life sometimes needs time to buffer.

426
00:31:00,379 --> 00:31:02,138
"Buffer"?

427
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:04,883
I mean,

428
00:31:04,883 --> 00:31:08,303
it's kind of like putting on the brakes.

429
00:31:08,303 --> 00:31:12,398
I see what you mean.
Like brakes that slow you down?

430
00:31:18,731 --> 00:31:21,775
The person who's meant to be on my side

431
00:31:21,775 --> 00:31:25,696
can't seem to understand me.

432
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:28,540
They don't even seem to want to try.

433
00:31:29,408 --> 00:31:32,001
Has that ever happened to you?

434
00:31:38,542 --> 00:31:41,628
It happens sometimes.

435
00:31:41,628 --> 00:31:44,256
And it hurts so much when it does.

436
00:31:44,256 --> 00:31:46,091
It's so frustrating.

437
00:31:46,091 --> 00:31:48,643
Why else would I come all the way here?

438
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:55,434
Oh, by the way.

439
00:31:55,434 --> 00:31:58,062
You're a literature major, right?

440
00:31:58,062 --> 00:32:00,939
- Right.
- So am I!

441
00:32:00,939 --> 00:32:02,615
No way!

442
00:32:04,234 --> 00:32:07,488
We have quite a lot in common.

443
00:32:07,488 --> 00:32:09,615
How so?

444
00:32:09,615 --> 00:32:13,243
Well, we both have the same major,

445
00:32:13,243 --> 00:32:15,788
and we're both desperate for work.

446
00:32:15,788 --> 00:32:17,206
And...

447
00:32:17,206 --> 00:32:19,090
What else...

448
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,418
Right!

449
00:32:21,418 --> 00:32:23,428
We're both buffering!

450
00:32:24,129 --> 00:32:26,014
You're right.

451
00:32:30,761 --> 00:32:34,314
So, why did you choose literature?

452
00:32:37,893 --> 00:32:41,855
I wanted to become a writer.

453
00:32:41,855 --> 00:32:45,665
Actually, I feel more comfortable

454
00:32:45,665 --> 00:32:48,217
expressing my thoughts on paper.

455
00:32:49,488 --> 00:32:52,415
What are you writing these days?

456
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,370
Well, just this and that.

457
00:32:56,370 --> 00:33:00,290
I just write down whatever comes to mind,

458
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:03,885
but it's nothing to write home about.

459
00:33:10,217 --> 00:33:12,386
I think you'll make it.

460
00:33:12,386 --> 00:33:14,263
Pardon?

461
00:33:14,263 --> 00:33:16,105
As a writer, I mean.

462
00:33:18,434 --> 00:33:20,276
You think so?

463
00:33:20,936 --> 00:33:22,779
Trust me.

464
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,407
I just have a feeling.

465
00:33:33,323 --> 00:33:35,041
Can I...

466
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,203
really trust your feelings?

467
00:33:38,203 --> 00:33:39,811
If you don't believe me,

468
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:42,458
then come and see for yourself.

469
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:44,133
What?

470
00:33:50,883 --> 00:33:52,517
Come on.

471
00:34:00,684 --> 00:34:02,227
Let's go!

472
00:34:02,227 --> 00:34:03,903
You've got this.

473
00:34:09,568 --> 00:34:11,953
Come on, Bonobono!

474
00:34:12,696 --> 00:34:14,664
That's it. You got it!

475
00:34:30,047 --> 00:34:31,423
That's too bad.

476
00:34:31,423 --> 00:34:34,934
I was hoping it'd be a Bonobono.

477
00:34:36,303 --> 00:34:38,180
So, if you got Dai Nee-chan,

478
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:41,433
does that mean your feelings were off?

479
00:34:41,433 --> 00:34:43,936
You know about Dai Nee-chan?

480
00:34:43,936 --> 00:34:47,648
Not many people know about that character.

481
00:34:47,648 --> 00:34:51,610
She's the older sister of Shimarisu-kun,
who is Bonobono's friend.

482
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:53,487
Oh, no way!

483
00:34:53,487 --> 00:34:55,622
You really do know her!

484
00:34:56,365 --> 00:35:00,803
Shall we call it a day?
It looks like you're fresh out of luck.

485
00:35:00,803 --> 00:35:03,372
Did you say we're going for another drink?

486
00:35:03,372 --> 00:35:05,874
What? You seem pretty drunk already.

487
00:35:05,874 --> 00:35:07,543
I'm totally fine.

488
00:35:07,543 --> 00:35:10,462
I haven't even had that much to drink.

489
00:35:10,462 --> 00:35:13,674
You had ten lemon sours.

490
00:35:13,674 --> 00:35:15,816
Hey, this is Choi Hong you're talking to.

491
00:35:15,816 --> 00:35:17,344
What was that?

492
00:35:17,344 --> 00:35:18,804
Choi?

493
00:35:18,804 --> 00:35:21,557
That's right. Choi Hong.

494
00:35:21,557 --> 00:35:23,289
My last name is Choi,

495
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:25,591
and my first name is Hong.

496
00:35:28,605 --> 00:35:30,315
I'm Jungo.

497
00:35:30,315 --> 00:35:32,742
My name's Aoki Jungo.

498
00:35:33,527 --> 00:35:35,571
- Jungo.
- Right.

499
00:35:35,571 --> 00:35:37,330
Jungo...

500
00:35:38,657 --> 00:35:40,834
Hey, Jungo.

501
00:35:43,287 --> 00:35:46,999
Doesn't Dai Nee-chan look lonely to you?

502
00:35:46,999 --> 00:35:48,432
You know what we should do?

503
00:35:48,432 --> 00:35:51,462
We should look for her boyfriend!

504
00:35:51,462 --> 00:35:53,756
- Are you talking about Pippo?
- That's right!

505
00:35:53,756 --> 00:35:57,342
We need to find Pippo
so they can be with each other!

506
00:35:57,342 --> 00:35:59,644
- All right, then.
- Good.

507
00:36:06,825 --> 00:36:09,396
Come on, Pippo!

508
00:36:09,396 --> 00:36:11,440
You got one again!

509
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,074
That's amazing!

510
00:36:25,871 --> 00:36:27,206
What's the matter?

511
00:36:27,206 --> 00:36:31,627
I could've got Pippo
if I just played one more round.

512
00:36:31,627 --> 00:36:36,507
Dai Nee-chan needs to have Pippo by her side.

513
00:36:36,507 --> 00:36:39,343
You've got nothing to worry about.

514
00:36:39,343 --> 00:36:41,470
Even if it wasn't for you,

515
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:44,348
they'll always have each other.

516
00:36:44,348 --> 00:36:46,316
Their love is everlasting.

517
00:36:48,102 --> 00:36:50,153
Everlasting...

518
00:36:55,984 --> 00:36:59,704
Do you believe in everlasting love?

519
00:37:03,033 --> 00:37:06,836
That's a difficult question.

520
00:37:10,165 --> 00:37:14,427
I mean, it has to exist somewhere, right?

521
00:37:18,132 --> 00:37:20,308
"Somewhere"?

522
00:37:23,595 --> 00:37:25,271
I made up my mind!

523
00:37:26,724 --> 00:37:30,269
I'm going to stay here.

524
00:37:30,269 --> 00:37:33,905
I want to go and see where that "somewhere" is.

525
00:37:37,901 --> 00:37:39,570
By the way,

526
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,989
where do you live?

527
00:37:41,989 --> 00:37:43,782
Don't worry about me.

528
00:37:43,782 --> 00:37:46,042
I can get home by myself.

529
00:37:46,994 --> 00:37:48,996
Goodbye.

530
00:37:48,996 --> 00:37:50,998
How are you going to get home?

531
00:37:50,998 --> 00:37:53,375
I'm going to run.

532
00:37:53,375 --> 00:37:55,176
In this rain?

533
00:37:56,518 --> 00:37:58,505
Don't worry.

534
00:37:58,505 --> 00:38:03,268
I'm probably much faster than you.

535
00:38:10,851 --> 00:38:12,144
You might

536
00:38:12,144 --> 00:38:14,496
have me fooled for a weakling,

537
00:38:14,496 --> 00:38:16,832
but I actually run
around Inokashira Park every morning.

538
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,550
I do five laps each day.

539
00:38:20,877 --> 00:38:23,714
There's no way
you can run five laps every day.

540
00:38:23,714 --> 00:38:26,258

00:52:53,192 --> 00:52:54,951
No way.

723
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:58,030
Is it Cake Day?

724
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:00,949
It's your mother's birthday today.

725
00:53:00,949 --> 00:53:04,036
You're right! What time is it now?

726
00:53:04,036 --> 00:53:06,705
Come on, Hong.

727
00:53:06,705 --> 00:53:08,082
Didn't you forget last year as well?

728
00:53:08,082 --> 00:53:10,226
But lunar birthdays are so confusing.

729
00:53:10,226 --> 00:53:12,853
I forgot to get her something.

730
00:53:12,853 --> 00:53:14,421
Let's just go.

731
00:53:14,421 --> 00:53:16,472
What? Okay.

732
00:53:18,217 --> 00:53:19,885
Min Jun.

733
00:53:19,885 --> 00:53:22,179
Can we tell her that this is from me?

734
00:53:22,179 --> 00:53:23,889
Please?

735
00:53:23,889 --> 00:53:27,351
Don't give me that look.
You can't win me over that easily.

736
00:53:27,351 --> 00:53:30,037
Please, Min Jun. Can we?

737
00:53:30,037 --> 00:53:33,464
Just this once. Please.

738
00:53:37,753 --> 00:53:39,755
Did Jun say he'll be here by 7 p.m.?

739
00:53:39,755 --> 00:53:41,006
Yes, he did.

740
00:53:41,006 --> 00:53:42,633
I told you he would be.

741
00:53:42,633 --> 00:53:44,885
Why do you have to keep checking?

742
00:53:44,885 --> 00:53:48,263
You should've picked him up yourself.

743
00:53:48,263 --> 00:53:50,223
What's with the attitude?

744
00:53:50,223 --> 00:53:52,900
I just want to make sure there's enough food.

745
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:57,606
If I ever get a boyfriend,
I'm never going to tell you.

746
00:53:57,606 --> 00:54:00,074
Sure. Don't bother.

747
00:54:01,151 --> 00:54:02,869
That must be them.

748
00:54:04,404 --> 00:54:05,781
Hello, my brother-in-law-to-be.

749
00:54:05,781 --> 00:54:07,908
Hey. How have you been?

750
00:54:07,908 --> 00:54:10,619
"Brother-in-law"? That's so weird.

751
00:54:10,619 --> 00:54:13,786
Hey, let her be.
She's just practicing. Right?

752
00:54:13,786 --> 00:54:15,165
Hello, Jun.

753
00:54:15,165 --> 00:54:16,208
Come on in.

754
00:54:16,208 --> 00:54:19,002
Happy birthday, Mother.

755
00:54:19,002 --> 00:54:22,297
Thanks, Min Jun. You must be hungry.

756
00:54:22,297 --> 00:54:25,634
This makes me so happy.

757
00:54:25,634 --> 00:54:28,762
This is such a lovely cake!

758
00:54:28,762 --> 00:54:31,682
Didn't you hate birthdays
because it made you feel old?

759
00:54:31,682 --> 00:54:32,746
What's gotten into you?

760
00:54:32,746 --> 00:54:35,102
I'm celebrating with my future son-in-law.

761
00:54:35,102 --> 00:54:39,106
You have no idea how happy I am.

762
00:54:39,106 --> 00:54:42,567
Just wait until you meet yours later.
You'll know exactly how I feel.

763
00:54:42,567 --> 00:54:44,569
Can you stop getting ahead of yourself?

764
00:54:44,569 --> 00:54:46,238
Why are you and Rock being so weird?

765
00:54:46,238 --> 00:54:49,992
No, you're being weird.
We're basically a family now.

766
00:54:49,992 --> 00:54:51,667
That's right.

767
00:54:52,786 --> 00:54:54,037
I'm so sorry.

768
00:54:54,037 --> 00:54:55,956
I had to take this call.

769
00:54:55,956 --> 00:54:58,083
So, what did I miss?

770
00:54:58,083 --> 00:55:01,920
Don't worry.
You didn't miss anything important.

771
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,255
By the way, Hong.

772
00:55:03,255 --> 00:55:06,466
- Can I ask you for a favor?
- A favor?

773
00:55:06,466 --> 00:55:08,593
Can you go to the airport for me tomorrow?

774
00:55:08,593 --> 00:55:11,346
- What?
- I need a replacement interpreter

775
00:55:11,346 --> 00:55:14,725
because Ms. Miyazawa had
something urgent come up at home.

776
00:55:14,725 --> 00:55:16,818
You want me to interpret?

777
00:55:17,978 --> 00:55:20,272
Come on, Dad. I can't.

778
00:55:20,272 --> 00:55:23,775
It's been years since I last spoke Japanese.

779
00:55:23,775 --> 00:55:25,444
Why can't you go instead?

780
00:55:25,444 --> 00:55:27,276
You're good at Japanese, too.

781
00:55:27,276 --> 00:55:29,824
Dad's going to Busan for work tomorrow.

782
00:55:30,615 --> 00:55:33,493
I just need you to cover for tomorrow.

783
00:55:33,493 --> 00:55:36,371
I already made plans
with Min Jun tomorrow.

784
00:55:36,371 --> 00:55:38,790
Don't worry. You should go.

785
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:40,842
He needs your help.

786
00:55:42,044 --> 00:55:43,678
Okay?

787
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,550
That's my son-in-law.

788
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:50,385
- Help yourselves.
- Thank you.

789
00:55:50,385 --> 00:55:53,020
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Mom.

790
00:55:57,643 --> 00:55:58,977
I'm sorry.

791
00:55:58,977 --> 00:56:02,064
We'll have to check
on the venues next week.

792
00:56:02,064 --> 00:56:03,482
It's okay. I understand.

793
00:56:03,482 --> 00:56:07,319
I'll look for a few more places
for us to check out next week.

794
00:56:07,319 --> 00:56:08,953
Okay.

795
00:56:14,457 --> 00:56:16,091
Min Jun.

796
00:56:16,787 --> 00:56:18,664
Yes?

797
00:56:18,664 --> 00:56:20,832
Thank you.

798
00:56:20,832 --> 00:56:23,666
Oh, come on.
I told you not to say that.

799
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:25,724
Whenever you say that,

800
00:56:25,724 --> 00:56:28,276
you sound so distant.

801
00:56:29,841 --> 00:56:31,517
Good night.

802
00:56:33,929 --> 00:56:35,813
Go inside. It's cold.

803
00:56:53,281 --> 00:56:55,492
You're a lifesaver, Ms. Choi.

804
00:56:55,492 --> 00:56:58,161
I didn't realize you knew Japanese.

805
00:56:58,161 --> 00:56:59,705
Did you study there?

806
00:56:59,705 --> 00:57:03,758
No, I lived there for a bit when I was little.

807
00:57:04,626 --> 00:57:08,213
I took classes for a year
and got pretty good grades,

808
00:57:08,213 --> 00:57:10,424
but I get nervous when it really matters.

809
00:57:10,424 --> 00:57:12,308
I still get stage fright.

810
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,139
He'll be here soon. Shall we?

811
00:57:17,139 --> 00:57:18,856
Right, of course.

812
00:57:28,608 --> 00:57:31,953
[WELCOME, MR. SASAE HIKARI]

813
00:57:32,779 --> 00:57:34,781
I didn't expect him to be so late.

814
00:57:34,781 --> 00:57:36,541
Where is he?

815
00:57:41,204 --> 00:57:43,047
Yes, Mr. Park.

816
00:57:44,082 --> 00:57:46,501
I'm at the airport.

817
00:57:46,501 --> 00:57:49,303
- Excuse me, Ms. Choi.
- Sure.

818
00:58:52,856 --> 00:58:54,987
<i>Time stood still...</i>

819
00:58:54,987 --> 00:58:58,373
<i>like a neatly folded piece of paper.</i>

820
00:59:02,869 --> 00:59:05,797
<i>If I knew that I was going to meet Jungo...</i>

821
00:59:07,582 --> 00:59:10,009
<i>I would have never come.</i>
