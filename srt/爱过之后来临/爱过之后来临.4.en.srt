1
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,109
Are you all right?

2
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:08,909
Beni?

3
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,950
Don't worry.

4
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,290
I'm fine.

5
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,209
Everything will be okay.

6
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,469
Yun Oh.

7
00:01:36,019 --> 00:01:37,060
Yun Oh.

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,290
(Kobayashi Kanna)

9
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,459
Hello?

10
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,629
Good morning. Did you sleep well?

11
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,010
Yes.

12
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:10,139
I was pretty drunk last night, wasn't I?

13
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,639
Sorry.

14
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,680
It's fine. You don't need to apologize.

15
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,639
You don't sound too well.

16
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,310
Are you okay? I hope you're
not coming down with something.

17
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,020
No, I'm fine.

18
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,780
I just woke up. That's probably why.

19
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,359
We're meeting those Japanese
people who live in Korea...

20
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,449
at 1pm today. You remember, right?

21
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:33,280
It's not far from here,

22
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:36,039
so we can just meet in
the lobby 30 minutes earlier.

23
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,909
Why so early?

24
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,580
Why? Is there something
else you have to do?

25
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,250
I'm sorry,

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,049
but do you think we can cancel on them?

27
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,960
You want to cancel it? Why?

28
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,759
They're all great contacts who
can help you promote your book.

29
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,349
I'm sorry. I want to get some rest today.

30
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,349
All right.

31
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,649
Take it easy today.

32
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,978
The book signing event
tomorrow is more important anyway.

33
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:09,150
I'll let Mr. Lee know.

34
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,990
Thanks. Bye for now.

35
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,490
Bye.

36
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,169
Marry me.

37
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,669
Please...

38
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,300
come back to me now.

39
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:49,069
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:57,949 --> 00:03:59,039
Forget it.

41
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,409
I'll stop.

42
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,289
I'm exhausted too.

43
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,919
Just knowing that you
were going to Korea...

44
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:12,090
put me on edge.

45
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,759
I couldn't sleep at all
for the past few days.

46
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:29,189
Sleep tight.

47
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:52,129
We met again like a miracle.
What does this mean?

48
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,470
What is the meaning of this?

49
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:02,139
Is this a chance to start over?

50
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:03,889
Or...

51
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,269
is this a sign that we need...

52
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:09,729
closure?

53
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,519
(Bundang lake)

54
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:14,610
The last...

55
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:17,240
I really hope that's not what awaits us.

56
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:26,209
(The last... I really hope
that's not what awaits us.)

57
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:36,170
(What Comes After Love)

58
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:40,930
(Min Jun)

59
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,739
(Are you up yet?)

60
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,779
Hong, how's your stomach?

61
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,000
I want to cook you a fresh batch
of soybean sprout soup every day.

62
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,838
- Hi.
- Good morning, sir.

63
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,180
How can I help you?

64
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:24,060
Well, could you call a taxi for me, please?

65
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,600
Sure. Do you want a driver
who speaks Japanese?

66
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:29,519
Yes, thank you.

67
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:37,028
My goodness. Look at this mess.

68
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,818
Mom, do you want a bite?

69
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:40,239
No, I'm good.

70
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,620
You have to clean this all up
before you leave the house, okay?

71
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,659
- Dad.
- Yes.

72
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,000
Your breakfast is ready. I made it.

73
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:52,079
My goodness. What's gotten into you?

74
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,670
Thanks.

75
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,560
- It's good, isn't it?
- What?

76
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,560
Should I open a bakery?

77
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:09,769
A bakery?

78
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,559
You said you wanted to open a studio.

79
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,769
Was it to make scented candles?

80
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,110
A leather craft studio.

81
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,319
Leather?

82
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:19,489
I don't care about scented
candles or leather anymore.

83
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,110
You can't even eat those.

84
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:23,489
I think this is my calling.

85
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,329
I really love seeing people
enjoy the baked goods I make.

86
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,949
- With that said, Dad...
- My goodness.

87
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,828
Go and talk to your sister.

88
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:34,329
I'm a puppet ruler. Your sister
is the one who calls the shots.

89
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,959
Hong.

90
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:39,920
Here, try this.

91
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,220
Oh, boy. Maybe later.

92
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:44,800
My gosh. I'm so hungover.

93
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,430
What? Did you have drinks with Min Jun?

94
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,768
Yes.

95
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:51,680
What? Why didn't you call me?

96
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,519
The three of you went out
for drinks after the fitting?

97
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:55,019
What kind of wedding dress did you pick?

98
00:07:56,689 --> 00:07:57,939
Hi, Mr. Lee.

99
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,860
Mr. Sasae did?

100
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:03,699
I see.

101
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,410
Well, all right. It's the weekend anyway.

102
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,199
We should let him rest up.

103
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:14,459
Yes. You should check
in on him, just in case.

104
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,129
All right.

105
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,879
What was that? What's going on?

106
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:24,379
Oh, the visiting author from
Japan isn't feeling too great...

107
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:27,009
and cancelled everything
on his schedule for the day.

108
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,100
You mean, Sasae Hikari?

109
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,269
Hong, shouldn't you go
and check in on him too?

110
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,769
Me? Why should I?

111
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,899
I'm sure Mr. Lee will take care of him.

112
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,149
Wait, Hong.

113
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,820
Can I borrow your guitar?
You know, your old guitar.

114
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,570
My guitar? Why do you need it?

115
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,239
I want to use it as a prop
when I take pictures...

116
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,409
of my baked goods for social media.

117
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,950
It's in the storage room.

118
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,159
I know that.

119
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,169
But you said I was
never allowed to touch it.

120
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:06,090
So, he actually sent your
stuff like you told him to.

121
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:08,850
Your boyfriend is really something.

122
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,639
Ex-boyfriend.

123
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:13,889
Right, your ex-boyfriend.

124
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:18,940
So, this means it
really is over now, right?

125
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,658
Hey, come on. It's okay!

126
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:28,990
Just forget him.

127
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,580
By the way, where's my
gift you brought from Japan?

128
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,539
- Is it in here?
- Don't open it!

129
00:09:40,169 --> 00:09:41,250
Why not?

130
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:44,340
Just because.

131
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,429
Don't open it.

132
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:51,549
It took me some time to realize...

133
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,558
that what I was trying
to forget wasn't him.

134
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:58,480
It was myself when I was in love with him.

135
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:02,360
So just like that, I sealed everything...

136
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,070
related to him.

137
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:18,000
Here.

138
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,789
Thanks. I'll put it back as soon
as I'm done taking some pictures.

139
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,240
Excuse me, sir.

140
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,450
Yes?

141
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,038
I've never been there before,

142
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:03,039
but this lake you mentioned...

143
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,129
I think it's pretty big.

144
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:08,049
I see.

145
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:13,549
I'd like to be dropped off at a
spot where I can see the lake trail.

146
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,929
Sorry for being difficult.

147
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:20,809
Don't worry about it. It's my job
to take you where you need to be.

148
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,419
Aren't you over-trimming them?

149
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:46,250
Have some mercy, Mom.

150
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:49,629
This has to be done if we want
to see flowers again next year.

151
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:51,629
I bet you had no idea.

152
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,759
Do you think it's easy
to care for living things?

153
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,429
I know it's hard.

154
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:57,808
Whether it's a plant or a child.

155
00:11:57,809 --> 00:11:59,678
Goodness. Do you even know?

156
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,269
Hong, can you pull it toward you?

157
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:02,440
Sure.

158
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,809
- Hey, don't drag it. Lift it.
- Oh, okay.

159
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,480
Good?

160
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,070
Yes, it's good. All right.

161
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,240
Oh, right. Have you guys decided
on your wedding venue yet?

162
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:17,279
Min Jun said he'd do more research.

163
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,829
It's not like buying a
home. Don't be so picky.

164
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,869
If there's a good venue,
just go ahead and book it.

165
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,419
Min Jun is busy too.

166
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:25,919
Okay.

167
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,750
What's with that look on your face?

168
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,758
What?

169
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:32,419
Did you get into a fight with Min Jun?

170
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:34,299
No.

171
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,009
It's chilly. We should go inside.

172
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,149
What's gotten into you?

173
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,190
I used to hug you like this
all the time when I was little.

174
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,779
That's true. Back when
you always listened to me.

175
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,700
You were so adorable back then.

176
00:12:58,409 --> 00:12:59,529
Now, I'm not?

177
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,120
No, I can't stand you.

178
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,659
That's why I'm hoping Min Jun
takes you as soon as possible.

179
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,289
Are you that fond of Min Jun?

180
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,339
Yes, I am very fond of him.

181
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,749
I've known him since he was little.

182
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,299
He was such a good boy and still is.

183
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,340
It really isn't easy to
meet a man like that.

184
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,350
I know that Min Jun is a great person too.

185
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:23,850
Hong.

186
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,399
Marriage isn't something
you do with the love of your life.

187
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:30,769
You should marry a good person.

188
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:40,409
The kind of marriage Jungo
and I used to talk about...

189
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,490
certainly wasn't the kind
of marriage Mom described.

190
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,909
So to speak, it was...

191
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:48,870
I wouldn't really call it marriage.

192
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:52,129
It was me wanting to be with him forever.

193
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:56,969
It was like another name for
wanting to stay in love forever.

194
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,009
(Ichiro Ramen)

195
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:02,719
Everyone is working so hard.

196
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,138
- Hey! There you are.
- Hi!

197
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:06,138
- Hello.
- Hi, Nozomi!

198
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:07,600
(To Choi Hong)

199
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:11,519
What is this?

200
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,149
A wedding invitation.

201
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,940
Oh, my gosh! Boss!

202
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,779
I don't believe this. You're lying, right?

203
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:21,909
This is a miracle!

204
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,409
After the tenth proposal,

205
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:30,210
Nozomi finally said yes!

206
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:34,000
All right, guys. First...

207
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,668
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

208
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:38,049
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

209
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,059
- This is good.
- Nice.

210
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,979
- Stop it.
- Tell us!

211
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,440
Never. Just forget it.

212
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,980
Hey, what's the matter? What is it?

213
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,859
Nothing. I was just...

214
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,950
What is it? Are you that
sad that I'm getting married?

215
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,409
I'm sorry, but I can't
reciprocate your feelings.

216
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,870
You should've told him sooner.

217
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,659
Then I could've run away from him.

218
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:11,500
Too bad.

219
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,330
No, it's not that.

220
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,460
You know, I...

221
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,379
I had no friends or family in Japan,

222
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,589
so I was always lonely.

223
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,679
But...

224
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:30,389
you're inviting me to your wedding,

225
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,769
and you treat me like your family, so...

226
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,519
Then...

227
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:38,820
how about we raise our glasses
for Hong, who is now officially...

228
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,240
a member of the family?

229
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,360
- Yes.
- Let's do it.

230
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,409
Cheers.

231
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,158
What?

232
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:49,749
Yes, Hong taught me.

233
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,580
It's what Koreans say
when they clink glasses.

234
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,460
- Really?
- Yes.

235
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,590
All right. Cheers!

236
00:15:57,549 --> 00:16:00,169
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

237
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,049
(To Choi Hong)

238
00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:08,470
What is this?

239
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,269
A wedding invitation.

240
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,230
The manager is getting married, at last.

241
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,309
Seriously?

242
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,190
He wants you to be there too.

243
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,398
- Me too?
- Yes.

244
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,610
And he wants to know if
there's anything we can't eat.

245
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,490
Isn't that so considerate?

246
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,240
In Korea, we don't ask that kind of thing.

247
00:16:34,169 --> 00:16:35,370
You'll come, won't you?

248
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:40,379
I'll think about it.

249
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,719
What for? Come with me.

250
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,129
Let's go.

251
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:48,429
Why can't you come?
Because you have to work?

252
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:51,429
There's that too, but...

253
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:53,059
Don't worry.

254
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:55,559
I prepared the gift.

255
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,230
A gift?

256
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:58,899
I thought of something.

257
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,110
Look forward to it.

258
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,950
What are Japanese weddings like?

259
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,700
I've never been to one overseas.

260
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,490
I don't know.

261
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,960
It must be similar to a Korean one.

262
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,920
It's totally different
from a Korean wedding.

263
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,549
It's completely different.

264
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:24,970
Right?

265
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:28,720
Jungo won't tell me in
detail, and it's frustrating.

266
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,219
He doesn't want to put pressure on you.

267
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,098
Pressure? Why would I feel that?

268
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:34,390
Don't even ask.

269
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,268
I was so flustered when my
cousin got married in Japan.

270
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:41,269
For starters, the monetary
gift is a minimum of 300 dollars.

271
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,149
For real? That's a lot of money.

272
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,859
So they only invite family
and those who are really close.

273
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,239
If you agree to attend,

274
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,409
you can't just wire the money
and congratulate them from afar.

275
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,619
You must show up.

276
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:55,959
It's really rude not to.

277
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,119
I see...

278
00:17:57,289 --> 00:17:58,869
Hey, you should take notes.

279
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:02,289
You must buy a special
envelope. A pretty one.

280
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,210
- There's a special envelope?
- Yes.

281
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,130
It's not like a Korean wedding at all.

282
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,720
You're right.

283
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,390
Hey. Did you book a hair salon?

284
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,720
A hair salon? What for?

285
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,890
The other guests will go all out.

286
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:17,598
They get their hair done...

287
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:19,348
and wear dazzling dresses and stuff.

288
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:20,809
Men wear full-on suits.

289
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:22,359
What will you wear?

290
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:24,150
Me?

291
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,529
What should I do with you?

292
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,490
You have nothing to wear.

293
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:51,680
Ji Hee told me...

294
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:52,970
Okay.

295
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,430
She said I should watch what
I wear to a Japanese wedding.

296
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,849
That's true.

297
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,940
What kind of wedding do you like?

298
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,650
I'd like...

299
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:12,359
a small wedding.

300
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,450
Like in the movie "About Time."

301
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,579
Then it must rain during the ceremony.

302
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,880
You bet it should. And
umbrellas should get flipped.

303
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,420
The highlight of that wedding
was the sudden shower.

304
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,470
We should invite Ji Hee
and my diner colleagues.

305
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,220
For the live music,

306
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,809
I'd like to hire your father's band.

307
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:40,099
I bet he'd gladly accept the offer.

308
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:44,359
But...

309
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:46,569
if I were to get married here,

310
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:49,069
I don't think my mom would come.

311
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,529
She still doesn't take your calls?

312
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:58,579
Don't worry. She'll come around one day.

313
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,230
It's so pretty.

314
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,569
Yun Oh?

315
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,909
- Welcome.
- Hello.

316
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,039
Hello.

317
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,579
Could she try on that dress?

318
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,210
No, Yun Oh. It's fine.

319
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:52,799
She can.

320
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:57,509
A staff member will take your
size before helping you out.

321
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,349
Will you come this way?

322
00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:05,940
See you later.

323
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:20,779
Are you ready?

324
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:22,618
What for?

325
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:25,579
You know the first reaction
is most important, right?

326
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,960
- I do.
- Then look over there.

327
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,140
You look...

328
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:27,059
amazing.

329
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,690
I just love the groom's reaction.

330
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,319
The best one...

331
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,529
is one that comes from
the bottom of your heart.

332
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:52,788
(Do Not Trespass)

333
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:54,039
- Hey.
- Hi.

334
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:55,839
Here you go.

335
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:57,970
You saved my life. I'll
be sure to keep it clean.

336
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,509
Do you have a job interview?

337
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,349
No. Hong got a sudden invite
to an acquaintance's wedding.

338
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,808
Is Hong doing okay?

339
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:06,098
Yes, she's good.

340
00:23:06,099 --> 00:23:08,679
I heard our senior Sato...

341
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,098
is urgently looking for a part-time worker.

342
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:12,399
Will you meet him if you're interested?

343
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,019
You'd been hoping to find
work at a publishing company.

344
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,900
Senior Sato's company?

345
00:23:19,109 --> 00:23:20,609
Yes, I'd like that.

346
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:23,569
Then drop by tomorrow.
He seemed really rushed.

347
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,288
Do you have his number?

348
00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:28,499
- Yes, thanks. I'll call.
- Okay.

349
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,079
- See you. Thanks.
- Bye.

350
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:40,630
(Seibunsha)

351
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,219
Where's that thing, Yoshino?

352
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,890
Up on the top right.

353
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:49,430
Hey, Aoki.

354
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,319
Thanks for giving me a chance.

355
00:23:58,569 --> 00:23:59,989
Are you working on your novel?

356
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,819
No, not yet.

357
00:24:02,069 --> 00:24:03,989
Out of everyone in your year,

358
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:06,779
I thought you were the most promising.

359
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,539
Thank you.

360
00:24:08,869 --> 00:24:12,410
I guess I can put off
the lecturing for now.

361
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,539
Can you start today?

362
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,880
Two people quit out of the blue.

363
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,960
- It's an emergency.
- That's right, yes.

364
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,259
I must start today?

365
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:22,839
You don't want to?

366
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,720
No, it's not that, but...

367
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,098
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

368
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:33,440
Your seat's that way.

369
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,358
Congratulations.

370
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:40,230
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

371
00:24:41,109 --> 00:24:43,240
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

372
00:24:43,819 --> 00:24:44,910
Congratulations.

373
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:49,118
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

374
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,829
- Thank you.
- Please take a seat.

375
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,619
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

376
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,869
Thank you.

377
00:25:03,049 --> 00:25:05,049
(Aoki Jungo)

378
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,549
(Choi Hong)

379
00:25:23,069 --> 00:25:24,359
(Choi Hong)

380
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,739
Hong! Hello.

381
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,529
- Hello.
- You made it.

382
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,740
Where's Jungo? He's not with you?

383
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:36,289
He had a sudden job interview.
He'll come by when he's done.

384
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:39,379
Are you well-prepared
for today's special stage?

385
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,089
I'm not well-prepared at all.

386
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:45,089
I've never sung at a wedding,
and I'm dead nervous.

387
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:47,838
Don't worry.

388
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:51,098
If you do as well as the rehearsal
yesterday, everyone will faint.

389
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:52,719
- That's right.
- You'll be fine.

390
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,598
- I'm not fine.
- You'll be fine.

391
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:57,140
- Just relax.
- Yes.

392
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,769
Ladies and gentlemen.

393
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,439
Thank you for attending the wedding...

394
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:07,279
of Nitta Ichiro and Kato Nozomi
despite your busy schedules.

395
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,240
The bride and groom will join us now.

396
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:13,868
When they come into view,

397
00:26:13,869 --> 00:26:16,250
please welcome them with
a warm round of applause.

398
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:21,289
Will you please turn to look
at the entrance at the back?

399
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:23,920
Here come the bride and groom!

400
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,509
You look awesome, boss!

401
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,640
You look way too tense!

402
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:43,150
This needs to be copy-edited by 7pm.

403
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:45,319
- Okay.
- Thanks.

404
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,130
(3 missed calls: Beni)

405
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,549
It's time to reveal the special event...

406
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:19,019
we planned in secret for the new couple.

407
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:21,899
We were going to invite TWICE...

408
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,149
whom our boss loves just a
bit more than his new wife...

409
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,859
What are you saying?

410
00:27:27,569 --> 00:27:29,358
That reaction tells me I was right.

411
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:30,400
What?

412
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,619
That's enough joking for now.

413
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,279
Let me introduce Ichiro Ramen's...

414
00:27:36,619 --> 00:27:38,868
very own K-pop star, Choi Hong.

415
00:27:38,869 --> 00:27:41,119
Give her a round of applause.

416
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,759
Ichiro and Nozomi.
Congratulations on your big day.

417
00:27:49,089 --> 00:27:53,339
Even if I don't sing too well,
please be kind and understanding.

418
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:19,740
How long will I love you?

419
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,079
As long as stars are above you

420
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,880
And longer, if I can

421
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:34,799
How long will I need you?

422
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:39,349
As long as the seasons need to

423
00:28:42,269 --> 00:28:44,269
Follow their plan

424
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:50,190
How long will I be with you?

425
00:28:51,609 --> 00:28:54,778
As long as the sea is bound to

426
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:55,950
You startled me

427
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:59,950
- Were you taking photos?
- Yes.

428
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:05,329
How long will I want you?

429
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,789
Yun Oh!

430
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:16,009
And longer by far

431
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,559
How long will I hold you?

432
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:25,099
As long as your father told you

433
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,940
As long as you can

434
00:29:33,529 --> 00:29:35,900
How long will I give to you?

435
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:40,029
As long as I live through you

436
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:45,289
However long you say

437
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:51,089
How long will I love you?

438
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,630
As long as stars are above you

439
00:29:58,259 --> 00:30:00,890
And longer, if I may

440
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:19,299
Beni.

441
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,549
Are you angry?

442
00:31:25,849 --> 00:31:27,849
The publishing house I interviewed at...

443
00:31:28,309 --> 00:31:31,230
asked me to start right away.

444
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,980
I see.

445
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,650
Today of all days?

446
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,200
It was a place I'd
always wanted to work at.

447
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:42,529
I had no choice.

448
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,250
What's this?

449
00:32:00,589 --> 00:32:02,339
Your thank-you gift.

450
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:07,349
I'm tired. I'm going to bed first.

451
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,140
This isn't right.

452
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,690
What?

453
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,609
I mean,

454
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:21,240
I didn't even send them any money.

455
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,069
It's impolite to accept a gift from them.

456
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,619
You care about manners that much,
and you miss the event on the day?

457
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:29,538
That's not what happened.

458
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:31,660
You said you'd try to come on time.

459
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:35,579
I said I'd try. I didn't say I
could definitely be there.

460
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,289
You should've said from the
start that you didn't want to go.

461
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,839
- What?
- If that were the case,

462
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,470
you shouldn't have said anything.

463
00:32:51,309 --> 00:32:52,390
Beni.

464
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,809
Don't follow me.

465
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:20,250
It didn't take me long to realize...

466
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,589
that no love stays the same.

467
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,000
Here you go, Min Jun.

468
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,709
Here's a forehand.

469
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:32,089
Keep your eye on the
ball and move slowly. Yes.

470
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,420
Here's a backhand!

471
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,550
Are you okay?

472
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,059
Du Yeol.

473
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,599
Let's wrap it up today. Do more,

474
00:37:45,019 --> 00:37:46,599
and I'll throw up.

475
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:54,150
You must be looking for a matrimonial home.

476
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,320
Not yet. Hong's quite busy.

477
00:37:57,909 --> 00:37:59,159
How's Hong these days?

478
00:37:59,869 --> 00:38:00,948
Why do you ask?

479
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:03,239
Well, I remember my wife...

480
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:05,539
becoming very cranky before our wedding.

481
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,079
She told me a while later that...

482
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:11,420
getting married suddenly
made everything scary.

483
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,178
Your wife is the bravest woman on earth.

484
00:38:17,179 --> 00:38:18,299
But for her to get scared?

485
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,639
I know, right?

486
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:22,599
It made me anxious until
the day before our wedding.

487
00:38:23,059 --> 00:38:26,018
Anyway, don't put your guard down...

488
00:38:26,019 --> 00:38:27,559
until you enter the wedding hall.

489
00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:40,819
Hong. You didn't forget our
plans for tomorrow, did you?

490
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,699
Get a good sleep. I'll see you tomorrow.

491
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,619
(Okay.)

492
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,719
Beongae.

493
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,590
You know it too, right?

494
00:39:02,469 --> 00:39:04,559
That I suck at remembering things.

495
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:13,110
But why can't I forget the memories...

496
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,980
with Jungo?

497
00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:26,789
What do you think, Beongae?

498
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:28,788
What are you doing?

499
00:39:28,789 --> 00:39:30,869
It's cold. Stop acting silly outside.

500
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,289
Whatever. What is it?

501
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,590
Here.

502
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,260
What's this?

503
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:41,510
It was inside your guitar case.

504
00:39:42,429 --> 00:39:44,510
You must have a lot on your mind,

505
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,639
so I wasn't sure about giving it to you.

506
00:39:47,139 --> 00:39:49,230
But I couldn't ignore it.

507
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,150
Forget it.

508
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:54,980
Aren't you going to read it?

509
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,280
Really?

510
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,869
Already? Got it.

511
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,619
We'll get there a bit earlier.

512
00:40:10,829 --> 00:40:11,829
Okay.

513
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,500
It's a success!

514
00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:16,249
There's already a line from
the door to the side of the street.

515
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,340
Seriously?

516
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,459
But there are four hours
until the book signing.

517
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,380
- This is great.
- I know.

518
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,050
Oh, right.

519
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:29,139
Ms. Choi.

520
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:31,679
Today is Mr. Sasae's birthday.

521
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:34,309
Is that so?

522
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:36,769
What should we prepare as his gift?

523
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,980
Sorry?

524
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,400
Why are you asking me that?

525
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,779
Mr. Lee told me you
studied abroad in Japan.

526
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:49,159
Mr. Yoon. How are studying
abroad and the birthday gift related?

527
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:53,329
I'll think of something myself.

528
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,769
Come inside.

529
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:17,610
Gosh, I'm full.

530
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,030
From now on, my favourite dish is bulgogi.

531
00:41:22,989 --> 00:41:27,320
I enjoyed today's meal more
because it was on you, Beni.

532
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,449
Dad. You ate three portions alone.

533
00:41:32,909 --> 00:41:35,788
And Beni treated you with
her hard-earned money.

534
00:41:35,789 --> 00:41:38,038
Come on. This much won't hurt.

535
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:40,590
She's right. And I couldn't
stop. It was just too good.

536
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,969
Father. I'll treat you again
on your next birthday.

537
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,260
Really?

538
00:41:46,929 --> 00:41:48,929
I'm in total bliss.

539
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:50,599
Thank you, Beni.

540
00:41:51,139 --> 00:41:53,099
I should be the one thanking you.

541
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:56,849
You were the reason Jungo and I could meet.

542
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,130
Is this lady your grandmother, Yun Oh?

543
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,880
Yes.

544
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:29,969
Jungo's grandmother raised
Jungo when he was little.

545
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:32,179
His mom left us.

546
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,940
(Jungo's 11th birthday)

547
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:48,699
This cake is unusual.

548
00:42:49,449 --> 00:42:51,239
Don't kids normally eat...

549
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:55,039
birthday cakes with fruits or
cartoon characters on them?

550
00:42:57,329 --> 00:43:00,119
My grandmother especially liked Mont Blanc.

551
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:02,629
Mont Blanc...

552
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:06,050
is a cake that resembles
the snow-covered Alps.

553
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,339
"The Alps?" You mean the mountain?

554
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,380
Yes.

555
00:43:10,969 --> 00:43:14,349
My grandmother's dream
was to climb up the Alps.

556
00:43:15,309 --> 00:43:17,219
But due to her legs that
were weak since childhood,

557
00:43:17,429 --> 00:43:21,190
watching documentaries about
climbing mountains became her hobby.

558
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,769
That was why she always bought Mont Blanc.

559
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:35,619
- Jungo.
- What?

560
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:40,919
This one.

561
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,420
It's 52 dollars?

562
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,289
(Mont Blanc Size 5, 52 dollars)

563
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,800
Beni.

564
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:50,050
I'm really full from the bulgogi earlier.

565
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:53,300
I don't have room for a
cake. Let's eat it next time.

566
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,599
Excuse me. Can we just buy a piece?

567
00:43:58,889 --> 00:44:00,558
I'm afraid...

568
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:02,849
we don't sell Mont Blanc in pieces.

569
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:05,269
The shape breaks down when cut through.

570
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,690
Is that so?

571
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:11,610
Then shall we buy a different dessert?

572
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:17,948
Beni. I'm stuffed.

573
00:44:17,949 --> 00:44:20,408
I'm full.

574
00:44:20,409 --> 00:44:21,579
- "I'm full?"
- Yes.

575
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:22,710
- Really?
- Yes.

576
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,500
Let's come here next time.

577
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,800
I was going to treat you for the whole day.

578
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,509
Sorry. We'll come again another day.

579
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:33,800
We'll be waiting.

580
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:45,269
Today was really fun.

581
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:48,360
I'm glad I got to hear your stories.

582
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,989
- My stories?
- Yes.

583
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:56,489
You rarely express yourself with words.

584
00:44:58,659 --> 00:45:00,039
Is that so?

585
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,250
What's this? You know that too, don't you?

586
00:45:06,289 --> 00:45:10,550
Of course, you can't
express everything with words.

587
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,800
But there are things I won't
know unless you verbalize.

588
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:17,679
That's true.

589
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:22,019
But I'm simply...

590
00:45:22,849 --> 00:45:25,019
bad at using words.

591
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,809
Even without words,

592
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:30,230
my sincerity...

593
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:33,320
will naturally be conveyed.

594
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:36,280
But...

595
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,119
I still want you to tell me.

596
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:42,699
Even if I know how you feel,

597
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:46,079
there are things I want to hear in person.

598
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,960
Like what?

599
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:53,170
Something like, "I love you."

600
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,599
That's hard.

601
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:02,679
What?

602
00:46:04,059 --> 00:46:07,900
Instead, I'll definitely write...

603
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:10,980
a novel about my feelings
toward you one day.

604
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:13,150
For real?

605
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,650
Yes. I promise.

606
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:21,239
I want to read it as soon as possible.

607
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,050
"One star of memories."

608
00:46:38,969 --> 00:46:40,639
"Another star of love."

609
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:44,469
"Another star of loneliness."

610
00:46:45,429 --> 00:46:47,429
"Another star of admiration."

611
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:51,769
- "Another star of poetry."
- "Another star of poetry."

612
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,440
When did you memorize it?

613
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:59,320
Whenever you recited it,

614
00:46:59,909 --> 00:47:03,329
I came to like this part for some reason.

615
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:10,670
"Another star of poetry."

616
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:12,960
Did you know?

617
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,209
What?

618
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:17,170
We're all a part of a star.

619
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:21,139
When a star exploded, Earth was created,

620
00:47:21,389 --> 00:47:23,800
and we were born.

621
00:47:24,809 --> 00:47:27,929
Even if our race and
nationality are different,

622
00:47:28,349 --> 00:47:29,809
we're fragments...

623
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,769
of the same star in the end.

624
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:38,320
That's interesting.

625
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:39,699
Right?

626
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:40,860
Yes.

627
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:44,489
We...

628
00:47:45,449 --> 00:47:47,579
have become Inokashira's star.

629
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:50,250
"Inokashira's star?"

630
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,539
That's right.

631
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:00,920
On your next birthday, I'll buy you...

632
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:03,590
a Mont Blanc in your grandmother's stead.

633
00:48:07,179 --> 00:48:08,639
Thank you.

634
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,570
We only talked about the bright future.

635
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:20,360
The problems we avoided facing,

636
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:22,400
the uncertainty of it...

637
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,780
or the trickery,

638
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:30,119
eventually piled up like
snow and hit the two of us.

639
00:48:31,539 --> 00:48:34,500
But at the height of our happiness,

640
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,000
we were unaware of reality's horror.

641
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:39,710
Back then, we were nothing...

642
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,090
but Gemini shining brightly...

643
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,510
without a flaw.

"Having the same experience
as the female character,"

"I related to her while
reading your novel."

overcoming the differences..."

651

652
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:12,789
"was not easy."

overcome them, Mr. Sasae?"

655
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,250
This is amazing.

656
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,380
I'm really glad.

657
00:49:29,139 --> 00:49:30,760
Honestly,

658
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:35,268
I didn't write this novel
with the intent to tell...

659
00:49:35,269 --> 00:49:37,190
a grand story.

660
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:44,190
Honestly, this novel wasn't
written to tell a grand story.

661
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,320
I wrote this novel...

662
00:49:48,409 --> 00:49:51,030
simply because of my
regret toward one person...

663
00:49:52,039 --> 00:49:54,159
and the memories I couldn't forget.

664
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:57,460
My true feelings were written down.

665
00:49:58,789 --> 00:49:59,879
It was...

666
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,210
with the faint hope that...

667
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:06,969
if that person read my book,

668
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:11,389
they would understand my foolishness...

669
00:50:12,219 --> 00:50:16,230
and immaturity back then.

670
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:18,940
I see.

671
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:22,979
Because your genuine
feelings were in the novel,

672
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:26,570
many readers were able to relate to it.

673
00:50:26,989 --> 00:50:28,948
It's a shame, but we must wrap up...
