00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:19,778
What kind of a person am I to you, Jungo?

2
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,843
What kind of a person?

3
00:00:22,843 --> 00:00:24,409
Yeah.

4
00:00:24,409 --> 00:00:27,120
I just got curious about how you saw me as a person.

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,539
I just got curious about how you saw me as a person.

6
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:31,990
That's all.

7
00:00:34,419 --> 00:00:36,963
I'm not sure.

8
00:00:36,963 --> 00:00:40,357
The Kanna I know...

9
00:00:41,618 --> 00:00:44,929
has always been confident

10
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:47,390
and always honest about how she feels.

11
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,977
and always honest about how she feels.

12
00:00:50,977 --> 00:00:52,645
I see.

13
00:00:52,645 --> 00:00:54,763
Why do you ask?

14
00:00:55,857 --> 00:00:58,526
I don't know when it started,

15
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:00,945
but whenever I'm with you,

16
00:01:00,945 --> 00:01:04,607
I feel different from my usual self.

17
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:08,870
That's why I decided to turn back.

18
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,430
That's why I decided to turn back.

19
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,751
I'll become myself again,

20
00:01:14,751 --> 00:01:16,919
back to being confident and honest like the Kanna that you once knew.

21
00:01:16,919 --> 00:01:20,029
back to being confident and honest like the Kanna that you once knew.

22
00:01:23,843 --> 00:01:25,219
I know now that love is something I can't control.

23
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:28,431
I know now that love is something I can't control.

24
00:01:28,431 --> 00:01:31,021
I was too late to realize that.

25
00:01:39,525 --> 00:01:41,444
What do you think?

26
00:01:41,444 --> 00:01:43,579
Isn't that good news for you, too?

27
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,899
That's such a Kanna thing to say.

28
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,941
Come on. I know how it must've been.

29
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:53,663
It couldn't have been comfortable
to work with me.

30
00:01:57,794 --> 00:02:00,453
- Just a little.
- Really?

31
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:31,285
Kanna?

32
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:33,086
What's wrong?

33
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:44,840
I guess she also knew...

34
00:02:46,342 --> 00:02:48,511
that it was your birthday today.

35
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:50,554
Who are you talking about?

36
00:02:52,181 --> 00:02:55,383
That one that you can't get over.

37
00:02:58,588 --> 00:03:00,522
She was...

38
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:04,359
just here.

39
00:03:06,321 --> 00:03:07,955
What?

40
00:03:09,991 --> 00:03:12,994
She was standing by the entrance but saw me and took off.

41
00:03:12,994 --> 00:03:15,737
She was standing by the entrance but saw me and took off.

<i>I wanted to say that we should let go of our regrets.</i>

<i>"Not getting what you want</i>

53
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:58,366

00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,045
<i>I couldn't understand her one bit.</i>

66
00:06:50,045 --> 00:06:51,354

67
00:06:51,354 --> 00:06:53,857
<i>I thought she was only thinking about herself.</i>

68
00:06:53,857 --> 00:06:55,801

Why do I always have to wait?

00:07:04,326 --> 00:07:06,437
This isn't easy for me, either!

74
00:07:06,437 --> 00:07:08,539
Do you think I like living like this?

75
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:10,124
We see each other at home, anyway.

76
00:07:10,124 --> 00:07:13,467

<i>I wonder who came up with the word for regret?</i>

81
00:07:42,948 --> 00:07:46,292
<i>Why did God create us to feel like this...</i>

90
00:08:51,767 --> 00:08:55,661
I don't know. What can I do?

91
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,842
Jungo.

92
00:09:04,071 --> 00:09:06,781
You may be a man of a few words,

93
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:08,200
but with her,

94
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,769
you need to tell her exactly how you feel.

95
00:09:12,746 --> 00:09:14,004
Look her in the eyes,

96
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:17,376
don't hold back,
and be honest about your feelings.

97
00:09:17,376 --> 00:09:20,295
She'll see that you're being genuine then.

98
00:09:20,295 --> 00:09:22,822
I'm sure that she will.

99
00:09:23,674 --> 00:09:26,442
If you just talk to her...

100
00:09:27,995 --> 00:09:30,713
it'll clear up any wrong ideas.

101
00:09:37,046 --> 00:09:39,272
Go and be happy.

102
00:09:40,616 --> 00:09:44,819

104
00:09:52,745 --> 00:09:55,180
I better get going.

105
00:09:58,233 --> 00:09:59,543
I'll walk you to the lobby.

106
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:02,029
No, I'll be fine on my own.

107
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:03,489

00:10:31,283 --> 00:10:33,327
- Ms. Choi.
- Yes?

113
00:10:33,327 --> 00:10:36,246
Today's interview will be
Mr. Sasae's last item on the agenda.

114
00:10:36,246 --> 00:10:38,381
Will you be there?

115
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:42,753
I can't. I have something else
to take care of later.

116
00:10:42,753 --> 00:10:45,489
- I'm sure you'll be fine without me.
- Yes, ma'am.

117
00:10:45,489 --> 00:10:49,885
Mr. Sasae said he'd be fine by himself
to get to the airport tomorrow.

118
00:10:49,885 --> 00:10:52,470
I don't think we'd need to accompany him.

119
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,888
Would that be okay?

120
00:10:53,888 --> 00:10:56,684
Sure. I'll let Mr. Choi know.

121
00:10:56,684 --> 00:10:58,769
Thank you.

122
00:11:26,739 --> 00:11:29,035
Has Jungo left?

123
00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:32,301
No.

124
00:11:32,301 --> 00:11:34,024
When is he leaving?

125
00:11:34,024 --> 00:11:35,555
Tomorrow.

126
00:11:35,555 --> 00:11:36,824
Are you okay?

127
00:11:36,824 --> 00:11:37,944
Yeah.

128
00:11:37,944 --> 00:11:40,101
Are you sure?

129
00:11:40,101 --> 00:11:42,729
Why? Would it be better if I wasn't?

130
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:46,024
Of course not. That's not what I meant.

131
00:11:46,024 --> 00:11:48,277
Look, Ji Hui.

132
00:11:48,277 --> 00:11:51,404
- This was my favorite paragraph.
- What?

133
00:11:51,404 --> 00:11:54,032
"Just let yourself go
and let the moment take over.

134
00:11:54,032 --> 00:11:56,368
Then, look back on yourself,

135
00:11:56,368 --> 00:11:59,120
almost as if you were a spectator.

136
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,500
Once the river in your heart settles
and grows quiet,

137
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,879
keep watching until you figure out
where it wants to flow.

138
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:10,673
That might be the most honest approach

139
00:12:10,673 --> 00:12:13,819
we can have toward our lives."

140
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,138
I couldn't agree more.

141
00:12:16,138 --> 00:12:18,348
I'm glad.

142
00:12:18,348 --> 00:12:19,767
As soon as I read it,

143
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:24,646
it felt like you saw right through me
for the very first time.

144
00:12:24,646 --> 00:12:26,982
I actually wrote that
while thinking about you

145
00:12:26,982 --> 00:12:29,458
after we met two days ago.

146
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:35,099
Right. I should've known.

147
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,912
Today's interview will start at two o'clock,

148
00:12:39,912 --> 00:12:43,682
and it will be held at a book cafÃ©
near the office.

149
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:50,368
In that case, could we make a quick stop at the office?

150
00:12:50,368 --> 00:12:53,658
Sure. It's pretty close by, so it should be fine.

151
00:12:53,658 --> 00:12:55,360
Let's make a quick stop.

152
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,278
It should be fine since it's close by.

153
00:12:59,807 --> 00:13:01,725
Sir, can we stop by the office first?

154
00:13:01,725 --> 00:13:04,202
Yes, of course.

155
00:13:06,755 --> 00:13:09,942
The book signing went without a hitch,
thanks to everyone.

156
00:13:09,942 --> 00:13:12,652
It was such a wonderful experience.

157
00:13:12,652 --> 00:13:15,197
"The book signing went without a hitch,

158
00:13:15,197 --> 00:13:17,950

159
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,993
I hope to work with you again soon.

160
00:13:19,993 --> 00:13:22,278
Thank you.

161
00:13:29,086 --> 00:13:34,097
Ms. Choi had a meeting to get to today, so she's currently out of the office.

162
00:13:34,097 --> 00:13:36,927
Oh, I see.

163
00:13:36,927 --> 00:13:38,929
It's snowing.

164
00:13:38,929 --> 00:13:40,997
Look, it's snowing.

165
00:14:25,893 --> 00:14:27,710
Mr. Sasae.

166
00:14:28,353 --> 00:14:31,714
Shall we head over to the interview now?

167
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:34,175
Yes, of course.

168
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,659
<i>[WHAT COMES AFTER LOVE]</i>

169
00:16:00,965 --> 00:16:03,759
It's a shame, but we've come
to the last question already.

What do you believe comes after love?

173
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:15,105
Regret, loneliness, and other emotions
certainly come to mind,

174
00:16:15,105 --> 00:16:19,150
but it felt like the title
had a special meaning to you.

175
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,779
"What do you believe comes after love?

176
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:28,520
It felt like the title had a special meaning to you."

177
00:16:30,912 --> 00:16:32,997
For the past five years,

178
00:16:32,997 --> 00:16:36,809
I've thought about a lot of things
while writing this novel.

179
00:16:37,669 --> 00:16:40,671
What do I believe comes after love?

00:16:41,548 --> 00:16:43,950
I believe

181
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:49,128
we can gain an understanding of what love is.

182
00:16:49,128 --> 00:16:51,249
It feels very ironic.

183
00:16:51,249 --> 00:16:53,960
"It feels very ironic."

184
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,521
Yes, you're right.

185
00:16:56,521 --> 00:16:59,632
It's such a sad irony.

186
00:17:00,483 --> 00:17:04,696
Only after love

187
00:17:04,696 --> 00:17:07,748
do we realize what it truly means.

188
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:13,093
That's why I believe we're always filled with regret.

189
00:17:13,093 --> 00:17:17,298
Maybe that's why the deeper our love is,

190
00:17:17,298 --> 00:17:20,477
the bigger our regret becomes.

191
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:37,977
I don't think we can express
all our feelings by just speaking.

192
00:17:37,977 --> 00:17:42,289
And those feelings are what you're trying to write, isn't it?

193
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:48,819
There's something special about the way you write.

194
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:50,975
And that's why I like it.

195
00:17:55,914 --> 00:17:59,282

197
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,267
<i>the only thing I could do was write.</i>

198
00:18:57,267 --> 00:19:00,854
<i>To understand how she felt</i>

199
00:19:00,854 --> 00:19:06,805

taken seriously at that time.

340
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,269

00:38:24,017 --> 00:38:25,435
There you go.

367
00:38:25,435 --> 00:38:27,361
Thank you.

368
00:38:35,153 --> 00:38:36,488
How's your father?

369
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:38,990
- Is he well?
- Yes.

370
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:40,832
He's doing very well.

371
00:38:41,534 --> 00:38:43,078
I heard my grandfather

372
00:38:43,078 --> 00:38:45,547
was against you and my father dating.

373
00:38:46,134 --> 00:38:49,626
Did you ever hold it against my dad?

374
00:38:49,626 --> 00:38:51,427
No.

375
00:38:52,462 --> 00:38:54,964
I was actually quite glad.

376
00:38:54,964 --> 00:38:58,885
He didn't ask me to come to Korea.

377
00:38:58,885 --> 00:39:01,221
Being lonely in a foreign country

378
00:39:01,221 --> 00:39:05,225
with only one person to lean on?

379
00:39:05,225 --> 00:39:07,922
I don't think I could've done it.

380
00:39:08,978 --> 00:39:11,780
We were quite different, too.

381
00:39:14,776 --> 00:39:18,203
I hope you two make it, though.

382
00:39:18,947 --> 00:39:21,207
Thank you.

383
00:39:24,577 --> 00:39:27,963
But sometimes...

384
00:39:31,084 --> 00:39:34,587
I feel like unfulfilled love would be meaningless

385
00:39:34,587 --> 00:39:36,806
and I get kind of scared.

386
00:39:42,053 --> 00:39:44,264
Sometimes, it takes a lot of time

387
00:39:44,264 --> 00:39:46,899
for you to realize something.

388
00:39:48,518 --> 00:39:51,855
There is no such thing as meaningless love.

389
00:39:51,855 --> 00:39:53,732
Love is a blessing in itself.

390
00:39:53,732 --> 00:39:58,035
It doesn't matter what kind of love it is.

391
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,707
I only realized that after a long time.

392
00:41:22,779 --> 00:41:24,197
Hello.

393
00:41:24,197 --> 00:41:25,824
Would you like to check out?

394
00:41:25,824 --> 00:41:26,927
Yes, please.

395
00:41:26,927 --> 00:41:28,587
Okay, thank you.

396
00:41:28,587 --> 00:41:30,684
Please wait a moment.

397
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:34,593
Excuse me, sir.

398
00:41:35,917 --> 00:41:39,535
These flowers were supposed to be given to you.

399
00:41:39,535 --> 00:41:43,656
But, they were handed to another customer yesterday.

400
00:41:43,656 --> 00:41:47,426
We do apologize for our mistake, sir.

401
00:41:47,426 --> 00:41:49,447
We're really sorry.

402
00:41:49,447 --> 00:41:51,046
Thank you.

403
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:03,484
- Dad.
- Yes?

404
00:42:03,484 --> 00:42:06,030
Do you really have to follow my account?

405
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,657
I thought you wanted more followers.

406
00:42:07,657 --> 00:42:09,909
Yeah, but you're not just "a follower."

407
00:42:09,909 --> 00:42:13,079
What are you trying to say?
Is family not important to you?

408
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:15,339
No, that's not what I'm...

409
00:42:18,292 --> 00:42:20,052
Hey, Mr. Lee.

410
00:42:21,254 --> 00:42:22,888
Okay.

411
00:42:23,548 --> 00:42:26,725
Can't you just take care of it?

412
00:42:42,275 --> 00:42:45,570
Hey, what side of the bed
did you wake up on?

413
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:47,572
What are you trying to make up for?

414
00:42:47,572 --> 00:42:49,532
Have you lost weight?

415
00:42:49,532 --> 00:42:51,325
Oh, come on. No way.

416
00:42:51,325 --> 00:42:53,119
I never realized you were so small.

417
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:55,621
Oh, knock it off, will you?

418
00:42:55,621 --> 00:42:57,790
You'll catch my cold if you don't.

419
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:59,918
Well, I don't actually mind.

420
00:42:59,918 --> 00:43:02,011
Do you not have work today?

421
00:43:03,546 --> 00:43:05,006
Rock.

422
00:43:05,006 --> 00:43:07,884
I was on my way home last night,

423
00:43:07,884 --> 00:43:11,637
and I got this random warm feeling.

424
00:43:11,637 --> 00:43:15,475
So, I'm going to give myself a small gift today.

425
00:43:15,475 --> 00:43:16,934
What are you talking about?

426
00:43:16,934 --> 00:43:18,936
Were you out drinking again?

427
00:43:18,936 --> 00:43:20,521
No.

428
00:43:20,521 --> 00:43:23,733
How about a movie date with Mom?
It's been a while.

429
00:43:23,733 --> 00:43:25,735
I'm down if you're paying.

430
00:43:25,735 --> 00:43:28,237
Can you see what's on while I go for a run?

431
00:43:28,237 --> 00:43:29,955
I'll be back soon.

432
00:43:40,917 --> 00:43:43,211
Hey, Lightning.

433
00:43:43,211 --> 00:43:45,304
See you in a bit.

[I'M SORRY ABOUT EARLIER
HAPPY BIRTHDAY - HONG]

435
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:54,115
Hello.

436
00:44:54,115 --> 00:44:56,033
- Hello.
- Hello. How are you?

437
00:44:56,033 --> 00:44:58,752
- Hello.
- Hi, Ji Yun.

438
00:44:59,954 --> 00:45:01,998
Okay, Seo U. Let's take a look at your leg.

439
00:45:01,998 --> 00:45:03,624
Okay.

440
00:45:03,624 --> 00:45:05,543
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

441
00:45:05,543 --> 00:45:07,219
Then...

442
00:45:08,212 --> 00:45:10,465
How about this blue?

443
00:45:10,465 --> 00:45:12,467
Would the blue make it brighter?

444
00:45:12,467 --> 00:45:15,061
This one does seem a bit too dark.

445
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,646
You know,

446
00:46:47,646 --> 00:46:49,906
I haven't stopped running.

447
00:46:58,615 --> 00:47:00,368
Ever since we broke up,

448
00:47:00,368 --> 00:47:03,413
I wanted to be closer to your heart.

449
00:47:03,413 --> 00:47:05,501
So, I just kept running.

450
00:47:08,041 --> 00:47:10,769
I ran around Inokashira Park...

451
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:15,432
and I thought about you.

452
00:47:16,216 --> 00:47:17,927
At first,

453
00:47:17,927 --> 00:47:20,995
it was because I missed you.

454
00:47:25,225 --> 00:47:27,684
But as I kept running...

455
00:47:30,772 --> 00:47:33,046
I started to understand...

456
00:47:35,057 --> 00:47:38,291
how you must've felt back then.

457
00:47:41,032 --> 00:47:43,869
You were running

458
00:47:43,869 --> 00:47:46,742
to get over your loneliness.

459
00:47:52,544 --> 00:47:54,451
I thought...

460
00:47:56,464 --> 00:47:59,520
that I knew everything about you.

461
00:48:01,469 --> 00:48:03,524
But now I know...

462
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:09,299
that I didn't understand
the most important part.

463
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:18,582
You know what?

464
00:48:20,113 --> 00:48:22,577
After we broke up...

465
00:48:23,908 --> 00:48:26,340
I couldn't even run for a while.

466
00:48:28,622 --> 00:48:31,341
It's just like you said in your novel.

467
00:48:32,417 --> 00:48:34,468
I was the same.

468
00:48:35,211 --> 00:48:37,817
I regret everything I did, too.

469
00:48:40,091 --> 00:48:42,651
When we were together...

470
00:48:47,098 --> 00:48:50,226
all I did was complain

471
00:48:50,226 --> 00:48:52,595
and didn't even try to understand how you felt.

472
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:56,024
I was just the same.

473
00:48:56,024 --> 00:48:59,475
I didn't see what was actually important.

474
00:49:03,823 --> 00:49:06,576
I didn't see it until it was too late.

475
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:09,203
I made you feel...

476
00:49:09,203 --> 00:49:13,055
lonely and miserable, too.

477
00:49:18,838 --> 00:49:20,443
No.

478
00:49:24,219 --> 00:49:26,541
It was my fault.

479
00:49:31,017 --> 00:49:33,552
I made you lonely.

480
00:49:37,402 --> 00:49:39,029
I'm sorry.

00:49:44,757 --> 00:49:46,641
No.

It wasn't just your fault.
