00:01:23,889 --> 00:01:32,889
My Dear Brothers
EP21

2
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,560
Where's Master?

3
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,680
He's...

4
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,600
Left.

5
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,240
He's left?

6
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,160
He's not gonna kill me?

7
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,760
It was a misunderstanding.

8
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,240
I've already explained everything to him.

9
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,000
Senior

10
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,200
Your eyes...

11
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,320
Yeah.

12
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,600
It seems like the mana influence of the Dark Forest

13
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,520
has limits.

14
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,280
So

15
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,880
your gustation can be restored, too.

16
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,680
Great!

17
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,840
Senior

18
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,840
That looks like your immortal umbrella.

19
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,800
It really is.

20
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,000
What's wrong?

21
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,360
Never mind.

22
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,880
Got pricked by a thorn.

23
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,040
I can't believe it's been missing for so long.

24
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,080
And now it's back.

25
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,200
(That's weird.)

26
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,800
(Isn't the immortal umbrella in Devil Sect's hands?)

27
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,600
(Why is it here?)

28
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,080
(Is Shi Dong doing something again?)

29
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,760
It is because the Immortal perception was missing.

30
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,280
No wonder the Master was so angry.

31
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,600
Devil Lord must have used the Immortal perception to find the Holy Garment.

32
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,400
I heard that all the sects from Immortals Alliance

33
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,120
are out in force.

34
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,000
Just in order to find Devil Lord in whatever way.

35
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,320
So if they find him,

36
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,320
they will severely punish him, right?

37
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,000
Don't worry.

38
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,760
Only if we find Qiu Ping first,

39
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,920
we can keep him safe.

40
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,000
Aren't you tired, guys?

41
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,400
Give us the compass.

42
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,480
Don't move.

43
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,080
You guys trynna fight with me?

44
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,640
Your Master Hou Chi is here.

45
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,720
Your Master Hou Chi is here.

46
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,120
Are you okay?

47
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,880
Can't be better.

48
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,880
I knew I, as the hero, will be alright.

49
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,680
That's the treasure made of the Immortal perception.

50
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,680
Let me show you

51
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,520
what's the protagonist's charm.

52
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,880
Follow this direction, then the Holy Garment can be found.

53
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,480
It doesn't make sense.

54
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,400
What do you mean?

55
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,680
Now everyone from Immortals Alliance are looking for you.

56
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,000
Do you think you can stay alive till we find the Holy Garment?

57
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,280
You are here, though.

58
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,960
Don't rely on me.

59
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,920
I neither have any Holy Power,

60
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,040
nor the qualification for the exam.

61
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,400
Just rely on yourself.

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,160
But you got Hou Chi.

63
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,000
We're not related.

64
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,120
If you want to look for the Holy Garment with him,

65
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,440
just go tell him.

66
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,320
I'm your brother.

67
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,440
You have to help me.

68
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,160
Hou Chi just became my brother, too.

69
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,760
I have to make it fair enough.

70
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,280
I can't use him for you.

71
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,000
I bet you don't wanna go home.

72
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,440
I... I do want to.

73
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,160
If you fall in love with each other,

74
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,560
it's fine when you are not going home.

75
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,760
But he's just

76
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,680
treating you like his little sister.

77
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,320
And

78
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,680
don't you make him your brother just for going home?

79
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,160
Now you changed your mind?

80
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
I got a bright future.

81
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,520
Blood is thicker than water, Shi Xia.

82
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,400
Alright.

83
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,200
I promise.

84
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,440
When you are the head of the Alliance,

85
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,400
I'm going home with you.

86
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,640
Deal.

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,640
Shi Xia

88
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,920
Come on, try it.

89
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,640
The fruit I just picked.

90
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,600
Drink some water, Xia.

91
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,360
I'll take it for her.

92
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,480
That's sweet.

93
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,640
We need to cross that hill.

94
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,080
Let's go then.

95
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,240
Come on.

96
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,680
Be careful, Xia.

97
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,360
Are you okay?

98
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,680
I'm good.

99
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,400
They really have some special relationships.

100
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,160
Isn't that jade pendant

101
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,840
exactly the same as the one which Yuan Zhao gave you?

102
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,080
How do you know?

103
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,480
The old guy is a fount of wisdom.

104
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,400
To break the couple,

105
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,680
he's giving out his best thing.

106
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,600
Don't talk nonsense.

107
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,560
I'm giving it back sooner or later.

108
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,720
He may not want it.

109
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,520
How come?

110
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,960
I can't believe that.

111
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,880
I just got one more brother.

112
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,080
Now I'll get a brother-in-law.

113
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,400
Do you want to die?

114
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,600
Don't move.

115
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,320
Stop running.

116
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,240
Brother-in-law

117
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,280
Come here.

118
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,680
Hou Chi

119
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,280
Follow us.

120
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,320
Coming.

121
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,760
I'm so tired. Let's have a rest.

122
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,600
Go rest alone.

123
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,640
Let's just have a rest.

124
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,600
Qiu Ping

125
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,160
I got something to ask you.

126
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,280
I just heard you said the word "brother-in-law".

127
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,680
What is that?

128
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,960
Why you got a brother

129
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,240
and now a brother-in-law?

130
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,240
You're such a nerd.

131
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,520
You know nothing about relations.

132
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,440
Let me tell you.

133
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,280
The relation between Brother to sister is the love of a family.

134
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,240
And that between Brother-in-law and sister is the love of a couple.

135
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,360
Get it?

136
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,800
Couples consist of men and women

137
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,640
So do Brothers and sisters.

138
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,200
What's the difference?

139
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,840
Sit here, come on.

140
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,120
That's the life.

141
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,480
Remember it.

142
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,280
A brother-in-law can do everything that a brother does.

143
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,880
But a brother

144
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,560
can't do everything that a brother-in-law does.

145
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,840
Show me the thing.

146
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,560
Just like the queue at milk tea shop.

147
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,400
The brother-in-law always ranks the first,

148
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,240
with the biggest permissions.

149
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
The brother has to be behind him.

150
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,120
Understand?

151
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,120
Hi, I want a pure milk tea.

152
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,920
I came first, so I should be the first one.

153
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,520
I'm the brother. I should be the first one.

154
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,720
Be quiet, be quiet.

155
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,120
The brother-in-law should be the first one.

156
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,520
Are you the brother-in-law?

157
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,720
You are the brother-in-law.

158
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,400
(I get it.)

159
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,560
(I have to keep the first position.)

160
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,360
Look.

161
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,640
It's getting more and more interesting.

162
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,520
Such a shabby village.

163
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,240
Is the Holy Garment here?

164
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,640
Just be careful.

165
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,160
I feel it so weird.

166
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,760
I'm here.

167
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,680
Nothing to be afraid.

168
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,560
Let's go.

169
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,080
What's wrong?

170
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,680
Is this Holy Power compass broken?

171
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,960
So disappointing.

172
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,040
Why is it broken at this time?

173
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,000
Maybe the Holy Garment is exactly here.

174
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,560
What do you mean?

175
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,080
The compass falls when it meets a magnetic pole.

176
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,560
And now it's broken.

177
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,080
The best explanation is that

178
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,520
the Holy Garment is right here.

179
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,520
You're right.

180
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,160
Let's go get it, come on.

181
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,600
Guys.

182
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,840
Come here.

183
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,920
Your Majesty

184
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,640
Husppy

185
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,280
Your Majesty

186
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,760
Thank you all

187
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,120
to take part in my sister's wedding.

188
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,480
I really appreciate that.

189
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,400
I have nothing to pay for you.

190
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,680
I'll just cry for you guys.

191
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,000
Your sister's wedding?

192
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,040
You're not here for the wedding?

193
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,920
Yeah, why not?

194
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,480
Husppy

195
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,760
That's your fault.

196
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,440
What's wrong?

197
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,440
Aren't you a little stingy as a brother?

198
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:14,920
I...

199
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,040
You hold your sister's wedding at such a poor place.

200
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,040
Is here poor?

201
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,000
Isn't it?

202
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,720
What's poor?

203
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That's the old site of our Devil Sect altar.

204
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,760
All the apprentices' weddings in Devil Sect

205
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,840
were finished here.

206
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,480
Tell me.

207
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,040
Have you forgot it again?

208
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,920
Have you...?

209
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,600
Nonsense.

210
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,840
I absolutely know it.

211
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,120
I mean,

212
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,400
the old site of the Devil Sect altar is too poor.

213
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,000
When I find the Holy Garment,

214
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,320
the first thing is to offer lots of money

215
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,440
to remould this place.

216
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,040
Let me cry for you.

217
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,280
Go away.

218
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,920
You're so beautiful today, my Devil Lady.

219
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,960
Like a peri.

220
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,960
I just wanted to ask you two for a favor.

221
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,680
I'm not sure if you two can help me.

222
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,320
Sure.

223
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,520
They are both willing to help.

224
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,800
That's great.

225
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,720
Then

226
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,400
Y'all just walk around here.

227
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,200
See you later.

228
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,320
Come on, put this

229
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,320
on it.

230
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,480
Okay.

231
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,440
Your Majesty

232
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,480
Thank you all.

233
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,120
Look, they're coming.

234
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,720
Devil Lady, and The Immortal Venerable Hou Chi

235
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
Put the wedding clothes on.

236
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,360
What do you mean?

237
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,280
Make us the groomsman and bridesmaid?

238
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,600
That's impossible.

239
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,440
Wait...

240
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,360
What is a groomsman?

241
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,160
What?

242
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,040
Shi Xia

243
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,280
You should do Husppy this favor.

244
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,080
Yeah, my Devil Lady.

245
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,080
You gotta help me.

246
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,880
Are you serious?

247
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,480
We are brother and sister.

248
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,280
And they're making us the groomsman and bridesmaid.

249
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,760
That's weird.

250
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,400
See the bigger picture.

251
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,400
Yeah, you need that vision.

252
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,200
We can nearly get the Holy Garment.

253
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,000
As long as you can get Hou Chi,

254
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,760
at that time

255
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,320
the Holy Garment will be mine.

256
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,160
Exactly.

257
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,800
Just the groomsman and bridesmaid.

258
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,200
Not the groom and bride.

259
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,480
There's nothing to worry about.

260
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,280
Help me, please.

261
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,040
Help me.

262
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,640
Alright.

263
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,720
Shi Xia just said yes.

264
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,880
Come on.

265
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,760
Qiu Ping

266
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,160
If I do the groomsman,

267
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,560
am I at her first position then?

268
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,160
Exactly.

269
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,600
So you have to do it well.

270
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:41,720
Go.

271
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,280
I will try my best.

272
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,800
Change the wedding clothes.

273
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,520
Okay?

274
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,760
Alright, look at our bride.

275
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,960
Her beautiful face.

276
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,760
We can't see.

277
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,000
I can't see her face either.

278
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,720
Let's see our groom.

279
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,720
Look at his handsomeness.

280
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,280
Great.

281
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,160
Alright, let's turn to the topic.

282
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,040
So based on our tradition in Devil Sect,

283
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,240
our groom

284
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,360
has to choose his bride

285
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,480
from all these ones.

286
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,840
That'll be passed.

287
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,160
I say brother-in-law, you say go.

288
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,680
Okay?

289
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,960
Brother-in-law, go!

290
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,360
Brother-in-law, go!

291
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,720
Brother-in-law, go!

292
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,960
Go!

293
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,840
Come on!

294
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,360
Go!

295
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,520
What are you smelling?

296
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:36,960
My sister.

297
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,040
Everybody.

298
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,640
I found her.

299
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,800
That's none of your business.

300
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,280
Why you so competitive?

301
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,240
This part is for the groom to find his bride.

302
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,400
The Devil Lord told me to be a good groomsman.

303
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,480
Just remember that

304
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,600
we are the supporting actors.

305
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,720
We need to help the protagonists.

306
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,880
We can't win the groom?

307
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,600
Absolutely no.

308
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,880
The love apple is on the thread.

309
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,440
Wish you get a happy marriage.

310
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,800
I'll say one two three, then you two start to eat.

311
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,880
One, two, three, bite!

312
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,600
Can't bite it.

313
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,600
Here we go again.

314
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,840
One, two, three.

315
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,640
Can't bite it again.

316
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,360
Come on.

317
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,800
One, two, three. Can't bite it.

318
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,560
Nice.

319
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,720
They're kissing.

320
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,360
Don't kiss that much.

321
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,040
Don't bite!

322
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,960
What is he doing?

323
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,240
Yeah!

324
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,040
Great!

325
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,600
Great!

326
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:46,680
You...

327
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,760
You two!

328
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,400
Why do I ask you two for help?

329
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:58,960
Xia

330
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,000
Am I a bad groomsman?

331
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,240
Yes.

332
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,840
So, I can't be in the first position?

333
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,680
What?

334
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,600
We're so out of the wedding.

335
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,200
Groom

336
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,040
Would you take your whole life

337
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,600
to protect your bride?

338
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,080
Yes, I do.

339
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,080
Do you hear that?

340
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:24,920
No.

341
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,840
So louder.

342
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,240
Yes, I do.

343
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,520
Louder!

344
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,400
Yes, I do.

345
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,560
Bride

346
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,120
Would you take your whole life

347
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:32,880
to be with your groom?

348
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,040
Sis, I would like to do it, too.

349
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,480
You...

350
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,960
(What does this fool mean?)

351
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,880
(Treating me like his sister,)

352
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,200
(why is he saying this then?)

353
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,120
Now let the groom and bride seal the contract.

354
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,400
Sis

355
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,840
We made a contract, too.

356
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,520
That's different.

357
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,640
What's the difference?

358
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,360
Sis

359
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,880
I want to be at your first position.

360
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,240
You're always saying "the first position".

361
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,680
What does that mean?

362
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,040
Qiu Ping said

363
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,200
the brother-in-law ranks the first to his sister.

364
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,040
He said a brother-in-law can do what a brother can't do.

365
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,920
But in my view,

366
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,040
the things San Ha and her husband did

367
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,360
has nothing different from us.

368
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,320
We eat cotton candy faster and better than them.

369
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,440
We also made a brother and sister contract.

370
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,440
Shut up.

371
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,360
People will laugh at us.

372
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,760
Let me tell you that

373
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,560
the love between brothers and sisters could never equal to

374
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,720
the love between men and women.

375
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,000
Now everyone's here.

376
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,840
Except Bi Hong.

377
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,680
Why are you here?

378
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,800
Immortal Venerable Bi Hong

379
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,960
Are you getting used to this pair of eyes?

380
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,320
Master

381
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,520
Master

382
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,920
Master, are you okay?

383
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,000
Master

384
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,240
Immortal Venerable Bi Hong

385
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,560
You killed your Master.

386
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:02,720
No.

387
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,400
I didn't.

388
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,080
The son of the Yuhua Sect owner

389
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,440
killed his Master.

390
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,200
If anybody knows it,

391
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,600
that'll be a great story in Immortals Alliance.

392
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,200
I didn't do that!

393
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,520
Oh.

394
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,760
I forgot that

395
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,160
Immortal Venerable Bi Hong is blind.

396
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,640
So he doesn't believe it.

397
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,360
I didn't kill Master.

398
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,080
I didn't do that.

399
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,320
I didn't kill Master.

400
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,960
So do you want to see

401
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,760
the death of your Master?

402
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,640
My eyes...

403
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,200
I can see things again.

404
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,280
Enjoy the views.

405
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:28,880
Master

406
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,280
Master

407
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,440
Where's my Master？

408
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,040
Don't worry.

409
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,280
I have buried him already.

410
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,680
Nobody will find him.

411
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,160
That's what I found from him.

412
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,960
Keep it yourself.

413
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,320
Let's go.

414
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,040
Hong

415
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,760
You work hard the most.

416
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,880
But you don't have the Immortal perception,

417
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,360
which makes you cultivate slowly.

418
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,200
This book might help you.

419
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,840
Let me know what's going on.

420
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,760
I prepared a gift for you.

421
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,080
The instrument I gave you is to protect yourself.

422
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,680
And you're using it against me?

423
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,320
No.

424
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,320
No, I don't want them.

425
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,320
Now dig out your eyes,

426
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,120
and give them back to your Master.

427
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,560
I knew you wouldn't like to give them back.

428
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,360
You've been mocked for 200 years for you don't have the Immortal perception.

429
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,960
If lost your eyes,

430
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,200
what's the difference between you and a useless man?

431
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:24,920
Husppy

432
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,160
Who's that?

433
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,800
Not leaving?

434
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,160
Today you took off the veil,

435
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,880
ate the apple,

436
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,840
and even kissed.

437
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,120
Why are you still here then?

438
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,720
That's our family business.

439
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,600
Just go back to your place.

440
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,640
Alright, leave.

441
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,560
Go away.

442
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,920
Come on, let's go inside.

443
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,320
Close the door.

444
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,560
What a day...

445
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,040
San Ha came in.

446
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,680
And it's none of your businesses?

447
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,320
My friend.

448
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,680
San Ha is married.

449
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,320
She belongs to brother-in-law now.

450
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,400
No.

451
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,640
You can't come in.

452
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,760
You scared me.

453
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,520
Did you find the Holy Garment?

454
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,040
I checked everywhere here,

455
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,440
but got nothing.

456
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,600
Did we make it wrong?

457
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,200
Come on.

458
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,160
Master

459
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,840
The Devil Sect must be hiding in this village.

460
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,280
Master

461
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,880
As what you expected,

462
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,400
the compass was made of the Immortal perception.

463
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
I guess the Devil Lord

464
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,400
has followed the compass

465
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,160
and is about to get the Holy Garment soon.

466
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,840
You're right.

467
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,000
They got this compass with their lives.

468
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,840
The silver Holy Garment should belong to the Lingxiu Sect

469
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,040
and the Feng Ming valley.

470
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,160
Check the house.

471
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,120
Let's go.

472
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,320
Keep the pace.

473
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,080
Too bad.

474
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,080
The Immortal Sect is coming.

475
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,040
Move.

476
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,800
Look...

477
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,200
I've seen a lot of bride-snatching things.

478
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,680
But it's my first time to see

479
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,760
someone stop the bride to go into the bridal room.

480
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,520
She's your little sister.

481
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,760
You should protect her by yourselves.

482
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,120
How can you give this right to others?

483
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,680
Take San Ha home.

484
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,840
Take her home?

485
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,640
You...

486
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,280
If you think it's too late,

487
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,160
just go to the bridal room together.

488
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,040
Take her back tomorrow.

489
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,640
Go to the bridal room together?

490
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,440
Never mind.

491
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,160
He's a bit blunt.

492
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:51,880
Come on, my friend.

493
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,920
Let me talk to you.

494
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,040
Let's go.

495
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,680
Take your sis in.

496
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,200
Alright.

497
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,840
My friend.

498
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,240
The bridal room

499
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,280
only belongs to the groom and the bride.

500
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,680
But you're here,

501
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,200
how do you make them be inside?

502
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,600
So this is

503
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,800
the thing that a brother-in-law can do while a brother can't.

504
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,200
You finally get this.

505
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,880
No wonder sis said the love between brothers and sisters

506
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,960
could never replace the love between couples.

507
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,160
Smart.

508
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,000
Shi Xia

509
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,000
Hou Chi, bad news.

510
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:31,720
The Immortal Sect...

511
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,840
They're following our pace.

512
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,960
Husppy, take San Ha go.

513
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:35,600
Okay.

514
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,360
You two, hide inside.

515
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,400
Don't come out.

516
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,880
Move!

517
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,120
This... this is the bridal room.

518
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,760
I know it's the bridal room.

519
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,040
Protect the compass.

520
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:45,800
Let's go.

521
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,160
Shi Xia

522
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,320
I got something for you.

523
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,840
Why do you give me these?

524
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,760
That's the bride price.

525
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,040
What?

526
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,080
Husppy said I need to offer things in pairs.

527
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,120
Look, these are in pairs.

528
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,400
Didn't you make me your sister?

529
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,680
The bride price is the thing you should offer to your wife.

530
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,440
You won't understand.

531
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,520
I understand, Shi Xia.

532
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,920
I don't want to be your brother.

533
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,320
I want to be the brother-in-law.

534
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,960
Do you know what you're talking about?

535
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,680
I know.

536
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,720
My love to you is like men to women.

537
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,440
Not brothers to sisters.

538
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,920
I want to be in the bridal room with you.
