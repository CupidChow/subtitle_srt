00:01:23,889 --> 00:01:30,000
My Dear Brothers
EP27

2
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,520
Baubles!

3
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,520
Varied baubles!

4
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,360
Have a look and pick one!

5
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:43,880
Hello,

6
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,560
may I help you?

7
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,440
What's this?

8
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,080
Is this an agate made by cicada?

9
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,640
You have a good taste.

10
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,480
This glass cover is a tribute from Tianlai country.

11
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,160
It has good quality and nice color.

12
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,640
When you put it over a candle,

13
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,680
the house will be so bright as a palace.

14
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,760
I'll take it.

15
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,360
I'll pick out something else,

16
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,440
and check out later.

17
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,240
OK.

18
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,480
Help yourself.

19
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,280
Ask me if you need anything.

20
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,840
Do you like it?

21
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,360
Try it if you like.

22
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,240
How could I?

23
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,720
I'm pretending a man now.

24
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,880
Don't worry.

25
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,720
Just you and me.

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,920
No one would know.

27
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:19,840
Excuse me.

28
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,760
We'd like to try this one.

29
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,320
Ok.

30
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,120
I will see what you're gonna do.

31
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,400
So beautiful!

32
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,760
Who's there?

33
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,320
Nobody.

34
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,400
You're so pretty!

35
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,960
Senior

36
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,520
Junior

37
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,040
What instrument is this?

38
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,000
Why haven't I seen it?

39
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,720
It's not an instrument,

40
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,160
but an ornament worn on finger.

41
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,280
It's a love token for a couple.

42
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,360
Shi Xia wishes to

43
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,720
wear this with me.

44
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,600
I'm here to

45
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,200
ask Senior for help

46
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,520
to make this thing.

47
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,960
Senior

48
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,000
I just thought it over.

49
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,400
Although it's small,

50
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,120
it's hard to make.

51
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,640
But,

52
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,760
we do have a vault next to us.

53
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,520
Why don't make a use?

54
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,640
Being rich is so good.

55
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,520
It's nothing.

56
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,760
For me, it's just a drop in the bucket.

57
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,840
The most important thing is to share worries of Master Hou Chi.

58
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,920
When I'm gone,

59
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,520
there are only you guys to be with him.

60
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,200
Where are you going?

61
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,560
Go and visit Shi Dong.

62
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,600
I promised him that

63
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,120
I would often go back to see him.

64
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,680
I'm with you wherever you are.

65
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,320
You'll be very busy

66
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,720
after being the head of the Alliance.

67
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,240
How can you be with me all the time?

68
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,080
Maybe you're too busy to remember me.

69
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,800
I won't.

70
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,440
You are always the first

71
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,680
in my heart.

72
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,520
I won't forget you

73
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,920
even I passed away.

74
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,800
Nothing happened,

75
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,880
why do you say that?

76
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,560
(He was bothered by Evil Aura.)

77
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,400
(He's enduring for not raising my concern.)

78
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,680
Hou Chi

79
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,520
It came to my mind that Qing Feng needed to see me.

80
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,080
I have to get there.

81
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,240
Then I'll wait for you.

82
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,800
I'll be right back.

83
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,840
It took a lot of treasure to make a ring.

84
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
No wonder it can make girls happy.

85
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,080
I have a question

86
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,640
to ask you.

87
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,040
What's romance?

88
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,680
Romance?

89
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,600
Qing Feng

90
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,760
When will Hou Chi come?

91
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,240
Don't worry.

92
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,760
Look!

93
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,400
Let's go.

94
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,280
Go ahead.

95
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,120
Come on.

96
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,400
Come here.

97
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,320
Let's get out of here, too.

98
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:17,800
Have a seat.

99
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,760
What do you think?

100
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,120
Is the "romance" I prepared

101
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,080
for Master Hou Chi good?

102
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,400
Romance?

103
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,560
Although

104
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,840
it's a dialect of Shi Xia's hometown,

105
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,920
it doesn't bother me.

106
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,360
The two characters of "romance"

107
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,640
have the root of "water".

108
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,320
So I think it's related to "water".

109
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,640
Then I prepare this surprise for Master Hou Chi

110
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,320
to make Shi Xia happy.

111
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,480
Are you shy?

112
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,400
No.

113
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,600
Then why are you blushing?

114
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,680
What are you doing?

115
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,320
Hou Chi

116
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,680
Thank you for preparing this wonderful night for me.

117
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,160
No matter how long it lasts,

118
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,720
I'll remember today.

119
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,040
Well,

120
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,920
do you think it is romantic enough?

121
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,800
Yes.

122
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,480
Do you use the word romance here too?

123
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,080
The 10th thing you wrote in your note.

124
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,680
In a very romantic moment,

125
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,800
your boyfriend put the ring on your finger.

126
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,560
You said you like trees,

127
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,200
so I made a leaf ring for you.

128
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,560
Do you like it?

129
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,240
Yeah,

130
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,280
I love it so much.

131
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,440
It's such a small matter,

132
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,560
but you remember it.

133
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,200
All matters about you

134
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,960
are not small.

135
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,680
Actually,

136
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,080
I got you something too.

137
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,800
Where?

138
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,000
In the water.

139
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,200
The water?

140
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,720
I can't see it.

141
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,560
Is this

142
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,920
our yard?

143
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,120
When you are the head of the Alliance,

144
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,800
you'll live in the Celestial Palace.

145
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,760
You may not get back to Yuhua Sect very often.

146
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,600
I put all the views of the yard

147
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,200
in the crystal ball.

148
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,560
If you get homesick,

149
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,960
you can see it.

150
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,040
What about you?

151
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,440
Are you in it?

152
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,880
Sure.

153
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,520
Whatever the seasons switch,

154
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,880
it'll always be summer

155
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,080
in this crystal ball.

156
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,240
I like it.

157
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,920
So beautiful.

158
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,440
Well,

159
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,480
I have something for you, too.

160
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,520
I think this dress suits you so well,

161
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,280
so I bought it for you.

162
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,400
Are you insane?

163
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,720
I'm a man,

164
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,720
why do you give me a dress!

165
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,920
Stop pretending.

166
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,280
I saw you wearing it

167
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,240
that day in the store.

168
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,000
You,

169
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,360
you saw it?

170
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,840
What do you want?

171
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,400
Don't worry,

172
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,720
I never hurt ladies.

173
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,800
If you promise not to hit me again,

174
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,840
then I'll treat you well.

175
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,400
These are rings,

176
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,640
which are love tokens

177
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,240
for man and woman.

178
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,000
Do you know what I mean?

179
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,320
Dumb girl.

180
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,400
One of these rings

181
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,120
is worth a house.

182
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,400
As long as you promise to be my girl,

183
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,520
you'll not only get all the rings,

184
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,680
but also all the property owned by Yi family

185
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,520
will contain your name.

186
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,280
I heard it works well

187
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,120
to give gifts at romantic moments.

188
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,320
Wait, wait!

189
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:01,720
Qing Feng

190
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,000
Qing Feng

191
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,240
Hou Chi

192
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,120
There is a custom in our hometown.

193
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,040
If people in love

194
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,480
drink "cross-cupped wine",

195
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,560
they'll be in love forever.

196
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,680
Since you don't drink alcohol,

197
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,560
how about we replace it with tea?

198
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,360
OK.

199
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,440
Forever.

200
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,560
Shi Xia

201
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,720
I...

202
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,800
In a very romantic moment,

203
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,760
my boyfriend put the ring on my finger.

204
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,930
(Forget me.)

205
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,040
From now on,

206
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,800
only you to stay with me.

207
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,400
Shi Xia

208
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,600
Shi Xia

209
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,560
Senior

210
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,240
Why do you come?

211
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,280
I'll go with you.

212
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,080
No,

213
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,640
this is your home,

214
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,560
you can't leave.

215
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,120
No.

216
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,240
I've put the past behind,

217
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,440
except...

218
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,320
you.

219
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,240
You haven't eaten for five days.

220
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,600
You'll starve to death

221
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,000
if you don't eat.

222
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,200
I said

223
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,560
I won't eat anything

224
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,080
if you still wanna go out.

225
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,800
Are you even gonna die

226
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,160
to keep me here?

227
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:39,920
Qiu Li

228
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,920
I can't watch you to make mistakes.

229
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,680
But I'm here for you.

230
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,120
Brother

231
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,280
Qiu Li

232
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,320
You finally come back.

233
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,440
I'll be there for you,

234
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,080
so you don't need her to protect you.

235
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,640
You would rather die

236
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,760
to keep me here.

237
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,680
Since you want her back,

238
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,320
I'll let her back.

239
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:56,880
Husppy!

240
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,080
Husppy!

241
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,280
Husppy, come here!

242
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,360
My brother fainted!

243
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,000
What's wrong?

244
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,040
He fainted,

245
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,920
come in here!

246
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,760
Are you Bai...

247
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,400
I'm Bai Li, go!

248
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,000
OK!

249
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,880
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.

250
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:34,960
Immortal Aunt?

251
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:39,920
What?

252
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,160
Great,

253
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,160
you finally come back.

254
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,480
You don't have to hide anymore.

255
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,360
He drank Love-forgetting Potion.

256
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,320
He won't recognize you

257
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,560
even he meets you.

258
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,520
Yeah.

259
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,720
He has forgotten me.

260
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,800
What do I worry about?

261
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,560
Let's go.

262
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,400
Look, we're here again.

263
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,360
Now that you've moved on,

264
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,120
why do you recall old memories at familiar sights?

265
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,320
It's Hou Chi's lifelong wish to be the head of the Alliance.

266
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,400
I don't want to miss it.

267
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,640
I won't bother him by showing up.

268
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,960
Just taking a look at him

269
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,640
from a distance is enough.

270
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,680
Shi Xia

271
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,720
After the ceremony,

272
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,440
I'll take you to make a sightseeing tour.

273
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,240
Let's start over, okay?

274
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,880
Qing Feng, we seldom move down the mountain

275
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,120
to attend the ceremony of Master Hou Chi.

276
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,320
What do you want?

277
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,200
I'll buy them all for you.

278
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,960
Shi Xia has disappeared,

279
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,480
but you still in the mood to hang out.

280
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,680
Master said

281
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,400
Shi Xia and Master Bi Hong eloped.

282
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,920
That's not Shi Xia's style.

283
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,920
The fact is in front of us.

284
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,360
She did leave with another guy!

285
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,360
Shi Xia and Master Hou Chi

286
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,000
got together after being through a lot.

287
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,600
I saw all of her feelings

288
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,680
to Master Hou Chi.

289
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,920
There must be some reason for her

290
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,320
to leave without saying goodbye.

291
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,360
Even so, she can tell us.

292
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,080
We can fix it together.

293
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,320
But she just kept it in mind,

294
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,600
and ran away from us.

295
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,160
We're all upset.

296
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,200
Look at Master Hou Chi,

297
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,320
he has looked sulky

298
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,000
and ignored everyone all the way here.

299
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,680
He must be heartbroken.

300
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:16,880
Stop it!

301
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,800
I'll shut up!

302
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,880
I won't, indeed!

303
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,480
Dolls!

304
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,840
Handmade dolls.

305
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,160
Limited edition of Yuhua Sect dolls!

306
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,720
Have a look!

307
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,360
Dolls!

308
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,280
Dolls stitched by hand!

309
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,320
Dolls!

310
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,280
What's the matter, Shi Xia?

311
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,120
Dolls!

312
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,080
Have a look!

313
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,720
Nothing,

314
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,320
I just think

315
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,040
they're special.

316
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,280
You like it?

317
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,680
I'll buy it for you.

318
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:53,760
No, thanks.

319
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,120
Dolls!

320
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,000
It's you!

321
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:02,920
Look

322
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,760
These dolls are modelled after

323
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,120
you and The Immortal Venerable Hou Chi.

324
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,200
It sells well.

325
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,600
Shi Xia!

326
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,280
Qing Feng? Yaogua?

327
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,800
What a coincidence.

328
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,640
You visit The Otherworld Town, too.

329
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,320
Shi Xia, why do you leave Yuhua Sect?

330
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:34,960
And why did Master say

331
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,320
you and Master Bi Hong eloped?

332
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,560
Master... that's what he said?

333
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,800
Do you have some troubles?

334
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,000
Tell us,

335
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,440
so we can help you.

336
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,960
You'd better have some reasons.

337
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,680
I don't.

338
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,760
We eloped exactly.

339
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,600
Look, what did I say?

340
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,320
She has broken faith!

341
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,720
Stay away from this wicked woman

342
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,200
in case you do as she did.

343
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:11,960
Yi Yaogua

344
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,920
Speak with respect!

345
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,400
Qing Feng

346
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,080
Believe it or not,

347
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,080
I have nothing to explain.

348
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,280
Alright.

349
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,280
Since you don't care about him anymore,

350
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,200
why come to The Otherworld Town?
