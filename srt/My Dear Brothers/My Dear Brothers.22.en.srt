00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,880
My Dear Brothers
EP22

2
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,880
I don't want to be your brother.

3
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,160
I want to be the brother-in-law.

4
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,080
Do you know what you're talking about?

5
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,880
I know.

6
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,840
My love to you is like men to women.

7
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,640
Not like brothers to sisters.

8
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,800
I want to be in the bridal room with you.

9
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,760
How can you say that?

10
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,120
Do you know what it means?

11
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,320
We are doing it right now.

12
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,880
You really don't understand.

13
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,000
Shi Xia, I do.

14
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,560
I love every moment I spent with you.

15
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,680
I want to protect you all of my life.

16
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,920
But we made us brother and sister already.

17
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,200
I'll break that contract in front of everybody.

18
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,160
Your master wouldn't allow that.

19
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,680
I knew it.

20
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,200
He'll say I'm the demon girl from Devil Sect again.

21
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,880
Shi Xia

22
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,160
Don't worry about that.

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,480
I just wanna know

24
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,320
whether I can be your brother-in-law?

25
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,680
Only if you say yes.

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,880
I'd rather destroy my 200 years of cultivation.

27
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,040
I'm willing to do that.

28
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,080
I just want to be with you.

29
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,800
And we'll never be apart.

30
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,800
But we live in two different worlds.

31
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,560
We were supposed to be apart.

32
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,280
Shi Xia

33
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,160
Hou Chi

34
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,840
Are you okay?

35
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,440
Hou Chi, what's wrong?

36
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,280
I'm okay.

37
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,000
Your Majesty, the Immortal Sect is coming.

38
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,000
Go away.

39
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,440
The compass must be there.

40
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,480
That's a fake one.

41
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,200
I threw it away.

42
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,400
Why don't you trust me?

43
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,920
You never tell the truth.

44
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,320
We won't let you go until you hand in the compass.

45
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,000
What's wrong with you?

46
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,560
That's the bridal room.

47
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,800
You guys wanna barge in?

48
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,760
The Devil Sect is too treacherous.

49
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,640
I got nothing to communicate with you.

50
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,680
Look at this, check it out.

51
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,520
The Immortal Sect old man is trying to take the Devil Sect bride away.

52
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,240
So shameless.

53
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,640
You're talking bullshit.

54
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,160
Master, don't fall for his trick.

55
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,840
Go away!

56
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,120
If you don't give us the compass today,

57
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,760
We Feng Ming valley will ruin your Devil Sect.

58
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,960
Go away, stay back.

59
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,360
I promise with the Lingxiu Sect's reputation.

60
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,520
The bridal room is just a trick.

61
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,760
Such a trash house.

62
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,480
How can it be the bridal room?

63
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,840
The compass must be inside.

64
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,520
Well.

65
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,120
Everybody can prove this.

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
If that's a real bridal room,

67
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,280
Mr. Zhao, what would you say?

68
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:09,880
Yeah.

69
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,200
We Lingxiu Sect will quit the alliance election.

70
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,280
Okay, fine.

71
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,120
Come on.

72
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,800
Let's go.

73
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,640
Go, come on.

74
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,680
Pay attention to the threshold.

75
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,000
That's a real bridal room.

76
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,160
It's real.

77
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,480
I told you already.

78
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,240
Why would you come in?

79
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,560
They're making babies.

80
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:46,840
Come back.

81
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,600
That's too much.

82
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,360
That's Husppy sitting on the sedan chair.

83
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,400
Since I promised with the reputation of my sect,

84
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,360
I have to see it for myself.

85
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,480
Too stubborn.

86
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,680
Come back.

87
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,080
D*mn.

88
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,480
Mr. Zhao, is that enough?

89
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,000
Such a R-rated scene,

90
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,080
I wouldn't like to see that.

91
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,800
Yeah.

92
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,000
Every minute of the wedding night is precious.

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,840
Yup.

94
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,600
Come back.

95
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:58,800
Let's go.

96
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,440
What the hell did we just do?

97
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,280
Now you see what you wanted.

98
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,280
And I've lost my patience.

99
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,760
Please go back.

100
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:17,960
Mr. Zhao

101
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,120
Keep your word.

102
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,680
A crowd of people fishing into a fish tank.

103
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,760
What a waste of time!

104
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,280
They tricked me.

105
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,360
Junior

106
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,960
Senior, thanks for being here.

107
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,280
Come on, there's a hidden path out there.

108
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:41,960
Follow me.

109
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,000
Go hide inside.

110
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,200
And go out when it's safe.

111
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,040
Senior, you should be careful, too.

112
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,160
Let's go.

113
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,760
It's so dark here.

114
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,880
Shi Xia, I remember you're scared of the dark.

115
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,080
Stop using the Holy Power.

116
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,480
I'm not scared.

117
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,600
I'm not scared of anything when you're here.

118
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,600
I'm so glad for

119
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,240
what you say.

120
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,040
Hou Chi, let's move.

121
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,320
We are in the void space now.

122
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,920
What should we do then?

123
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,240
I got enough Holy Power at the moment.

124
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,880
Let's try to get out of here.

125
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,480
I made the strongest ward.

126
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,680
Even if they are Daluo Immortals,

127
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,520
they won't be able to break this ward.

128
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,880
That's wise, my Immortal Aunt.

129
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,800
They can't run away this time.

130
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,760
Qi Lingling, keep an eye on this painting.

131
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,840
I'll meet them myself.

132
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,080
Yes, my Immortal Aunt.

133
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,320
I've settled the old guys from Lingxiu Sect.

134
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,560
So easy.

135
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,280
There you go.

136
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,800
You know the corner of the Devil Sect

137
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,720
well.

138
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,720
I don't even know there's a hidden path.

139
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,560
I lost my way.

140
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,920
And I just saw that in coincidence.

141
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,840
Lead the way.

142
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,960
Shi Xia

143
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,680
Hou Chi

144
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,120
Hold on, hold on.

145
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,640
Are you planning something here?

146
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,280
What do you mean?

147
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,160
I've seen someone like you.

148
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,920
Pretending to be so innocent

149
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,000
and acting like a playboy.

150
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,280
But, you are the one who wants the Holy Garment the most.

151
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,680
It's okay if you don't trust me.

152
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,120
I'll meet them myself.

153
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,640
Shi Xia

154
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,120
The Immortal Sect is after Shi Xia and Hou Chi.

155
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,320
This hidden path is a good place to hide.

156
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,400
Please.

157
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,200
What?

158
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,760
You don't trust me.

159
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,800
I'm being nice.

160
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,720
I'm telling you to help them.

161
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,040
Would you be nice to us?

162
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:46,960
Bi Hong

163
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,480
Don't forget about it.

164
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,440
I gave you that eyes.

165
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,600
You have no right to bargain with me.

166
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,920
This path is weird.

167
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,040
This is the old site of the Devil Sect altar.

168
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,440
Is this the way to the altar?

169
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,600
Let's go.

170
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,800
The ward here is hard to break.

171
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,200
The person who took us here

172
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,160
must be prepared well.

173
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,520
I'll try again.

174
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,360
Don't try again.

175
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:29,920
No.

176
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,680
Before my Holy Power is gone,

177
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,760
I have to get you out of here.

178
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,720
No, I don't want that.

179
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,120
I don't want to leave you.

180
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,600
But if I don't do anything,

181
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,680
we'll both die here.

182
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,440
I'd rather die with you

183
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,000
than watch you sacrifice for me.

184
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,720
I used to feel like

185
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,520
we come from a different world.

186
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,440
And we'll finally be apart.

187
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,160
So I'm also scared.

188
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,680
I try to escape.

189
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,160
But from this moment,

190
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,600
I won't do that anymore.

191
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,800
We'll live together.

192
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,000
And die together.

193
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,480
Hou Chi, what's wrong?

194
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,040
I'm okay.

195
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,120
Just occasionally heartache.

196
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,640
It'll be passed soon.

197
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,120
Why do you always feel like this lately?

198
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,280
Once I'm getting close to you,

199
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,240
you can't help hurting.

200
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,840
It seems like I took you this pain.

201
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,120
Because he got the Evil Aura.

202
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,200
Qiu Li

203
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,840
Evil Aura came from the Holy Root.

204
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,760
It grows with the feelings of love.

205
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,040
You two being so clingy right here.

206
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,760
Sure it works.

207
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,880
You're so mean.

208
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,720
When did you do this to him?

209
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,880
Is it the magic umbrella?

210
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,040
The Immortal Venerable Hou Chi has the power

211
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,800
which our two sects can't beat.

212
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,840
You don't even help Devil Lord as his sister.

213
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,120
So, I must help him.

214
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,520
If I don't do this,

215
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,720
how can Devil Lord be the head of the Alliance?

216
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,760
The Devil Lord tried everything to cure you.

217
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,160
But you're doing this.

218
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,280
Do you want to let him down?

219
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,480
No.

220
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,920
Of course not.

221
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,280
But you two are going to die right here.

222
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,400
The secret of the dead people

223
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,640
will never be known.

224
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,160
You just want to help the Devil Lord to be the head of the Alliance.

225
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,600
Only if I'm dead,

226
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,160
you can reach your goal.

227
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,040
You can get this.

228
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,440
But please let Shi Xia go.

229
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,120
Hou Chi

230
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Let her go?

231
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,640
To keep her taking Devil Lord away from me?

232
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,560
Hou Chi, you almost lost all your Holy Power.

233
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,000
You have no right to say that.

234
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,400
Just die.

235
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,080
Hou Chi

236
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,160
Hou Chi

237
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:16,880
Hou Chi

238
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,800
You both are gonna die here.

239
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,520
You Yuhua Sect ruined my base of the Holy Root.

240
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,400
So pay it with your Holy Root.

241
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,200
I'll never let you kill Hou Chi unless you kill me first.

242
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,440
If you want to die ahead of him.

243
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,680
Okay.

244
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,240
Hou Chi

245
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,120
If to give you the Holy Root,

246
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,440
I'd rather do something more meaningful.

247
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,040
Hou Chi,
are you trying to release all that Holy Root

248
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,920
to break the ward?

249
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,560
If I release all my Holy Root,

250
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,440
this wouldn't be a void space.

251
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,600
And you won't get a chance to do bad things here.

252
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,720
But you will disappear

253
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,560
forever.

254
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,680
But I'll use the last of my power

255
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,520
to get Shi Xia out of here,

256
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,320
and die with you together.

257
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,120
Hou Chi

258
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,880
Hou Chi

259
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,160
Hou Chi

260
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,000
Hou Chi

261
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:55,960
Shi Xia

262
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,560
I really want to go and visit your world.

263
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,720
To learn how to be a normal person.

264
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,720
I'll teach you that.

265
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,360
I'll teach you how to live in my world.

266
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,040
Just like how you taught me in Mount Yuhua.

267
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,840
I'll teach you how to use mobile phones and take the subway.

268
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,760
I'll teach you to go to the amusement park and to eat street food.

269
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,160
I got a lot of things to teach you.

270
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,600
Hou Chi

271
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,200
Don't go.

272
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,320
Good.

273
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,000
Just don't despise me for being stupid.

274
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,120
I won't.

275
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,560
I really want a boyfriend who's a bit clumsy.

276
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,240
The silver Holy Garment?

277
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,080
I finally found it.

278
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,200
Stay back.

279
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,560
I don't believe in this.

280
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,640
Qiu Li

281
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,080
Qiu Li

282
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,800
Are you alright?

283
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,400
You scared me.

284
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,120
I thought I'll never see you again.

285
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,840
Me too.

286
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,880
So acacia is not that we can't see each other,

287
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,920
but is afraid of not being able to.

288
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,080
We'll never be apart again.

289
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,800
Okay?

290
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,600
Okay.

291
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,920
But you have to answer me a question first.

292
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,880
What is a boyfriend?

293
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,680
A boyfriend?

294
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,040
It is someone

295
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,720
that you can eat cotton candy with.

296
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,080
Isn't it embarrassing?

297
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,200
No, why?

298
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,360
I found it first.

299
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,640
So easy.

300
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:31,920
Hou Chi

301
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,320
When Lin Kui confessed,

302
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,400
I was confused.

303
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,120
You are the one who's behind the scenes.

304
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,040
The owner Yuan, don't be mad.

305
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,400
Let me explain.

306
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,520
There's nothing to explain.

307
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,080
You're right.

308
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,520
I'm the one who pulled up the Holy Root of the apprentices of Immortal Sect.

309
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,320
I'm also the one who were trying to kill Shi Xia and Hou Chi.

310
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,800
Good and evil don't exist together.

311
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,240
I was just trying to get the silver Holy Garment by my capability.

312
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,280
What did I do wrong?

313
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,680
Qiu Li, stop it.

314
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,880
Only if you admit it.

315
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,560
I'll take you to explain in front of others.

316
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,520
Let's go, my Immortal Aunt.

317
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,360
Why is Ya inside this painting?

318
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,480
The Yuhua Sect Hou Chi got the silver Holy Garment.

319
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,960
He passed the election.

320
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,240
Let me announce.

321
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,120
Hou Chi from Yuhua Sect

322
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,800
is the head of the Immortals Alliance for this session.

323
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,440
Sis

324
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,320
Why? I can't agree.

325
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,920
I only see that

326
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,920
Hou Chi is wearing the Holy Garment.

327
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,080
You can't change the result

328
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,800
no matter how you think.

329
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,960
This is the official seal of the head of the Alliance.

330
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,200
When you come to the shrine,

331
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,840
you can open it.

332
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:07,920
Yes, ma'am.

333
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,520
I can't be the head of the Alliance now.

334
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,960
What do I need this box for?

335
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,640
You can't throw Shen Guan's thing away.

336
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,400
If you don't want it,

337
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,520
I can keep it for you.

338
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,200
It's yours.

339
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,360
Hong

340
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,000
Take Junior back to heal.

341
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,120
Alright.

342
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:56,960
