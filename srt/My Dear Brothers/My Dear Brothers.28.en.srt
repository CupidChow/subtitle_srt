00:01:23,889 --> 00:01:30,000
My Dear Brothers
EP28

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,680
Fine.

3
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,680
So if you don't care anymore,

4
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,600
why are you here in the Otherworld Town?

5
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,480
Are you here for the succession ceremony
of Master Hou Chi?

6
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,080
What’s in your hand?

7
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,600
Let me have a look.

8
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,240
Nothing.

9
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,880
Just an ordinary plant. Qing Feng.

10
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,080
Miss, you dropped something.

11
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,880
The Immortal Venerable Hou Chi.

12
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,680
Would you like to

13
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,000
buy another doll for Miss Shi Xia?

14
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,960
I don't know this girl,

15
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,840
and I haven’t given her dolls either.

16
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,400
Qing Feng, Yi Yaogua,

17
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,640
Come with me.

18
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,160
Let's go.

19
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,440
I have such a good taste.

20
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,200
Don't you think

21
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,480
it strange how Master Hou Chi treated Shi Xia?

22
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,600
Strange how?

23
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,320
It's like

24
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,720
he never knew Shi Xia.

25
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,800
There's a saying,

26
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,760
nothing is more lamentable than a dead heart.

27
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,440
Shi Xia broke his heart,

28
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,520
so he became numb.

29
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,800
Can someone really

30
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,800
change his heart overnight,

31
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,320
and then give up overnight?

32
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
We finally have this moment for us two,

33
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,120
but you're always talking about others.

34
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,400
I think I'm less important to you

35
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,680
than your sister.

36
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,640
Don't you want to go on a night out?

37
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,280
I agreed.

38
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,440
Really?

39
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,400
Could you put on a girl's dress?

40
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,680
You're out of control again, aren't you?

41
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,560
You're not serious at all.

42
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,240
Come in.

43
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,760
We're in this remote inn,

44
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,640
which is certainly inferior to those in the city.

45
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,960
But this was the farthest inn

46
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,480
from the Otherworld Inn.

47
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,240
We'll not see anyone

48
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,080
from the Yuhua Sect again.

49
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,200
It's fine here.

50
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,520
As you have seen just now,

51
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,520
Hou Chi has forgotten about you.

52
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,840
If you don't let it go,

53
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,360
you're the only one who suffer.

54
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,240
So set yourself free.

55
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,840
Every moment with Hou Chi

56
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,920
was precious to me.

57
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,640
Even though I can't be with him forever,

58
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,760
I don't want to forget those memories.

59
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,800
Fine.

60
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,200
If you don't want to forget him,

61
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,160
just let it be.

62
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,600
When the Otherworld pageant is over,

63
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,160
I'll take you away.

64
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,280
We can scour the world for good food.

65
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,480
With time goes by,

66
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,600
you'll gradually forget about him.

67
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,560
No.

68
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,080
No matter how time goes

69
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,320
I won't forget him.

70
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,000
Like this Holy Tree,

71
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,480
he will grow in my heart

72
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,640
and be born again.

73
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,640
Have a good rest.

74
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,240
Senior.

75
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,720
What's the matter, Shi Xia?

76
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,120
My Holy Tree is gone.

77
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,400
Did you find it?

78
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,160
It was windy last night.

79
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,720
Where did the wind take it?

80
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,720
No, I have to find it.

81
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,200
In the outskirts of the Otherworld Town,
there is a Holy Power gathering place,

82
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,080
which is an excellent place for practicing.

83
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,920
Let's go there today to practice.

84
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,000
Shi Xia.

85
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,720
Did you find it?

86
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,440
Not yet.

87
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,960
Master, Holy Power is at its peak just before noon.

88
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,640
Let's go.

89
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,120
Don't worry.

90
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,480
We still have time.

91
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,840
Let’s take a break here,

92
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,080
and then we'll go.

93
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,000
Even if Shi Xia was wrong,

94
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,400
as a noble and righteous man,

95
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,560
you should not stand idly by.

96
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,920
Masters

97
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,680
I think you've gone a little too far this time, too.

98
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,200
Qing Feng.

99
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,320
Master. Let's go.

100
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,680
My Holy Tree was gone.

101
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,240
Shi Xia, did you lose your mind?

102
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,960
Do you want to kill yourself for the branch?

103
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,600
Where's Hou Chi?

104
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,440
This is how he protects you!

105
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,640
We broke up.

106
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,400
Come here.

107
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,000
Tell me more about it.

108
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,080
Why did you break up?

109
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,560
Did he dump you?

110
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,520
I dumped him, of course.

111
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,280
Why did you do that?

112
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,120
What else could it be?

113
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm tired of him.

114
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,000
I didn't like him anymore.

115
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,160
So I dumped him.

116
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,040
He was hurt badly

117
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,840
by my indifference and unrestraint.

118
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,320
You two have eaten Cotton Candy.

119
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,560
How could you break up so easily?

120
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,160
I'm a modern girl.

121
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,480
What's wrong with Cotton Candy?

122
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,960
You're not going back.

123
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,200
You're an ancient girl.

124
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,360
You two have been together for,

125
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,400
like only half a month.

126
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,640
I've been his brother-in-law only for a while.

127
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,280
In addition,

128
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,760
Did I write that 800-meter roll of paper

129
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,480
in vain?

130
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,320
I've been up all-night writing and my hands still...

131
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,760
What matters more,
your bubble address as a brother-in -law,

132
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,360
or my happiness?

133
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,720
Your happiness?

134
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,760
You did not cheat on him, did you?

135
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,160
No, no, no.

136
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,680
If you don't like Hou Chi,

137
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,440
which one could you like?

138
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,040
I did not cheat on him.

139
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,400
Anyway, I don't like him anymore.

140
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,680
It was all my fault.

141
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,400
Fine.

142
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,200
Even if you cheated on him,

143
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,840
it would be his fault.

144
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,640
I'm going to help you punish that bad man.

145
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,040
Are you insane!

146
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,600
You didn't tell me the truth.

147
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,440
Tell me!

148
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,280
I...

149
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,000
By the way,

150
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,480
Why are you here all of a sudden?

151
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,840
Why I came here?

152
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,440
Don't change the subject.

153
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,720
Tell me exactly what happened.

154
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,520
My brother is here to take part in

155
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,400
the Succession Ceremony
of Immortal Venerable Hou Chi.

156
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,640
Hi, Immortal Aunt.

157
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,680
Hi, brother.

158
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,920
As Hou Chi's brother-in-law,

159
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,760
he couldn't miss his brother-in-law's

160
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,280
moment of glory, right? Husppy.

161
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,720
Shut up.

162
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,040
Has she recovered yet?

163
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,320
One cannot achieve anything
without concentrating on a subject.

164
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,960
One cannot understand by analogy
without reading widely.

165
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,080
As an expert on schizophrenia,

166
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,000
your brother has to...

167
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,200
Are you really cured?

168
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,000
Thank you for your concern.

169
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,560
I'm completely cured.

170
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,640
Sister Shi Xia

171
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,080
I've done so much that hurt you,

172
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,520
and I'm so sorry.

173
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,560
Please don't blame me,

174
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,480
and forgive me, please.

175
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,240
That's all right.

176
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,000
That was because you were sick.

177
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,320
It was not your fault.

178
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,400
Great. Sister Shi Xia.

179
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,000
From now on, you and brother

180
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,440
are the closest people to me.

181
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,120
Great!

182
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,640
Shut up.

183
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,760
Shi Xia

184
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,680
Shi Xia

185
00:18:33,305 --> 00:18:36,190
(Forget me.)

186
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,000
Why are all my memories of Shi Xia fading away?

187
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,640
Lovers can be together forever

188
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,640
as long as they drink cross-cupped wine.

189
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,600
Is it because of the tea?

190
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,000
Shi Xia

191
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,560
Shi Xia

192
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,880
Where are you now?

193
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,840
Why did you make me forget you?

194
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,040
Junior, don't look for her anymore.

195
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,760
Shi Xia has already gone.

196
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,800
You set this all up, didn't you?

197
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,360
You told Master about my health.

198
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,680
And it was you who gave Shi Xia Love-forgetting Potion.

199
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,200
Right.

200
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,120
I did all of this.

201
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,360
Why did you do these?

202
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,720
You and I are brothers.

203
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,440
Do I have to watch you die?

204
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:32,880
I don't need you

205
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,200
to decide my life for me.

206
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,800
I will never give her up,

207
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,800
even if I die.

208
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,720
You're willing to die for her?

209
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,400
Did you ever think about Shi Xia's situation?

210
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,200
Do you know that

211
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,680
my father has already wanted to kill her?

212
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,640
My dad would have killed her

213
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,760
if I hadn't stopped him in time.

214
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,240
The only way to keep Shi Xia alive

215
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,000
is to let you drink the Love-forgetting Potion.

216
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,760
Shi Xia

217
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,960
also drank the Love-forgetting Potion.

218
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,600
She didn't want to see you die alone.

219
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,800
It would be a relief

220
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,160
for both of you to forget the past.

221
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,440
Junior

222
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,560
Your life does not belong to you alone.

223
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,160
You are the head of the Alliance.

224
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,160
It is your mission and responsibility

225
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,640
to rule the immortal world,

226
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,080
and to maintain the glory of your sect.

227
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,840
This Love-forgetting Potion will keep you alive,

228
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,760
and save you from suffering.

229
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,400
You'd better drink it.

230
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,320
My days are numbered.

231
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,320
If you hate me,

232
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,280
you can go home in relieve.

233
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:12,840
Come here.

234
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,160
The sun is about to set,

235
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,120
but you brought me here for a picnic.

236
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:17,880
What's the matter with you?

237
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,680
Go outdoors

238
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,080
and breath some fresh air

239
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,080
-Yeah.  - It will help you ease the feelings of being lovelorn.

240
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,600
I'm in a good mood.

241
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,680
It's gonna be dark later.

242
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,840
I'm not staying here.

243
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,200
Have a picnic with me or run 500 meters.

244
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,160
Pick one.

245
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,280
I choose to run the 500 meters.

246
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:34,880
Okay.

247
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,640
Okay.

248
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,600
Get ready.

249
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,120
Ready, go.

250
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,520
Sister, are you okay?

251
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,640
Are you okay?

252
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,360
Are you hurt?

253
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,800
Shi Dong, what's the matter with you!

254
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,160
How could you dig a hole for your own sister?

255
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,880
Wait a minute.

256
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,440
Here you are. Keep calm.

257
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,640
Eat something.

258
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,680
Have a picnic.

259
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,760
You'll be thanking me in a minute.

260
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,640
Enjoy your picnic.

261
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,600
Let's go.

262
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,520
Don't leave.

263
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,150
(Shi Xia is in danger.)

264
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,080
So handsome.

265
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,760
Screw you.

266
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,760
Do you think Hou Chi

267
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,200
has already found us?

268
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,720
The real test starts

269
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,400
when he finds out.

270
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,920
You came to Shi Xia

271
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,360
as soon as you knew she was in danger.

272
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,320
Hou Chi, you are my good brother-in-law.

273
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,200
Shi Dong, what are you up to now?

274
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,280
A man and a woman, alone in a pit.

275
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,320
What am I up to now?

276
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,280
Isn't that obvious?

277
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,960
Hou Chi, my sister dumped you

278
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,120
because she was young

279
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,200
and inexperienced.

280
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:32,720
Please don't mind.

281
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,080
Girls who say they want to break up

282
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,880
are just in a mood.

283
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,320
Do something to make her happy.

284
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,920
The entrance has Devil Sect's

285
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,960
most secure ward.

286
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,280
Even you, my brother-in-law,

287
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,920
has to take a while to break through it.

288
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,720
You two take your time.

289
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,160
I'll pick you up next morning.

290
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,640
Or do I have to go down there and teach them?

291
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,040
Let's go.
I can make it.

292
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:02,800
Come back.

293
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,520
Shi Dong, come back here.

294
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,160
I really can.

295
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:06,800
Shi Dong.

296
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,200
You...

297
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,840
Are you here to rescue me?

298
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,120
Please don't misunderstand me.

299
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,200
No matter who falls here today,

300
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,840
I will not stand by.

301
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,600
I'm going to start to break the ward.

302
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,960
Please stay away from me.
