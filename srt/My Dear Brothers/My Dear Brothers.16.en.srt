00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:30,056
My Dear Brothers
EP16

2
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,800
Senior

3
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,320
What brought you here?

4
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,880
Thankfully, I'm here in time.

5
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,600
How could I

6
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,160
miss the thrilling visit to the Temple?

7
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,080
Senior

8
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,720
Could you please turn back?

9
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,200
I'll blame myself

10
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,160
if something awful happens to you.

11
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,800
I won't forgive myself forever.

12
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,200
Forever?

13
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,720
Then it's worthy.

14
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,720
Senior

15
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,840
I know you were trying to help me

16
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,640
by asking Yi Yaogua to take the test.

17
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,360
Only you know me.

18
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,360
You're my real confidante.

19
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,720
You're a kind and cool guy,

20
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,080
or you wouldn't be good friends with Hou Chi.

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,440
Good friends!

22
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,840
Senior

23
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,040
I've always wondered

24
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,160
why Hou Chi and you can be friends

25
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,440
though you guys have a huge difference in characters?

26
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,160
It was

27
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,280
when I knew I had no Immortal perception...

28
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,480
Bi Hong

29
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,880
You can't master it

30
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,400
without Immortal perception.

31
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,760
Chi

32
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,320
Is this your instrument, Bi Hong?

33
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,840
Bi Hong

34
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,120
You're giving yourself too many airs.

35
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,920
Don't push my buttons.

36
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,040
Show us your instrument,

37
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,280
or we won't let you go.

38
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,040
All right.

39
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,880
Bi Hong

40
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,440
He jumped!

41
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,400
Bi Hong

42
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,640
Bi Hong

43
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,360
Go! Go get Master!

44
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:18,960
Let's go!

45
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,760
Where are you, Senior?

46
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,520
Hou Chi

47
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,560
Where are you, Senior?

48
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,880
I'm here.

49
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,640
If you've seen the Magic Umbrella, hold your breath,

50
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,160
and express your mind to it.

51
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,480
I... I can't do it.

52
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,680
No! Don't go!

53
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,880
Hou Chi, I'm at the foot of the Houshan's precipice.

54
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,320
Hou Chi, I'm at the foot of the Houshan's precipice.

55
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,600
Hou Chi, I'm at the foot of the Houshan's precipice.

56
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,880
Senior

57
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,520
Are you sending messages to me by the Magic Umbrella?

58
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,960
I can control the Magic Umbrella!

59
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,760
It was Hou Chi who told me

60
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,560
one with Immortal perception is utterly different from the one without it.

61
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,160
But he also told me

62
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,800
it seemed not so bad

63
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,200
without it.

64
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,120
I didn't expect that a dull boy like Hou Chi

65
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,160
was a sweet guy when he was a child.

66
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,400
But

67
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,960
I lost the Magic Umbrella

68
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,840
that he gave me a few days ago.

69
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,480
And I haven't found it yet.

70
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,800
Lost?

71
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,480
Yeah, I lost it in The Otherworld Town.

72
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,920
Did you see it?

73
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,280
No.

74
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,680
I

75
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,440
Senior

76
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,320
Shi Xia

77
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,640
Senior

78
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,600
Don't be afraid, Shi Xia.

79
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,840
Just stay where you are. I'll come to you.

80
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,280
Now you tell me you can't find the entrance?

81
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,800
Are you kidding me?

82
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,840
Are you kidding me?

83
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,560
Are you kidding me?

84
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,000
Your Majesty

85
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,080
It seems that there's ward in the Dark Forest.

86
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,400
I haven't broken it yet.

87
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,000
I'll do it myself.

88
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,280
Devil Lord

89
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,400
It's so dangerous in the Dark Forest,

90
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,800
so you can't go alone.

91
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,160
Devil Lord

92
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,160
Wait for me!

93
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,880
Be safe, Your Majesty.

94
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:09,920
Senior

95
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,800
Shi Xia

96
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,840
Hou Chi

97
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,560
What are you doing here?

98
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,720
When did you get there?

99
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,840
Have you sobered up?

100
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,840
I'm fine, my dear sister.

101
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,480
You still see me as your sister?

102
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,080
Of course.

103
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,320
You're my sister forever.

104
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,520
Actually,

105
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,880
I shouldn't have said those words that day. I had a cause...

106
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,640
Shi Xia

107
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,000
No need to explain.

108
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,080
But my words were hurtful.

109
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,080
It must break your heart.

110
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,120
It's fine. It was not.

111
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,440
Really?

112
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,400
That's good.

113
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,560
Let's go get Senior.

114
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,280
No.

115
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,840
Why?

116
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,760
I just want to be with you.

117
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,600
We have to find him first

118
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,800
and get out of the Dark Forest.

119
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,440
There's no need to rush.

120
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,960
No need?

121
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,720
I have to beg Lord Shen Guan

122
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,920
for a test qualification for you.

123
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,640
You know what,

124
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,320
your master even wants to kill me for that.

125
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,440
Neither master nor the test

126
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,440
is more important to me than you.

127
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,160
I just want to be with you

128
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,880
every minute, every second.

129
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,480
No distractions.

130
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,200
No conflicts between immortals and devils.

131
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,120
Just the two of us.

132
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,680
It's Holy Tree.

133
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,880
It was beginning to thrive again.

134
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,760
Shi Xia

135
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,640
I want to be with you,

136
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,240
forever.

137
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,640
But we shouldn't be like that.

138
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,480
No, we should be.

139
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,520
Come with me, Shi Xia.

140
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,520
What about the test of the head of the Alliance?

141
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,720
Forget it.

142
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,560
What about the brother-sister contract between us?

143
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,000
You promised me that you would take the test

144
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,400
and take me home.

145
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,960
The contract has been canceled now.

146
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,600
Don't leave me alone.

147
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,680
Shi Xia

148
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,560
You aren't Hou Chi.

149
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,760
He would never cancel the contract.

150
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,840
No desire, no delusion.

151
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,280
No delusion, no distraction.

152
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,280
I see.

153
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,040
The Dark Forest can trigger people's delusion,

154
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,680
so one must break it to get out of there.

155
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,600
Senior

156
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,760
Senior

157
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,360
Senior

158
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,320
Wake up!

159
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,440
It's all your delusion

160
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,840
whatever you have seen.

161
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,440
We're in the Dark Forest.

162
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,720
Let's take a look there, Senior.

163
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,720
Shall we?

164
00:11:59,320 --> 00:11:59,840
Okay.

165
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,720
How about we live here?

166
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,880
Then we don't need to care about

167
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,600
the stuff on our back.

168
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,680
You're going to fall over the cliff, Senior.

169
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,360
Senior

170
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,240
Wake up.

171
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,840
You're on the edge of the cliff!

172
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,720
We only live once,

173
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,160
so why do you have to chase after those that don't belong to you?

174
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,160
I'm everything to you, right?

175
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,640
Let's go.

176
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,520
Senior

177
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,200
I would like to die

178
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,040
if I could be with her.

179
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,240
Senior

180
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,120
I'm tired.

181
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,440
I know I have no Immortal perception,

182
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,080
but I continue trying.

183
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,240
Over the past two hundred years,

184
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,600
my father has always forced me to be an ordinary person,

185
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,280
having an ordinary life.

186
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,840
But I don't want to give up practicing.

187
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,000
What I didn't understand until today

188
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,840
is one will be happy when he is resigned.

189
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,200
Senior

190
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,800
Do you remember that sentence?

191
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,120
I am the master of my own destiny.

192
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,560
I am the master of my own destiny.

193
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,680
Right.

194
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,440
Let's go meet Lord Shen Guan.

195
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,720
Not only will I beg a test qualification for Hou Chi

196
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,400
but for you.

197
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,360
No.

198
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,200
I have no Immortal perception.

199
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,880
So what?

200
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,720
Everyone needs a dream.

201
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,800
Senior

202
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,600
Shi Xia, I...

203
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,520
What happened to me just now?

204
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,480
You were hallucinating.

205
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,520
Now I see

206
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,880
why the Dark Forest is dangerous.

207
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,560
People will be trapped in delusion.

208
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,920
As people always say, it's hard to get rid of delusion.

209
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,040
One will be tortured to death by it.

210
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,600
Delusion?

211
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,400
My delusion?

212
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,360
Shi Xia

213
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,680
Shi Xia

214
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,720
Shi Xia

215
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,880
Shi Xia

216
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,440
How are you feeling, Chi?

217
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,560
What's happening to me?

218
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,400
You were drunk in the Great Hotel.

219
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,640
We used Enchantments and normal ways to wake you up but failed.

220
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,320
What happened?

221
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,240
The test of Immortals Alliance.

222
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,640
Stop.

223
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,880
You have missed the test of the head of the Alliance.

224
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,960
All your efforts in the past two hundred years are in vain.

225
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,760
I'm guilty.

226
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,640
I'll take your punishment, Master.

227
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,240
What's done is done.

228
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,960
I have no more words.

229
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,800
We have to make a new plan.

230
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,840
It's not right. Watch this.

231
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,600
Why are there three people?

232
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,560
Which one is Lord Shen Guan?

233
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,800
I think no one looks like the Lord.

234
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,720
Lord Shen Guan should be

235
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,480
an old leader of all the immortals.

236
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,440
They're too young.

237
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,480
Let's go.

238
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,720
I'll take that.

239
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,480
I win.

240
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,600
No. You cheated!

241
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,480
Never mind.

242
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,600
A bet is a bet.

243
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,400
Since I'm the winner,

244
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,720
It's my call today.

245
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,400
I see.

246
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,760
They're the doppelganger of Lord Shen Guan.

247
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,680
You two, come here.

248
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,000
Nice to meet you, Lord Shen Guan.

249
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,360
Do you come here for the test of the head of the Alliance?

250
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,160
You're right.

251
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,760
We're here to beg you for a retake

252
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,840
for Hou Chi from Yuhua Sect.

253
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,160
Lord Shen Guan

254
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,160
I'm Bi Hong from Yuhua Sect.

255
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,800
I beg you for a retake for him.

256
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,520
Shi Xia

257
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,800
It's said Devil Lord was disqualified from the test.

258
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,240
Right.

259
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,280
Fine.

260
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,240
I can give Devil Lord another chance.

261
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,360
What about Hou Chi?

262
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,840
He can run for the next head of the Alliance,

263
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,880
if there will be another test.

264
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,240
That's unfair.

265
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,480
Shi Xia

266
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,360
Unfair?

267
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,600
It's just the chance for a retake.

268
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,080
I can give it to

269
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,120
whoever I like.

270
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,400
Shi Xia

271
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,200
Is Shen Guan can be arbitrary?

272
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,200
Of course.

273
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,400
That's Shen Guan's authority.

274
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,480
If so,

275
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,200
why don't you give Devil Lord and Hou Chi

276
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,640
the chances respectively?

277
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,680
Hou Chi, Hou Chi

278
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,960
I'm tired of hearing that name.

279
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,680
Well,

280
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,040
take a message for me.

281
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,000
I'll summon Devil Lord.

282
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,400
I tell you something.

283
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,120
Lord Shen Guan never leaves the temple.

284
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,520
Do you want to see Devil Lord?

285
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,200
You can do it yourself.

286
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,720
Why do you have to ask people for help?

287
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,600
By the way, I'll do it for you

288
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,840
if you can't leave here.

289
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,760
But you have to give me a little tip

290
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,000
according to the custom in our hometown.

291
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,800
Am I clear?

292
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,680
You dare to bargain with me.

293
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,520
You've got some nerve, little girl.

294
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,200
Shi Xia

295
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,280
Lord Shen Guan

296
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,760
Shi

297
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,160
I guess no one has stepped into

298
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,920
the Wuwang Temple over the past millennia.

299
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,920
And you can't get out of there.

300
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,800
Right?

301
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,320
You have to play pai gow yourself,

302
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,000
so you must be bored.

303
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,640
I underestimated you.

304
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,840
You just want to ask the chance

305
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,000
for a retake for Hou Chi, right?

306
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,560
I promise you.

307
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,000
Well, Shen Guan,

308
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,200
I want to beg another retake for Bi Hong.

309
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,200
Shi Xia

310
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,200
How greedy you are.

311
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,440
It is not easy for me to see an immortal,

312
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,400
so I have too many wishes.

313
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,160
My bad.

314
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,800
All right.

315
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,720
I promise you.

316
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,040
Thank you so much, Lord Shen Guan.

317
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,120
Devil Lord

318
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,200
I'll go with you

319
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,080
if you decide to get into there alone.

320
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,200
Qi Lingling

321
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,000
Yes, sir.

322
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,200
Take care of Immortal Aunt.

323
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:18,920
Husppy

324
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,160
Let's go get Shi Xia.

325
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:21,640
Okay.

326
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,280
Let's go.

327
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,400
Devil Lord

328
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,520
It's you.

329
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,440
Yeah, it's me.

330
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:37,920
Well...

331
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,120
Are you all right?

332
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,280
I'm all right.

333
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,720
You're not hurt, are you?

334
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,600
I'm fine.

335
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,160
It's said one will lose an important stuff

336
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,560
after getting into the Dark Forest,

337
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,200
but Bi Hong and I lost nothing.

338
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,000
Look.

339
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,600
I've told you,

340
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,160
I'm the hero, so my halo can protect you.

341
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,200
Hero

342
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,040
You got another halo.

343
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,360
Lord Shen Guan wants to see you.

344
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,840
Me?

345
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,080
Really?

346
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,600
Do you want to see me?

347
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,840
Are you...

348
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,760
Devil Lord?

349
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,600
(What a surprise.)

350
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,840
(I can get such a benefit as a hero.)

351
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,000
What are you doing there, Lord Shen Guan?

352
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,000
You can't spoon with the candidate

353
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,920
with your identity.

354
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,080
Shut up.

355
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,640
Don't stop.

356
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,080
You don't have it.

357
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,560
I do.

358
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,880
I do have everything I have.

359
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,480
You don't have Immortal perception.

360
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,320
Immortal perception?

361
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,360
I don't have it.

362
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,880
You summoned me for Immortal perception?

363
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,080
(Immortal perception should be passed down from generation to generation,)

364
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,960
(but why Devil Lord gets no Immortal perception?)

365
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,000
(The Holy Garment responded,)

366
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,360
(so the Fifth Senior has descendants.)

367
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,400
(The real Devil Lord must hide in Devil Sect.)

368
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,960
Lord Shen Guan

369
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,200
You promised me.

370
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:15,920
Right.

371
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,360
What did she promise?

372
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,080
Go,

373
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,400
take my order.

374
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,880
Two millennia ago.

375
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,000
The Otherworld Array is ready.

376
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,320
We're going to trigger it tomorrow,

377
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,120
then the world will be peaceful.

378
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,000
The stars and moon won't be upside down,

379
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,160
and the time will be back to normal.

380
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,840
Shi Ji

381
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,640
You must guard the array for 72 hours

382
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,320
after we get into it.

383
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,720
You can never leave there.

384
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,800
Got it.

385
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,800
I'll guard it until you come back.

386
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,880
I mean

387
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,040
you must protect it

388
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,240
whether we can come back from the array.

389
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,040
Bad news.

390
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,360
The Fifth Senior left a letter and went away.

391
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,240
He fled from the battle.

392
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,400
What are we going to do about that?

393
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,040
I'm going to

394
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,240
take Qiu Boyan back.

395
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,200
It's too late.

396
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,360
I devoted myself to the array.

397
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,280
I only have three days left.

398
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,160
Senior

399
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,360
It's time.

400
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:13,800
Get into the array.

401
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,800
Fifth Senior

402
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,640
Finally, your Devil Sect have emerged.

403
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,240
This time,

404
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,880
I'll find the selected Immortal perception

405
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,160
to stabilize the Otherworld Array.

406
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,840
It has been two thousand years.

407
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,480
I have protected it for bimillennium.

408
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,280
Finally, the day is coming.
