00:01:23,944 --> 00:01:29,778
My Dear Brothers
EP34

2
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,160
Lord Shen Guan.

3
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,440
Bi Hong.

4
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,520
It's Heaven's will to have made you the head of the Alliance.

5
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,840
So please get into the array as early as possible

6
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,280
and live up to your duty as a guard.

7
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,680
Yes, I will,

8
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,160
My Lord

9
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,000
Bi Hong just ascended to the head.

10
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,000
I want to enter the array with him

11
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,520
to help him fulfill his destiny.

12
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,680
You have my permission.

13
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,320
My honor, Lord Shen Guan.

14
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,520
It's going to end, finally.

15
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,640
Is my holy power

16
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,240
too weak to protect the ward?

17
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,560
You are not allowed to get here.

18
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,000
Leave here now.

19
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,440
Go.

20
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,040
Tell me

21
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,920
where Yuan Zhao and Bi Hong are.

22
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,440
It's none of your business.

23
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,280
Take your people with you and leave.

24
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,200
Or I will go to fight with you.

25
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,640
Go get her.

26
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,360
Oh no, I've been strengthening the array these days.

27
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,280
I didn't know it would consume so much of my power.

28
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,760
I'm afraid I can't make it this time.

29
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,440
Lord Shen Guan,

30
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,200
I didn't know you are so weak.

31
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,160
I'm afraid I can't show you my mercy this time.

32
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,440
The seal of the head of the Alliance

33
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,000
is the key to the array.

34
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,000
It's okay.

35
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,720
I'll stay with you

36
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,960
until you finish the sacrifice.

37
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,760
Yue.

38
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,120
How did you get in here?

39
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,760
Shen Guan was nothing but weak.

40
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,160
I just had her on the run.

41
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,080
You two

42
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,720
are easily reconciled.

43
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,680
What about me?

44
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,440
Yuan Zhao

45
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,000
Right in the beginning,

46
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,520
you've made up your mind to choose him over me.

47
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,520
You went all out for him.

48
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,160
What about me then?

49
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,320
In your heart,

50
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,760
I never deserve your love.

51
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,600
Did I do anything wrong

52
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,320
so that you could treat me like that?

53
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,120
Yue.

54
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,840
I'm the one who messed things up.

55
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,200
I'm the one who failed to be a good father.

56
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,560
But you can't stop the sacrifice.

57
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,400
Or the Otherworld see upheavals and massive destruction.

58
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,680
You won't survive, either.

59
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,920
The only thing I can do for you right now,

60
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,240
is to bring the peaceful world back.

61
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,640
Yes, Yue.

62
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,440
We just want to protect you.

63
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,320
Hypocrites! All of you!

64
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,200
I grew up

65
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,200
in suffering

66
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,600
and torture.

67
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,280
I was alone.

68
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,160
Now you remember there is a daughter? Too late.

69
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,800
I am the one who can decide my life.

70
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:43,880
Father.

71
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,920
If you walk one more step,

72
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,320
this seal will be gone.

73
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,120
From today on,

74
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,840
you will be prisoned here.

75
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,120
Keep your eyes on them.

76
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,800
Yue.

77
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,520
There is no time left for the array.

78
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,400
If we don't do the sacrifice right now,

79
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,160
the Immortals World is be destroyed.

80
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,360
If I can't have Bi Hong's Immortal perception,

81
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,560
I will find thousands of its substitutes.

82
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,240
Other people's life

83
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,200
is not my concern.

84
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,280
But this time,

85
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,400
don't even think about shaking me off.

86
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,240
Yue.

87
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,480
Immortal Aunt

88
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,600
I have captured over a hundred of Immortal apprentices.

89
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,680
What do you want to do with them?

90
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,960
Very well.

91
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,120
Take ten of them to the sacrifice every day.

92
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,640
If they are not enough,

93
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,800
take more.

94
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,960
And continue your capture in all the sects.

95
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,080
Yes, Immortal Aunt.

96
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,240
Another thing.

97
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,600
Send letters to the Yuhua Sect.

98
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,120
Tell them if they don't give the Devil Lord to me,

99
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,840
I'll sacrifice all their apprentices.

100
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,000
Yes.

101
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,160
Brother

102
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,880
all I need is you now.

103
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,360
Then we can reunite in a family.

104
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,360
It's ridiculous.

105
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,600
Bi Hong took the place,

106
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,080
but he didn't fulfill his duty.

107
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,080
Instead, he colluded with the evil woman

108
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,400
and kidnapped their father.

109
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,080
He is doing harm to our fellows.

110
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,960
Now he wants you to be the hostage.

111
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,320
Do they really think

112
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,680
we will give them what they want?

113
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,160
They are insane.

114
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,520
I don't fear them.

115
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,400
Just cut it off.

116
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,920
Stop bluffing, please.

117
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,360
You know

118
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,240
what kind of situation you are in?

119
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,920
Yuan Zhao is prisoned.

120
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,440
Hou Chi is of no use now.

121
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,840
As to your Holy Beasts,

122
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:04,800
when they get into the Celestial Palace,

123
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,400
they will be roasted by Qiu Li.

124
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,680
Now that they are coming for me,

125
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,760
I shall be the one to settle it.

126
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,640
I didn't see that coming.

127
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,400
It turns out the Devil Lord is a righteous man.

128
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,880
Then I, on behalf of the Yuhua Sect,

129
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,920
extend our gratitude to you.

130
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,960
Wait.

131
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,320
This must stay as a secret

132
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,520
to my sister and her husband.

133
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,240
She just got married.

134
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,320
I don't want to ruin it.

135
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,080
I already knew.

136
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,040
Even if Immortal Aunt keep to her promise,

137
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:45,880
you can only save

138
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,960
the rest few apprentices of the Sect.

139
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,440
What about the others?

140
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,360
She will take more people to the sacrifice.

141
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,280
Why not let me come with you?

142
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,560
You?

143
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,000
Come on.

144
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,000
Say, if you are fully recovered,

145
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,960
what cards have you got in your hands?

146
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,360
Qiu Li and Bi Hong are invincible right now.

147
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,000
And you have no chance to win.

148
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,040
And

149
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,360
what about my sister if you come with me?

150
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,680
Can you stand seeing her

151
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,600
lay in fear and tears all day?

152
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,480
Now,

153
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,000
the most important thing for you

154
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,120
is to keep my sister safe.

155
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,000
Do not betray my trust.

156
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,200
I'll take care of the rest.

157
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,200
Hou Chi.

158
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,760
I know what you are worrying about.

159
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,120
Rest reassured.

160
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,240
I will head off to the Celestial Palace with the Devil Lord.

161
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,840
And you stay here, safe and sound.

162
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,960
Brother is like father.

163
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,400
You must listen to me.

164
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,040
Can you stand seeing her

165
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,000
lay in fear and tears all day?

166
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,240
Hou Chi.

167
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,360
There are too many flowers on the tree.

168
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,640
They are weighing the branches down.

169
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,680
I got to pick some to lessen its burden.

170
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,080
You are this tree, anyway.

171
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,480
I need to take good care of it,

172
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,280
and make nectar into wine.

173
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,240
I...

174
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,240
Don't move.

175
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,960
What's wrong with you?

176
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,640
I guess it's the heavy flowers.

177
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,640
that make me tired.

178
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,760
Let's get some rest.

179
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,360
We can do it in the day?

180
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,800
What are you talking about!

181
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,880
Aren't you tired?

182
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,520
Why are you staring?

183
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,520
I want to see you.

184
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,040
What's special about me?

185
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,360
Now you can see me every day.

186
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,920
You'll get bored of it.

187
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,160
No.

188
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,360
Never.

189
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,640
He seems weird.

190
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,960
Turn around.

191
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,480
I want to see you.

192
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,400
I know a trick that can help you fall asleep.

193
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,840
Wanna give it a try?

194
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,680
But first, you have to turn around.

195
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,120
Every time I went to the hairdresser's,

196
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,320
I felt sleepy

197
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,240
when they dried my hair.

198
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,040
I guess it's the same as

199
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,680
when you pet a dog.

200
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,040
Father.

201
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,440
You've overstretched yourself

202
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,240
for rescuing the apprentices.

203
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,160
Let me help you.

204
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,640
No.

205
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,320
You still have your mission.

206
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,640
We can't afford any slip.

207
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,880
Don't worry. I am good.

208
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:18,880
One more.

209
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,360
Shi Xia.

210
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,480
I am good at it, right?

211
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,880
When did you fix it?

212
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,960
The moment

213
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,680
I found it was broken.

214
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,120
Hou Chi.

215
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,200
I miss Senior Hong Bi.

216
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,240
What about going to the palace to see him?

217
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,120
I've known everything I need to know.

218
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,400
If there was no sacrifice,

219
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,360
I would be the one who took everything away from him.

220
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,160
I always thought

221
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,240
he had a free life.

222
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,560
But I never noticed that

223
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,880
he was unknowingly changing.

224
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,360
I should be responsible

225
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,760
for what has happened to him.

226
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,800
Don't say that.

227
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,280
You did so to save me.

228
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,600
I should be responsible for him too.

229
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,440
What's done is done.

230
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,280
Regret and self-blame won't help.

231
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,560
You have to move on.

232
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,400
I know you never let go of the burden,

233
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,280
just as the Holy Tree covered with fully blossomed flowers.

234
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,560
You were born with those responsibilities.

235
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,200
You care about Bi Hong,

236
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,120
and you care about the Immortals World, too.

237
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,440
You lost your Immortal perception,

238
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,560
but you still want to safeguard your fellow members.

239
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,240
It's a matter of life and death of all of us.

240
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,160
I know you won't sit idle and do nothing.

241
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,200
I won't be a drag.

242
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,960
You don't blame me?

243
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,520
Of course not.

244
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,800
This is exactly

245
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,880
what I love about you.

246
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,560
I'm proud that I am married to you.

247
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,680
Wherever you go,

248
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,720
I will follow you.

249
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,840
No, it's too dangerous.

250
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,520
Just stay here and wait for me to come back.

251
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,320
You want me to stay here,

252
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,600
then all I will do is worry about you and Shi Dong.

253
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,720
I respect you have your ambition.

254
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,480
But can you

255
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,400
let me protect my family and the one I love?

256
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,400
Hou Chi

257
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,640
You didn't listen to my words, right?

258
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,120
I told you not to get embroiled.

259
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,040
And you?

260
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,920
You are even taking my sister with you?

261
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,800
Don't you know that Qiu Li never likes Shi Xia?

262
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,840
Your going

263
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,320
will only cause troubles.

264
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,040
Brother...

265
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,080
Let me finish.

266
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,960
I know you don't want me to go alone.

267
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,760
I know that.

268
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,320
But Shi Xia,

269
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,280
you have no power.

270
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,240
There's not much you can do.

271
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,600
I don't think it's a good idea for you to go.

272
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:34,840
And you,

273
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,560
you are at best a Groot.

274
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,000
You are not as strong as before.

275
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,760
Even if you go, you won't be of much help.

276
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,240
So, why don't you just listen to me?

277
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,120
Go back home

278
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,440
and continue your happy life.

279
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,000
Welcome me when I return in triumph,

280
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,920
all of you.

281
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,000
That's the deal.

282
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,040
Are you done?

283
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,200
Yeah.

284
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,280
Ok, now I'm going to speak.

285
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,880
First of all, we don't really care

286
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,520
if you are going to the Palace and see Qiu Li.

287
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,040
Our plan to get into the Town,

288
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,720
is to save senior Bi Hong and his father.

289
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,760
Don't flatter yourself.

290
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,120
Yeah.

291
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,880
I just want to rescue my master.

292
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,080
It has nothing to do with you.

293
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,560
Well, well, well.

294
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,760
You still remember your wedding vows?

295
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,120
A few days ago,

296
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,280
you pledged that you would respect her brother, still remember?

297
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,760
We are in.

298
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,200
You are here!

299
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,240
You guys are not helping.

300
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,360
They can't go. And you two, either.

301
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,120
I'm concerned about Shi Xia.

302
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,480
She is the only one I'm close to, after all.

303
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,080
I want to help Hou Chi.

304
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,720
Brother, you have so many new friends.

305
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,840
No wonder you don't want Qiu Li.

306
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,000
Qiu Li

307
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,520
You promised to release them

308
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,360
if I get back.

309
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,680
Now here I am.

310
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,280
I will do anything you want.

311
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,920
Just let other people go.

312
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,040
You are all I want.

313
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,880
If you come with me,

314
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,040
they can get in and save them.

315
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,320
But if you don't,

316
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,080
everyone in there,

317
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,120
will die for the sacrifice.

318
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,640
Don't, please.

319
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,680
I'll come with you.

320
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,680
Don't worry.

321
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,680
She won't hurt Shi Dong.

322
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,560
Let's save the apprentices first.

323
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,320
Something's wrong.

324
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,760
Immortal Aunt doesn't do like this.

325
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,720
That's too easy.

326
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,880
Whatever, we don't have time now.

327
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,600
Master, Qing Feng, Yi Yaogua,

328
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,960
let's get them out.

329
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:15,840
Ok.

330
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,920
I'll go with you.

331
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,840
Then you must follow closely.

332
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,680
I'm sorry, Qiu Li.

333
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,640
I was kind of angry that day.

334
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,920
I shouldn't have said that.

335
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,480
Don't take it seriously.

336
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,000
I won't, dear brother.

337
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,360
Though I wasn't around,

338
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,560
but I think about you all the time.

339
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,480
How did you care about me?

340
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,760
I remember you fear thunder the most.

341
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,640
I was concerned of you

342
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,080
when storms came.

343
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,600
I wish I could get back to you immediately.

344
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,440
But I know no enchantments.

345
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,720
I am not the one fearing thunder,

346
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,600
she is.

347
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,840
She is you, isn't she?

348
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:30,760
Qiu Li

349
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,000
At the moment I met you in that thunderstorm,

350
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,880
I've decided to protect you.

351
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,840
If what you said

352
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,200
is what you think,

353
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,200
that would be great.

354
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,680
Brother, look at this.

355
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,760
Why do you have the seal of the head of the Alliance?

356
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,080
It's not merely a seal,

357
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,520
it's the key to activate the array.

358
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,280
Destroy it,

359
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,480
then the array will be gone.

360
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,240
It means

361
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,960
we have the whole Immortal World

362
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,560
in our hands now.

363
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,240
Now that you are back,

364
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,440
I will give it to you.

365
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,880
Then you will be the only head in the Immortal World.

366
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,760
Do you like it,

367
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,320
dear brother?

368
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,640
Of course I like it.

369
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,880
I must manage to get it back.

370
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,520
Qiu Li

371
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,640
It is said that the seal can foresee the future.

372
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,400
I want to see

373
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,440
how powerful I am after becoming the head.

374
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,160
So, can I touch it?

375
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,200
Yes, of course.

376
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,160
It belongs to you.

377
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,280
Since you insist on

378
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,400
going for death with them,

379
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,680
I will give you what you want.

380
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,560
Master, I'm sorry that I'm late.

381
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,560
Why are you here?

382
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,320
We come here to save you.

383
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,600
You still decide to save me

384
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,960
even after what I did?

385
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,320
It is just water under the bridge.

386
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,720
Senior

387
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,280
I've always seen you as my confidant.

388
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,880
I won't stand by

389
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,440
if you are in troubles.

390
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,280
Father

391
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,240
How could master's cultivation

392
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,480
be so massively depleted?

393
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,120
It was Qiu Li.

394
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,320
She sent the apprentices

395
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,480
to the sacrifice every day.

396
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,440
Father tried his best to save them back.

397
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,400
We thought wrong of Master Yuan before.

398
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,320
We will never forget what you've done for us.

399
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,680
Master, let's get out of here first.

400
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,760
We'll find a safe shelter and heal your wounds.

401
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,960
Hou Chi, take everyone with you and leave.

402
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,480
Bi Hong and I must stay.

403
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,320
The array is reaching its limit.

404
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,720
But the seal is still in Qiu Li's hands.

405
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,560
We must find it

406
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,080
and finish the sacrifice.

407
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,840
That's why she didn't seem perturbed at all.

408
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,360
She has the seal.

409
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,280
Master, take the apprentices to leave with you.

410
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,600
I'll stay with the master.

411
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,320
Me too.

412
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,520
No.

413
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,440
It is our duty to guard the array.

414
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,400
Not yours.

415
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,520
Chi.

416
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,600
I've owed you too much.

417
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,360
I can't get you and Shi Xia into this.

418
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,320
No, Bi Hong and I have long been bound together.

419
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,760
If it is your responsibility,

420
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,040
then it's mine too.

421
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,480
I won't leave.

422
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,960
Then it's mine, too

423
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,080
I am willing to stay and help.

424
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:10,920
We are not leaving, too.

425
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,400
Yeah, we are not going.

426
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,120
Dear fellow members,

427
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,600
safeguarding the Immortal World

428
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,240
is an obligation that all of us must undertake.

429
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,440
We will stay

430
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,920
to protect the array.

431
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,000
I am grateful that you all want to stay.

432
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,320
But if we all perish in this place,

433
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,240
that would give what Qiu Li wants.

434
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,680
So, I earnestly ask all of you

435
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,720
to leave here.

436
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,760
It will also help if you contribute outside the array.

437
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,080
Master Hou Chi made a point.

438
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,800
Then we are counting on you.

439
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,000
And we will stay outside the palace.

440
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,640
Senior Yuan Ye, lead everyone out.

441
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,320
Let's go.

442
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,000
I'm back.

443
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,400
The seal is in my hands.

444
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,520
Sure enough.

445
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,360
You definitely know how to deal with her.

446
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,680
I traded half of my life for that.

447
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,480
It is

448
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:34,840
fake.

449
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,760
What?

450
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,200
Dear brother,

451
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,200
do you enjoy this game?

452
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,680
Do you like it?

453
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,120
You lied to me, again.

454
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,240
It's you that is lying to me all the time.

455
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,800
I love you with all my heart.

456
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,600
But you?

457
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,000
You are just like them.

458
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,920
You just want to abandon me.

459
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,640
Since we can't all live,

460
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,200
let's die together.

461
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:30,880
Yue
