My Dear Brothers
EP25

2
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,400
Welcome back, The owner.

3
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,120
Congratulations, Master Hou Chi,
the head of Immortals Alliance.

4
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,880
The owner.

5
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,240
As soon as I got your message,

6
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,280
I sent some apprentices to go down the hill

7
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,400
to look for Junior Yuan Gui.

8
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,440
Unfortunately,

9
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,120
we've had no word.

10
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,720
Send more people to find him.

11
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,280
Got it.

12
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,800
It has been confirmed that

13
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,920
Shi Xia is not the spy for Devil Sect.

14
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,560
Lin Kui, the real spy, has been caught.

15
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,200
Shi Xia didn't do anything

16
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,880
to hurt Yuhua Sect,

17
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,200
but helped Hou Chi a lot

18
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,960
in running for head of Immortals Alliance.

19
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,480
Given this,

20
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,960
I decide to reinstate Shi Xia as an apprentice of Yuhua Sect.

21
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,560
Senior Yuan Ye.

22
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,840
From this day forward,

23
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,400
Yuhua Sect lifts the ban on women,

24
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,120
so Shi Xia can go wherever she wants.

25
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,200
Got it.

26
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,160
The head of Immortals Alliance's inauguration

27
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,360
will be held in 15 days

28
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,760
in The Otherworld Town.

29
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,960
Get everything ready, Senior Yuan Ye.

30
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,720
It must be perfect.

31
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,160
Got it.

32
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,360
Holy Tree revived,

33
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,000
and it's in leaf.

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,360
There are the familiar Holy Tree,

35
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,440
courtyard,

36
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,800
breeze,

37
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,760
the babble of running water,

38
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,400
and

39
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,600
Hou Chi.

40
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,960
Welcome home.

41
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:54,840
I'm done with my soup.

42
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,280
All right, I'm full.

43
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,120
You used to love the meals I made,

44
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,040
but you took a little this time.

45
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,280
Everything tastes like sawdust to me,

46
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,880
so it's enough for me to fill my stomach.

47
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,120
You've been experiencing a loss of appetite

48
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,360
since you couldn't taste anymore,

49
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,120
and your cheeks are sunken now.

50
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,680
Because of me,

51
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,280
you lost your taste.

52
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:32,840
Really?

53
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,960
Is my face smaller than before? Good news.

54
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,760
I failed to lose weight before.

55
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,920
Now,

56
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,040
I don't need to do it anymore.

57
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:44,960
But I love

58
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,000
your chubby cheeks.

59
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,800
And you

60
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,680
look pale now.

61
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,120
Don't worry.

62
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,480
I can cover it with makeup.

63
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,080
Makeup?

64
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,560
Why do you always follow me?

65
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,280
Why do you always go to Shi Xia?

66
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,520
Shi Xia is my friend.

67
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,680
Is there something wrong with that?

68
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,920
There is no pure relationship

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,400
between a man and a woman.

70
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,160
What's more,

71
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,560
Shi Xia is Master Hou Chi's girlfriend,

72
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,520
so you should keep distance with her.

73
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,720
None of your business.

74
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,760
Master Hou Chi's concerns are my concerns,

75
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,920
so I have to keep an eye on you for him.

76
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,720
I could get you guys back from the abyss

77
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,040
in case you were out of control

78
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,320
and crossed the moral line.

79
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,440
I am done with you.

80
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,400
Master Bi Hong

81
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,640
This one as friend, and the other as confidant,

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
are enough for playing mahjong.

83
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,040
Actually, I'm not good at makeup.

84
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,680
And I don't know how to use

85
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,880
those outdated cosmetics.

86
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,480
Well, let me try.

87
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,280
You?

88
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,120
Nothing is difficult for me

89
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,120
in this world.

90
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,720
I'm curious to know

91
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,960
how good is Hou Chi

92
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,360
at makeup.

93
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:22,920
Come on.

94
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,920
I'm done.

95
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,480
Have you ever put some makeup on my face?

96
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,280
Why I think

97
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,840
there's no difference?

98
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,160
I always think

99
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,480
you're pretty without makeup.

100
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,960
You said some cheesy pick-up lines!

101
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,160
Where did you learn it?

102
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,840
(Didn't she like it?)

103
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,760
Bad boy.

104
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,560
You're alluring with a lovely red face

105
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,320
after getting Cotton Candy.

106
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,640
Let me cool you down.

107
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,840
Wait for me, you guys.

108
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,800
Are we interrupting something?

109
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,960
You're right on time, Qing Feng.

110
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,920
We're talking about rouge.

111
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,920
Come and see it.

112
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,680
Okay.

113
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,720
Shi Xia is Master Hou Chi's girlfriend,

114
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,120
so she makes herself up for him.

115
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,280
What is the point if you helped her pick out the rouge?

116
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,160
I think you look good now.

117
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,320
Am I right, Master Hou Chi?

118
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,800
Which kind of rouge did you put on your face?

119
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,720
It's...

120
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,440
This one.

121
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,120
It's said

122
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,120
it will be harmful to the skin

123
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,440
if one often uses the rouge.

124
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,520
The natural way you wear makeup is good.

125
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,480
Good.

126
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,680
That's the prescription of Pain Potion.

127
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,560
I'll leave it here.

128
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,160
I'm going to meet friends for a drink, bye.

129
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,720
Sorry to bother you.

130
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,640
You used to praise me

131
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,480
when I played the instrument, Immortal Venerable.

132
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,320
Was it bad today?

133
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,360
Or did I do something wrong?

134
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,680
It's not your fault.

135
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,440
I should be blamed.

136
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,280
We're your friends, Immortal Venerable.

137
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,560
We can help you out.

138
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,880
Friends?

139
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,720
I thought

140
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,240
the friendship

141
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,960
was the safest and the most stable one in this world.

142
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,520
But now I know

143
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,040
the friendship

144
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,720
is the most ridiculous one

145
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,080
in this world.

146
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,640
Blue hydrangea means treachery,

147
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,120
but the pink one eternity.

148
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,000
You replaced the treachery with eternity.

149
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,280
Everything changes,

150
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,880
let alone a relationship.

151
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,400
Nothing lasts forever.

152
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,000
Shi Xia

153
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,720
The leaves on my hydrangea had shriveled up.

154
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,800
I need help.

155
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,160
Senior

156
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,280
Shi Xia

157
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,600
What happened?

158
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,280
I spilled some liquor

159
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,000
over it.

160
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:25,960
Liquor?

161
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,640
You were so careless.

162
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,480
Now its root is still alive.

163
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,320
Let's move it from the flowerpot.

164
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,480
Okay.

165
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,360
Be careful.

166
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,520
All right.

167
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,200
Just be careful with that.

168
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,880
Thank you.

169
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,520
You had been with Hou Chi

170
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,720
since you came back to Yuhua Sect.

171
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,600
It's the first time you've been here these days.

172
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,080
I didn't realize

173
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,320
I was always in his courtyard

174
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,520
until you said that.

175
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,280
I've been meaning to ask,

176
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,920
why do you like my Junior?

177
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,160
Why do you like prying now?

178
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:29,960
I...

179
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,160
Hou Chi is innocent,

180
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,920
like a teenager.

181
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,240
I worry about you.

182
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,640
I'm afraid you fell in love with him on a whim,

183
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,160
but make him heartbroken later.

184
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,960
I'm not you.

185
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,000
I won't mess around,

186
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,440
and I'm committed to Hou Chi.

187
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,480
Nothing going to change my love for him.

188
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,520
Well, you can tell me

189
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,280
when did you fall in love with him?

190
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,560
I...

191
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,960
There was a period

192
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,760
when he always inexplicably showed up.

193
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,600
Each time I tried to keep my distance from him,

194
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,520
he would get close to me.

195
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,520
He always gave me

196
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,200
the gifts that I disliked.

197
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,720
Gradually,

198
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,320
My thoughts were all of him.

199
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,480
I can't get him out of my head.

200
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,000
Maybe

201
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,040
that was the time.

202
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,760
(If I had been brave,)

203
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,520
(I could have had a chance.)

204
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,680
Perhaps that is so-called

205
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,600
"different words from what I did".

206
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,200
All right.

207
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,960
The flower will revive soon.

208
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,440
It's getting late,

209
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,360
so I have to go.

210
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,120
Senior

211
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,560
Senior

212
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,120
Junior

213
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,600
Why did you sleep down here?

214
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,680
I slept here after getting drunk.

215
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,120
So, what are you doing here?

216
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,720
My heart disease got worse.

217
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,960
I told you,

218
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,920
it would trigger Evil Aura,

219
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,440
if you experienced intense mood swings.

220
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,400
The more you love Shi Xia,

221
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,840
the more pain you suffer.

222
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,000
Shi Xia has become

223
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,600
your Love Calamity.

224
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,600
Did you find a way

225
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,840
to handle Evil Aura?

226
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,160
Love Calamity sprang from love,

227
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,400
so it's incurable.

228
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,680
But it wouldn't be triggered

229
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,360
if you didn't love anyone else.

230
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,400
No.

231
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,080
Nothing can change my love for Shi Xia.

232
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,920
Then I can't help you.

233
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,600
There are Pain Potion

234
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,080
and my force,

235
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,640
so we may control Evil Aura.

236
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,680
No way.

237
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,680
You're immersing yourself in your love,

238
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,960
so you will die of heart failure someday.

239
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,320
Junior

240
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,720
You're going to be the head of the Alliance,

241
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,840
so you can't...

242
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,480
No.

243
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,160
Everyone can be the head of the Alliance,

244
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,800
but Shi Xia is my everything.

245
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,680
I'll explain myself to Lord Shen Guan

246
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,760
and let her choose another candidate.

247
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,440
All right, all right.

248
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,560
Even if you can give up becoming the head of the Alliance,

249
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,560
how long will you be together?

250
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,760
Have you ever thought

251
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,680
Shi Xia would be sad all her life

252
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,760
if you died?

253
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,560
I will last out

254
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,560
until I send her home.

255
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,640
Do you think she would forget you

256
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,720
if she went back home?

257
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,200
I've made up my mind,

258
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,240
so keep my secrets, please.

259
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:47,960
(No.)

260
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,360
(I can't keep watching him die)

261
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,640
(or break Shi Xia's heart.)

262
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,800
Master

263
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,480
Chi

264
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,560
How are you feeling now?

265
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,560
Don't worry about it.

266
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,720
I feel better now.

267
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,160
Usually, we get a winner

268
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,760
after one hundred rounds,

269
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,360
but you can't

270
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,040
catch even one hit from me.

271
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,280
How dare you say you're better.

272
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,800
I didn't tell you the truth

273
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,400
because I don't want you to worry about me.

274
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,080
It's all my fault.

275
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,560
I'm a bit out of practice, making a slow recovery.

276
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,440
I know it.

277
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,800
Your disease is special,

278
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,080
It's Evil Aura.

279
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,120
It's Shi Xia

280
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,640
who made you sicker.

281
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,920
It's not Shi Xia's fault, Master.

282
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,840
The Evil Aura must be controlled

283
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,360
if I practice frequently.

284
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,640
At this point,

285
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,800
you're still protecting her.

286
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,160
Chi

287
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,080
She is like a sword hanging over your head.

288
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,800
You could die at any moment.

289
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,080
This is the end.

290
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,120
I have to expel her from Yuhua Sect.

291
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,040
Master

292
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,200
No.

293
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,560
Get out of my way.

294
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,080
Master

295
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,560
Listen to me, please.

296
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,520
Growing up in Yuhua Sect,

297
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,680
I don't know who my parents are

298
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,640
and where I come from.

299
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,960
I have lived alone for two hundred years.

300
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,920
There's nothing for me to expect in this world

301
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,400
except being the head of the Alliance.

302
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,400
I didn't know

303
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,160
the meaning of joys and sorrows

304
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,840
till I met Shi Xia.

305
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,520
I discovered the reason for my life.

306
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,920
She is the one

307
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,720
that I must watch over

308
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,760
in this world,

309
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,880
and the one I want to

310
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,280
travel all around the world with.

311
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,640
I'm not satisfied for only being her brother.

312
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,560
I want to spend the rest of my life with her.

313
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,600
So I

314
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,480
will never leave Shi Xia.

315
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,560
I agree with you about being Shi Xia's brother,

316
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,360
because I want you to control your emotions,

317
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,120
being the head of the Alliance without any attachments.

318
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,680
I didn't expect

319
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,160
your crush would grow even stronger.

320
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,120
Chi

321
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,160
Don't forget your great responsibility.

322
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,080
Will you

323
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,120
put aside the pride of the sect

324
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,040
and give up your life

325
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,040
for such a girl?

326
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,640
Shi Xia is more important

327
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,400
than the pride.

328
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,480
Nothing matters more than her.

329
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,840
Now I can't carry a burden as the head of the Alliance,

330
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,920
so I'll explain myself to Shen Guan

331
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,560
to quit as the head.

332
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,760
Then Shen Guan can choose another candidate.

333
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,120
Let me ask you something.

334
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,120
Would you like to cut all emotional ties

335
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,920
and leave Shi Xia?

336
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,400
No.

337
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,160
Yes or no?

338
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,040
No.

339
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,560
How is it going?

340
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,080
Evil Aura attacked his heart,

341
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,080
and his blood flowed upward.

342
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,000
Fortunately, you struck his acupoints,

343
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,680
or his blood vessels would went pop,

344
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,040
and he would die of it.

345
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,160
In light of his situation,

346
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,480
he must cut his emotional ties.

347
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,920
I'm going to kill the threat.

348
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,560
You can't do that, dad.

349
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,160
Love Calamity sprang from love.

350
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,480
And he loves Shi Xia so much.

351
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,200
It would make things worse

352
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,400
if he knew you had killed Shi Xia

353
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,200
after waking up.

354
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,720
Now the inauguration is coming,

355
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,560
so the most important thing

356
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,560
is to calm him down,

357
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,840
preventing the situation from progressing further.

358
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,880
Are you sure about this?

359
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,040
Hou Chi is my Junior,

360
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,080
so I don't want him to die.

361
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,240
I will do my best to save him.

362
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,760
Take care of Chi

363
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,520
and keep him away from

364
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,080
that demon girl.

365
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,200
Immortal perception, a unique core,

366
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,440
is the root of the cultivator.

367
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,560
The one who inherited the Immortal perception from its owner

368
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,400
will get the same scar as the owner.

369
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,880
The lineage of Devil Sect I've waited for one thousand years

370
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,840
was born in Yuhua Sect.

371
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,360
The owner Yuan

372
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,560
There must be a reason, right?
