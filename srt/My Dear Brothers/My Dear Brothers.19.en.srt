00:01:23,589 --> 00:01:29,644
My Dear Brothers
EP19

2
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,000
What do you want? Just say it.

3
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,280
If you can kill yourself with this sword,

4
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,520
I'll let Hou Chi go.

5
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,160
Put down the sword.

6
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,320
Don't hurt her.

7
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,800
Though you're one of the devils,

8
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,920
you're passionate and candid by nature.

9
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,880
I believe you won't break your promise.

10
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,160
All the people present are witnesses.

11
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,560
Shi Xia

12
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,480
Shi Xia

13
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,760
Hou Chi

14
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,560
It turned out to be the Holy Power
of the sibling contract.

15
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,840
Are you okay?

16
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,400
I'm fine.

17
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,560
And, I'm glad you're fine.

18
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,600
Shi Xia

19
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,280
Hold on.

20
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,480
Who pulled out the Immortal perception?

21
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,920
Won't you investigate about that, Devil Lord?

22
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,240
I have enough time to do that.

23
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,480
Chi, you forgot what I said

24
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,520
in a blink of an eye, right?

25
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,960
It seemed that Chi has decided Shi Xia
to be his sister.

26
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,680
Fortunately, he still doesn't understand

27
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,360
the differences between a sister and a woman.

28
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,560
Maybe keeping the sibling contract
between them

29
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,880
is not a bad thing.

30
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,320
Forget it.

31
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,640
The election is coming soon.
You should get ready for it.

32
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,360
Don't let Shi Xia's affairs
distract you anymore.

33
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,320
Thank you, my master.

34
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,760
I see.

35
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,760
I'll remember what you told me.

36
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,040
Keep the wound from water.

37
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,040
Did you hear me?

38
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,000
After coming out of the Dark Forest,

39
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,480
did you find anything wrong?

40
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,840
Why do you ask about this?

41
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,680
Bi Hong went blind.

42
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,960
It seems that the legend
of the Dark Forest is true.

43
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,120
Senior, I'm looking for you everywhere.

44
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,360
What's wrong with you?

45
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Why are you looking for me?

46
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,240
After coming back from the Dark Forest,

47
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,840
did you lose anything?

48
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,760
No.

49
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,840
I'm pretty good.

50
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,600
That's good.

51
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,840
I'm relieved, then.

52
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,120
He...

53
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,480
That was my fault...

54
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:08,920
Don't break in.

55
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,120
I'm asking you about that.

56
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:14,960
Me?

57
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,320
I'm okay.

58
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,840
We are not from this world.

59
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,600
By the way,

60
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,720
there's still your Character Shield
getting my back, right?

61
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,480
Don't lie to me.

62
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,440
Take it easy.

63
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:31,800
Well,

64
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,880
there's a man

65
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,600
called Lin Kui, do you know him?

66
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,960
Lin Kui?

67
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,840
No. Why?

68
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,480
That was him who induced me
into the painting today.

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,480
Last time, in the Otherworld Town,

70
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,720
the news that you were kidnapped
was also sent to me by him.

71
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,520
There's a catch in it.

72
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:52,720
Left guard

73
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,240
Yes.

74
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,320
Bring me Lin Kui.

75
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,280
Got it.

76
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,440
Shi Xia

77
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,120
I warn you,

78
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,080
don't run around alone.

79
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,640
Take me with you all the time,

80
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,480
clear?

81
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,400
I get it.

82
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,560
It's a little stuffy in the room,

83
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,760
I'll go for a walk.

84
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,600
Keep the wound from water.

85
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,520
I heard that the son
of the Yuhua Sect's owner went blind.

86
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,160
That was because he went to the Dark Forest. It's really miserable.

87
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,360
Don't miss it when you pass by.

88
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,200
They're all made of good materials.

89
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,280
Have a look when you pass by.

90
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,360
Have a look.

91
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,320
Ladies and gentlemen,

92
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,440
come on and have a look.

93
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,760
Have a look.

94
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,480
Shi Xia

95
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,000
It's amazing.

96
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,720
How do you know it's me?

97
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,680
After I went blind,

98
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,480
the other four senses become sensitive.

99
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,200
Senior

100
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,680
Your eyes...

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,480
Don't apologize.

102
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,560
If you really want to do something for me,

103
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,320
you can be responsible for the rest of my life...

104
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,480
Every milk tea for the rest of my life.

105
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,200
Then let's start with this one.

106
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,480
Senior, I have something else to do.

107
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,000
I gotta go.

108
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,120
Master

109
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,560
It's me.

110
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,800
I prepared a gift for you.

111
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,480
Take it.

112
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,760
What's this?

113
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,240
I made it for you specially.

114
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,960
It's hard for you now.

115
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,520
If you meet something dangerous,

116
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,680
you can tap here to launch spirit arrows.

117
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,160
At least, you can protect yourself.

118
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,480
Prevent those bad guys
from getting close to you.

119
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,840
Thank you, master.

120
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,640
Bi Hong

121
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,680
Being like this,

122
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,640
you should give up the alliance election.

123
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,520
Don't bother.

124
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,840
My qualification for it

125
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,840
was not obtained by Yuhua Sect.

126
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,160
Senior

127
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,800
I...

128
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,880
I've been suppressing these for a long time.

129
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,840
You are really cruel to Bi Hong.

130
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,640
Everyone knows

131
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,640
that he's your child who was born
in the mortal world.

132
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,280
He did not have the Immortal perception.

133
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,120
You are ashamed about that.

134
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,280
But...

135
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,480
He didn't do anything wrong.

136
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,320
That was my fault.

137
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,160
I shouldn't have given birth to him.

138
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,960
It was Lin Kui who led me
into the secret path.

139
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
I saw a lot of Immortal perceptions
before I was sucked into the painting.

140
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,840
As long as we find the secret path,

141
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,000
there will be major discoveries.

142
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:38,960
Here it is.

143
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
This is the Immortal perception, right?

144
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,320
Master, the Devil Lord just came in here.

145
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,240
The Secret Book of the Immortal perception

146
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,640
It may be useful to Bi Hong.

147
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,040
Let's go and notify the owners of each Sect.

148
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,200
Go.

149
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,800
It's you, the devil.

150
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,240
Go to hell.

151
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,280
Qing Feng

152
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,160
Qing Feng

153
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,840
This is the unique feat of Qingcheng Sect,

154
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,880
Pull the Plug.

155
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,480
It will only be used

156
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,560
when one intends to die with his opponent.

157
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,520
She made the first move.

158
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,200
Her Immortal perception has been damaged,

159
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,400
and she needs to rest for some days.

160
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:11,960
Qing Feng

161
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,800
Why don't you trust me?

162
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,200
I told you,

163
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,880
the Devil Lord didn't kill anyone.

164
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,560
How can I trust you?

165
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,120
The Immortal perceptions are all snatched from you.

166
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:23,800
See,

167
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,800
this is the result of doing good things.

168
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,000
I was helping you find out the truth,

169
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:28,920
but you

170
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,480
made a false countercharge on me.

171
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,320
It was a misunderstanding.

172
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
We've just found it.

173
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,040
How dare you say that it was a misunderstanding?

174
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,880
My brother's Immortal perception has pulled out
by someone.

175
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,320
Do you remember?

176
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,480
I told you,

177
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,080
I had a brother, too.

178
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,160
Back then, the Devil Sect gutted Qingcheng,

179
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,200
if it was not my brother
who sent me away desperately,

180
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,480
I would have been killed.

181
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,280
For this bloody feud,

182
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,600
I have never forgotten about it.

183
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,280
I came to be apprenticed in the Yuhua Sect,

184
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,600
just for one day,

185
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,200
I can kill the devil

186
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,720
and avenge for my family.

187
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,200
Qing Feng

188
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,000
You would rather hurt yourself

189
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,360
than hurt me.

190
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,480
I'll remember this kindness in my heart.

191
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,720
But the matter of pulling out the Immortal perception

192
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,240
really has nothing to do with the Devil Lord.

193
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,600
I can swear on my life.

194
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,920
Even if it was not the Devil Lord,

195
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,040
it had something to do with the Devil Sect.

196
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,800
We have seen all those evidence.

197
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,440
The Devil Lord

198
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,680
You have to give us an explanation.

199
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,920
Please be perceptive of it.

200
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,240
I think

201
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,200
Lin Kui has a major suspicion in the matter.

202
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,560
Stop talking nonsense.

203
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,320
Lin Kui?

204
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,440
You put the blame on someone
who has been missing for many days,

205
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,760
this is really a good plan.

206
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,560
That's it.

207
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,240
If you don't give us the real murderer,

208
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,280
we will eradicate your Devil Sect.

209
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,760
Go ahead. I'm not afraid of you.

210
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,440
Your Majesty

211
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,160
We caught Lin Kui.

212
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,160
Lin Kui

213
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,480
I am the one who pulled out the Immortal perception.

214
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,640
You can dispose of me as you see fit.

215
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,600
Lin Kui

216
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,880
How could it be you?

217
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,240
Tell me the truth,

218
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,720
is there anyone who coerced or lured you?

219
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,480
What I said is the truth.

220
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,000
I don't believe it.

221
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:45,880
Master

222
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,680
Though Lin Kui likes sneaking,

223
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
he is loyal to his friends

224
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,520
and filial to his parents.

225
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
No matter what kind of delicious food
he finds,

226
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,400
he wants to take it back to them.

227
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,560
A man like him,

228
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,880
I don't believe he will do the devil things

229
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,840
like pulling out someone's Immortal perception.

230
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,440
Are you finished?

231
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,360
Listen,

232
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,600
pulling out the Immortal perception is a secret
enchantment inherited from my ancestors.

233
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,600
I thought it wouldn't be used

234
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,240
as I was cultivating in Yuhua Sect.

235
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,680
I didn't expect that

236
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,520
the way of cultivating is tough and long.

237
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,240
So,

238
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,120
I wanted to use others' Immortal perceptions

239
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,200
to improve mine.

240
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,600
You b*st*rd,

241
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,720
I was deceived by you.

242
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,400
Lin Kui

243
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,640
Do you remember

244
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,400
that you used to be an apprentice of my Yuhua Sect?

245
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,560
Today,

246
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,080
I won't tolerate you.

247
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:42,960
Hold on.

248
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,840
Don't you think that the case

249
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,840
was solved so easily?

250
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,520
The Little One

251
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,760
Do you want me to demonstrate

252
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,640
how to pull out the Immortal perception in public?

253
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,480
Take him away.

254
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:58,960
Get up.

255
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,480
The Devil Sect saved my family.

256
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,560
To die for them,

257
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,840
I have nothing to regret.

258
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,080
Take him away.

259
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,600
Now that the case about the Immortal perception
has cleared,

260
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,560
please continue to find the Holy Garment.

261
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,160
You are so procrastinated.

262
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,080
You had no clue about
the Holy Garment so far.

263
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,280
Lord Shen Guan

264
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,960
You shouldn't set the subject.

265
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,040
The exam doesn't start,

266
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,440
they've made my Devil Sect

267
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
a mess.

268
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,560
You are gifted with good eloquence,

269
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,680
counting the blame on me.

270
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,560
Well,

271
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,280
I will reveal one more clue to you all.

272
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,120
The Silver Holy Garment
was originally a battle garment.

273
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,200
The mortal battle garment is bloodthirsty,

274
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,360
the celestial battle garment
is addicted to Holy Power.

275
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,080
Addicted to Holy Power?

276
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,320
Lord Shen Guan

277
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,040
There is one more thing

278
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,080
that I want to ask you to be a witness.

279
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,520
It's my pleasure.

280
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,080
For thousands of years,

281
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,560
there's something interesting
happened finally,

282
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,440
I won't miss it.

283
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,440
Hou Chi

284
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,840
Today, to be your master, I agree

285
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,160
that you and Shi Xia formally
become brother and sister.

286
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,080
Lord Shen Guan and all the people present

287
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,000
are witnesses.

288
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,840
What?

289
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,800
A few days ago,

290
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,640
the head of the Immortal Sect

291
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,720
witnessed your sibling contract.

292
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,720
The contract connects your blood as a family.

293
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:44,720
Senior

294
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,120
You don't allow Shi Xia
to approach Hou Chi, do you?

295
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,800
Just destroy the sibling contract.

296
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,880
The contract is not a trifling matter.

297
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,520
Hou Chi

298
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,360
From now on,

299
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,400
you should treat Shi Xia as your own sister.

300
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,880
Thanks for your perfected, Master.

301
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,800
Sister...

302
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,240
Perfected?

303
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,160
He is witty.

304
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,000
Hou Chi admitted Shi Xia to be his sister
in public,

305
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,800
and it can cut off the possibility
of them becoming lovers.

306
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,040
It's just what I want.

307
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,200
After all, I'm Shi Xia's real brother.

308
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,640
He is at most a step-brother.

309
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,240
It's much better than
to have a brother-in-law.

310
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,080
Yeah.

311
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,200
Good for them.

312
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,960
I will be the host tonight.

313
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,040
Don't make it harder.

314
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,880
What are you waiting for?

315
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,160
Salute to Lord Shen Guan quickly.

316
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,760
Thank you, Lord Shen Guan.

317
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,200
Everyone,

318
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,360
Shi Xia is a member of the Devil Sect,

319
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,640
and has a very close relationship
with the Devil Lord.

320
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,960
And Hou Chi is my favorite apprentice.

321
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,200
He's like a branch on the same tree
as other Sects.

322
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,600
Today, they formally become brother and sister,

323
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,360
which is a sign of the Immortals Sect and the Devil Sect's

324
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,520
official reconciliation.

325
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,760
You're right.

326
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,120
The reconciliation of the Immortals Sect
and the Devil Sect,

327
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,400
it is the general trend.

328
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,240
There were so many things happened today.

329
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,080
Go back to have a good rest.

330
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,440
Those Immortal perceptions will be temporarily kept
by the Immortal Sect.

331
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,800
Let's cope with them after the election.

332
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,680
Let's do as you say.

333
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,760
Well, that is all.

334
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,000
Hold on, sister.

335
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,120
Have a good chat.

336
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,160
Sister...

337
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,920
In fact, as long as you are with me,

338
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,280
I'm happy no matter what I play with.

339
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,040
Because you're here, brother.

340
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,200
Qiu Li, I won't give up on you.

341
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,240
During the search for the Holy Garment,

342
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,640
you can live in the magic cave.

343
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,000
When I come back,

344
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,280
we can play together again.

345
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,280
Brother

346
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,760
I didn't expect you to abandon me in the end.

347
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,160
Why are you here?

348
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,080
Why I'm here?

349
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,720
I'm here to apply medicine to you.

350
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,320
Do you know

351
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,560
why I am the only one

352
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,360
to take care of you?

353
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,960
That's because

354
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,800
they don't care about you as much as I do.

355
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:12,680
I don't need it.

356
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,520
Leave me alone.

357
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,840
It's fine for you to be mean to me
at ordinary times.

358
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,760
But now you're hurt like this,

359
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,800
don't be stubborn.

360
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,720
What are you doing?

361
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,720
I apply medicine to you in person,

362
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,560
which is your honor.

363
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,840
Have a good rest.

364
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,680
That feeling just now,

365
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,840
is it the crush?

366
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,720
Do I...

367
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,760
To warmly celebrate Shi Xia
and Hou Chi's becoming brother and sister,

368
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,720
the Mo Piao Piao milk tea
will be sold at half price.

369
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,800
All at half price.

370
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,960
Why do you make such a big discount?

371
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,800
Muddy the waters.

372
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,680
I'm happy. I'm willing to.

373
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:10,840
Happy?

374
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,120
You weren't like this before.

375
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,360
In the Otherworld Town, weren't you who

376
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,680
organized a Sister Selection Meeting
for Hou Chi

377
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,560
to prevent him from being my brother?

378
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,320
Why do you have

379
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,600
such a big change in your attitude now?

380
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,840
Because I figured out one thing.

381
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,840
It's better to let him be my brother
than my brother-in-law.

382
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,680
Mind your wording.

383
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,040
Or I'll kick your ass.

384
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,360
My girl

385
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,400
Don't dream about it anymore.

386
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,960
You two are now legal brother and sister.

387
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,800
Kill the seeds of love in the bud.

388
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,840
I didn't.

389
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,240
You'd better not.

390
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,240
Or, you will be the only one who is sad.

391
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,640
I think Hou Chi is happy about that.

392
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,520
He seems to treat you as his sister sincerely.

393
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,360
Sister

394
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,880
why are you here alone?

395
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,840
The Immortal Venerable

396
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,080
Everyone,

397
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,400
this is my sister.

398
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,680
Congratulations.

399
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,480
Wait for me.

400
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,040
Sorry.

401
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,200
Did you leave your eyeballs at home?

402
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,080
This gentleman,

403
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,880
this is my sister, Shi Xia.

404
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,480
So what?

405
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,880
You haven't congratulated us yet.

406
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,640
Devil Lady

407
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,920
What are you doing here?

408
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,680
Your brother has gone.
