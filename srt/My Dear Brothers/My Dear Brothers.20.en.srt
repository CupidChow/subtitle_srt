00:01:23,889 --> 00:01:30,000
My Dear Brothers
EP20

2
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,440
Sister

3
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,920
I've been looking for you.

4
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,160
Immortal Aunt, sorry. I'm so late to be here.

5
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,560
Let me take you out.

6
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,240
It's in vain.

7
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,560
The Holy Fence

8
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,080
can only be opened by the Holy Key.

9
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,640
I will find a way to take you out.

10
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,120
Wait.

11
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,160
What's going on outside now?

12
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,320
Peaceful.

13
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,640
The Immortal Sect and Devil Sect are very close.

14
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,760
But the situation

15
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,760
will be broken soon.

16
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,160
His Majesty wants to be the head of the Alliance.

17
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,800
So, he will fight with Hou Chi

18
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,160
sooner or later.

19
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,800
I must help my brother become the head of the Alliance.

20
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,120
If I can go out of here,

21
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,440
I must kill Hou Chi and Shi Xia.

22
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,280
Then my brother will come back to me.

23
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,760
Right?

24
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,920
It's so stinky.

25
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,040
No, I can't stand it.

26
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,200
What's wrong?

27
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,720
Devil Lady

28
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,120
Just enjoy yourself.

29
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,280
We've made a lot.

30
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,160
Husppy

31
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,560
What's going on? There is no guest.

32
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,360
Definitely, there is no guest.

33
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,880
Please give me a reasonable explanation.

34
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,800
Me?

35
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,080
Why?

36
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,400
The Devil Lady loves eating stinky tofu.

37
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,480
It's not my fault.

38
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:11,920
Yeah.

39
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,080
I just love eating stinky tofu.

40
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,840
-Look.  -So what?

41
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,760
Even if she wants to eat the dragon meat,

42
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,240
there's nothing wrong, right?

43
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,120
You didn't look like this...

44
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,920
It's you.

45
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,760
Me? What?

46
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,480
It's you.

47
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,720
You stuff your nose with cotton,

48
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,040
which makes you look so unprofessional.

49
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,000
-I...  -That damaged the reputation

50
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,280
of the milk tea shop.

51
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,080
Is it true?

52
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,880
Do you have more?

53
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,040
Yes.

54
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,680
I have a lot.

55
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,640
I mean cotton.

56
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,960
Cotton?

57
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,160
Let me share it with you. Come on.

58
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,000
No.

59
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,000
Shi Xia

60
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,440
Enjoy it.

61
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,600
Hey.

62
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,800
Hey.

63
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,080
Devil Lady, enjoy it.

64
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,000
My cotton...

65
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,920
My... My...

66
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,440
Oh my god.

67
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:22,880
Are you looking for Shi Xia?

68
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,160
She's there.

69
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,880
Mr. Qiu, I'm looking for you.

70
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:28,960
Me?

71
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,640
Mr. Qiu

72
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,960
Now Shi Xia and I

73
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,560
are authorized sister and brother.

74
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,720
I've thought about this matter for the whole night.

75
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,400
But I still have to learn something from you.

76
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,880
Please teach me to be a good brother.

77
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,160
The Plan of Being A Brother?

78
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,640
First,

79
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,760
urge her to have meals regularly.

80
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,880
Sister, it's time for breakfast.

81
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,400
Second,

82
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,280
greet her every day.

83
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,760
Sister, welcome home.

84
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,680
Third,

85
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,640
never be too careful in protecting her.

86
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,280
Sister, be careful.

87
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,080
Mr. Qiu

88
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,640
Enough.

89
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,400
I don't want to be your sister.

90
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,520
Don't you know it?

91
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,440
You're not like

92
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,800
a brother for me.

93
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,440
I love you.

94
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,720
You love me?

95
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,000
But I just treat you like a sister.

96
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,920
Haven't you ever loved me?

97
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,080
Yes.

98
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,040
Shi Xia?

99
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,160
What are you thinking about?

100
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,040
Nothing.

101
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,520
I just

102
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,320
want to invite you to eat stinky tofu.

103
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,800
Cheers. Come on.

104
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,200
Cheers for the love between the brother and sister from different worlds.

105
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,120
What you said all makes sense.

106
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,520
But the most important thing for being a good brother

107
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,920
is to be obedient to your sister.

108
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,440
Sometimes your sister may be brutal,

109
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,760
and make trouble for you for no reason.

110
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,760
Please, two brothers. Taste it.

111
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,360
The brother should be obedient to the sister.

112
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,320
Just taste the stinky tofu.

113
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,720
It's nothing terrible.

114
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,520
We're allies.

115
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,960
You must pay for your gossipy nature.

116
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,800
Mr. Qiu

117
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,160
Taste it.

118
00:08:59,360 --> 00:08:59,760
It's delicious.

119
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,520
It's you

120
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,480
who set me up like this.

121
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,240
Is it spicy?

122
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,840
I don't think so.

123
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:26,880
Hey.

124
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,880
You couldn't take spicy food before.

125
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,720
If there is a competition of eating spicy food,

126
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,680
I must be the champion.

127
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,960
You got allergic?

128
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,680
There are crushed peanuts in it.

129
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,240
You should find it, since you're allergic to peanuts.

130
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,920
I'm fine.

131
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,360
I didn't eat much.

132
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:00,720
Wait.

133
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,560
You used to be alert to the taste of peanuts.

134
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,240
Why can't you find it this time?

135
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,560
It's not weird.

136
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,520
Alright.

137
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,160
Maybe I'm thinking too much.

138
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:17,920
By the way.

139
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,200
We have created a new kind of milk tea.

140
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,680
Taste it.

141
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,400
It's great.

142
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,360
So delicious.

143
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,600
What does it taste like?

144
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,560
Milk Tea With Love.

145
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,320
It must be the taste of love.

146
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,680
It tastes like banana that you hate most.

147
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,240
I thought you're weird long ago.

148
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,920
Shi Xia, be honest.

149
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,320
Have you lost your sense of taste?

150
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,560
You have really lost your sense of taste?

151
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,720
She looks fine after coming back from the Dark Forest.

152
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,120
I really believed she lost nothing there.

153
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,720
What have you done?

154
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,240
Stop.

155
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,920
So what if I lost my sense of taste?

156
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,720
I'm fine.

157
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,880
You still speak for him in such a situation.

158
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,040
I lost nothing important.

159
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,560
I'm fine and healthy now.

160
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,160
I know so much about you.

161
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,000
You're such a foodie.

162
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,240
If you lost your sense of taste,

163
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,640
your life will become tasteless.

164
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,680
You have also lost so much joy.

165
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,760
I'm fine.

166
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,600
Really.

167
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,640
Sister

168
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,640
I didn't protect you well.

169
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,840
I must try my best to cure you.

170
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,200
So if Hou Chi really regards Shi Xia as his sister,

171
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,160
he will not fall in love with her anymore.

172
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,360
The brother

173
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,080
can't fall in love with his sister.

174
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,360
We have scolded and even punished him.

175
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,640
And even we have forced him to swear like that.

176
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,240
But Hou Chi

177
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,080
is still obsessed with Shi Xia.

178
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,960
It's such a critical time for selecting the leader.

179
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,760
We have to force him like this.

180
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,320
Just stop him for the time being.

181
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,680
That's a good idea.

182
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,960
You're so smart.

183
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:04,880
Senior

184
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,720
Do you think it will work?

185
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,240
Why Hou Chi is still being with Shi Xia?

186
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,720
I even didn't know

187
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,560
there is such a place in Devil Sect.

188
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,640
What a nice place.

189
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,320
I found this place by accident.

190
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,840
Close your eyes.

191
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,800
Why?

192
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:40,880
Just close your eyes.

193
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,920
You said

194
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,440
it is eatable, and you can pinch it

195
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,880
when you feel stressed.

196
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,160
Though I can't understand it,

197
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,200
I think you might need it,

198
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,680
since you have lost your sense of taste.

199
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,200
How could you keep

200
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,400
such a crispy thing so well?

201
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,480
I don't want to break its completeness.

202
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:16,960
I keep it well

203
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,840
because I want to please you.

204
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,440
As long as you are happy,

205
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,320
I'm willing to do anything.

206
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,880
Hou Chi

207
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,720
Why are you so nice to me?

208
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,600
Is it because I am your sister?

209
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:32,800
Of course.

210
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Do you know

211
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,000
there is a slight difference

212
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,000
between a sister and a woman?

213
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,040
What's the difference?

214
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,920
The difference...

215
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,160
The difference is...

216
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,280
Hou Chi

217
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,400
What are you doing?

218
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:14,920
Let go of me.

219
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,200
Come with me.

220
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,400
Kneel.

221
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,120
Since you come to Devil Sect,

222
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,760
have you focused on finding the Holy Garment?

223
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,440
I try to find it with my Holy Power every day.

224
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,960
Then where is it?

225
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,040
I still haven't got its response yet.

226
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,360
You have disappointed me.

227
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,880
The rules for selecting the leader this time

228
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,320
are different from the regular rules before.

229
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,960
Though you do well in cultivating Holy Power,

230
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,680
it's useless if you can't find the Holy Garment.

231
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,600
I understand.

232
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:11,920
Understand?

233
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,280
Do you really understand?

234
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,240
From tomorrow on,

235
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,000
you must focus on practicing,

236
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,120
and devote yourself to finding the Holy Garment.

237
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,320
If you have no other orders,

238
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,240
I will leave now.

239
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,520
Scolding and punishment are all useless.

240
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:55,880
It seems that

241
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,360
I have to be more merciless.

242
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,680
What are you looking at?

243
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,400
Are you looking at the moon?

244
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:12,880
Stop looking at it.

245
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,520
Let me tell you something.

246
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,520
We have spent

247
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,800
half of our Holy Power.

248
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,520
But we still

249
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,480
can't find the Holy Garment.

250
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,080
How about those Immortal Sects?

251
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,040
They are trying to find it

252
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,120
by all kinds of means.

253
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,440
In my opinion,

254
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,880
it's just in vain.

255
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,400
Is Shen Guan fooling us?

256
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,080
How can I know it?

257
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,360
Perhaps,

258
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,480
the Holy Garment can't be found by ordinary Holy Power.

259
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,240
I have to find another way.

260
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,840
By the way,

261
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,320
where is Immortal perception?

262
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,560
The Immortal Sects took it away.

263
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,880
What a waste.

264
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,320
The Immortal perception is useless for them.

265
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,920
What a pity.

266
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:03,800
Hey.

267
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,480
Let me steal it back for you.

268
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,200
Wait. Wait.

269
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,400
Are you sure of it?

270
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,720
If they catch you,

271
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,120
there will be bad consequences.

272
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:13,960
You don't trust me.

273
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,560
You don't trust me, do you?

274
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,240
I'm just worried about you.

275
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,280
Worry?

276
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,560
Don't worry.

277
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,120
They even don't know how capable Husppy is.

278
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,040
Master Yuan Gui?

279
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,320
The owner's gift for you.

280
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,520
Take it.

281
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,600
The Master's gift for me?

282
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,160
Why did he send me a gift?

283
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,760
This jade pendant

284
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,840
looks so familiar.

285
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,480
Bi Hong

286
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,280
Master Yuan Gui

287
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,320
Why did you sigh?

288
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,240
I feel sorry for you.

289
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,640
Don't you know that yet?

290
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,560
What?

291
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,360
The owner, your father,

292
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,080
sent Shi Xia a gift.

293
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,560
Do you want to make Shi Xia and Bi Hong a couple?

294
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,360
Since we can't wake Hou Chi up,

295
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,320
I have to make such a decision.

296
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,960
If Shi Xia and Bi Hong can be a couple,

297
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,440
Hou Chi can focus on

298
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,720
the selection.

299
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,240
Anyway,

300
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,960
you just do this for Hou Chi.

301
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,240
Have you ever done something for Bi Hong?

302
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,720
He is your son.

303
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,280
Bi Hong...

304
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,600
It's also good for Bi Hong.

305
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,800
If Bi Hong can fall in love with Shi Xia,

306
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,440
then he will be willing

307
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,440
to be a mortal.

308
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,160
He was so merciless this time.

309
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,280
He even wanted to sacrifice you.

310
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,880
I can't accept it.

311
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,840
(Hou Chi is the only one who Shi Xia loves.)

312
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,320
(Besides, I am blind now.)

313
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,400
(I don't deserve her.)

314
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,040
(Father, it's useless for you to do that.)

315
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:16,920
Senior

316
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,320
I have something to tell you.

317
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,480
Shi Xia

318
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,880
I'm here for the jade pendant.

319
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,200
No wonder I found it familiar.

320
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,200
Sister

321
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,680
Senior

322
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,280
This jade pendant

323
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,000
looks exactly the same as Senior's.

324
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,240
It's Master's cherished treasure.

325
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,480
He even sent it to you.

326
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,600
Don't misunderstand.

327
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,880
Really?

328
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,040
Does the owner want to make me and Senior a couple?

329
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,440
The Master specially sent the jade pendant to Shi Xia

330
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,880
to congratulate us on being the real brother and sister.

331
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,120
He finally accepted Shi Xia being my sister.

332
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,880
Why does this stupid chump look so happy?

333
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,400
He even isn't jealous at all.

334
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,600
Shi Xia

335
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,040
If you don't want to keep it,

336
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,000
I can help you return it to the owner.

337
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:20,920
Thank you.

338
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,240
Sister, just keep it.

339
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,560
He knows the two jade pendants are coupled.

340
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,920
It seems that he only regards me as his sister.

341
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,120
Shi Xia, then...

342
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,160
Do you really want me to keep the jade pendant?

343
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,800
Just keep it.

344
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,040
Don't disappoint the Master.

345
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,120
(Disappoint?)

346
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,920
(What is he thinking about?)

347
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,320
Shi Xia

348
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,400
If you don't want it, you can return it back.

349
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,000
I will keep it.

350
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,080
Hou Chi

351
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,760
I will be your sister.

352
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,480
I will be your good sister all my life.

353
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,800
(Shi Xia, since you still love Hou Chi,)

354
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,040
(why did you keep the jade pendant?)

355
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,760
Bi Hong

356
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:47,880
What's the matter?

357
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,800
Have you taken the jade pendant back?

358
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,200
Master Yuan Gui

359
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,240
I want to go back to Mount Yuhua.

360
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,520
I want to see those hydrangeas in my yard.

361
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,040
How can you think about these meaningless things

362
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,480
in such a situation?

363
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
It's blossom season.

364
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,360
Maybe the flowers in my yard are just blooming.

365
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,280
It's just a piece of cake for me

366
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,960
to steal Immortal perception.

367
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,520
Good job.

368
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,480
Let me make a detector

369
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,280
with my knowledge.

370
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,240
Husppy

371
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,600
Have you finished?

372
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,640
Yes, I have.

373
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,280
Look.

374
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,240
What a delicate mold.

375
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,040
It's done.

376
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,240
Holy Compass.

377
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,680
Let's try it first.

378
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,200
What are you waiting for?

379
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,440
Let's find the Holy Garment.

380
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,200
Let's go to find it.

381
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,320
Maybe the Immortal Sects will soon find

382
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,280
Immortal perception have been stolen.

383
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,400
You just need

384
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,360
to distract Hou Chi if they come.

385
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,600
Nobody else can make trouble for me.

386
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,040
She has already distracted him.

387
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,640
Who?

388
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,560
The Devil Lady.

389
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,120
What a good job she has done.

390
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,600
Should we help them...

391
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,080
No.

392
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,040
They must keep a distance from each other.

393
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,680
Distance?

394
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,400
Then just separate them.

395
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:36,960
No.

396
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,520
You can't separate them.

397
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,160
They can't be separated,

398
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,640
and can't be coupled.

399
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,280
You confused me.

400
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,680
Just keep a balance.

401
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,160
So how about this?

402
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,120
My sister is going to get married.

403
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,800
Just ask the Devil Lady

404
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,040
to help her prepare for the wedding.

405
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,760
Hou Chi is addicted to the Devil Lady,

406
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,720
so he will certainly come with her.

407
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,680
Then he can't focus on finding the Holy Garment.

408
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,320
At that time,

409
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,640
Holy Garment will be mine.

410
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,520
Sister

411
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,760
Sister

412
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,160
Why do you look unhappy?

413
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:05,960
I don't.

414
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:06,800
I'm happy.

415
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:07,520
Really?

416
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,320
-Of course.  -Why do I sense you're unhappy?

417
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
You know nothing.

418
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,120
Just focus on finding the Holy Garment.

419
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,160
Don't follow me.

420
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,160
You told me

421
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,600
there is a difference between a sister and a woman.

422
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,120
But you didn't tell me what it is.

423
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,040
It's not important.

424
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,800
Devil Lady, you are finally here.

425
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,440
What does the Devil Lord want from me?

426
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,200
It's nothing important.

427
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,440
Just my sister

428
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,960
is going to get married.

429
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,760
His Majesty just wants you to help my sister

430
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,960
prepare the wedding.

431
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,600
I don't know much about that.

432
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,920
You know so much.

433
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,160
You have good taste.

434
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,600
Please help us.

435
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,280
You won't refuse me, will you?

436
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,600
Then my sister will be sad.

437
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,520
Alright, I'll go.

438
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,240
Tai Di

439
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:51,960
I'm coming.

440
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,040
Take the Devil Lady upstairs. Hurry up.

441
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,840
Please follow me. This way.

442
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,480
This way.

443
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,080
Hey, you.

444
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,200
What are you doing here?

445
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,800
Forget it.

446
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:01,640
It's not important.

447
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,000
Since you also come here, just help us.

448
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,640
Okay?

449
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,480
Help us check the gifts from my future brother-in-law.

450
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,840
Brother-in-law? Gifts?

451
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,560
Do you know what it is?

452
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,720
It's a pair of dolls.

453
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,960
The one in your hand

454
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,160
is the bride.

455
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,600
This one is the bridegroom.

456
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,400
Do you know what this is?

457
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,600
This is a wedding candle.

458
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,400
It is used in the new couple's room...

459
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,200
Why did I say so much to you?

460
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,160
You won't use it. You're such a chump.

461
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,040
Put it down. Put down.

462
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,520
Put down.

463
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,920
Why are they all coupled?

464
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,600
Of course, they are coupled.

465
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,800
The bridegroom and the bride

466
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,320
are just a couple.

467
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,960
We use the coupled things

468
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,120
to bless them.

469
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,360
This jade pendant

470
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,280
looks exactly the same as Senior's.

471
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,520
What is the brother-in-law

472
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:17,840
you just said?

473
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,200
Brother...

474
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,560
My brother-in-law

475
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,200
is the husband of my sister.

476
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,840
(Did the Master want Senior to be my brother-in-law?)

477
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,160
Is brother-in-law also a kind of brother?

478
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,760
Maybe it is.

479
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:41,960
Anyway,

480
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,200
I will have a brother-in-law sooner or later.

481
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,320
Just like... My God, I...

482
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,480
How can I explain it to you?

483
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,240
In Husppy's world,

484
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,960
my brother-in-law is someone who will protect my sister.

485
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,680
(Isn't it enough to just have a brother?)

486
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,320
(Why should there also be a brother-in-law?)

487
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:06,760
Senior

488
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,840
Something bad happened.

489
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,120
Someone has stolen Immortal perception.

490
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,520
Immortal perception has been stolen.

491
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,320
Does the Devil Sect

492
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,040
want to find the Holy Garment with Immortal perception?

493
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,240
No matter how they will use it,

494
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,880
it must be their conspiracy.

495
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,680
They have stolen Immortal perception,

496
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,120
which means

497
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,720
they have damaged the dead bodies of our disciples.

498
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,200
Even if we held a funeral for them,

499
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,520
they couldn't rest in peace.

500
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,760
What a malicious conspiracy.

501
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,480
Let me take it back from them.

502
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,480
What happened here?

503
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,200
What...

504
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,200
Where is Immortal Aunt?

505
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,440
What happened?

506
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,720
What happened?

507
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,520
Mr. Husppy

508
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,120
Qi Lingling has stolen the Holy Key.

509
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,720
Who?

510
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,320
Qi Lingling has stolen the Holy Key.

511
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,080
Immortal Aunt

512
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,240
No one tailed us.

513
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,080
Qi Lingling

514
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,040
Where is the Magic Umbrella

515
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,680
you got from Yuhua Sect?

516
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,000
It is said that the Magic Umbrella

517
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,560
is an instrument Hou Chi sent to Bi Hong.

518
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:46,720
Evil Aura.

519
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,720
I will set Evil Aura for Hou Chi.

520
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,440
It will work whenever he misses someone.

521
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,040
Master Yuan Gui

522
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,760
Don't call me Master.

523
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,320
Tell me.

524
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,440
Did the Devil Sect steal Immortal perception?

525
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:25,960
Immortal perception?

526
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,120
Why did the Devil Sect steal it?

527
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,280
Don't try to fool me.

528
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,640
Tell me the truth.

529
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,560
I know nothing about it.

530
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,680
I even don't know what you are talking about.

531
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,960
The owner cares too much

532
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,680
about the reputation of the Immortal Sects.

533
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,080
That's why the Devil Sect becomes increasingly arrogant.

534
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,760
But I am not so merciful as him.

535
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,160
If you don't tell me the truth,

536
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,200
I will kill you.

537
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,120
I know nothing about it.

538
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,120
You can't run.

539
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,600
Master Yuan Gui

540
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,320
Stop there.

541
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:56,800
Demon girl

542
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,240
The Immortal Sect has made peace with the Devil Sect.

543
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,920
Why did I become a demon girl again?

544
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,680
Peace?

545
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,240
That's just your conspiracy.

546
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,960
Help.

547
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,920
Senior

548
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,600
Shi Xia, run.

549
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,080
Good boy.

550
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,920
You use the defense instrument I sent you

551
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,320
to fight against me.

552
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:34,840
Shi Xia

553
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,800
I will stop him. Go to find Hou Chi. Hurry up.

554
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,320
Senior

555
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:38,760
Go.

556
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,200
He won't hurt me.

557
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,040
Bi Hong

558
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,280
I made a wrong judgment on you.

559
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,720
You have also been captivated by this demon girl.

560
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,320
In this case, I must kill her today.

561
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,000
Master Yuan Gui

562
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,480
Don't force me.

563
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:07,880
Get out of my way.
