00:01:23,944 --> 00:01:33,000
My Dear Brothers
EP32

2
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,320
Evil Aura

3
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,480
The Evil Aura is still there.

4
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,640
He didn't take
the Love-forgetting Potion.

5
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,720
Hou Chi.

6
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,000
Master Houchi.

7
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,800
Hou Chi.

8
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,520
Shi Dong.

9
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,120
You are still alive.

10
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,840
What happened to you?

11
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,560
How did he become like this?

12
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,080
Because Bi Hong has removed his Holy Root.

13
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,160
So it was you.

14
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,760
Come with me.

15
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,400
Why did you harm him with Qiu Li?

16
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,760
Shi Xia

17
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,440
I...

18
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,160
I thought he killed you.

19
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,320
I thought you were dead.

20
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,080
I was avenging you.

21
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,360
Bi Hong.

22
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,160
Bi Hong.

23
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,320
Listen.

24
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,160
It was just an act.
He pretended to kill me and Shi Dong

25
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,080
to protect us.

26
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,120
It's all my fault.

27
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,520
I should have told you

28
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,120
in the first place.

29
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,440
But could you give the Holy Root back to him?

30
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,080
Or he'll die.

31
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,040
Please, I'm begging you.

32
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,840
You know what?

33
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,480
When I saw you the first time,

34
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,120
I thought I would never be alone.

35
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,720
Because I have my brother,

36
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,680
and I have you.

37
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,160
I'm willing to give up everything for you,

38
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,040
because I like you.

39
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,760
But,

40
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,840
why?

41
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,960
Why didn't you give a sh*t

42
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,160
about everything I've done for you?

43
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,640
All you are thinking about is him.

44
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,320
Have you ever thought about my feelings?

45
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,720
Bi Hong.

46
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,160
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,600
I know I owe you.

48
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,360
But it's a life-and-death matter now.

49
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,480
Could you just give it back to him?

50
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,800
I'm begging you, please.

51
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,600
Not gonna happen.

52
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,160
It's mine.

53
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,080
Why the h*ll should I give it to him?

54
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,920
What are you talking about?

55
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,000
How could it be possible?

56
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,880
Listen,

57
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,560
it was Yuan Zhao

58
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,280
who transplanted my

59
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,400
Holy Root to Hou Chi.

60
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,120
Now it's been restored to me.

61
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,520
Shi Xia

62
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,320
Shi Xia

63
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,720
You once said that

64
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,280
I am the master of my own destiny.

65
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,160
Now I got the Holy Root.

66
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,440
I finally got the Holy Root.

67
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,400
You should feel happy for me, right?

68
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,800
Let's go back to Devil Sect.

69
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,040
Whatever he gave you,
I can give you better.

70
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,280
Come with me, Shi Xia.

71
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,200
Shi Dong

72
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,520
You are hurting me.

73
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,040
Stop your acting.

74
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,640
I know you are not Bai Li.

75
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,280
You are so nice to Bai Li,

76
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,320
but are cold to me.

77
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,040
I just don't want you to take the wrong path.

78
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,280
You almost got killed,

79
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,280
and I avenge you. How could it be wrong?

80
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,480
Qiu Li

81
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,400
It's all my fault.

82
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,080
I should have let you know in the first place.

83
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,920
But look at me now. I'm fine.

84
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,920
You don't have to avenge me.

85
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,040
Be good, all right?

86
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,440
Remove your Thunderclap Killing Array,

87
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,800
and give the Holy Root back to Hou Chi.

88
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,920
Then let's go back to the Devil Sect together.

89
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,680
I'll guard you for my whole life.

90
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,080
Dong.

91
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,200
Did I do something wrong again?

92
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,160
Dong.

93
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,840
Don't hate me,

94
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,960
please.

95
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,040
I'm not blaming you.

96
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,600
I just want you to listen to me.

97
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,720
Remove the array,

98
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,200
and give Hou Chi his Holy Root back.

99
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,960
But,

100
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,200
why should I give it back to Hou Chi

101
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,800
since it doesn't belong to him anyway?

102
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,120
Now that you are back,

103
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,480
what about

104
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,360
I transplant it to you?

105
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,440
You...

106
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,280
You were here with me when I was grounded,

107
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,240
and you even risked your life

108
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,360
to summon Bai Li.

109
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,400
How could I let you down?

110
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,160
So you've been lying to me all the time.

111
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,920
All Bai Li ever did was weeping
and hindering us.

112
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,400
It's me who's always been there helping you.

113
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,600
But all you are thinking about is Bai Li.

114
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,840
I can't live with it.

115
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,360
So I swallowed her.

116
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,440
Qiu Li

117
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,200
It's my fault.

118
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,120
I shouldn't have neglected your feelings.

119
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,920
I will do anything for you

120
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
as long as you stop it now. I promise.

121
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,280
Everything I've done is for you.

122
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,520
How could you hurt my

123
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,600
feelings like this?

124
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,240
I'm not going to return the Holy Root,

125
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,680
and you are not going to leave.

126
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,520
You...

127
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,680
If you are not going to stop it,

128
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,320
don't call me brother from now on.

129
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,760
Don't call you brother?

130
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,760
When did you ever call me your sis?

131
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,040
Dong.

132
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,280
If I'm determined,

133
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,560
I would never stop until I made it.

134
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,200
Qi Lingling.

135
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,840
Escort Shi Dong and Shi Xia to the Devil Sect.

136
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,200
Kill anyone

137
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,880
who's in your way.

138
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,120
Yes, madam.

139
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,480
Thunderclap Killing Array

140
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,040
It seems that

141
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,120
I'm not the only hostage here.

142
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,880
The Devil Sect has controlled
the Otherworld Town.

143
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,360
No one is leaving here.

144
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,360
I'll beat the drum

145
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,160
if anyone dares to move.

146
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,760
Everyone in the Otherworld Town will die.

147
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,520
Go.

148
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,720
Go.

149
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,920
Qi Lingling

150
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,000
Let me heal you.

151
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,120
It's too late.

152
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,880
I'm sorry.

153
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,800
I can't guard you anymore.

154
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,080
Qi Lingling

155
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,440
Qi Lingling

156
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,560
Run.

157
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,320
I've done my best to

158
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,200
take care of his wounds.

159
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,480
The bleeding stopped,

160
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,760
and there's no life-threatening.

161
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,040
How did it happen?

162
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,000
Those who lost their Holy Roots before

163
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,360
only ended up losing their forces.

164
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,160
No one had been injured like him.

165
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,520
What's wrong with him?

166
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,680
Nothing.

167
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,160
Just take good care of him.

168
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,800
Master.

169
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,200
Master.

170
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,040
You know something, right?

171
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,760
I don't know what you are talking about.

172
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,600
You don't know?

173
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,920
Okay. I'll make it clear.

174
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,000
I have many questions.

175
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,640
First,

176
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,360
why did you transplant Bi Hong's
Holy Root to Hou Chi?

177
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,040
Second, the Celestial Seal

178
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,120
had predicted that Hou Chi would be
in danger if he entered Celestial Palace.

179
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,720
After Shi Dong and I told you the prediction,

180
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,640
what you did was not to tell Hou Chi,

181
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,760
but to plant the death of Yuan Gui on us,

182
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,120
trying to silence us.

183
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,160
What is on earth the deep dark secret

184
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,360
of the Celestial Palace?

185
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,640
Third,

186
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,600
why Hou Chi is different from others

187
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,280
when he lost the Holy Root?

188
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400
It's none of your business.

189
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,640
There's no need to know.

190
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,960
Not my business?

191
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,240
Everything related to Hou Chi

192
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,160
is my business.

193
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,200
Nothing to do with us?

194
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,400
You nearly got us killed.

195
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,680
Because of the so-called secret,

196
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,440
many people got killed.

197
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,240
Even your son and your daughter got involved.

198
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,960
And now you're not going to spill the beans?

199
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,440
You wanna watch more people dead?

200
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,440
You are not going anywhere today

201
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,360
unless you make things clear.

202
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,160
In fact,

203
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,360
Hou Chi is not a human.

204
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,800
He is the root of the Holy Tree

205
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,600
in Yuhua Sect.

206
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,840
Two thousand years ago,

207
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,040
there was a great calamity in Immortal world.

208
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,000
To defend against the nature disaster,

209
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
five best immortals

210
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,840
had been elected

211
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,880
for the Otherworld Array.

212
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,640
They were prepared to sacrifice themselves to

213
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,360
mend the sky.

214
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,280
However,

215
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,960
in the last minute,

216
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,680
one of the immortals got cold feet.

217
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,480
Only four immortals had done the sacrifice.

218
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,560
Though the crisis had been subsided.

219
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,960
While the hidden trouble

220
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,040
was left due to the lack sacrifice.

221
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,960
The unrest came every two hundred years.

222
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,880
Although Shen Guan

223
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,040
had been looking for the

224
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,760
runaway immortal,

225
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,720
the runaway dived for cover

226
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,960
after he set up a new sect,

227
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,840
which is the later Devil Sect.

228
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,040
In desperation, Shen Guan
established the Immortals Alliance

229
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,360
and glamorized its leading position.

230
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,320
People of each sect flocked to

231
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,120
win the glory of

232
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,360
the head of the Alliance.

233
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,200
But no one knew that

234
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,680
behind the glory

235
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,480
lied cruel sacrifice.

236
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,520
Every head of the Alliance

237
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,280
was forced to be sacrificed

238
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,400
to keep the array working.

239
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,120
And two hundred years later,

240
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,640
here came another heroic death.

241
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,240
Two hundred years ago.

242
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,480
The ancestry of the Devil Sect
had drawn up the rule that

243
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,600
no descendants of the Devil Lord

244
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,000
would be allowed to compete for
the head of the Immortals Alliance.

245
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,320
It was to avoid the sacrifice.

246
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,440
Only every Devil Lord knows about the secret.

247
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,480
And by some chance,

248
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,360
I discovered it.

249
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,320
I never expect

250
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,080
Hong would have the heaven chosen Holy Root.

251
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,920
Why should our son

252
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,240
suffer this fate?

253
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,240
His Holy Root is comparable
to the original Devil Lord's.

254
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,560
Shen Guan will definitely notice him.

255
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,640
I'm afraid

256
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,280
he's doomed to be sacrificed.

257
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,200
Don't worry.

258
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,760
I'll protect Hong

259
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,840
and make our family

260
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,640
a safe and happy future.

261
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,720
The whole sacrificing thing is too cruel.

262
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,520
The sacrifice would never end

263
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,960
until the heaven chosen Holy Root appeared.

264
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:43,920
As the saying goes,

265
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
plants are ruthless.

266
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,960
So I chose the root of the Holy Tree

267
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,200
as an emotionless substitute.

268
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,040
The baby made by Holy Root would not only

269
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,200
save Hong's life,

270
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,560
but can repair the Otherworld Array.

271
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,240
I just never expected

272
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,560
I failed at the very last minute.

273
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,880
No wonder Shi Ji picked me

274
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,800
and allowed me to resit.

275
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,640
She was planning to sacrifice me.

276
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,120
She was so mean.

277
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,160
Sacrifice is cruel.

278
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,280
What about the things you did?

279
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,240
To protect your son,

280
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,120
how many people got killed?

281
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,320
What I did was

282
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,760
not just to save Hong's life,

283
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,920
but to repair the Wonderland Array,

284
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,120
and to save all the common people in the world.

285
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,040
What's wrong with that?

286
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,040
All things on earth have lives.

287
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,160
How do you know the plants are ruthless?

288
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,400
Hou Chi is not your

289
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,400
heartless tool.

290
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,520
He got his own consciousness,

291
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,560
and his own feelings.

292
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,640
He hurts and he feels.

293
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,440
He could also be heartbroken.

294
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,240
You created and trained him,

295
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,320
and now you want to see him die?

296
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,080
He's a human being,

297
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,040
not your puppet.

298
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,560
The last thing you should do

299
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,040
is to deprive him of freedom

300
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,120
and lie to him.

301
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,640
I know you do have feelings for him.

302
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,040
Otherwise, you wouldn't have saved
him at the last minute.

303
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,600
Sacrifice. So my existence is only for sacrifice.

304
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,480
Master Hou Chi

305
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:06,960
Stay back.

306
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,920
Just leave me alone for a moment.

307
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,240
(Hou Chi is not a human.)

308
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,200
(He is the root of the Holy Tree in
Yuhua Sect.)

309
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,040
(Now I've lost all my forces,)

310
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,920
(like a helpless wreck.)

311
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,400
(I will be more of a)

312
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,920
(burden than a help)

313
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,840
(if I keep staying with Shi Xia.)

314
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,480
You make the soup for him?

315
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,800
Right. Come and have a taste.

316
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'll take it to him if it's okay.

317
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,560
Let me have a taste.

318
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,720
Well, it tastes a little salty.

319
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,720
Oh, I remember you can't taste.

320
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,720
It's all the same for you anyway.

321
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,080
But this is Hou Chi's first meal

322
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,600
after he became a mortal person.

323
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,640
It's important.

324
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,120
He has to eat well.

325
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,440
You're right.

326
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,000
The master player has

327
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,760
become a bronze player.

328
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,960
He's at his most vulnerable moment now.

329
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,800
Be careful and not to excite him.

330
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,400
What's wrong with the bronze player?

331
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,640
The normal players could also
have a good time in the game.

332
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,160
What's good to be a normal player?

333
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,680
Xia, I know that he used to be handsome,

334
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,760
competent and important.

335
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,440
It's understandable that you liked him.

336
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,880
But now he got nothing.

337
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,600
Are you sure you still like him
as you did before?

338
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,640
Not just sympathy?

339
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,240
I don't care whether he got

340
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,000
competence or status.

341
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,280
What's more,

342
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,040
he's still charming as before.

343
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,080
He looks good with gray hair.

344
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,040
Right, he's charming.

345
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,120
Never mind.

346
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,560
I'm going to add some water to the soup.

347
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,360
Master

348
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,880
I didn't expect you are still willing

349
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,920
to call me as your master.

350
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,960
There would be no me if without you.

351
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,120
Don't you hate me?

352
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,600
If it was not you to give me my life,

353
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,520
I would never meet Shi Xia.

354
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,240
I just created you.

355
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,280
Shi Xia is the one who gave you life.

356
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,160
She's right.

357
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,200
All the things on earth do have life.
Even the plants have feelings.

358
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,120
No one should sacrifice himself for others.

359
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,320
Now you lost the Holy Root and
the Evil Aura is gone,

360
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,040
it's time for you to choose your own life.

361
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,880
Actually,

362
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,200
I got a favor to ask.

363
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,320
What is it?

364
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,440
I want you to ask Lord Shen Guan

365
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,200
to obtain the enchantment
of breaking the virtual space,

366
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,760
and send Shi Xia back to her hometown.

367
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,080
Where is her hometown?

368
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,560
Why the enchantment of
breaking the virtual space

369
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,440
is needed?

370
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,400
In fact,

371
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,240
she does not belong to this world.

372
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,160
No wonder she's so smart and

373
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,480
always does some strange things.

374
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,720
It turned out that she came from another world.

375
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,000
I have an agreement with her.

376
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,600
We agreed that I'd use

377
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,440
the enchantment to send her back home

378
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,680
once she successfully helped me
become the head of the Alliance.

379
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,240
I never expected that

380
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,240
I would fall in love with her

381
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,480
and hate to part with her.

382
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,400
But I don't get it.

383
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,560
Since Shi Xia has promised to stay,

384
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,240
why don't you just be with her?

385
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,240
I'm a useless person now.

386
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,480
But Shi Xia is not.

387
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,200
She is young

388
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,240
and promising.

389
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,880
She shouldn't waste her youth

390
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,520
on me.

391
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,040
Since you've already made up your mind.

392
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,000
You have my word on that.

393
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,400
Hou Chi.

394
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,240
Hou Chi.

395
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,200
Have you seen Hou Chi?

396
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,000
Hasn't he been in the room?

397
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,440
I brought him the food
but found he was not there.

398
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,640
Told you.

399
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,000
Men are vulnerable at this time.

400
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,280
Maybe he has run away from home.

401
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,440
Calm down.

402
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,240
Master Hou Chi has no forces now.

403
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,080
He won't go so far.

404
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,600
If the Devil Lord is right,

405
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,280
Master Hou Chi will hate to

406
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,360
be seen by others.

407
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,440
Let's go find him separately.

408
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,520
Don't call out his name.

409
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:24,840
Let's go.

410
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,280
Go.

411
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,480
Stop there, the man in a white cape.

412
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,200
Don't you go, the man in the white boots.

413
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,640
Sir, someone is calling you.

414
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:25,880
Have a look back.

415
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,840
Why Shi Xia is shouting out?

416
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,480
It'll embarrass him.

417
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,640
Didn't you say he's vulnerable now?

418
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,280
Just wait and see.

419
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,400
Follow up.

420
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,520
The idiot, who can't cook and tell stories

421
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,680
but only can make silly dolls,

422
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,560
don't you take another step.

423
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,320
You are the one who likes me in your heart

424
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,080
but only treats me as your sister.

425
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,040
You are the one who pretended to take

426
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,720
Love-forgetting Potion
and suffered from endless pains alone

427
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,480
in order to protect me.

428
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,240
You are also the one
who hardens the heart to leave me

429
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,160
when you know I can't live without him.

430
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,560
Stop!

431
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,600
Is this Hou Chi?

432
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,680
It's really him.

433
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,440
How did he become this?

434
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,560
Right.

435
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,240
It's him.

436
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,200
But this idiot could

437
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,880
never do anything for you.

438
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,360
Just let me accompany
and guard you from now on.

439
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,560
Don't forget I'm a plant expert.

440
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,960
It's my thing to take care of plants.

441
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,800
Why is she kneeling?

442
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,080
What's she doing?

443
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:04,960
Hou Chi.

444
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,120
Will you marry me?

445
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,640
Put the ring on my finger again

446
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,400
if you will.

447
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,920
I know I won't get the wrong person.

448
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,080
They are just beginning to date.

449
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,360
Isn't it too soon for them to get married?

450
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,760
Shi Xia has just come of age.

451
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,680
No,

452
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,280
they are not getting married.

453
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,200
Devil Lord.

454
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,360
It's your sister's choice.

455
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,680
Hou Chi.

456
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,960
Go home with me.
