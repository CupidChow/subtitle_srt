My Dear Brothers
EP31

2
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,440
It's a dream anyway.

3
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,080
I can do whatever I want.

4
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,120
So sweet.

5
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,200
So real.

6
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,600
It's super friendly experience like 4D and VR.

7
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,920
(She is roaring drunk.)

8
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,720
(It's not safe to leave her alone.)

9
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,160
(I'd better wait until she sobers up.)

10
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,800
Should I get you some hangover remedy?

11
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,040
I don't need hangover remedy.

12
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,720
It was hard to dream of you.

13
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,080
Time is limited.

14
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,320
I must seize the time to realize my dream.

15
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,800
Realize your dream?

16
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,320
I want to go to the moon.

17
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,720
It's the moon.

18
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,600
We are really on the moon now.

19
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Since you are so good,

20
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,880
let me tell you a story.

21
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,440
Once upon a time,

22
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,160
there was a lonely girl.

23
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,960
One day she met Peter Pan who could fly.

24
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,200
Peter Pan held her hand

25
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,160
flying out the window.

26
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,080
He took her travel in the dark sky,

27
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,840
and chased the moon and stars.

28
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,000
The girl came to Peter Pan's world,

29
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,080
and took a big adventure with him.

30
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,440
By the time she got home,

31
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,720
all her family was back.

32
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,320
When I was a child,

33
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,160
I always dreamed about meeting Peter Pan

34
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,920
and taking an adventure with him.

35
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,440
Maybe when I got back,

36
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,360
my family could also come back safe and sound.

37
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,480
In the past,

38
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,640
I thought you were my Peter Pan.

39
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,640
I came to your world.

40
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,800
But you don't remember me.

41
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,760
(My body can't hold on much longer.)

42
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,840
(When I enter Celestial Palace tomorrow,)

43
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,760
(I will tell Shen Guan the truth.)

44
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,720
(Let her choose a more suitable man to be the head of the Alliance.)

45
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,920
(Shi Xia)

46
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,360
(Trust me.)

47
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,520
(Even if I can't be the head of the Alliance,)

48
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,400
(I will still ask Shen Guan)

49
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,960
(for the enchantment of breaking the virtual space.)

50
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,920
(I can't give you a home.)

51
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,720
(But I'll take you back to your own home.)

52
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,800
Be gentle.

53
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,720
Brother

54
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,840
Brother

55
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,440
I won't let you die in vain.

56
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,040
I must revenge.

57
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,440
Shi Xia

58
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,080
I gave up my Holy Root for you.

59
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,120
Why would I still lose you?

60
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,560
Why is it unfair to me?

61
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,280
How long will you be depressed?

62
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,720
Piss off.

63
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,760
I didn't bring you back

64
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,280
to drown your sorrows.

65
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,000
What you're going through right now

66
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,800
is far less than what I've gone through in the past.

67
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,000
How can you be so depressed here?

68
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,280
Did I suffer less than you?

69
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,200
Over these years,

70
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,600
I have endured ridicule and scorn from those around me.

71
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,200
I was humiliated to stay in Yuhua Sect

72
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,880
for the purpose of having the Holy Root one day,

73
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,720
and gain their approval.

74
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,160
Till now, I realized that

75
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,440
it's him.

76
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:57,600
It's Yuan Zhao who gave my Holy Root to Hou Chi.

77
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,360
What?

78
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,040
Hou Chi's Holy Root is yours?

79
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,680
My father lied to me.

80
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,120
My brother

81
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,120
took everything that belong to me.

82
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,120
He killed the one I love the most.

83
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,800
I'm completely

84
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,800
a joke now.

85
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,000
I thought that after Yuan Zhao abandoned me and my mother

86
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,720
and chose you,

87
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,720
he would be responsible.

88
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,000
What was done is done.

89
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,040
It won't help that you're here to languish in pain.

90
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,320
Hou Chi's Holy Root belongs to you.

91
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,120
The head of Immortals Alliance should also be yours.

92
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,760
Shi Xia, of course, should be yours.

93
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,840
They're the ones who made you lose everything

94
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,000
and your beloved one,

95
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,320
leaving you with nothing.

96
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,920
Tell me.

97
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,720
Will you get over with it?

98
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,840
I won't.

99
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,200
So do I.

100
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,880
Why don't we join forces

101
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,040
and destroy them

102
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,880
to revenge for Shi Xia and Devil Lord.

103
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,760
How about that?

104
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,600
I was drunk yesterday.

105
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,320
Who took me home?

106
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,040
It's impossible.

107
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,800
It must be a dream.

108
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,960
Hou Chi would not be here.

109
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,080
Qing Feng

110
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,480
Shi Xia

111
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,120
Why are you up so early?

112
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,320
You were drunk last night.

113
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,960
I thought you would get up till noon.

114
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,960
Did you take me home?

115
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,560
Yeah, why?

116
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,760
Nothing.

117
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,280
I must be so lonely lately

118
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,680
that my erotic dream seemed so real.

119
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,520
What dream is so clear?

120
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,720
Nightmare.

121
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,960
The sequela after falling down the cliff.

122
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,800
It's creepy.

123
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,480
Did you drink?

124
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,280
Me?

125
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,200
There's nothing to upset me.

126
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,760
Why did I drink?

127
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,360
It's Qing Feng.

128
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,600
She argued with Yi Yaogua.

129
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,560
Qing Feng, this is the soup I made for you to sober up.

130
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,760
Don't drown your sorrows in drink again.

131
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,960
Those guys have done too far.

132
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,160
They said they don't recognize

133
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,280
the head of the Alliance from Yuhua Sect.

134
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,480
Not only did they not attend the ceremony,

135
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,960
but they did not want to listen to your orders as well.

136
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,000
When you arrived at Celestial Palace

137
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,240
and take up the post of the head of the Alliance,

138
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,520
they dare not come.

139
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,840
The day has finally come.

140
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,400
When Hou Chi enters Celestial Palace,

141
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,280
everything will be over.

142
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,200
Hong.

143
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,040
Hong.

144
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,040
Hong.

145
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,200
Devil Lord.

146
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,960
You can get all kinds of herbs in my home.

147
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,440
Why you have to come out to pick herbs.

148
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,440
You're a dead man now.

149
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,080
If you are spotted,

150
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,640
you're screwed.

151
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,200
What are you doing?

152
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,440
I want to use your Holy Mirror.

153
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,600
Give it back to me.

154
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,360
Do you think I'm just hanging out?

155
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,400
I come out to get down to business.

156
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,640
You're a dead man.

157
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,600
What can you do?

158
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,920
Today is Hou Chi's Succession Ceremony.

159
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,840
Although Shi Xia

160
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,720
said nothing,

161
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,880
she must have been thinking about it.

162
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,400
I have to help her

163
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,480
capture the highlight moment of Hou Chi,

164
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
so she won't have regrets.

165
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,200
Master Hou Chi stabbed you.

166
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:12,920
Don't you hate him?

167
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,520
The Love-forgetting Potion

168
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,200
was hand-fed to him by my sister.

169
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,080
I can't blame Hou Chi entirely.

170
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,040
It's all over now.

171
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,200
The most important thing now

172
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,760
is not to leave Shi Xia any regrets.

173
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,440
Shi Xia won't have any regrets,

174
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,520
but I am going to be scolded badly by Qing Feng.

175
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,360
Give Holy Mirror back to me.

176
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,120
It's up to you.

177
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,160
Give it back.

178
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,200
Even ten times as many of you

179
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,120
wouldn't stop me.

180
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,240
Take your men and leave, Immortal Aunt.

181
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,480
I know I can't stop you.

182
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,280
I come here today

183
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,840
to make a deal with you.

184
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,720
That's my master's whisk.

185
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,640
What did you do to him?

186
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,800
He's fine now,

187
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,240
but just poisoned.

188
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,720
But how will he be after

189
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,840
depends on you.

190
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,880
What do you want from me?

191
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,920
Use your Holy Root

192
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,080
to change your master's life.

193
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,760
What do you say?

194
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,680
When the loved disciple leaves,

195
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,760
the master secretly sees him off.

196
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,000
Your affections are really deep.

197
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,960
Hong

198
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,520
You lured me here

199
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,560
and trapped me down.

200
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,240
What is it for?

201
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,320
You used my Holy Root

202
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,120
to cultivate Hou Chi for over 200 years.

203
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,600
As you hoped,

204
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
he is now the head of the Alliance.

205
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,240
Shouldn't I, the master of the Holy Root,

206
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,920
congratulate you?

207
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,560
I did lie to you about a lot of things.

208
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,040
But everything

209
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,480
was all for you.

210
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,040
Shut up.

211
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,800
For me?

212
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,440
You took my Holy Root and killed my lover,

213
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,640
and made me become a devil in public.

214
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,040
Tell me,

215
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,520
what did you do for me?

216
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,560
I can't say it now.

217
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,480
After today,

218
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,480
only one day,

219
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,080
you'll know everything.

220
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,560
It's enough.

221
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,440
From the moment I joined Devil Sect,

222
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,960
you are no longer my father.

223
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,080
I won't let you have

224
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,120
what you want.

225
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,440
You want Hou Chi to be the head of the Alliance.

226
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,040
I will spare no effort to stop it.

227
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,640
You want to use my life

228
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,760
to stop Hou Chi to enter Celestial Palace.

229
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,600
I want to see that

230
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,680
in Hou Chi's mind,

231
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,200
it's you that matter a lot,

232
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,640
or the power?

233
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:49,960
Have you decided yet?

234
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,480
When Yuan Zhao is attacked by the poison,

235
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,640
even if you give me the Holy Root,

236
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,480
I won't be able to help you.

237
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,720
No matter what will happen tomorrow,

238
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,680
you have to enter Celestial Palace.

239
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,760
Proceed on our way.

240
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,440
Hou Chi

241
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,080
You need to think about that clearly.

242
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,440
If you take one more step,

243
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,600
your master will die.

244
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,160
I have promised my master.

245
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,400
I must enter Celestial Palace.

246
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,960
Today, anyone and anything

247
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,440
won't stop me.

248
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:40,840
Wait.

249
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,840
I can't negotiate with the head of the Alliance

250
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,480
with just a few chips.

251
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,000
You can leave your master's life alone.

252
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,920
But what about the people in the Otherworld Town

253
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,520
and the lives of all cultivators?

254
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,680
Can you ignore them as well?

255
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,880
Why is the sky so dark?

256
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
What happened?

257
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,120
There is a bad sign in the heaven.

258
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,360
The Thunder Kill Array.

259
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,000
If you don't comply today,

260
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,920
all people in The Town

261
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,560
will die.

262
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,720
Devil Lord.

263
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,160
It's going to rain.

264
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,360
Maybe we should go back.

265
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,640
Stop dillydallying.

266
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,920
What are you afraid of?

267
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,240
Go.

268
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,120
-Your Majesty  -Your Majesty

269
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,640
Your Majesty

270
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,280
Your Majesty

271
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Your Majesty

272
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,920
What happened to you three?

273
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,320
Is Qiu Li sick again?

274
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,880
She has gone completely mad.

275
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,120
She took Bi Hong

276
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,880
to arrange The Thunder Kill Array in The Otherworld Town.

277
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,840
The Thunder Kill Array

278
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,320
We're screwed.

279
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,760
The Thunder Kill Array

280
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,040
can destroy everyone

281
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,800
and everything.

282
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,880
Sh*t!

283
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,640
Shi Xia is still in The Town.

284
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,800
Hurry up.

285
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,560
-Run.  -Run.

286
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,760
Why haven't Shi Dong and Yi Yaogua come back yet?

287
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,160
Are they alright?

288
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,640
Oh, my god!

289
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,680
Is that the anger of Zeus?

290
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,640
My God!

291
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,960
Someone had arranged the Thunder Kill Array in the Otherworld Town.

292
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,440
The Thunder Kill Array?

293
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,200
The kill array

294
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,240
can destroy everything.

295
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,440
Everyone in this town

296
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,280
will be struck by lightning.

297
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,040
The Thunder Kill Array has been launched.

298
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,720
When the clouds are full of lightning,

299
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,240
it will strike all the Town.

300
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,440
Hou Chi

301
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,960
There is not much time

302
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,160
for you.

303
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:06,800
I accept.

304
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,920
But you must spare these apprentices behind me.

305
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,560
You can rest assured.

306
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,160
I'm only interested in your Holy Root,

307
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,000
not theirs.

308
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,200
Go to The Otherworld Town quickly,

309
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,480
and tell the elders of Immortals Gate

310
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,280
to protect the people in the Town.

311
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,320
But, you...

312
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:27,920
Just go.

313
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,000
Yes, sir.

314
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,480
I said yes.

315
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,360
You can remove the killing array.

316
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,120
I won't remove it

317
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,840
until I get Holy Root.

318
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,600
You have great accomplishments.

319
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,520
If you change your mind halfway,

320
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,640
it will completely ruin all my efforts.

321
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,040
This powder

322
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,560
can temporarily seal off your meridians

323
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,360
and keep you from using your ability.

324
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,280
The powder

325
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,800
will not only paralyze you,

326
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,080
but soon,

327
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,040
can make you soundless.

328
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,480
What are you waiting for?

329
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,200
No hurry.

330
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,920
There's someone more suitable than me to do this.

331
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,360
Why do you

332
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,320
have the protective restraints of the Yuhua Sect?

333
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,200
Shi Dong and Yi Yaogua are still out there.

334
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,360
I have to find them.

335
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,400
I'll go with you.

336
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,800
Devil Lady

337
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,520
-Devil Lady  -Devil Lady

338
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,000
Devil Lady

339
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,720
You're still alive.

340
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:20,680
My brother?

341
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,040
Qing Feng

342
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,320
There's a self-defense charm in this ring.

343
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,920
It was Hou Chi who saved us that day.

344
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,400
Are you hiding something from me?

345
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,840
If you still regard me as your friend,

346
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,880
tell me the truth.

347
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,120
That day,

348
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,280
it was Master Hou Chi who saved you.

349
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,880
Go quickly.

350
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,280
It's dangerous.

351
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,800
The man who killed Master Yuan Gui

352
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,120
is not my brother.

353
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,200
I only believe my eyes.

354
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,800
You've drunk Love-forgetting Potion

355
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,800
and became a real heartless man.

356
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,920
Senior

357
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,040
Junior

358
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,760
I come here to remove your Holy Root.

359
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,440
Are you shocked?

360
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,680
Shi Xia

361
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,440
Yes.

362
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,200
I did it to revenge for Shi Xia.

363
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,040
However,

364
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,520
I did it more for myself.

365
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,280
Because your Holy Root

366
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,680
is originally mine.

367
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:54,960
It's Yuan Zhao

368
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,800
who removed my Holy Root

369
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,960
to you.

370
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,640
Everything you've ever had in your life

371
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,800
was taken from me.

372
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,240
When you had Love Calamity,

373
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,160
I could have killed you

374
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,200
to recapture my Holy Root.

375
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,800
But for Shi Xia,

376
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,520
I let you go.

377
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,680
I can forgive everything

378
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,320
that happened before.

379
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,560
I can give you all my glory.

380
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,800
I just want Shi Xia.

381
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,400
I had already made a deal with her.

382
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,680
We will stay away from Immortals Sect

383
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,160
and live as normal people.

384
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,920
But you killed her.

385
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,000
It's you who took my last hope.

386
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,360
I won't tolerate you anymore.

387
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,160
Senior

388
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,640
Now you're begging me,

389
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,200
but it's too late.
