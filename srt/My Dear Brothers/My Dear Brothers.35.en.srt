My Dear Brothers
EP35

2
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,400
The Otherworld Array is going
through havoc.

3
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,880
Go with me now. It needs protection.

4
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,080
Forget it. It has been destroyed.

5
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,760
There's nothing you can do now.

6
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,320
Keep doing this

7
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,600
will only deplete all your power

8
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,360
to death.

9
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,040
When the array is destroyed,

10
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,320
The immortal World will be gone.

11
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,800
No

12
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,240
Everyone comes over and wields your force
to guard the palace!

13
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,720
Quick!

14
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,040
Shi Dong.

15
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,000
Concentrate.

16
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,160
Brother, don't be scared.

17
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,000
Soon we will be together forever.

18
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,320
I will be with you.

19
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,760
Those people

20
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,080
will go down the grave with us.

21
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,680
Qiu Li.

22
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,200
I know you hate this world.

23
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,960
But there is no need to ruin this place.

24
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,320
We can leave.

25
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,480
You can go to my world.

26
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,840
Your world?

27
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,680
Yes.

28
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,000
I will protect you.

29
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,800
I won't leave you.

30
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,440
Shi Dong.

31
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,320
I don't believe in you.

32
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,200
Brother.

33
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,320
Brother, are you okay?

34
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,600
I'm sorry.

35
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,600
I didn't mean to.

36
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,720
I don't mean to hurt you.

37
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,520
As long as you are unharmed.

38
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,720
Brother.

39
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,960
I'm sorry.

40
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:15,800
Brother.

41
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,840
Are you okay?

42
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,520
Yeah.

43
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,200
Shi Dong, you liar!

44
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,360
I'd rather die with you

45
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,880
than see you being with another woman.

46
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,480
Shi Xia.

47
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,320
You chose her, right?

48
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,720
Then she must die.

49
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,680
Qiu Li, don't let her control you anymore.

50
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,360
Be who you really are.

51
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,880
Qiu Li, please.

52
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,880
This is not you.

53
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,080
Brother.

54
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,520
Bai Li.

55
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,520
No.

56
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,280
Shi Dong.

57
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,720
You thought that loser would come and save you?

58
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,800
I'll kill you both today.

59
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,680
Go to hell!

60
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,760
Brother.

61
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,680
Qiu Li.

62
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,800
Qiu Li.

63
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:14,960
Brother.

64
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,040
Brother.

65
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,120
I believe in you now.

66
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,800
I will never hurt you.

67
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,120
I love you the most.

68
00:08:59,280 --> 00:08:59,920
Qiu Li.

69
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,920
But I

70
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,160
I am running out of time.

71
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,600
This is what I can do for you, my brother.

72
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:18,760
No.

73
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,080
One last thing.

74
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,160
Qiu Li.

75
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,800
Qiu Li.

76
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,320
Brother.

77
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,920
You are the best thing

78
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,400
that has ever happened to me.

79
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,800
Dear brother.

80
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,840
You are my favorite.

81
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,360
My brother.

82
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,440
Can you

83
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,480
call me sister?

84
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,240
Sister.

85
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,240
Don't worry.

86
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,320
What's happening?

87
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,840
It's okay. I'm with you.

88
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,480
Qiu Li.

89
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,200
Brother.

90
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,920
You are the only one

91
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,840
that is good to me.

92
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,080
I will do anything for you.

93
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,720
Brother.

94
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,360
Qiu Li.

95
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,080
Qiu Li.

96
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,080
Qiu Li.

97
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,560
Qiu Li.

98
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,600
Qiu Li.

99
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,320
Hang in there.

100
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,600
Father.

101
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,720
Stay with the array.

102
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:53,800
I'm fine.

103
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,080
Don't worry.

104
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,160
The array is reaching its limit.

105
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,320
We must turn on the switch

106
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,160
to stop the apocalypse.

107
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,960
Go!

108
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,840
Go!

109
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,240
Master.

110
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,480
Safeguard the array.

111
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,840
Junior.

112
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,680
Listen to the Master.

113
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,200
Hou Chi.

114
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,160
Bi Hong.

115
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,560
Actually,

116
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,760
I've seen you both

117
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,240
as my sons.

118
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,360
I'm sorry.

119
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,960
No.

120
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,280
It's my bad. I failed to keep you safe.

121
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,280
No.

122
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,640
Father.

123
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,040
Father.

124
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,000
Father.

125
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,720
Master.

126
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,080
Junior.

127
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,480
Hou Chi.

128
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,840
It's time.

129
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,120
Junior.

130
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,120
Senior.

131
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,280
Take care.

132
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,240
Senior.

133
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,480
Senior.

134
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,840
Senior.

135
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,920
The Otherworld array has been initiated.

136
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,480
The doom is coming.

137
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,480
You must finish the sacrifice
as early as possible

138
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,000
to stop the catastrophe.

139
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,760
Lord Shen Guan.

140
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,520
The enchantment of breaking the virtual
space is carved in the array.

141
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,080
Cast it,

142
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,720
you and the array will be as one.

143
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,880
And Bi Hong's Holy Perception

144
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,320
will finish its last part.

145
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,080
To all of you,

146
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,040
my flesh and my cultivation have gone
after I die.

147
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,880
Along with my last bit of soul

148
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,760
attached to the array.

149
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,880
So, I earnestly ask all of you

150
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,160
to stop this calamity and save our world.

151
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,360
Come.

152
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,760
Escort me into the array.

153
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,720
Senior.

154
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:56,680
Stay still.

155
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,440
To activate the Holy Perception,

156
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,880
you've shattered your arteries.

157
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:11,240
I've tried so hard to cultivate for
two hundred years.

158
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,880
It gets me where I am today.

159
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,640
I have nothing more to ask for.

160
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,800
Junior.

161
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,280
The only one I am worried about

162
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,240
is you.

163
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,360
Take care of yourself, please.

164
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,000
And keep Shi Xia unharmed.

165
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,520
Senior.

166
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,000
Senior.

167
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,800
I am the owner of my destiny.

168
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,160
True.

169
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,440
We die for those who understand us the most.

170
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,120
I was lucky to have you.

171
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,280
Shi Xia.

172
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,360
I've moved on.

173
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,000
But I still can't get you off my mind.

174
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,040
Bi Hong's Holy Perception

175
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,920
is back to Hou Chi. Why would that happen?

176
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Maybe as Hou Chi said,
he and Bi Hong were bound together.

177
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,520
That's why when Bi Hong died,

178
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,160
the Perception naturally gets back to him.

179
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,640
Senior.

180
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,360
We've fixed our Magic Umbrella.

181
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,000
I told you

182
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,760
our destiny was tied together.

183
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,440
It was our common mission to protect the array.

184
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,360
I will finish it for us.

185
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,560
You promised you would look after my sister.

186
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,800
I told Hou Chi that

187
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,000
if I could protect my family and
the only one I love,

188
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,160
He could do what he should do to protect this world.

189
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,600
Sister, if you stay here for him,

190
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,080
what if he dies?

191
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:07,800
Before that,

192
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,400
I will send you home.

193
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,920
Be safe and sound.

194
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:20,720
I will.

195
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,120
Hou Chi, don't forget

196
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,800
our contract.

197
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,720
Take it.

198
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,240
This doll will be with you.

199
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,120
I don't need this

200
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,240
and I don't need brother, either.

201
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,240
Shi Xia.

202
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,440
Your gift.

203
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,000
This is me and that is you.

204
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,920
I will stick to my contract

205
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,880
and be by your side through
thick and thin.

206
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,320
Hou Chi.

207
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,960
I'm back. For real.

208
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,560
You are awake!

209
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,520
You are back, too.

210
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,640
Well, I have to. I was working,

211
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,040
then I got a phone call from
your classmate.

212
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,720
She said you fainted in the amusement park.

213
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,080
So, I asked for a leave and rushed home.

214
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,440
What are you talking about?

215
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,360
Didn't we time travel to the Immortal World?

216
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,600
Time travel?

217
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,480
Aren't you here?

218
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,560
You fool.

219
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,320
Shi Dong.

220
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,120
You disappeared.

221
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,920
I looked for you for a whole year.

222
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,480
When did you get back?

223
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,480
Disappeared?

224
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,520
Would you just say something nice?

225
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,520
When did I disappear?

226
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,200
Her fever was gone.

227
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,160
Why she kept talking nonsense?

228
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,480
Shi Dong, what is it?

229
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,160
You fell into a water puddle

230
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,760
and your bag was soaked
when you were back.

231
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,640
It was in the bag.

232
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,520
Where are you going?

233
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,840
Your porridge!
