My Dear Brothers
EP24

2
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,440
Brother

3
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,200
Brother

4
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,800
Brother

5
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:44,920
Watch out!

6
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,320
Shi Dong!

7
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,040
Where is Devil Lord?

8
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,320
Shi Dong

9
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:17,960
Brother?

10
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,360
Brother!

11
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:24,920
Shi Dong

12
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,840
Are you kidding me again?

13
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,600
You've done this countless times,

14
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,240
but I won't trust you this time.

15
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,240
I saw that

16
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,040
the Holy Power Needle didn't hurt your vital part yesterday.

17
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,200
You will be safe and sound.

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,160
If you don't wake up,

19
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,080
I'll disown you!

20
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:53,880
Brother

21
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,000
Wake up, brother.

22
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,760
Don't scare me.

23
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,200
I promise I won't get angry

24
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,960
or fight with you

25
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,160
as long as you wake up.

26
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,400
Please, brother.

27
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,080
Brother

28
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,640
Mom and dad went away,

29
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,080
and now even you?

30
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,200
You've deserted me once.

31
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,440
Don't do that again, please.

32
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,440
What are you talking about?

33
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,320
When did I ever desert you?

34
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,080
Brother

35
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,800
Immortal Venerable Hou Chi,

36
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,600
thank you for using your power to cure his Majesty.

37
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,720
Well,

38
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,440
I'll look after him.

39
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,840
The shot didn't hit the vital part,

40
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,920
but after all Devil Lord isn't immortal.

41
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,280
He has to take medicine on time and nurse his body well.

42
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,760
Ok, ok.

43
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,040
See you.

44
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,240
Shi Xia is going back to the Yuhua Sect with me.

45
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,520
Devil Lord doesn't spend much time with his sister.

46
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,480
Just leave them alone for a while.

47
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,280
I knew it.

48
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,920
You are kidding me again.

49
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,920
When did I do that?

50
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,920
I really got a hurt this time.

51
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,360
It's killing me.

52
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
Does it still hurt?

53
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,240
Yeah.

54
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,960
Of course.

55
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,400
There are no painkillers in this place.

56
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,360
I'll go to Senior Bi Hong

57
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,120
to get some.

58
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:28,920
Wait,

59
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,240
what did you mean?

60
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,560
When did I desert you?

61
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,920
You forgot it,

62
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,640
so never mind.

63
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,360
No, no,

64
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,280
don't put me in the wrong.

65
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,880
If you don't make it clear,

66
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,400
you're just making it up.

67
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,480
Put you in the wrong?

68
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,040
When have I ever wronged you?

69
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,960
Do you remember?

70
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,080
When I was seven,

71
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,280
you took me to the ferris wheel at a fairground.

72
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,920
You've been picking up plastic bottles for a long time

73
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,160
to buy tickets.

74
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,440
It was a weekend.

75
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,560
The amusement park was very crowded.

76
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,160
We had to line up for the ride.

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,800
Brother

78
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,800
Brother!

79
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,320
Brother!

80
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,400
Brother...

81
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,120
Brother

82
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,960
Brother, where are you?

83
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,120
I waited for you all night.

84
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,760
But at the end, I only got aunt and uncle to pick me.

85
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,280
Well,

86
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,960
can it be that he run away

87
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,720
because he is unwilling to be adopted?

88
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,120
Shi Dong loves his sister the most,

89
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,800
he won't leave her alone.

90
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,240
Why not?

91
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,200
If he wants to be on his own,

92
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,560
Shi Xia will be a liability.

93
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,520
What?

94
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,040
You waited at the amusement park all night?

95
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,360
I thought you abandoned me,

96
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,800
feeling sad for a long time.

97
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,480
Then uncle brought you back.

98
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,400
Good for you.

99
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,160
You ate and drank

100
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,280
like nothing happened.

101
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,040
Silly girl.

102
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,040
It's not what you thought.

103
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,840
It's not?

104
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,000
What could it be?

105
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,000
I saved up money for the tickets

106
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,920
to bring you

107
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,880
to have fun all day.

108
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,600
You just got on the Ferris wheel

109
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,400
while I saw

110
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,200
several bullies at school

111
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,560
coming to us.

112
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,280
He's there!

113
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,280
I didn't want to put you in danger.

114
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,680
Come back, brother!

115
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,800
So I distracted them.

116
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,440
Boy, open the door!

117
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,040
Open the door!

118
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,000
You won't come out?

119
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,320
Then stay there forever!

120
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,160
Hello? Let me out!

121
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,600
You were at the amusement park that night too?

122
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,680
Sorry.

123
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,160
I haven't thought we'd be trapped,

124
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,720
and caused huge influence on you.

125
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,040
It was a misunderstanding,

126
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,320
but I cared about it for so long.

127
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,320
Silly me.

128
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,560
Shi Xia dared to take my brother from me.

129
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,120
I'm gonna kill her!

130
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,120
No,

131
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,800
you can't kill people.

132
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,720
You can't kill Shi Xia.

133
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,080
Bai Li

134
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,280
Don't stop me.

135
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,240
You can't.

136
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,360
No way!

137
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,040
No,

138
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,120
you can't do that.

139
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,800
Shi Xia is a good girl.

140
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,880
You, you can do that.

141
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,560
She...

142
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,880
Is she...?

143
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,440
Yes,

144
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,200
the dissociation of personality.

145
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,480
She was abused by Qiu Ping as a child.

146
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,000
That is her way

147
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,200
to protect herself.

148
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,120
Brother

149
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,120
Brother

150
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,920
Let me out!

151
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,840
Let me out!

152
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,000
Brother

153
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,080
You mustn't let her out.

154
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,360
She'll hurt you.

155
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,840
Don't let her out, ok?

156
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,320
Don't listen to her.

157
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,600
Let me out!

158
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,240
Let me out!

159
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,640
Shi Xia

160
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,440
I will kill you!

161
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,040
Let's go.

162
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,400
Brother

163
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:45,840
Brother

164
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,240
I think

165
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,920
it won' t work

166
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,960
to lock her up.

167
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,080
I don't want, either.

168
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,880
But she'll hurt someone

169
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,320
if I let her out.

170
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,920
Who started the trouble should end it.

171
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,400
I'm the one who made her sick.

172
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,400
If I leave Devil Sect,

173
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,400
I wonder if she gets better and faster.

174
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,680
Don't you just wanna go back to Yuhua Sect with Hou Chi?

175
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,920
You can't bear to leave Devil Sect,

176
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,320
while I can't bear to leave Hou Chi.

177
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,000
I'll go back to Yuhua Sect with Hou Chi,

178
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,320
and you'll stay to look after Qiu Li.

179
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,720
Let's do this for each other, isn't it good?

180
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,040
You go to date,

181
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,440
while I look after patient.

182
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,400
It's not for each other, but just for you.

183
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,280
It will rain. Sister will be married.

184
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,440
This is the law of nature.

185
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,040
Married?!

186
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,520
You just date him!

187
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,280
No way.

188
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,520
I didn't say that.

189
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,280
How will you let me go with Hou Chi?

190
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,360
It depends on your performance.

191
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:51,840
Brother

192
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,920
You were hurt.

193
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,920
Walk slowly.

194
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,680
Yue

195
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,840
Yue

196
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,080
Don't call me that.

197
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,520
You don't deserve to be my father,

198
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,960
and you don't deserve to be my brother.

199
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,400
Sooner or later,

200
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,880
I'll kill you sooner or later!

201
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,040
Yue

202
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,720
Come back to Yuhua Sect with me.

203
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,560
I'll definitely find a way to cure you.

204
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,520
Get away!

205
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,040
If you break this ward today,

206
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,680
I'll tell the world

207
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,120
about your scandal!

208
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,560
I'll make you thoroughly discredited!

209
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,040
(As long as she's locked up here,)

210
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
(no one will know that)

211
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,320
(I killed the elder Yuan Gui.)

212
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,680
(Maybe it's better for everyone)

213
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,800
(to maintain the present status.)

214
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,080
Father

215
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,280
She's very unstable right now.

216
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,560
If we take her by force,

217
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,640
we'll irritate her,

218
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,040
and she'll cause some problems.

219
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,520
I think we'd better to let her stay here,

220
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,080
and give the matter further thought.

221
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,560
All right.

222
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,400
You people almost recover.

223
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,320
We've stayed at Devil Sect for a long time.

224
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,560
There are many things to prepare

225
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,720
before the accession of Hou Chi.

226
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,480
So

227
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,960
we will return to

228
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,760
Yuhua Sect tomorrow.

229
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,360
Master

230
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,440
Master Hou Chi and Qing Feng just recover from injuries.

231
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,080
It's not good for them to use force to control sword flying.

232
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,280
So is trudging.

233
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,880
I wanna rent a better carriage

234
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,840
to replace walking.

235
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,400
It's rare that you have the compassion for your fellows.

236
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,520
Just do as you say.

237
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,120
Thank you, Master.

238
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,120
Master

239
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,840
I have one more request.

240
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,800
Go ahead.

241
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,800
During these days,

242
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,520
I finally figure out.

243
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,200
I want to be with Shi Xia forever.

244
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
So I ask you

245
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,160
to allow her to go back Yuhua Sect with us, please.

246
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,280
You're brother and sister,

247
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,040
of course you should be together.

248
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,160
Besides,

249
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,560
Shi Xia is an apprentice of Yuhua Sect.

250
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,680
She should go back with us.

251
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,840
Master

252
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,960
-I mean...  -Junior

253
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,840
Shi Xia is your sister,

254
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,120
but also Devil Lord's.

255
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,280
If you wanna take her away,

256
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,440
you should get the permission of Devil Lord.

257
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,480
You're right.

258
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,080
I'll go and talk with him.

259
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,120
Come on, we have milk tea here,

260
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,320
one immortal coin per cup.

261
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,080
Come and taste it!

262
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,760
Brother

263
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,680
It's hot.

264
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,600
Allow me fan you.

265
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,440
Walking outside is good for health,

266
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,840
so I can recover soon.

267
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:52,960
Indeed.

268
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,240
Are you tired?

269
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,440
Have a rest here.

270
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,360
Nah,

271
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,760
I only

272
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,520
feel thirsty.

273
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,040
I have already prepared it for you.

274
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,600
Whatever you're given, you pay for.

275
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,680
Pretty good.

276
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,920
Sister

277
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,000
Master allowed you to return to the Yuhua Sect with me.

278
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,880
Great!

279
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,440
Let's go.

280
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,040
Your master said yes,

281
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,640
but your blood brother didn't!

282
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,080
Devil Lord

283
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,320
Sister destines to be married.

284
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,440
The responsibility of a brother

285
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,560
is to walk his sister down

286
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,320
to someone.

287
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,160
You have to accept it.

288
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,840
Brother

289
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,800
He's right.

290
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,960
It will rain. Sister will be married.

291
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,240
This is the law of nature.

292
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,000
What?

293
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,600
Who said this nonsense?

294
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:10,560
Well,

295
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,720
I thought they were brother and sister at first.

296
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,640
I'm sorry, your Majesty.

297
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,000
He said that, not me.

298
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,160
It's not a law of nature

299
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,080
in my family!

300
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,280
It's not.

301
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,160
Then what's the law in your family?

302
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,200
Let me know,

303
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,560
and I will obey it.

304
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,120
I hear you.

305
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,160
These are temporary memorial tablets of mom and dad.

306
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,280
Father, mother.

307
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,600
I'm unfilial.

308
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,440
I didn't look after Shi Xia carefully.

309
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,560
She falls in love at such a young age.

310
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,720
More than that,

311
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,840
her boyfriend is a 200-year-old man!

312
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,520
I'm not able to stop it,

313
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,280
so I take him to see you.

314
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,640
200 years old

315
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,280
is nothing for a cultivator.

316
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,400
Besides,

317
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,760
I even look younger than you.

318
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,040
How dare you talk back to me here?

319
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,200
I'm telling you,

320
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,080
My parents are much more grave than me.

321
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,760
And they're strict with my sister.

322
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,160
When they were alive,

323
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,360
they never allowed Shi Xia to date,

324
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,000
you know?

325
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,840
I was only seven when they were alive.

326
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,040
I mean,

327
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,000
my parents love Shi Xia so much.

328
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,320
The requirements for future son-in-law

329
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,600
are also very strict.

330
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,600
According to the rules of our hometown,

331
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,920
a girl should first

332
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,600
bring her boyfriend to parents.

333
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,000
It's a pity that my parents passed away,

334
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,120
so I brought you here to worship them.

335
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,080
You can regard it as an interview.

336
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,080
The door closed!

337
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,840
I guess my parents aren't satisfied with you.

338
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,560
They don't agree with your relationship!

339
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,200
Shi Dong

340
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,760
Enough.

341
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,960
Hou Chi

342
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,120
Don't listen to him.

343
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,120
My parents were nice.

344
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,480
If they're alive,

345
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
they must like you.

346
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,400
If they aren't satisfied,

347
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,040
there's no way that I allow Shi Xia to go with you,

348
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:26,680
you know?

349
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,200
Then what should I do

350
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,440
to please them?

351
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,040
Not unless you swear in front of them.

352
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,480
If you treat her

353
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,680
with no good,

354
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,840
and if she has any grievance,

355
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,480
you'll lose your most important thing!

356
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,000
Ok.

357
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,320
I swear.

358
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,600
I will devote myself to Shi Xia,

359
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,920
and never let her down.

360
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,440
If I break my oath,

361
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,600
I will...

362
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,840
no more Cotton Candy for me.

363
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,040
Cotton Candy?

364
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,440
Are you kidding me?

365
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,640
I'm serious.

366
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,120
How can Cotton Candy

367
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,040
compare with my sister?

368
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,000
I'll give you another chance.

369
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,240
Say it again.

370
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,080
But

371
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,480
Cotton Candy

372
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,000
is the most precious thing for me

373
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,120
except for Shi Xia.

374
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,960
Sister, look at him!

375
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,040
He's not sincere in the least.

376
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,120
You still want him?

377
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,800
Yeah.

378
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,440
What do you think

379
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,040
I should swear to show my sincerity?

380
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,000
Say...

381
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,040
... If you break your oath,

382
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,000
you will be usurped

383
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,240
when you become head of the Alliance.

384
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,680
Say it.

385
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,200
I swear.

386
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,520
I will devote myself to Shi Xia,

387
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,880
and never let her down.

388
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,720
If I break my oath,

389
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,880
I will lose my lordship.

390
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,720
That's more like it.

391
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,320
However,

392
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,840
I still think Cotton Candy is more important.

393
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,200
That's it.

394
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,320
He visited mom and dad,

395
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,480
and made the oath.

396
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,000
Can we leave?

397
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,480
Mom and dad are satisfied.

398
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,440
But your blood brother,

399
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,680
I'm not.

400
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,400
As the saying goes,

401
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,360
"The eldest brother is like father."

402
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,600
Parents are gone.

403
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm the head of the family.

404
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,680
As a son-in-law,

405
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,240
he should serve me tea,

406
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,560
and call me brother.

407
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,720
Am I right?

408
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,800
Yeah.

409
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,960
It's too hot!

410
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,480
Look what you did!

411
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,880
He even blew it!

412
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,640
Are you winding me up?

413
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,040
You don't want to take Shi Xia with you, do you?

414
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,880
How can that be?

415
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,840
We're just joking.

416
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,880
How can we make you neglected?

417
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,320
Hot, cold, room temperature and with ice.

418
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,000
Hou Chi already prepared for you.

419
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,080
Brother

420
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,960
Please drink tea.

421
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,400
Have a seat.

422
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,080
Sit down.

423
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,560
Now that you've called me brother,

424
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,440
I have some rules for you two.

425
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,400
What else do you want?

426
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,680
Listen carefully.

427
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,280
The first three are specifically aimed at you.

428
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,040
First,

429
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,280
you can't be biased.

430
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,840
You can't forget your brother because of your boyfriend.

431
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:58,640
Remember,

432
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,960
come back home often, come back home.

433
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,560
Stop.

434
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,200
Ok.

435
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,600
Second,

436
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,400
if he and I

437
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,440
have disagreement,

438
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,600
you have to agree with me firmly.

439
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,400
What if it's your fault?

440
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,040
Impossible!

441
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,800
All right.

442
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,400
Third,

443
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,240
if he bullies you,

444
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,520
you beat him.

445
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,240
If you can't beat him up,

446
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,480
I'll do!

447
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,000
I think you just want to beat him.

448
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,400
Don't worry, Devil Lord.

449
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,680
I will not.

450
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,440
That's not up to you,

451
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,640
but Shi Xia.

452
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,000
I promise you.

453
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,120
If I inadvertently bullied her,

454
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:49,840
I'll let you beat me,

455
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:50,960
and never strike back.

456
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,720
He has some moral integrity.

457
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,560
Yeah.

458
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,200
That's all for Shi Xia.

459
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,040
And the rest is for you.

460
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,840
As long as you let Shi Xia go,

461
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,960
I'll follow all the rules.

462
00:26:18,048 --> 00:26:20,059
(Rules of caring wife)

463
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:22,920
There are too many.

464
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,400
I won't read it one by one.

465
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,200
Read it carefully when you're home.

466
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,800
Hot pot with shrimp, I'll have "mush" money.

467
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,880
Tofu is good for you.

468
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,080
It includes collagen.

469
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,920
Hot pot, hot pot,

470
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,640
I can never taste you.

471
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,000
Do you wanna some kelp?

472
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,920
Aren't you crowded?

473
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,440
Don't forget the rules I set for you.

474
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,120
You can't be biased.

475
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,960
You have no sense of taste. Just watch me eat.

476
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,520
It's tender, spicy and numb taste.

477
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,240
Beef tripe should be boiled 15 ups and downs.

478
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,880
Tender, smooth and crunchy.

479
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,680
Shi Xia has no sense of taste,

480
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,040
and you still provoke her like that.

481
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,240
You don't understand.

482
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,720
We have a kind of happiness called mukbang.

483
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,960
Watching others enjoy the food,

484
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,960
you are very happy as if yourself are eating.

485
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,160
Right?

486
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,080
Eat more.

487
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,760
Is it good?

488
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,960
Spicy.

489
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:23,760
Drink some water.

490
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,040
Don't try to be brave if you can't eat spicy food.

491
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,920
Enough.

492
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,480
Don't forget the rules I set for you.

493
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,120
The rules!

494
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,200
Don't forget the rules I set for you.

495
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,560
You already set a pile of rules,

496
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,360
and it's not enough?

497
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,680
Yeah, it's not specific.

498
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,080
I have to make it more clear

499
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,120
according to your situation.

500
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,480
This is your first love.

501
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,080
You can't do many things in first love.

502
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,880
It's a big deal to hold hands.

503
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,360
Do you know what I'm saying?

504
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,760
We do this a lot.

505
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,200
See no evil, hear no evil,

506
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,520
speak no evil, do no evil.

507
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,800
Do you know what I'm saying in this way?

508
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,800
Don't worry, Devil Lord.

509
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,720
I observe the etiquette to Shi Xia.

510
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,640
I never cross the line.

511
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,560
The most intimate thing

512
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,640
is eating Cotton Candy for several times.

513
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,880
You said it's more important

514
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,600
than head of the Alliance.

515
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,320
What is Cotton Candy?

516
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,360
It is...

517
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,800
-I didn't ask you.  -... Cotton Candy literally.

518
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,600
You tell me.
