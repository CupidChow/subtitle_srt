00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:30,000
My Dear Brothers
EP23

2
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,120
Qiu Li is right.

3
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,480
Now,

4
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,040
the Evil Aura is filled with your heart.

5
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,800
Any mood swings

6
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,000
will cause heart pain.

7
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,680
I haven't found a way

8
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,440
to cure it yet.

9
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,640
What I can do is making some Pain Potion

10
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,600
to relieve the pain.

11
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,120
But that's not a long-term solution.

12
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,720
You must calm yourself down,

13
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,040
or it will get worse.

14
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,320
I see.

15
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,600
Don't let Shi Xia know about this.

16
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,680
I don't want her to worry.

17
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,160
Here is the potion.

18
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,160
Senior

19
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,240
Qiu Li said there was Evil Aura inside Hou Chi.

20
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,040
And the Evil Aura would surge
if he experienced intense mood swings.

21
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,080
What does that mean?

22
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,480
My medical skill is the least to be doubted.

23
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,120
If he takes the Pain Potion

24
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,440
prescribed by me regularly,

25
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,280
he will finally be cured.

26
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,320
I always trust you, Senior.

27
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,280
Well,

28
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,400
I'm going to help the owner blend the incense,

29
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,640
so Shi Xia...

30
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,280
That's the first dose

31
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,240
for him,

32
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,200
so you must make sure

33
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,240
he drinks it up.

34
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,760
Don't worry.

35
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,800
I promise that I will make him drink it all.

36
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:58,960
Shi Xia

37
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,760
It's time to take the potion.

38
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,920
Okay.

39
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,680
Does it taste bitter?

40
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,800
I have had a lot of Cotton Candy,

41
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,760
so the taste is fine.

42
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,240
Hold it yourself.

43
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,160
It occurs to me that...

44
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,680
You said

45
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,160
you have never taken me as your brother.

46
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,640
It's not just a lie.

47
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,480
That's because

48
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,560
you also love me.

49
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,880
Since I'm not your brother,

50
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,760
let's break the contract

51
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,920
and take a fresh start.

52
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,600
No.

53
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,440
The contract

54
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,280
is a unique token for us.

55
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,680
I think we can keep it.

56
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,440
But...

57
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,200
Devil Lord said

58
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,840
I can't be the brother and the brother-in-law at the same time.

59
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,400
I couldn't be your brother

60
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
if I were his brother-in-law.

61
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,880
In fact,

62
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,840
you can play both roles.

63
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,360
What does it mean?

64
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,360
In this world, there is a kind of relationship

65
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,000
called "love me in the name of a brother."

66
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,720
I like it.

67
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,720
I didn't lose.

68
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,040
I didn’t.

69
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,800
I didn’t.

70
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,800
I'm not defeated!

71
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,000
You scared me.

72
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,000
Are you alright?

73
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,920
Can't be better.

74
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,600
I lost the fight,

75
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,040
and it’s just a game to me.

76
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:39,960
But...

77
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,800
Am I a sore loser?

78
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,600
But why...

79
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,160
Why were you talking in your sleep?

80
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,880
You said ten times that

81
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,520
you didn't lose.

82
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,480
I always uphold

83
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,880
the spirit of the competition.

84
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,360
I lost the game,

85
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,120
But I was absolutely overwhelming

86
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,360
on my attitude.

87
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,400
All in all, I didn't lose.

88
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,640
Or do you think...

89
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,800
I lost out to Hou Chi?

90
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,240
Well, you...

91
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,120
You had a tremendous victory!

92
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,240
If you dare to eavesdrop one more time,

93
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,800
I will beat you deaf.

94
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,680
Not anymore. Not anymore.

95
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,040
Oh my. The eye wrinkles.

96
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,720
By the way,

97
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,600
where's Shi Xia?

98
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,560
Did she stay with me all the time

99
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,360
when I was asleep?

100
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,000
Right.

101
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,080
She stayed with Hou Chi all the time.

102
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,800
What? How dare she.

103
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,840
She should have been comforting me now.

104
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,200
Any idea about Qiu Li's whereabouts?

105
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,360
Not yet.

106
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,000
She is in the evil mode now,

107
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,760
so she may do evils any time.

108
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,400
No.

109
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,640
I need to find Shi Xia.

110
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,600
Wait. Hold on a second.

111
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,480
Devil Lady is safe with Hou Chi.

112
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,360
A man and a woman were in a room alone.

113
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,080
Hou Chi is more dangerous than Qiu Li.

114
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,040
Shi Xia

115
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,960
Did I lose you?

116
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,000
I hurt both of you. I should be blamed.

117
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,960
I deserve

118
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,880
everything I get.

119
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,480
What's done is done.

120
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,160
Why do you have to regret it?

121
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,600
A good villain never lets scruples get in the way.

122
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,440
With too many scruples,

123
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,960
you're doomed to be a loser.

124
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,040
You can't keep the woman you love.

125
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,840
I don't want to be a villain.

126
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,160
I helped you once,

127
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,520
so we're done.

128
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,800
I won't help you anymore.

129
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,040
Done?

130
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,520
This pair of eyes

131
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,520
are so beautiful.

132
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,680
We helped each other,

133
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,920
so you can't define it.

134
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,240
You're gonna do

135
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,480
whatever I tell you to do.

136
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:29,880
Take it.

137
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,560
Put the incense in Yuan Zhao's room.

138
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,120
Even you kill me,

139
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,920
I will never hurt my own father.

140
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,480
Don't worry.

141
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,480
The incense isn't fatal,

142
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,080
but can cause hallucination.

143
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,760
What the hell are you doing?

144
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,960
Don't you want to know

145
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,520
who the woman is in that painting?

146
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,800
Ya

147
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,360
It's been two centuries.

148
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,960
You haven't aged

149
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,440
a day.

150
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:38,540
(Two hundred years ago.)

151
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,320
It's gone.

152
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,520
The ball has gone.

153
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,160
Hong

154
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,080
Get ready.

155
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,680
Hong

156
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,960
Why didn't you take the ball?

157
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,560
Hong

158
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,760
What happened?

159
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,760
What happened to you, Hong?

160
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,240
I don’t like to stay here.

161
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,800
I want to play somewhere else.

162
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,080
Darling

163
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,480
Today is the Lantern Festival.

164
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,080
The lantern show will be held in the town.

165
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,000
Yue caught a cold,

166
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,080
so I will stay with her.

167
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,040
You can go and show Hong around.

168
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,120
What if the people from Devil Sect come here?

169
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,040
We've been here for a long time,

170
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,600
but no one from Devil Sect came here.

171
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,280
You won't be recognized

172
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,440
if you take good disguises.

173
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,360
If I give the rabbit lantern to my sister,

174
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,280
she must love it.

175
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,560
She must be very happy.

176
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,880
Go!

177
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,480
Excuse me. What happened to the village?

178
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,160
It's the people from Devil Sect...

179
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,000
They poisoned the village.

180
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,560
Devil Sect?

181
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:07,800
Hong

182
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,320
Wait here.

183
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,120
All the people inside died.

184
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,720
You could be killed if you got in there.

185
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,880
Hong

186
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:18,920
Hong

187
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:21,800
Hong

188
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,160
Hong

189
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,520
Hong

190
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,560
Ya, Yue.

191
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,480
Ya

192
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,240
Lord Shen Guan

193
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,960
The lineage of Devil Sect I've waited
for one thousand years

194
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,960
was born in Yuhua Sect.

195
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,120
Mr. Yuan

196
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,080
There must be a reason, right?

197
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,920
My lifelong mission

198
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,480
is to cultivate

199
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,040
a perfect head of the Immortals Alliance.

200
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,200
I'll try to avoid unnecessary deaths,

201
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,040
so the process and approaches

202
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,640
aren't important.

203
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,080
It's my duty

204
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,240
to obey the divine will.

205
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,880
I won't go through it

206
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,080
if you wouldn't like to talk about it.

207
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,880
Then, take care of your disciple

208
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,160
and make sure he can get into the temple.

209
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,200
(How come Hou Chi is the offspring
of Devil Sect?)

210
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:49,960
Come in.

211
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:01,840
Dad

212
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,880
What're you doing here?

213
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,200
I blend some incense to help you sleep.

214
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,680
There are a lot of things going on.

215
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,480
I think you must be thinking a lot,

216
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,080
and the incense

217
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,720
can help you have a good rest.

218
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,240
Leave it.

219
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,760
You were just able to see again.

220
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,040
Don't do those useless things.

221
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,080
Go get some rest.

222
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,360
Got it.

223
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,000
Ya

224
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,080
Is it you?

225
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,480
Ya

226
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,560
Ya

227
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,840
Ya

228
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,400
Is it really you?

229
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,200
Ya

230
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,600
It's really you.

231
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,160
All these years,

232
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,080
I've been looking forward to

233
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,360
meeting you again.

234
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,120
Don't treat me hypocritical.

235
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,640
I left the Devil Sect because of you,

236
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,320
and I bred your children.

237
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,760
But what have you done to me?

238
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
You just left when I need you the most.

239
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,040
Qiu Li

240
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,840
Back then, people from Devil Sect

241
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,600
had poisoned the village

242
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,760
before Hong and I went back
from the lantern show.

243
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,960
All creatures are dead in miles around.

244
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,400
I regret it so much that

245
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,480
I couldn't go back earlier.

246
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:42,920
You lied.

247
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,000
You even didn't get into there to look for us.

248
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,120
Hong was too young.

249
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,200
You knew his situation,

250
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,280
so I must stay with him and protect him.

251
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,480
(So my mother is the former Immortal Aunt)

252
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,440
(And I have a sister)

253
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,840
Haven't you wondered

254
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,720
we were still alive at that time?

255
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,240
So...

256
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,800
Yue and you

257
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,040
survived from that calamity.

258
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,520
Yue

259
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,920
Where's Yue?

260
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,480
You don't deserve to know anything about her.

261
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,320
Yuan Zhao

262
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,680
You abandoned your daughter and wife.

263
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,800
You made us suffer so much.

264
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:26,840
Now,

265
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,120
you must pay your life!

266
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:30,720
Watch out.

267
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,440
Hong

268
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,760
Hong

269
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,040
Immortal Aunt

270
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,640
Hong

271
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,000
Let's get out of here.

272
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,680
Hong

273
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:50,960
Hong

274
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,520
Luckily, you don't have the Holy Root,

275
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,640
or it would be horrible.

276
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,720
Get some rest.

277
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,800
Wait.

278
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,320
Is what Immortal Aunt

279
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,880
just said true?

280
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,960
You knew who she is.

281
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,520
It means

282
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,360
it was you who poisoned the incense.

283
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,320
I want to know my origins.

284
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,640
What she said is true.

285
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,440
Your mother

286
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,800
is Qiu Ya,

287
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,480
the former Immortal Aunt.

288
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,440
But why do I have no memory

289
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,760
about that?

290
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,800
You were too young

291
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,480
to take it.

292
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,520
After knowing that,

293
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,920
then,

294
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,400
you lost your memory.

295
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,640
But...

296
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,440
Why does Qiu Li know everything about it?

297
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,720
Is she...

298
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,800
Is she my sister?

299
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,080
Her expressions and manners

300
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,200
are the same as your mother's.

301
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,080
I should have noticed that earlier.

302
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,480
You abandoned them

303
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,480
to save my life.

304
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,720
Without the Holy Root,

305
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,200
you can't be alive

306
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,080
if I were not with you.

307
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,520
I lost them already,

308
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,440
I can't lose you.

309
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,640
Qi Lingling

310
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:13,800
Oh, no.

311
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,200
Did she do evils again?

312
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,160
You'd better stay here, Immortal Aunt.

313
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,120
Do you mean she did evils again?

314
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,760
What should I do?

315
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,240
My brother must be mad at me.

316
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,680
Everything you did is for him,

317
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,040
he won't blame you.

318
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,720
No.

319
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,200
I have to apologize to him.

320
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,000
I...

321
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,760
I don't want him to hate me.

322
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,680
What brings you here?

323
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,480
What brings me here?

324
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,960
You will forget who you are

325
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,480
if I come here later.

326
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,960
I made a tremendous decision.

327
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,880
Don't be silly. Go straight.

328
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,960
I decided to resign the Devil Lord

329
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,600
and go home with you.

330
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,320
Don't you not want to go back home with me?

331
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,960
Don't you always

332
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,200
like your script of being a hero?

333
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,080
Why do you want to go home with me now?

334
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,560
Since I can't be the head of the Alliance

335
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,400
and the king of immortals,

336
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,560
the script is messed.

337
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,440
Although I own the power and fortune,

338
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,960
I should go back home with my sister

339
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,680
if she wants it.

340
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,400
I can make myself to drop everything

341
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,280
and go home with you.

342
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,880
(My brother will leave with Shi Xia)

343
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,160
(He will abandon me)

344
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,600
You must be moved,

345
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,520
and you even think your brother is great,

346
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,360
right?

347
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,800
I don't want to go back home.

348
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,720
What? Don't you always want to leave here?

349
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,600
Isn't this because...

350
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,400
Hou Chi

351
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,640
Right.

352
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,040
Because of him.

353
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,440
Are you kidding me?

354
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,720
No.

355
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,880
I'm serious.

356
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,960
I want to be with Hou Chi.

357
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,280
Hold on, my sister.

358
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,280
Calm down.

359
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,160
I won't interfere your relationship,

360
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,400
but let him send you home

361
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,120
as agreed

362
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,000
when he becomes the head of the Alliance.

363
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,240
I want to stay with him for ever and ever,

364
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,960
not temporarily.

365
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,520
Why do I have such a sister

366
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
like you?

367
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,440
Immersing yourself in love,

368
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,480
giving up studies,

369
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,560
and putting your dream aside.

370
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,040
Hou Chi can give up his own life to save me,

371
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,400
so why can't I abandon

372
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,440
my original life?

373
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,680
Brother

374
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,400
Brother

375
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,240
Anyway, you don't want to be the Devil Lord.

376
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,440
How about going back to Yuhua Sect with
Hou Chi and me?

377
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,200
We three can live together.

378
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,240
What do you think of it?

379
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,960
Look at you,

380
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,400
you just care about what you want.

381
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,160
Well, did you even consider my feelings?

382
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,360
What happened to you?

383
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,120
What happened to me?

384
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,720
I've been in the world of immortals
for a year,

385
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,480
I beat the former sanguinary Devil Lord

386
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,320
I led the Devil Sect to embark new path against all odds.

387
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,520
We finally got something with so much effort.

388
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,760
Do you think I want to give all these up?

389
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,040
I know whatever I do is just a joke

390
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,120
in your eyes.

391
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,280
You can only see what Hou Chi have done,

392
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,040
but you don't take a single look at what I have sacrificed.

393
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,280
Immortal Aunt

394
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,880
Kill Shi Xia,

395
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,640
then no one can take him away.

396
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:21,920
Watch out!

397
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,480
Brother

398
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,320
Brother

399
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,480
Brother

400
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,600
You can even die

401
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,560
to save her.

402
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,640
I must kill her today.

403
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,280
Brother

404
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,680
Luckily, he made it.

405
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,640
Brother

406
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,040
Brother

407
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,320
Brother
