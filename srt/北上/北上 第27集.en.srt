I'm finally in Italy.

00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,240
Do you remember

9
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,790
the story you told me

10
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,020
about Marford when I was young?

11
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,120
What kind of person was he?

12
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,690
Why did he go to China from Italy?

13
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,699
Who am I?

14
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,610
Where am I from?

15
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,360
This time,

16
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,740
I want to figure them out myself.

17
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,200
Venice has a canal too,

18
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,310
but it's different.

With each passing day,

20
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,430
I miss Flower Street more and more.

21
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,010
I also miss

22
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,160
the courtyard where you used to be.

23
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,180
Mayor Gu,

24
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,640
you didn't have to come in person.

25
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,950
We've confirmed that

26
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,840
this ship was just an ordinary cargo ship.

27
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,190
It's less than 100 years old.

28
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,100
I suggest we…

29
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,270
Are you sure?

30
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,120
Are there no other possibilities?

31
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,490
Mayor,

32
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,180
Curator Chen is right.

33
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,360
Actually,

34
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,010
the district government has been informed

35
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,750
to stop the excavation.

36
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,180
It's going to keep raining.

37
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,579
The drainage and protection work

38
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,700
will consume a lot of manpower and resources.

39
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,490
Our budget is limited.

40
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,310
Let's stop

41
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,579
excavating this ship, shall we?

42
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,870
We should spend the money on

43
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,400
more meaningful projects.

44
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,020
Alright.

45
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,370
I respect your opinions.

46
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,410
Let's stop then.

47
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,610

48
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,590
Today is our last day

55

57

The excavation finally restarted.

58
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,050
Why are you suddenly stopping it?

59
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,180
Who are you

60
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,750
to ask me that?

61
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,630
My son?

62
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,400
Or…

63
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,530
I'm a volunteer at the shipwreck site.

64
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,860
The decision has been made

65
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,300
and announced.

66
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,730
The shipwreck excavation is stopped.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,260
Don't waste any more time here.

68
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,170
I'm wasting my time?

69
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,770
Then what isn't a waste of time?

70
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,900
Should I sit in an office drinking hot tea

71
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,320
and doing field research

72
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,510
or stay in a library traveling around

73
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,360
through a few hardcover books?

74
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,170
That's not a waste of time?

75
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,610
Yeah, I know you're not satisfied with me.

76
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,680
I didn't listen to you about which college to attend

77
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,270
or about what job to take.

78
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,600
But do you think I'm here today

79
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,360
just to stand against you?

80
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,230
So you know what you've done.

81
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:51,690
Yes.

82
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,700
You're my son.

83
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,730
I am very disappointed in you.

84
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,440
But today,

85
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,810
we'll only talk about work.

86
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,930
Nothing personal.

87
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,790
I didn't make this decision.

88
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,140
The experts have confirmed

89
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,230
that this ship

90
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,920
has no excavation value.

91
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,960
Mayor Gu.

92
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,190
Mayor Gu.

93
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,680
What does this ship mean to you?

94
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,340
Is it just a cultural site for show

95
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,620
and a mere tool for Honghuai City's application for World Heritage status?

96
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,040
Now that the canal has become a World Heritage Site,

97
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,190
it's of no use to you anymore,

98
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,160
so you're just throwing it away?

99
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,360
You're going too far!

100
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,370
That's total nonsense!

101
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:33,800
Do you know

102
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,000
what happened on this ship

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,560
and who lived on it?

104
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,630
You don't!

105
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,930
They don't!

106
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,640
How can you say it's worthless?

107
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,340
There were real people living on this ship.

108
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,920
They might have been insignificant.

109
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,060
They might have been

110
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,380
of no value at all

111
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:51,730
in the long history.

112
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,990
But to their descendants and loved ones,

113
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,150
they were of immense value.

114
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,860
And we've been looking for traces.

115
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,710
They could very well be the ancestors

116
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,370
of the uncles and aunts,

117
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,030
grandpas and grandmas in the courtyard.

118
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,950
If I can prove that,

119
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,830
I can prove…

120
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,380
But the government's budget is limited!

121
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,180
Now that the canal has become a World Heritage Site,

122
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,160
the entire Honghuai is facing renovation and reconstruction.

123
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,300
Let me ask you.

124
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,510
Should the government

125
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,540
spend the money

126
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,800
on reconstruction that's closely related

127
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,560
to people's lives

128
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,720
or on a sunken ship

129
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,560
that experts have said

130
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,070
to be worthless?

131
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,030
Okay.

132
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,100
I got it.

133
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,770
Then please allow me,

134
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,830
on behalf of Grandpa Zhou,

135
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,740

and Ma Siyi to whom I made a promise,

137
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,170
to formally request

138
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,230
that you transfer the excavation of the sunken ship

139
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,250
to me.

140
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,580
I'll raise funds myself to complete the subsequent work.

that the place you think is meaningless

143

will turn out to be meaningful;

144

258
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,230
Within this month, we need to

259
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,700
narrow the gap with other platforms

260
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,040

Bee's market share.

262
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,030
We're having this meeting

263
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,480
to discuss

264
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,240
whether we should temporarily raise the commission

265
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,640
to boost the delivery riders' motivation.

266
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,580
An extra yuan per order.

267
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,200
I disagree.

268
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,270
Why?

269
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:03,870
The so-called temporary solution

270
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,200
can't be temporary.

271
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,060
If we raise it when it's over 38 degrees Celsius,

272
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,270
at what temperature will we lower it?

273
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:11,690
The reality is that

274
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,790
the commission is easy to raise

275
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,920
but hard to lower.

276
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,690
Once we raise it,

277
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,420
it'll become the new standard.

278
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,790
The money for the delivery riders

279
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,510
can't come from the customers

280
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,110
or the merchants.

281
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,240
It can only be deducted from our profits.

282
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,670
The current situation is that

283
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,670
our profits are as low as they can be.

284
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,140
If we give delivery riders

285
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,070
an extra yuan for each order,

286
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,800
the company will be losing money.

287
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,170
We can tell the delivery riders

288
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,270
that this extra yuan

289
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,600
is a high-temperature allowance.

290
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,410
High-temperature allowance?

291
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,490
What about a low-temperature allowance?

292
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,610
What about allowances for stormy weather?

293
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,440
Mr. Wanghe,

294
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,350
you'll only stay here for a year.

295
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,200
If you set such a high standard for us,

296
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,980
after you leave,

297
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,640
how are we supposed to move on?

298
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,560
Right?

299
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,630
If you insist on going your own way

300
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,910
and raising the commission,

301
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,750
I hope you can get the head office

302
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:55,710
to make rules about it.

303
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,070
Each district will

304
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,860
strictly follow the rules.

305
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,500
That's no problem.

306
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,700
Am I right, everyone?

307
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,500
Mr. Meng, what do you think?

308
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,220
Rules are rigid,

309
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,780
but people are flexible.

310
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,160
In fact,

311
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,170
in the company's commission standards,

312
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,710
there are already provisions

313
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,870
about temporarily raising the commission during extreme weather.

314
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,660
We're just specifying them.

315
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,640
Let's do this.

316
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,610
Wanghe,

317
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,270
you'll be in charge of raising the commission.

318
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,090
But

319
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,070
after it cools down,

320
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,720
you need to lower

321
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,940
the commission back.

322
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,170
No problem, Mr. Meng.

323
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:32,980
Next,

324
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,510
our top priority

325
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,720
is to make preparations

326
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,050
to prevent heatstroke.

327
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,230
Each station

328
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,830
needs to prepare

329
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,190
heatstroke medicine and mung bean soup.

330
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,150
In this regard,

331
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,360
Shao Xingchi's

332
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,770
Station 203 in Haidian District

333
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,960
has done a great job.

334
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,050
The delivery riders there are very satisfied.

335
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:50,620
Additionally,

336
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,820
the system needs to be optimized again.

337
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:53,570
Haikuo.

338
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,480
How long is the gap

339
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,680
between the time we give to delivery riders

340
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,410
and the time customers expect?

341
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,390
Usually three minutes.

342
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,350
The time shown to customers is 40 minutes,

343
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,720
while the time shown to delivery riders

344
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,200
is 37 minutes.

345
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:08,490
Mr. Meng,

346
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,350
I suggest we shorten the time

347
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,840
given to delivery riders by another minute.

348
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,880
Everyone,

349
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,410
great rewards will bring forth brave men.

350
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,340
If they can't do it, they don't have to take the order.

351
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,580
Wanghe,

352
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,870
simply shortening the system time

353
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,960
can only bring extensive growth.

354
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,420
Then what's your idea?

355
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,070
It's okay. Just speak your mind.

356
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,620
Mr. Meng.

357
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,810
The delivery riders of Bee

358
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,270
currently use third-party mapping services.

359
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,000
The odds of them providing the optimal routes

360
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,880
haven't reached 90% yet.

361
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,840
To some extent,

362
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,270
this has affected the delivery efficiency.

363
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,120
So I suggest

364
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,080
we launch our self-developed map ahead of schedule.

365
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,720
I've tested it.

366
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,880
It's already very stable.

367
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,010
It only needs final-stage debugging.

368
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,720
Isn't that too risky?

369
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,340
Haikuo,

370
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,470
if you dare to take responsibility for your advice,

371
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,600
I'll dare to heed it.

372
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,670
Do you dare?

373
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,210
Of course.

374
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,090
If anything goes wrong with the self-developed map,

375
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:13,090
I'll pack up and leave immediately.

376
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,720
Any other suggestions?

377
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,700
If not,

378
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,380
we'll proceed with this plan.

379
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,660
Meeting adjourned.

380
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,290
Haikuo,

381
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:30,820
stay for a moment.

382
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,080
I want to talk with you.

383
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,600
Sit down.

384
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,420
You're more excellent than I thought.

385
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,470
You flatter me, Mr. Meng.

386
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,780
Are you interested in coming to the headquarters?

387
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,640
Headquarters?

388
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,190
To do what?

389
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,220
To be the Chief Technology Officer.

390
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,320
The previous CTO

391
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,060
was poached by Eat Well.

392
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,920
Well,

393
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,750
compared with having a headhunter poach someone,

394
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,530
I prefer

395
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,040
to promote someone in the company.

396
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,610
Mr. Meng,

397
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,110
Wanghe still needs help.

398
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,440
I need help too.

399
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,430
Haikuo,

400
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,900
you're a genius programmer.

401
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,490
Running around for business with him

402
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,890
is a waste of your talent.

403
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:24,990
How about this?

404
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,900
Think it over.

405
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,240
Come to me when you've made up your mind.

406
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,860
It's too sudden.

407
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,550
Please let me think about it.

408
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,920
Whether you come or not,

409
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,320
you must keep it a secret.

410
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,970
It involves backend data.

411
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,870
Safety first.

to keep up the good work.

He didn't mention anything about a raise?

00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:02,980
No.

I didn't agree.

00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,510
Why?

Wanghe brought me into the company.

495
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,120
I need to discuss this with him first.

00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,790
Wanghe doesn't know how to code.

I don't understand.

you don't need to tell me about these things anymore.

00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,750
I don't want my husband

519
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,270
to be someone who can't even decide

520
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,070
the direction of his own career!

521
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,320
Lion's head meatballs.

522
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,970
Braised shredded tofu.

523
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,000
Stir-fried shredded eel.

524
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,430
Here's rice.

525
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:11,890
Two servings of rice.

526
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,570
Did you plant a bug on me?

527
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,000
I mentioned this morning that I wanted to eat hometown food,

528
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,330
and you brought it to me.

529
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,290
Don't flatter yourself.

530
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,410
I want to eat it too.

531
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,110
Here.

532
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:24,760
Eat up.

533
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:31,890
How's it?

534
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,180
Not quite there,

535
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,110
but not bad.

536
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,410
Haikuo's grandpa used to say that

537
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,560
when you crave hometown food,

538
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,810
you're not missing the food

539
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:42,810
but feeling homesick.

540
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:43,530
What?

541
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:44,900
You feel homesick?

542
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,030
Don't you miss home?

543
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:46,890
Occasionally,

544
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,680
when I feel wronged.

545
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,440
I barely think about it other times.

546
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,300
What about you?

547
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,510
How did Xiang Yu die?

548
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,050
Surrounded by enemies on all sides.

549
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,790
If a soldier keeps thinking about going home,

550
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,590
he'll lose the courage to fight.

551
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,010
I'm still fighting.

552
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,000
You're a girl.

553
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,850
You can be vulnerable sometimes,

554
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:06,880
but I can't.

555
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,590
Everyone under me is watching.

556
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,640
I can't let them see

557
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,720
my vulnerable side,

558
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,720
not even once.

559
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,350
I want to eat eel noodles.

560
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,610
I'll make some for you.

561
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,960
Please don't.

562
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,680
Given your cooking skills,

563
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,270
I'd have a fishy taste in my mouth afterward.

564
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:27,270
And I'd have to praise you against my better judgment.

565
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,210
What's Xingchi been up to lately?

566
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,590
His cooking skills aren't good either.

567
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,030
He learned to make eel noodles from Uncle Zhou.

568
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,560
And lion's head meatballs.

569
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,110

he helped me a lot,

631
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,880
Anyway, she thinks I'm Wanghe's underling.

632
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,590
So she basically thinks I'm a dog.

633

Why have you come alone?

634

I just have.

635
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,700
You had dinner by yourself?

636
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,010
None of your business.

637
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,000
Let's drink.

638
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,780
What's wrong with you this time?

639
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,510
You fought with Xiaohui again?

640
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,830
I suspect

641
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,860
Xiaohui has started menopause early.

642
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,170
What's the reason this time?

643
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,330
She's jealous of you.

644
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,530
Jealous of me?

645
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,180
What did I do?

646
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:04,050
Meng wants Haikuo to be the CTO at headquarters.

647
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,350
Haikuo said he needs

648
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,380
to ask for your opinion first.

649
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,840
Xiaohui is upset about it.

650
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,770
When did that happen?

651
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,120
The day

652
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,240
when Meng talked with me alone.

653
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,750
I asked you what he said,

654
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,400
and you said nothing.

655
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,000
He asked me to keep it a secret

656
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,350
for data security.

657
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,600
I didn't really understand it.

658
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,800
He told you to keep it secret, so you did?

659
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,380
That's not the point, okay?

660
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,030
Shouldn't you be asking

661
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,640
why Xiaohui is upset?

662
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,270
Why is Xiaohui upset?

663
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,710
She thinks…

664
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,470
I don't even want to say it.

665
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:40,880
Anyway,

666
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,420
recently, every few days,

667
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,860
she picks a fight with me.

668
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,600
It's wearing me out.

669
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,930
Leave her if you can't stand her.

670
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,710
Just break up with her.

671
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,590
You handled things like that,

672
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:55,810
and you're still single now.

673
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,260
Aren't you single too?

674
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,160
I won't be soon.

675
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,810
Wonderful.

676
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,110
Congratulations.

677
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,130
Why are you drinking so fast?

678
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,640
I'm happy.

679
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,920
Waiter!

680
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,030
A 12-pack of beer, please.

681
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,480
Enough. No more drinking.

682
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,490
We still have to work tomorrow.

683
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,510
Worry about yourself.

684
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,720
I know what I'm doing.

685
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,770
It won't affect anything.

686
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:22,600
Wanghe,

687
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,550
I've thought it through.

688
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,620
Don't worry about Xiaohui.

689
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,860
I won't go to headquarters.

690
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,440
Haikuo.

691
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,120
To be honest,

692
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,820
I really need you right now.

693
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,460
I hope you can stay and help me.

694
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,160
But Xiaohui isn't wrong.

695
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,880
You should decide

696
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,240
your career direction by yourself.

697
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,170
Whether you succeed or fail,

698
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,210
you need to learn

699
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,100
to take responsibility for your own decisions.

700
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,560
You also need to be responsible for Xiaohui.

701
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,300
Why are you looking at me?

702
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:12,290
Don't you already have the answer in your heart?

703
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:14,160
Just follow your heart.

704
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,410
What I say goes!

705
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,020
I say I'm not leaving, and that's that!

706
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:24,560
Come on.

707
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,280
To our friendship.

708
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:26,950
Cheers!

709
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:28,680
Cheers!

710
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,360
Cheers!

711
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,460
[Bar]

712
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,350
Mr. Zhou!

713
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,960
Mr. Zhou!

714
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,040
Uncle Shao.

715
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,180
Bingyi, slow down.

716
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,070
Look at him.

717
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,730
Wait for me.

718
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:55,240
Mr. Zhou.

719
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,020
It's confirmed.

720
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,000
One of my ancestors

721
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,030
indeed worked as a porter.

722
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:01,750
Really?

723
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,840
But the name is no longer traceable.

724
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:04,910
Why?

725
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,640
My family genealogy records

726
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,270
were burned during the war.

727
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,010
Only some fragments were left.

728
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:10,680
Look.

729
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,680
The writing is all blurred.

730
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,960
-Yeah.
-How do I know

731
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,400
this person worked as a porter?

732
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,440
It's because at the end of the Qing dynasty,

733
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,030
this person made a fortune

734
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,380
by selling tea.

735
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,960
He went back and built an ancestral hall for his clan.

736
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,670
That's why it was recorded.

737
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,020
This is history,

738
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,560
the folk history of people living by the canal.

739
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,510
I think

740
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,240
we shouldn't just look into our families.

741
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,450
Our neighbors on Flower Street,

742
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,740
we should ask them all.

743
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,910
Maybe every family has their own

744
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,880
stories.

745
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,010
-Yeah.
-Right?

746
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,640
So this is oral history?

747
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:48,600
Oral history is still history.

748
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,740
When Sima Qian wrote "Records of the Grand Historian,"

749
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,030
from emperors and generals

750
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,200
to peddlers and porters,

751
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,070
he went door to door to make inquiries.

752
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:55,750
Yes.

753
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,440
Jing Ke's assassination attempt on Qin Shi Huang

754
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,540
was only recorded in detail

755
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,200
because he ran into Xia Wuju

756
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,460
when he was visiting a neighbor.

757
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,750
Yes, indeed.

758
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,720
We don't have his talent,

759
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,030
but if we put in the effort,

760
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,000
we can also contribute to filling in

761
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,070
the blanks in official history.

762
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,110
Absolutely.

763
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,880
So this will also be considered history in the future?

764
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,610
Of course.

765
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,260
You'll become part of history too.

766
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,320
Gosh.

767
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,750
My dad,

768
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,790
Uncle Shao,

769
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,970
Grandpa Zhou, and I

770
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,880
naturally formed

771
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,070
a four-person research team.

772
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,550

♫At moonset cry the crows♫

774
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,960
we roamed the streets and alleys,

775
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,350
visiting over 100 families

776
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,160
along the canal,

777
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,880
encountering many rare antiques,

778
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,790
and recording countless fascinating stories.

779
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,200
To our surprise,

780

♫Streaking the frosty sky♫

781
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,270
after the canal's successful World Heritage application,

782
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,640
various folk museums,

783
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,780
big and small, began popping up along the canal.

784
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,400
This gave us a more comprehensive

785
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,270
understanding of its history.

786
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,750

788
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,830
driven by our obsession with the sunken ship,

789
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,030
somehow became the talk of the neighborhood

790
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,200
around Flower Street.

791
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,000
More and more people

792
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,620

And just like that,

796
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,000
I felt

797
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,570
I was finally getting closer to the truth,

798
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,990
and closer to fulfilling my promise

799
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,440
to Siyi.

800
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,000
Why am I so tired?

801
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,590
It's just the beginning.

802
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,210
It's only been a few days.

803
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,830

♫At moonset cry the crows♫

805

at least I knew the direction.

807
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,400
I was in control.

808
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,550

The town chronicle office says they have new leads.

Is that so?

821
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:02,750
Then let's pack up and go.

Let's go.

824
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,680
You may find the information

825

you're looking for

826
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,960
in their genealogy records.

827
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,000
If you can't find it here,

828
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,320
there's even less chance elsewhere.

829
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:12,950
This way.

830
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,500
They've been waiting for a long time.

00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,910
Yes.

832
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,030
Great.

833
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,280

Welcome.

838
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,590
They're looking for some information.

839
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,200
Thank you for coming.

840
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,400
Nice to meet you, sir.

Welcome, welcome.

842
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,520
One of my ancestors had a friend surnamed Shao.

843
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,030
There is a record of him.

844
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,860
I've kept it

845

but forgotten which book it's in.

846

Help them look for it.

847
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,010
Then let's look for it together.

848
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:46,730
Okay.

I have no objections.

1031
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,200
Cut it out.

1032
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,010
Your hostility towards him

1033
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,170
is so obvious.

1034
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,510
He was trained by Fenghua.

1035
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,090
I'm not comfortable using him.

1036
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:58,840
I've already

1037
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,760
discussed it with Fenghua.

1038
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,940
Don't worry.

1039
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,880
Since you've already discussed it,

1040
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,980
there's no need to ask for my opinion.

1041
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,240
I'll just do as you say.

1042
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,180
Thank you, Li.

1043
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,010
You're welcome. Come anytime.

1044
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,900
Xingchi was just angry for me.

1045
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:29,300
He knows He once worked for me.

1046
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,640
Job-hopping is illegal, huh?

1047
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,610
Just be grateful that I have a big heart

1048
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:38,210
and let him go without a fuss.

1049
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,400
What would you do

1050
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,290
if you wanted to make a fuss?

1051
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:47,670
There are countless ways

1052
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,820
to give an employee a hard time.

1053
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,480
It's not that I'm not capable of it.

1054
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,880
I just don't want to do it.

1055
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,450
If we weren't close,

1056
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,890
and I poached your staff with high salaries

1057
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,620
and publicly humiliated you,

1058
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:02,650
what would you do?

1059
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,630
It's simple.

1060
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,210
I'd use shady services.

1061
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,760
I'd rent hundreds of phone numbers

1062
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,820
to place orders continuously.

1063
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,200
When the delivery riders arrive at the restaurants,

1064
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,550
I'd cancel the orders.

1065
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,370
If I did this every day during peak hours,

1066
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:14,510
you'd be out of business in no time.

1067
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:16,100
You're ruthless.

1068
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,950
It's just the beginning.

1069
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:19,550
There are plenty of ways

1070
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,070
to screw with someone.

1071
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:22,760
You have no idea

1072
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,000
what I've been through all these years.

1073
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,930
Ms. Xia,

1074
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,650
I hate to trouble you, but…

1075
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,030
Could you write down all those dirty tricks

1076
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,440
for me?

1077
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,950
I'll have them patch up the system right away.

1078
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:43,620
Okay?

1079
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:46,640
What's in it for me?

1080
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,360
What do you want?

1081
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:54,810
The Mid-Autumn Festival is coming up.

1082
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:55,450
You know.

1083
00:41:58,330 --> 00:41:59,080
No problem.

1084
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,510
Here.

1085
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,860
Here is a spare battery.

1086
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,850
Don't charge it.

1087
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,620
There are more inside.

1088
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,590
What's wrong with your bike?

1089
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,740
The brakes seem to be broken.

1090
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,860
Brakes?

1091
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:16,400
The tires need changing too.

1092
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,330
Chief, Chief.

1093
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:21,880
I need to use your bathroom.

1094
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:24,470
You bought a new car?

1095
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:25,440
It's rented.

1096
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:27,000
Tomorrow is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

1097
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,820
I've already arranged leave for you and Haikuo.

1098
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:29,680
We'll drive home.

1099
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,540
Now?

1100
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,550
Get off. Make room for the new driver.

1101
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,160
Next,

1102
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,190
let's welcome

1103
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:37,510
Shao Xingchi, the driver for the Tongzhou section.

1104
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,200
I see.

1105
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,350
You just need me to drive.

1106
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,560
Nonsense.

1107
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,230
-You're important.
-Haikuo.

1108
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:45,760
Hurry up.

1109
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,010
Coming!

1110
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:49,720
The driver has changed?

1111
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:50,810
I'll give it a try.

1112
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:52,460
You don't need to use the bathroom?

1113
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,500
Maybe you should.

1114
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,450
Get ready.

1115
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,230
Let's go!
