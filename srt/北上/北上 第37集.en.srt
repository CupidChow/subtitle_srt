However, my family considered him poor,

wanted to break up.

we eloped.

But I...

106
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,890
I couldn't bring myself to do it, Son.

107
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,190
I ran away from home in desperation.

108
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,440
I kept running...

109
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,620
till I reached the canal.

110
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,870
I looked at the river and thought

111
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,270
maybe I should drown myself.

112
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,360
If I died,

113
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,390
then...

114
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,480
nobody could take you away from me.

116
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,870
the water was so cold.

I was about to die,

119

I met your father

120
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:05,330
who was visiting the canal for information.

He saved my life.

122
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,720
He raised you like his own son.

123
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,530
He also gave us a home.

Your dad

128

to take the consequences.

130
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,440
Over these years,

131
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,640
I've always loved your dad,

But the more I love him,

135
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,880
and the more I respect him,

136
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,910
the more I feel guilty about him.

We didn't mean to hide it from you.

140
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,140
We planned to

141

tell you when you grew up,

My mom and I couldn't have survived without you.

146

You gave up your career for me.

So we owe you a lot.

148
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,120
You don't owe me anything.

149
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,420
I did everything voluntarily.

150

Xingchi,

151
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,770
now that you've grown up,

152
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,140
I wouldn't see you as a child anymore.

153
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,750
Tonight,

154
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,640
let's talk

155
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:45,990
to each other

156
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,410
as two adult men.

157
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,370
I've never regretted my decision.

158
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,630
At first,

159
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,870
I thought I was doing

160
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,170
a very noble thing.

161
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,390
Of course,

162
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,870
I didn't do this stuff

163
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,200
because I'm a noble man.

164
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,850
I love your mom,

165
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,190
and I love you too.

166
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,160
My mistake was

167
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,980
not being a good enough father.

168
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,390
Sometimes,

169
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,360
I couldn't control my emotions.

170
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,110
Do you know what I'm saying?

171
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,470
You didn't go to college because you hated me.

172
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,960
In fact, you could've gone to a good college

173
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,550

in the courtyard,

175
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,960
had a good job,

176
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:07,859
and led a decent life.

177
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,329
I don't regret

178
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,020
everything I've done,

179
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,410
except for that one.

180
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,119
I held you back, son.

181
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,210
I'm sorry.

182
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,000
I also owe your mom an apology.

183
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,680
Let me finish.

184
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,610
Whenever I think about this,

185
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,750
the heavy weight of guilt

186
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,830
inside me

187
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,750
makes me feel suffocated.

188
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,670
For real, son,

189
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,400
I was wrong.

190
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,810
You gave me and my mom a chance to live a new life.

191
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,560
Dad,

192
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,020
let's put the past behind us.

193
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,160
I want you to know

194
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,090
that you're a very successful man.

195
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,640
You have a wife who loves you dearly,

196
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,090
and a son

197
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,190
who would like to take care of you when you get old.

198
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,170
Dad,

199
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,630
I hope you can stop

200
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,440
burying everything

201
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,680
deep down in your heart.

202
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,110
You can confide in me.

203
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,510
I also hope

204
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,640
that from now on,

205
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,970
you will start learning

206
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,790
how to be a good husband

207
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,240
and a good father.

208
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,060
Little brat.

209
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:01,860
I got it.

210
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,770
I'll try my best.

211
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,730
[For donation]

212
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,900
[For postage]

213
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,380
[For keeping]

214
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:47,420
[For keeping]

215
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:13,700
[It's a boy. He weighs 3.75 kilograms. His name is Shao Xingchi.]
[I wish you all the best. Don't worry about us.]

216
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,640
Wait for me!

217
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,440
Stop running!

218
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,200
Watch out! Be careful!

219
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,460
It's fine.

220
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,030
You two...

221
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,090
Sorry!

222
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,010
You'll suffer if I catch you!

223
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:37,790
Shoes.

224
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,830
You give me the same kind of shoes every year.

225
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,520
Can't you buy me another gift?

226
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,030
Cut the crap. You should be glad to have these.

227
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,030
I won't wear them.

228
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,380
Look at the shoes.

229
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,040
Those who don't know better would think I'm moving to a rural area.

230
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,240
Don't talk nonsense.

231
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,380
See, these shoes are exquisite.

232
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,660
They're made by hands.

233
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,240
Shoes of this kind are expansive abroad.

234
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,050
Put them on. See if they fit.

235
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,190
Didn't you love leather shoes when you were little?

236
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,720
I won't wear them.

237
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,460
Wanghe will laugh at me if he sees these on me.

238
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,840
Try them on now.

239
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,690
Can't I wear other shoes?

240
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,690
Just try and see if they fit.

241
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,620
You're back!

242
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,590
How long are you staying this time?

243
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,210
I think I will

244
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,280
settle down,

245
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,500
so I can spend more time with my parents.

246
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,230
That's nice.

247
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,490
I'm glad you're back.

248
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,780
I'll leave you to your work then.

249
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,460
I should

250
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,200
go home now.

251
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,220
Sure.

252
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,210
The old man entered the royal court to plead for mercy.

253
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,930
Did he succeed?

254
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,110
What happened

255
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,170
will be revealed in the next episode.

256
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,620
Grandpa,

257
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,800
what do you think of today's show?

258
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,960
It was good.

259
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:00,980
Let's go.

260
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,680
Be careful.

261
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:05,770
Nice and slow.

262
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,360
Mr. Zhou.

263
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,940
Who are you?

264
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,070
I am Mr. Xu,

265
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,420
the owner of this place.

266
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,160
The owner is Mr. Zhao.

267
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,670
What's the matter? You can tell me.

268
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,410
I have a favor to ask.

269
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:27,020
Go ahead.

270
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,260
Mr. Zhao has paid for an annual membership.

271
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,980
There is some money left in the account.

272
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,130
I need to return it.

273
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,200
Why?

274
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,010
This place is closing down.

275
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,320
Nowadays,

276
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,290
except for regular patrons like you,

277
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,570
nobody enjoys storytelling performances anymore.

278
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,400
Are you serious?

279
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,720
Some young people

280
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,740
were around just now, weren't they?

281
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,520
They are the performers' families.

282
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,110
Sometimes performers

283
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,920
even outnumber the audience.

284
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,620
How come?

285
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,010
The other day when I was here,

286
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,710
the audience was full.

287
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,270
The show that day

288
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,150
was the Legend of Yue Fei.

289
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,090
The Legend of Yue Fei?

290
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,830
I haven't heard that story for a while.

291
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,220
Lots of stuff, right?

292
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,480
Before I knew it, I already collected so many things.

293
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,620
Good for you.

294
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,890
This place looks like a small museum.

295
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,160
Right?

296
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:38,640
Many of these

297
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,790
were collected by Grandpa

298
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,270
during the research of

299
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,830
the Flower Street and the canal.

300
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,110
I've sorted out the information.

301
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,010
Would you like to take it?

302
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:45,730
No need.

303
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,850
Just leave it here.

304
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,390
I don't have a use for it anyway.

305
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,300
Okay.

306
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:52,910
Beautiful.

307
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:53,780
Have some water.

308
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,300
Sure.

309
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:57,950
This is the result

310
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,560
of the hard work done by us and Grandpa, right?

311
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,690
It'll be a shame if these things just lay around here.

312
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,360
Why don't you

313
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,820
sort out

314
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,210
these items,

315
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,130
and exhibit them to the citizens?

316
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,920
As I remember,

317
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,750
after the canal was certified as World Heritage,

318
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,720
the municipal government began extending aid and support

319
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,110
to relevant traditional cultures.

320
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,910
You should ask your mom about it.

321
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,600
I'll do it in your stead if you can't.

322
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,200
No need.

323
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,330
L-Let me think about it.

324
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,680
What about you?

325
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,820
Will you settle down here?

326
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,430
I want to spend more time with my grandpa.

327
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,920
He needs someone to take care of him.

328
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,540
Oh, right!

329
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,250
You know what storytelling is, don't you?

330
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,900
What if I set up a storytelling house?

331
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,120
Are people still into storytelling shows nowadays?

332
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,120
Where there is a will, there is a way.

333
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,260
I just want to set up a storytelling house

334
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,550
that even appeals to young people.

335
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:55,530
The decoration will be stylish.

336
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,160
I'll also build a fixed stage

337
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,440
for storytelling shows.

338
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,270
The elderly can spend their spare time

339
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,660
drinking tea and listening to stories there,

340
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,980
while young people

341
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,160
can have coffee, read books or meet up with friends.

342
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,850
Those who are passionate about history and culture like you

343
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:06,510
can exchange ideas there.

344
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,420
-Sounds nice.
-Activities like those.

345
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,480
It seems like a good idea.

346
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,760
That can also be

347
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,610
where we auction

348
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:11,890
or exhibit antiques.

349
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,850
That's right. If there is such a place,

350
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:14,620
would you like to go?

351
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,750
Sure.

352
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,100
I think that's the kind of place that is missing from the Flower Street.

353
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,160
It's like hearing a grandpa tell stories. How nice.

354
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,520
I just have this thought

355
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:25,020
that some people enjoy quietness,

356
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,110
and some others would like to take a rest somewhere.

357
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,390
Actually,

358
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,210
I'm in search of

359
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,590
a lifestyle.

360
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,440
[Urban Planning of Honghuai City]

361
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,480
Rest assured, everyone.

362
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,750
We will solve the problems

363
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,690
we discussed today as soon as possible.

364
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:57,700
Thank you, Mayor Gu. Thank you so much.

365
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:59,000
Just go home and don't worry.

366
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,980
Hui, walk them out.

367
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,740
Goodbye.

368
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,540
Fenghua!

369
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,550
I'm sorry.

370
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,590
The meeting ran late.

371
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,060
Sorry to keep you waiting.

372
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,000
No worries.

373
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,000
Have a seat.

374
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,110
You're being too courteous.

375
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,310
That makes me feel nervous.

376
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,840
What's to be nervous about?

377
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,240
You’re Mayor Gu now.

378
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,070
Don’t say that.

379
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,200
I watched you

380
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,750
grow up, remember?

381
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,830
You used to call me Auntie Gu.

382
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,880
Auntie Gu.

383
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,000
Have some tea.

384
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,200
Thank you, Auntie Gu.

385
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,720
I remember when you were a child,

386
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,960
you often played with the boys in the courtyard

387
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,960
like a little monkey covered in mud.

388
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,480
Look at you now.

389
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,510
Girls really do change a lot as they grow up.

390
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,910
You've become prettier.

391
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,310
After all, I worked in Beijing for some time,

392
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,550
and was exposed to many things.

393
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,440
Right.

394
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,790
Chen Rui told me

395
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,400
that you and your friends are back, right?

396
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,070
We got tired of working in Beijing,

397
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,270
and we felt homesick.

398
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,650
It's good that you're back.

399
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,580
You should have come back earlier.

400
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,050
Since the canal was accredited as World Heritage,

401
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,050
the Flower Street

402
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:15,270
has taken on a brand new look.

403
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,200
Elites like you

404
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,070
should return to their hometowns,

405
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,590
and make contributions.

406
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,160
I'm more of a dud

407
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,620
than an elite.

408
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,190
Don't say that, alright?

409
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:29,550
Auntie Gu,

410
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,400
I came here today

411
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,550
to ask you the details

412
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,120
about the renovation of the Flower Street.

413
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,110
Okay.

414
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,640
What would you like to know?

415
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:43,490
Actually, I have a rough idea

416
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,950
that I'd like to tell you.

417
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,430
I'm wondering

418
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,930
if it's possible to separate an area

419
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:50,170
in the Flower Street for the residents

420
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,620
to build their own houses.

421
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,960
This way, they can

422
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,580
be neighbors again.

423
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:57,070
The plans have been decided.

424
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,200
In principle, no change is allowed.

425
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,830
My parents and those of their generation

426
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:04,110
have lived in the Flower Street for most of their lives.

427
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,640
As their children,

428
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,840
we surely hope they can still be neighbors

429
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,200
after they retire.

430
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,350
As you know,

431
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,180
the elderly don't like being alone.

432
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,100
Their lives will be more pleasant

433
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,380
if they are surrounded by old neighbors.

434
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,440
How about this?

435
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:22,900
You can

436
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,660
discuss it with the residents,

437
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,420
and try to reach an unanimous decision

438
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,460
as to whether to build your own houses

439
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,200
or to move to the places as the original proposal says.

440
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,260
When you reach a consensus,

441
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,750
we'll talk about it,

442
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,440
and figure out a way together.

443
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,320
Okay, no problem.

444
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,140
I believe if the conditions allow,

445
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,170
they will definitely choose to live near one another.

446
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,320
Thank you, Auntie Gu.

447
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,320
Anytime.

448
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,200
Look at this.

449
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,480
Xingchi, have a seat.

450
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,790
These are the floor plans, right?

451
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,250
Get ready for the meeting.

452
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,110
What is this?

453
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,730
Ladies and gentlemen,

454
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,360
we're here today

455
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,460
to discuss

456
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,720
a matter.

457
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,960
Okay. Sure.

458
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,880
Sit down.

459
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,700
Be seated. It's cozier this way.

460
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,120
As you all know,

461
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,940
the Flower Street is about to be renovated.

462
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,320
It's a good thing.

463
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,170
But after the renovation,

464
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,090
we'll have to live apart from one another.

465
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,170
We spent

466
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,360
all these years being friends and neighbors.

467
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,750
I believe you all want to stick together.

468
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,210
-Yes.
-That's for sure.

469
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,610
We definitely don't want to be apart.

470
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:22,410
Therefore,

471
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,600
Wanghe and I

472
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,610
found a courtyard for you.

473
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,700
Though it is a bit old,

474
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,100
it is very spacious.

475
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,430
We can remodel it.

476
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,950
I think we can

477
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,970
share the cost together.

478
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,040
As for the government-assigned apartments,

479
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,440
we'll leave them to Siyi.

480
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:38,790
When we finish remodeling the courtyard,

481
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,870
we can all move in,

482
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,220
and be neighbors again.

483
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:42,400
That's great!

484
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,680
It's great news!

485
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,830
Raise your hand if you agree to the plan.

486
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,290
I'm raising both my hands!

487
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,790
Well,

488
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,070
I've seen the floor plans of the apartment buildings

489
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,670
assigned by the government.

490
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,720
The apartments look fine,

491
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,080
and they are in a good location.

492
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,550
More importantly, the environment there

493
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,320
is also quite nice.

494
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,070
Dad!

495
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,160
This is a big decision.

496
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,130
Shouldn't you let them mull it over?

497
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,760
-Mr. Shao...
-X-Xingchi!

498
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:04,640
Hurry!

499
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:05,240
Dad,

500
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,240
raise your hand!

501
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,930
Okay, you all approve of it.

502
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,440
We'll be neighbors again.

503
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,570
Well,

504
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,130
I'll pay the cost

505
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,280
of the common areas.

506
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:18,150
You only need to pay for your own living places.

507
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,080
Besides,

508
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,190
Fenghua and I

509
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,660
will find the best designers

510
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,770
to offer us solutions.

511
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:24,860
Your satisfaction is guaranteed, alright?

512
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,860
Great!

513
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:26,890
Come on.

514
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,840
To us sticking together.

515
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,070
Sure!

516
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,580
Sticking together!

517
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,730
Sticking together!

518
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:56,250
I didn't expect things would go so fast between you two.

519
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:58,850
Yeah.

520
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,790
I want to get married when I'm still young.

521
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:01,840
A wrinkled face

522
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,890
won't look good in wedding photos.

523
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,040
It's high time you found a wife.

524
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,190
If there is a girl you like...

525
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:07,950
There is.

526
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:15,730
Don't worry.

527
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,130
I'm handsome,

528
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,570
and I have a good master.

529
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,680
I'm sure I'll become the best chef

530
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,200
of Huaiyang cuisine in the Flower Street.

531
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,460
I can easily find a wife, don't you think?

532
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:25,730
You're right.

533
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,230
Men who can cook are quite popular

534
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,190
among girls now.

535
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,000
I hope

536
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:37,880
you'll be well.

537
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,750
You should fix your illness after getting married,

538
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,960
and lead a happy life.

539
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,510
If Wanghe doesn't treat you right,

540
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,550
tell me immediately.

541
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:49,810
I'll bring my household register with me and take you away.

542
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,970
I'm sorry.

543
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,360
I'm sorry.

544
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,000
What are you laughing at?

545
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,260
Nothing. It's just...

546
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,790
When you said you would take me away,

547
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,460
I could see a picture in my head.

548
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,790
I imagined that Wanghe and you would grab each other's hair.

549
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:04,150
"Let go!"

550
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,220
"You let go first!"

551
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,200
"Will you let go or not?"

552
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,510
"I'm gonna yell for help!"

553
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,310
Then,

554
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:11,239
I would be taking photos of you two,

555
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,730
not giving a hoot about who would live or die.

556
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,190
It would be so fun.

557
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:36,699
Xingchi.

558
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,710
I hope you can be as happy as I am.

559
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
I wish you will find

560
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,170
a nice woman

561
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,360
who appreciates you,

562
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,870
loves you,

563
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,139
cares about you and even dotes on you as if you were a kid.

564
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,670
Thank you.

565
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,670
I hope

566
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,590
you and Wanghe

567
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,070
will grow old together,

568
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,120
and have a lifetime of happiness.

569
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,550
Grandpa,

570
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:22,320
the Flower Street

571
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,480
will be renovated soon.

572
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,280
Before long,

573
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,410
we will all move out.

574
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,070
Really?

575
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,230
Then where will we live?

576
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,530
Fenghua found a courtyard for us.

577
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,730
We'll move there.

578
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:35,630
Is everybody moving there?

579
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,400
Yes.

580
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:39,410
Our family...

581
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,220
The Xie family...

582
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,350
The Xia family...

583
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,570
The Shao family...

584
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,760
Grandpa, don't worry.

585
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,330
Everybody here

586
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:50,140
will move to the new courtyard.

587
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,230
When we move,

588
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:54,230
I'll catch all the crickets here and bring them to you.

589
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,290
That's good.

590
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,920
Is there a central hall?

591
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,750
Yes.

592
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:02,110
Don't worry.

593
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:05,050
That courtyard is much bigger than this one.

594
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,040
Good.

595
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,710
The central hall should be saved for Granny Ma.

596
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,780
Plus,

597
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,640
we should install an air conditioner for her.

598
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,770
Her room is too warm.

599
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,510
In summer days,

600
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,440
the heat would push everyone away.

601
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,070
Get her

602
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,270
a new TV too.

603
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,660
It

604
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,660
has to be 40 inches, with an LCD screen.

605
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:30,770
The radio says there are promotional activities lately.

606
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,830
Electric appliances are on sale.

607
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,600
Buy her a TV when you have time.

608
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:36,440
Okay.

609
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,580
It's best

610
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,590
if you get her a new washing machine as well.

611
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,670
Granny Ma always tries to save on her electric bills,

612
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,710
so she often washes her clothes by hand.

613
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,300
Why bother?

614
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,580
Power prices aren't that high, are they?

615
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,980
When are you and Fenghua leaving?

616
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:05,740
Tomorrow.

617
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,830
Then you'll miss the opening of my bookstore.

618
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,290
We will come back someday.

619
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,740
Wish you prosperity!

620
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,340
I don't think it'll come true for me.

621
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,800
I'll take it as a win if I don't lose any money.

622
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,550
What transportation will you take tomorrow?

623
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,480
I'll drive a car.

624
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,070
Fenghua said

625
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,840
she would love to go north along the canal,

626
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:33,330
so she could see the scenery on the road.

627
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,670
Is she physically strong enough for that?

628
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,710
First, we'll leave the province,

629
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,090
get on the highway,

630
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,570
and then drive along the canal.

631
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,310
It'll take about one week.

632
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:45,070
I think she'll be fine.

633
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,000
One week?

634
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,490
As I remember,

635
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,590
it would take at least one month

636
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,730
to go to the north by ship。

637
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,150
The main cities and towns

638
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,270
we'll come across

639
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:00,110
are Xuzhou, Jining, Linqing,

640
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,960
Cangzhou and Tianjin.

641
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,520
Fenghua said,

642
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,660
since we grew up by the canal,

643
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,560
whenever she felt tired

644
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,730
in Beijing,

645
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:12,820
she would take a walk by the river to recharge her batteries.

646
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,770
This time,

647
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,560
she plans to recharge her batteries on the whole trip,

648
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,760
till she is fully energized and ready to receive surgery.

649
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,150
Okay.

650
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,090
I wish you

651
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,810
all the best.

652
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,700
And I hope

653
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,330
you will come home soon.

654
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,510
Thank you.

655
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,720
I'll keep you updated. Don't worry.

656
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,920
Just take good care

657
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,350
-of your family.
-Hurry up.

658
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,120
There you go.

659
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,070
Alright.

660
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,480
Go take care of your daughter.

661
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,220
I-I'm leaving then.

662
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,360
I'll be off then, Dad.

663
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:57,960
Okay.

664
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,840
Easy on the drinks.

665
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,550
Okay.

666
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,400
I'll be waiting for you to come back.

667
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,730
Go home. Go home now.

668
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,320
Bye.

669
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,230
We're leaving then.

670
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:06,920
Okay.

671
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,510
Off you go.

672
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,240
Don't worry.

673
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,280
♫There are lights afar♫

674
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:24,950
♫You lower your head as you walk♫

675
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,950
♫The bigger the city is, the more unsettled one feels♫

676
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,760
♫So many yearnings, on a long road♫

677
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,850
♫Too many heart-breaking moments along the way♫

678
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:44,450
♫The smiles in the past are forgotten♫

679
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,150
♫Time makes us♫

680
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,010
Right here.

♫Fragile and tough♫

682

Here?

683
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,320

♫I want to sing to you again, gently♫

685

Aren't you rich, Brother Kuo?

686
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,670
Don't you know this place? Look over there.

♫How I wish I can be with you♫

688
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,200
There is a river over there.

689
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,230
Nice.

690
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,810
♫I want to tell you the scenery I've seen♫

00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,480
The surroundings look fine to me.

692
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,700
What a lovely place.

693
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:03,880
And it's much bigger.

694
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,570
Let's go inside.

695
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,220
Sure.

696
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,760
♫I think on every silent night♫

♫I want to be with you for all the ups and downs♫

702
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,720
is that given your current condition,

703
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,030
the success rate

704
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,610
of a craniotomy is high,

705
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:32,030
and your illness is very likely to be cured.

706
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:32,960
Don't worry.

707
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,170
We'll try to minimize the risk.

708

So,

709
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:38,890
I hope you'll stay positive and receive treatment.

710
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,360
What are you doing?

711
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:52,930
Get back to your work.

712
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:53,540
Master.

713
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,820
♫Too many heart-breaking moments along the way♫

714
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:22,530
♫The smiles in the past are forgotten♫

What is it?

716
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,280
Isn't this a photo of my grandpa?

717
