3
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,310
Boss!

4
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,440
One bowl of tofu pudding, please.

5
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,710
Fenghua, why are you back?

6
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,240
Auntie.

7
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:19,840
Auntie.

8
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,520
We'd like a bowl too.

9
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,180
Wanghe, Xingchi, Haikuo!

10
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,890
How did you all get back?

11
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,730
By car.

12
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:26,150
It must have been a tiring journey.

13
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,880
Hurry, hurry.

14
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,680
Go home first.

15
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,760
Let your family know you're back.

16
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,860
Come back to my shop for tofu pudding later.

17
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,470
Are we closing?

18
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,690
At least for now.

19
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,260
This is great!

20
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,670
Are you back for the Mid-Autumn Festival?

21
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,650
I missed you.

22
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,420
This is wonderful!

23
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,590
Eat up quickly.

24
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,520
This...

25
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,880
Look at you.

26
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,290
Coming all this way just to visit.

27
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,510
You're really something.

28
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,000
It's the Mid-Autumn Festival.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,730
I wanted to come back for a family reunion dinner.

30
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:54,450
You're busy,

31
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,630
and we can video chat now.

32
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,030
It's the same wherever you are.

33
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,680
Exactly.

34
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,920
How about I go back to Beijing now?

35
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,230
Don't you dare.

36
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,400
Here.

37
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,840
Have some buns.

38
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,250
Come.

39
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,630
Okay.

40
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,510
It's hot.

41
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,920
How long are you staying this time?

42
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,320
I have to leave tomorrow.

43
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,510
Leaving tomorrow?

44
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,620
What’s the point of making this trip back here?

45
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,310
Work's been hectic.

46
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,120
This time, it was Wanghe who helped arrange time off too.

47
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,720
Otherwise, I couldn't have come.

48
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,850
It's good to be busy.

49
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,000
Being busy...

50
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,560
means the company values you more.

51
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,900
They're willing to give you more responsibilities.

52
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,230
Grandpa, Wanghe is now my boss.

53
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,880
Xingchi and I work under him.

54
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,300
Right, this boss of yours...

55
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,160
How is he treating you?

56
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,140
Pretty good.

57
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,950
He’s been a big help to the two of us at work.

58
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,800
We can learn a lot from him.

59
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,290
What about his personal life?

60
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,690
Their personal lives aren’t as good as mine.

61
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,890
They're both single.

62
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,790
They need to learn from me in this aspect.

63
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,720
These days, your grandson also has

64
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,680
someone to come home to after work.

65
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,910
Dad, did you hear that?

66
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,760
Your grandson

67
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,410
is shamelessly bragging and showing off.

68
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,010
It's better to be like you.

69
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,830
As a single, you're free.

70
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,750
Cut it out.

71
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,100
Alright, I'm done talking.

72
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,370
I'll go prepare some food for you.

73
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,000
Ask them if there's anything they want to eat.

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,660
Okay, thanks, Dad.

75
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,519
Don't be like your dad.

76
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,800
Oh yes, Grandpa.

77
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,500
My girlfriend bought you some mooncakes.

78
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,020
Really?

79
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,420
They're from Daoxiangcun.

80
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,540
That's nice.

81
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,580
I'm off to work.

82
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,490
Our son just got back.

83
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,720
Why can't you have a chat with him and go later?

84
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,159
It's not like he doesn't have a phone.

85
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,550
Can't we chat on the phone?

86
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,950
It's fine, just go ahead.

87
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:38,830
I'm off then.

88
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,890
Come home early after work.

89
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,090
Where else could I go?

90
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,970
Do you two still argue these days?

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,120
What arguments?

92
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,120
We're too old for that now.

93
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,350
Just thinking about it is exhausting.

94
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,210
Don't worry, everything's fine.

95
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,210
Don't just share the good news and leave out the bad.

96
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,470
You're the one who only shares good news.

97
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,010
With all that you've experienced in Beijing,

98
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,040
you nearly gave me a heart attack.

99
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,840
You know that?

100
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,450
Mom.

101
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,170
Your son is on the right path now.

102
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,800
Let me tell you.

103
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,710
In just two years,

104
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,340
all the things I bragged about before

105
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,400
will be fulfilled.

106
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,010
There's never enough money to be made.

107
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,160
As long as you stay on the right path,

108
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,740
your mom will be at peace.

109
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,420
I know.

110
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,870

00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,409
Here it comes!

174
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,610
Squirrel-shaped mandarin fish.

175
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,500
Grandpa, don't drink too much.

176
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,080
Okay, I don't need you to tell me.

177
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,550
By the way, come back often.

178
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,360
Come back and visit us often.

179
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,140
Come back often.

180
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,670
Come back often.

181
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,380
But...

182
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,520
He has a lot of business in Beijing.

183
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,550
Welcome, Mayor.

184
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,320
Happy holidays.

185
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,510
Cheers!

186
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,620
Today...

187
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,110
There's more good news.

188
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,130
The comprehensive upgrading and renovation of our Flower Street

189
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,940
has already begun.

190
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,120
Upgrade? To what?

191
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,150
It's exactly this courtyard

192
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,680
where we are all living now.

193
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,550
Houses that have fallen into disrepair will,

194
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,000
in principle, be renovated on-site.

195
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,000
On-site?

196
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,830
Then, then...

197
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,520
Do we need to move out?

198
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,750
Currently, the plan

199
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,870
has been submitted.

200
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,200
Let's try to make plans

201
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,330
and minimise disruption to your daily lives.

202
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,000
That's great!

203
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,840
When will it start?

204
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,800
If everything goes as planned,

205
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,530
next month.

206
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,120
That's so soon!

207
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,600
That is really quick and productive!

208
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,150
Indeed!

209
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,630
This is great news that deserves celebration.

210
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,610
Renovation...

211
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,840
What will it be like after the renovation?

212
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,770
I don't know, they're still planning.

213
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,120
But they'll most likely

214
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,660
try to preserve the original appearance of the old buildings as much as possible.

215
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,120
Does our courtyard count as an old building?

216
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:53,610
It should be.

217
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,720
My grandpa said

218
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,510
the main hall is over 200 years old.

219
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,850
As for Granny Ma's residence,

220
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,840
county records say it once produced a successful imperial examination candidate.

221
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,750
What about my house?

222
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,010
It produced servants.

223
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,590
No, for real though.

224
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,820
Granny Ma lives in the main hall,

225
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,430
so that's the master's room.

226
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,020
Your house and mine are the peripheral rooms,

227
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,160
where the maids and servants lived.

228
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,240
No wonder my grades were poor when I was young.

229
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,040
So it’s an issue of feng shui.

230
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,240
If I had lived in the same room as Siyi back then,

231
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,910
I might have gotten into a 985 university.

232
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,360
I think even if Siyi had been admitted, she might not have gone.

233
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,220
I remember she told me before the college entrance exam

234
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,090
that she thinks experience from traveling is more valuable than reading countless books.

235
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,000
And over these years,

236
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,730
she's been proving this saying with her actions.

237
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,550
You knew Siyi would leave?

238
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,700
I guessed that it was a possibility.

239
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,520
Why didn't you tell us back then?

240
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,930
With Siyi's personality,

241
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,080
what good would it have done to say anything?

242
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,080
Could we have kept her from leaving?

243
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,710
I used to worry a lot about Siyi too.

244
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,410
I was worried she'd suffer out there alone,

245
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,410
or be mistreated.

246
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,180
But I don't think so anymore.

247
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,530
Just recently,

248
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,440
together with Grandpa Zhou, Uncle Shao, and my dad,

249
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,420
we went on a business trip.

250
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,380
It was to trace the Shao family's ancestral footsteps.

251
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,810
It wasn't really that far,

252
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:01,600
but along the way,

253
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,480
I felt so happy

254
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,470
and excited.

255
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,400
I felt that it was the first time I truly

256
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,330
experienced the joy of traveling.

257
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,300
I believe it's the same for Siyi.

258
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,720
As long as you have hope

259
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,450
and a goal,

260
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,390
when you are on the road,

261
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,220
no matter how tired or difficult it gets for you,

262
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,110
you'll feel that

263
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,240
your heart is beating,

264
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,790
and life has its purpose.

265
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:26,980
Come on.

266
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,410
A toast

267
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,160
to Siyi, who's far away.

268
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,790
To Siyi.

269
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,790
To Siyi.

270

[By the Canal]

271
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,600
I'm fine.

272
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,630
Sit down, sit down.

273
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,630
Is that okay?

274
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,410
Okay.

275
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,000
Alright.

276
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,020
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival!

Fenghua.

279
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:58,670
Here,

280
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,460
have a tangerine.

281
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,120
The new ones are really sweet.

282
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,020
Thanks, Mom.

283
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,170
Stop watching.

284
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,370
Chat with me for a bit.

285
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,820
Every time we talk on the phone, you're always in such a rush.

286
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,410
You hang up before we're even done talking.

287
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,270
Well, go ahead.

288
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,540
Be honest with me.

289
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,610
Do you have a boyfriend?

290
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,630
What do you mean 'ah'?

291
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,730
I'm your mother.

292
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,800
Your eyes can't fool me.

293
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,550
What's wrong with my eyes?

294
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,880
They are pretty normal.

295
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,890
Come on, tell me.

296
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,390
There's no one, really.

297
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,150
I'm so busy I barely have time to eat,

298
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,510
let alone find a boyfriend.

299
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,640
So you plan to stay single forever?

300
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,100
Well, I can't force it if there's no one.

301
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,520
I'm not the type to simply settle.

302
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,390
Well, your dad and I just settled for each other.

303

Aren't we doing fine now?

00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,610
Fine.

305
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,970
I'll just find someone randomly then.

306
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,640
Don't be picky when the time comes,

307

complaining about this and that.

00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,720
That won't do.

309
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,200
Character comes first.

310
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,090
I don't care about anything else.

311
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,070
Well, rest assured,

312
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,730
he has pretty good character.

Don't pressure me.

Why haven't you decided?

00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,790
It's complicated.

00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,120
You have to capture the opportunity.

344
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,140
If you don't, they'll turn around and find someone else.

345
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,670
How does that song lyric go?

346
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,640
"I've been waiting for you until my heart aches,

347
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,690
been waiting for you until I'm gone."

348
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,460
They'll be long gone.

349
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,060
You silly child.

350
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,190
Seriously.

351
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,440
Wait and wait.

352
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,130
Here, Son. This one has roe in it.

353
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,840
Eat more.

354
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,550
Just come back when you crave for it.

355
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,340
Eat more.

356
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,240
Tell me.

357
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,230
How much money have you saved?

358
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,960
You mean savings?

359
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,990
Any kind of money.

360
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,030
We just want to know how much money you have.

361
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,240
This way, we'll know how much money we need to give you

362
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,440
when you get married.

363
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:35,990
Right?

364
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,620
Why should you give me money?

365
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,370
How can I ask you guys for money when it's my wedding?

366
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,730
Say no more.

367
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,780
Just tell us the truth.

368
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,040
How much money

369
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,470
do you really have?

370
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,440
I don't have much cash.

371
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,400
About 70,000 to 80,000 yuan.

372
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,910
I used the rest of my money to buy stocks.

373
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,240
Which stock did you buy?

374
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:55,890
Moutai.

375
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:57,560
And I have a car.

376
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,130
It's gifted by my boss.

377
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,720
That's not much.

378
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:02,990
Wait.

379
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,600
So...

380
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,630
all these years you've been out there,

381
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,790
what have you been up to?

382
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,440
Look at you.

383
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,380
Pretending

384
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,410
to be a successful person around us?

385
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,770
I have options in Bee.

386
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,660
Quite a lot of them, actually.

387
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,320
Once the company gets listed,

388
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,600
I'll have complete financial independence.

389
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,950
What if it doesn't get listed?

390
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,300
We could do a merger and acquisition.

391
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,760
As long as this company doesn't go bankrupt,

392
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,800
I won't be poor.

393
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,560
So you mean...

394
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,870
you're really a successful businessman?

395
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,700
How could I fake that, Mom?

396
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:36,960
Look at our son.

397
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,600
He's so smart.

398
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,930
He's not the kind to be taken advantage of.

399
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,940
Son, have you ever thought about

400
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,310
coming back to develop your career here?

401
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:45,910
Come back?

402
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,060
What for?

403
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,450
You see, Mayor Gu said

404
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,120
that

405
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,630
once our canal makes it onto the World Heritage List,

406
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,750
the development potential for Flower Street will be huge.

407
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,790
You're a successful entrepreneur now.

408
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,880
A successful businessman.

409
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,690
I don't consider it an accomplishment if you enjoy success alone.

410
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,880
If you are really capable,

411
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,480
come back and lead everyone to make a fortune.

412
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,930
As the advertisement goes,

413
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,730
"It's only beneficial when it delivers for everyone."

414
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,440
Think about it.

415
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,300
Think about it.

416
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,120
It's because you two miss me, right?

417
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,050
You can come to Beijing.

418
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,610
Why should we go to Beijing?

419
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,270
To live with me.

420
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,440
Live?

421
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,150
I'm not used to living in Beijing.

422
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,410
I'm used to it.

423
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,780
Come on.

424
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:31,990
Come on.

425
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:32,890
Come on, Mom.

426
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,860
T-The wine is finished.

427
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:36,750
All you know is drink.

428
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,420
Go buy me another pot.

429
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,780
I want one that has been aged 8 years.

430
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,540
You've been drinking every day.

431
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,320
I'll go.

432
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,130
I'll go.

433
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:43,980
I'll go.

434
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,600
Do you know which shop it is?

435
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,320
Of course. How can I forget?

436
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,840
Tell him

437
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,510
it's for me and put it on my tab!

438
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:56,630
What do you think?

439
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,080
I won't go to Beijing.

440
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,530
I know you can't leave the canal.

441
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,870
Did you notice

442
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,620
there's something different about him this time?

443
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,680
What's different?

444
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,970
Aren't you afraid of falling over?

445
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,600
It's okay. I can swim.

446
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,560
You didn't go home for dinner?

447
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,420
I did. What about you?

448
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,340
I came out to buy wine for my dad.

449
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,360
Are you feeling down?

450
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,560
No.

451
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,400
Then why are you sitting here?

452
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,390
People might think

453
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,480
you want to jump into the river.

454
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,660
In Beijing,

455
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,630
I always feel like I'm a passerby.

456
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,780
I always feel restrained.

457
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,770
But when I'm home,

458
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,160
I feel empowered.

459
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,430
I feel like I'm not afraid of anything.

460
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,330
There's nothing I wouldn't say

461
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,060
and nothing that I wouldn't do.

462
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,560
Tell me about it then.

463
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,940
Xie Wanghe.

464
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,460
Do you have a crush on me?

465
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,910
Since when?

466
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,280
Does it matter?

467
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,480
Yes, very.

468
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,030
Let me think.

469
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,640
Yesterday?

470
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,100
I can't remember

471
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,960
when it was exactly.

472
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,470
Which year?

473
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,060
Before we went to Beijing

474
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:16,810
or after?

475
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:17,990
After.

476
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,590
In my third year of college,

477
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,530
I was working on a travel marketing project with others.

478
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,970
But they all skipped town.

479
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,400
We lost all our money.

480
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,020
♫But I...♫

481
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,680
Stop drinking.

♫I just want to hold your warm hand♫

Fenghua.

485
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,150
Give it to me!

486
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:35,960
Drink with me.

487
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,090
You, stop drinking!

488
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,000
Just have a drink with me.

489
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:42,540
♫And gently press it against my chest♫

490
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,110
Why are you drinking?

Go home now!

492
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,470
Take your glasses.

493
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,240
Stop drinking!

494
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:43,870
Go home!

495
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,130
It's none of your business!

496

♫A faint light shines through the window♫

497

♫Glowing on a young face♫

498
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,880
Entrepreneurship

499
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,490
is never smooth sailing.

500
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,930
♫Nurturing dreams, yet leaving confusion behind♫

501

Then why is it me who fails every time?

00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,700
♫Only sober love remains pure and clean♫

514
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,170
When I was little, who's the one that told me

515
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,830
♫No matter what's good or bad♫

516
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,370
we should get up

517
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,630
from wherever we fell?

518
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:22,000
♫I wish you find love in this lifetime♫

519
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,320
Even if you can't pick yourself up,

520
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,550
I'm here with you.

521
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,730
♫Don't walk away with regret♫

522
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,180
As long as you still want to win

523
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,590
♫Reunions always come too late♫

524
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,940
♫When the heavy rain falls♫

525
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,480
and you still have that will,

♫I'll be there to hold an umbrella for you♫

527

you won't fail

in the future.

529
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,150
♫I want to say goodnight to you♫

530
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,950
Just because of that?

531
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,160
♫So we won't get lost in the sea of dreams♫

532
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,330
Your motivational words

533
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,550
didn't do much for me.

534
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,730
♫You loved my fearless youth♫

535
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,160
Those two slaps were what

536
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,000
knocked some sense into me.

537
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:01,220
♫Only sober love remains pure and clean♫

538
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,440
Are you a masochist?

539
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:02,770
You just knew?

540
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,600
♫No matter what's good or bad♫

I should be even harsher to you in the future.

543
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,530
This way,

544
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,760
you'll like me more.

This atmosphere.

549
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,180
Did you have this all planned...

550
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,100
♫And there are fireworks sparkling♫

For what?

560
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:07,850
For not avoiding.

561
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,980
I'm on a bridge.

562
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,100
How can I dodge?

563
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,250
Jump into the river?

564
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,910
No.

565
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,750
It wasn't fair for me.

566
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,070
What do you want then?

567

Let's not tell anyone yet.

♫Finally♫

592
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,420
Let's keep it a secret for now.

593
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,140
Why?

594

♫Together with you♫

595
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,110
It was too sudden.

596

♫We watch the fireworks rise♫

597

00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,680
♫Those♫

599
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:40,740
Okay.

600
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,680
♫Wishes were all♫

601
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,350
Go back and think about it.

00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,330
♫About you♫

603
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:46,730
Just don't regret it when you wake up tomorrow.

604
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,500
♫Handing over♫

605
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,170
It's possible.

606
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,580
♫My entire heart♫

607
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,120
Good night.

608
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,780
♫Which you hold up with both your hands♫

609

♫This is the happiest thing♫

610
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:01,290
♫Which I had never thought of♫

00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,840
Good night.

614
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,980
♫The wishes we made when we were young♫

615
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,520
♫And you're by my side♫

616
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:32,490
♫The fireworks finally flash before my eyes♫

617
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,680
Why are you still up?

618
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,290
Mom.

619
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,400
Has Dad

620
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,970
liked anyone else before?

621
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,070
How dare he?

622
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,120
I mean before.

623
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,670
Before you knew each other.

624
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,010
What does that have to do with me?

625
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,170
As long as he promised

626
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,350
he'd only love me from now on.

627
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:06,840
So,

628
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:09,640
you think it's okay even if

629
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,260
he has someone else in his heart?

630
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,190
I don't care who he has in his heart.

631
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,770
As long as he's by my side,

632
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,810
and I have his money in my pocket.

633
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,720
As for the rest, I can't care less.

634
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,440
I’ll just think of him as having an idol.

635
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,060
You're so open-minded.

636
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,080
Actually,

637
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,470
as the old saying goes,

638
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:35,530
"Soft fire makes sweet malt."

639
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,120
In life,

640
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,110
there are things that you will never understand.

641
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,240
And you'll hesitate

642
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,680
about what choice you should make.

643
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,200
So, you may as well not think about anything

644
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,180
or do anything.

645
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,520
Just let it be?

646
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,750
If you don't do anything, nothing will go wrong.

647
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,410
Don't worry.

648
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,400
Give it time.

649
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:06,300
Time will take care of everything for you.

650
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,070
Good girl, go to sleep.

651
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,850
You'll have a day on the road tomorrow.

652
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,590
Here.

653
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,440
Mom, stop.

654
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,960
Stop putting more stuff in. There's not enough room.

655
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,270
Take it.

656
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,530
I still have to take two people in the backseats.

657
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:23,720
I'll put the water here.

658
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,030
And there's fruit too.

659
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:24,920
Take this back.

660
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,640
No one wants mooncakes.

661
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,510
You must take it.

662
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,070
This is...

663
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,400
I can buy everything in Beijing.

664
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
I know you can buy everything there,

665
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,640
but nothing is better than what you get from home.

666
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,070
Don't work so hard, you know?

667
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,400
Be careful, be careful.

668
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:35,090
I'll just load them up.

669
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,930
Wanghe.

670
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:36,790
Keep an eye on her.

671
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:37,180
Okay.

672
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,840
Make sure she eats on time and doesn't stay up late.

673
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,150
I'll keep a close eye on her every day.

674
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:40,790
Okay.

675
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,930
Every day?

676
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,150
I don't have time every day.

677
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,190
Well, at least call me once a week.

678
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,500
All right, I will.

679
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,220

00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,640
Look at how pretty you are.

849
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,640
What can I do?

850
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:58,690
Fenghua looks great.

851
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:01,620
Fenghua, you should represent us couriers up there.

852
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,960
Stop kidding.

853
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,900
Let's keep working hard.

854
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,960
That day will come.

855
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:07,960
This year,

856
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,340
we've fought a good battle.

857
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,270
Next year,

858
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,260
we'll let the whole of Haidian know

859
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:14,500
which station is the most reliable.

860
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,810
Do you have confidence?

861
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,250
No.

862
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,469
No?

863
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,429
-Yes.
-Yes!

864
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,670
Fenghua.

865
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,710
They're just teasing you.

866
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,440
Then let's eat well and keep working.

867
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,360
Okay!

868
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,639
Let's eat, let's eat.

869
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,260
Fenghua, I'll go get you a bowl of soup.

870
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,320
Thank you, Auntie.

871
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,480
What are you doing?

872
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,340
Want some supper?

873
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,440
Let's spend New Year’s Eve together next week?

874
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,310
Permission granted. You may leave now.

875
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,430
You little brat, you really think you're Concubine Hua now?

876
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,630
Cheers to the last day of this year.

877
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,980
Isn't Xiaohui coming?

878
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,980
She's working overtime.

879
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,350
She has a lot of work to do.

880
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:48,530
She's so busy, she doesn't even have time to come home.

881
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:50,710
Did you two fight again?

882
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:51,880
No.

883
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,660
She’s holding onto my payroll card.

884
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,430
She can spend my money however she wants.

885
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,920
Look at my attitude.

886
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,960
What can she buy with your salary?

887
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,810
It's all about the attitude.

888
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:04,010
You're single. What do you know?

889
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:04,880
That's right.

890
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,410
Attitude is the key.

891
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:09,490
What girls care about the most is undivided love.

892
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:11,530
Even if I'm the most ordinary girl in the world,

893
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,610
you can only like me.

894
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,510
Yes.

895
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,520
This is how it works in Korean dramas.

896
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,500
You still have time to watch Korean dramas?

897
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,160
We are so busy that we don't even have time to eat.

898
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:23,960
Hey.

899
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,170
Can't I have some spare time?

900
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,800
The performance of your Station 203...

901
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,280
I know it's unsatisfactory.

902
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,190
Don't worry.

903
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,240
I've got an idea.

904
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,920
Things will change drastically after the New Year.

905
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,060
I'm worried that you'll be eliminated

906
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,720
before that change happens.

907
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,860
Are you here to pick a fight today?

908
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,200
Bro.

909
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:43,320
Your performance is not good.

910
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,610
Can't I say something about it?

911
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,640
If your performance was better,

912
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,010
would I even talk about it?

913
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:47,970
Do you have to...

914
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,480
Enough, shut up.

915
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,900
It's about to be New Year.

916
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,010
Come, have a toast.

917
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:52,760
Come on.

918
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,320
In 2014,

919
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:56,390
a lot has happened to all of us.

920
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,230
Let's forget

921
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,250
all the bad things,

922
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:58,950
and keep up with

923
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,220
all the good things.

924
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,360
I hope all of us can

925
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,430
get a step closer to our dreams.

926
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,840
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

927
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,430
Friends.

928
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,920
2014 is coming to an end.

929
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,350
Let's welcome 2015 together!

930
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:18,350
The countdown starts now.

931
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,700
Ten.

932
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,700
Nine.

933
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,440
Eight.

934
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,410
Seven.

935
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,400
Six.

936
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,400
Five.

937
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,190
Four.

938
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,000
Three.

939
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:26,920
Two.

940
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,790
One.

941
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,480
Happy New Year!

942
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:40,790
It's so beautiful!

943
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,220
Cheers.

944
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:45,800
Cheers.

945
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,960
Happy New Year.

946
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,800
Cheers!

947
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,480
Cheers to our friendship!

948
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,480
Happy New Year!

949
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,230
Come on!

950
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,210
This place is really nice.

951
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,510
What's wrong?

952
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,190
Is she drunk after only one drink?

953
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,720
Maybe she drank it too fast?

954
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,200
Did she have a drink prior?

955
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,290
The delivery riders of Station 203 all trust Chief Shao.

956
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:38,820
We also think highly of him.

957
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:39,950
But...

958
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,410
looking at our commission for the past few months,

959
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:45,230
we have some complaints

960
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,730
about the current plans.

961
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,820
You think the commission is too low, right?

962
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,700
Indeed.

963
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,070
Chief Shao insists that

964
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,440
every delivery rider in Station 203

965
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,480
take no more than

966
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,480
30 orders a day.

967
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:56,280
But

968
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:57,540
in other areas,

969
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,250
the riders take at least over 40 orders a day.

970
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,340
Last month's champion station, 201,

971
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,110
the riders there took 48 orders a day.

972
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:05,210
We delivery riders also compare within each other.

973
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,300
As time goes by,

974
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,810
it's inevitable that we feel frustrated.

975
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,230
I see.

976
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,930
Keep following Xingchi's orders at work

977
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:18,380
for the time being.

978
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,180
You can go now.

979
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,350
Mr. Xie.

980
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:31,330
Go ahead.

981
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,590
Fenghua seems to be

982
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,590
in poor physical condition lately.

983
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,030
What's wrong with her?

984
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,920
She looks very pale recently.

985
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,510
My mom and my wife both saw her vomiting in secret.

986
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,150
At first,

987
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,520
we thought she was pregnant.

988
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,780
Don't talk nonsense.

989
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,910
When I changed her pillow cover,

990
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:51,370
I found that she lost a lot of hair.

991
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:53,480
And there was blood on her toothbrush.

992
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,340
These are all symptoms of a weakened immune system.

993
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,520
Got it. Go.

994
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,060
You already had symptoms.

995
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,860
Why did it take you more than half a year to come?

996
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,520
Besides dizziness,

997
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,590
I just have a headache from time to time.

998
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,090
There are no other symptoms.

999
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,420
Have you been vomiting?

1000
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,110
Yes.

1001
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,060
Occasionally.

1002
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,460
Do you feel

1003
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,290
your eyesight has declined?

1004
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,590
A bit, I think.

1005
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,400
But everyone's on their phones nowadays.

1006
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,010
It's normal to see things a little blurry, isn't it?

1007
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:37,090
I suggest

1008
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,920
you do

1009
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,710
a thorough brain examination.

1010
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,510
Really?

1011
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,280
Is it that serious?

1012
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,270
I can't...

1013
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,430
give you a definitive diagnosis.

1014
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,550
You're still young.

1015
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,280
Go get examined,

1016
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,600
and we'll talk after the result comes out.

1017
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,250
