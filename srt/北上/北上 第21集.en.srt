00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:00,630
Hello, Mom.

4
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,430
Xingchi!

5
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,080
What have you been doing? Your phone has been off all day.

6
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,600
My phone ran out of battery.

7
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,610
I just charged it. What's wrong?

8
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:11,450
We were worried about you.

9
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,320
I'm a grown-up now.

10
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,079
You don't have to worry about me.

11

I'm fine.

12
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,300
Don't worry, Mom.

13
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,270
What do you mean "don't worry"?

14
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:19,829
Listen to me.

...Just keep your phone on.

17
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,740
I called you because I wanted to tell you that

your dad

19
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,500
has arranged with Mr. Du

20
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,970
for you to learn bamboo carving from him.

21
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,690
Bamboo carving?

22
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,020
That's an intangible cultural heritage.

Your Uncle Du

26
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,070
is a famous bamboo carving master.

27
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,310
He's doing me a great favor,

28
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,070
being willing to take you as an apprentice.

29

What happened?

35
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,710
He hung up, that's what happened.

36
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:54,310

He turned off his phone.

42
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,870
Look at him.

43
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,270
How can he be so immature?

44
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,150

They're becoming more and more filial.

And here he is, almost 30,

yet still in his rebellious phase.

Why do you have to get the other kids involved?

Who should I compare him to

if not them?

You know the saying, to feed without teaching

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,260
is the father's fault.

56
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,250
So it's all my fault, you mean?

57
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,670

If He Tianming wants to work here, that's okay.

But bringing his whole family here

Hey, Xia Fenghua.

108
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,040
What's that supposed to mean?

109
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,040
Don't talk out here.

110
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,630
Let's go talk in the office.

111
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,310
Come on, let's talk there.

112
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,240
Have a glass of water first and calm down.

113
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,590
You know we're running a business here, right?

114
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,030
This isn't a charity.

115
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,710
Have you ever seen anyone

116
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,200

117
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,230
Their family's situation is special.

118
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,390
Besides, He is capable.

119
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:50,240
He might be capable,

120
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,670
but can he handle the workload of three people?

121
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,050
Do you know there are four people in his family?

122
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,670
How can you support all of them?

123
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,190
But they're not just sitting around.

124
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,750
His mother cooks for the station,

125
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,990
and his wife helps with sorting.

126
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,790
They're all quite busy usually.

127
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,620
Are they your relatives?

128
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,480
No, they're not.

129
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,080
He and I were colleagues before.

130
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,390
We handed out flyers

131
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,160
and sold phone cases together.

132
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,970
I know his family is indigent.

133
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,470
I was just thinking,

134
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,750
since they can offer manpower

135
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,670
and they're not lazy,

136
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,400
why can't we all work together?

137
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,310
Besides, they're really not staying here for free.

138
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,310
Not for free?

139
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,740
You call that little money "not staying for free"?

140
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,210
Remember when

141
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,260
we set up this station together?

142
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,220
How difficult it was!

143
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,080
Why did you have to bring in some old, weak, sick, and disabled people?

144
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,670
Sun, how about this?

145
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,940
Do me a favor and

146
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,750
let them stay for a few more days.

147
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:47,900
He said

148
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:49,260
he's looking for a place.

149
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,610
As soon as he finds one, they'll move out immediately.

150
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,750
It has to be today.

151
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,870
They must leave immediately!

152
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,760
Sun.

153
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,159
Xia Fenghua.

154
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,150
Have you lost your mind?

155
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,620
Have you even lifted yourself out of poverty?

156
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,820
Yet you're thinking of helping others?

157
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,990
Are you in any position to do that?

158
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:05,720
Sun Daqing.

159
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,590
Since you've brought this up,

160
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,410
let's get things straight.

161
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,660
This station was originally contracted by me alone.

162
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,320
I only brought you in because you wanted to join.

163
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,870
Today, without my consent,

164
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,640
you tried to drive my employee away.

165
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,000
You have no right to do that.

166
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,900
For one station,

167
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,500
there's only so much money it can make.

168
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,960
If you give more to others,

169
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,850
there's less left for us to share.

170
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,520
Can't you do this simple math?

171
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,240
Did you buy that self-study diploma?

00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,840
Settle the accounts right away

174
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,070
and leave!

175
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,290
From now on,

176
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,390
I'll run this station myself!

177
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,950
Way to go, Xia Fenghua.

178
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,500
Don't you regret it.

179
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,290
From now on,

180
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,870
let's go

181

[Sorting Area (Urban Area)]

182
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,950
our separate ways!

183
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,790
Come in.

184
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,790
Fenghua, I'm sorry.

185
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,820
This is my own decision.

186
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,500
It has nothing to do with you.

187
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,670
Sun and I don't get along.

188
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,950
Splitting up was bound to happen sooner or later.

189
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:21,940
From now on,

190
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,150
we'll run this station ourselves.

191
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,410
The earth keeps spinning, regardless of who's here or not.

192
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:27,740
What about

193
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,810
the business Mr. Sun brought in?

194
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,670
He took all the business with him.

195
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,520
We'll find new business later.

196
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,159
No matter how much business we lose,

197
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,820
we'll make it up in the future.

198
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,130
But

199
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,630
you have to help me with some of the management work.

200
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,890
We can't afford it now,

201
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,940
so I won't be able to pay you extra.

202
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,120
No need, Fenghua.

203
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,710
We're already extremely grateful

204
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,130
to you for keeping us on.

205
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,840
Don't worry, Fenghua.

206
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,950
My whole family will work hard from now on.

207
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,410
We won't let you regret it.

208
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,410
Alright, get back to work.

209
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,020
This exhibition of ours

210
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,070
provides a detailed introduction to the history of the canal's evolution

211
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,470
through numerous artifacts and images.

[Honghuai Grand Canal Expo]

213
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,710
Please take a closer look.

214
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,390
Well, speaking of the Grand Canal,

215
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,840
we all know that

216
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,600
it's the greatest hydraulic engineering project of ancient times,

217
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,750
bar none.

218
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:35,150
In fact, starting from the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods,

219
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,240
up until today,

220
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,900
our country has continuously

221
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,590
been constructing and dredging the Grand Canal.

222
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,030
After the founding of New China,

223
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,270
in 1953 and 1957,

224
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,130
the Jiangyin Lock and Yangliuqing Lock were built,

225
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,460
as well as thousand-ton locks like the Suqian Lock.

226
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,270
After 1959,

227
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,220
to support the South-to-North Water Diversion Project,

228
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,630
the section from Xuzhou to the Yangtze River was expanded as a key project,

229
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:58,120
[Lively Jiangnan]

230
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,030
which is about 400 kilometers of the canal.

231
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,270
This increased the canal's annual one-way capacity

232
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,250
to nearly 20 million tons.

233
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,150
It also expanded

234
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,920
the irrigated and drained areas along the canal.

235
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,900
This measure

236
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,350
ensured the safety of people's lives and property

237
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,870
along the canal,

238
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,230
as well as the development of agricultural production.

239
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,360
Therefore, this project has achieved

240
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,520
social benefits in various aspects.

241
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,190
However, there's one point

242
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,650
I want to emphasize today.

243
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,230
That is, through this exhibition,

244
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,380
you may have felt that

245
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,550
this rich heritage

246
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,890
left by our ancestors

247
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,030
is still benefiting us descendants

[Footage of the Sunken Ship]

249

[Canal of Plenty]

251
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:33,910
Therefore,

252
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,230
we should sincerely exclaim that

253
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,750
this is indeed a great project.

254
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:41,830
Bravo.

255
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,010
Mr. Zhou.

256
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,640
Come and take a look at this.

257
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,610
Come on, check this out.

258
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:55,760
What is this?

259
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,980
An arrow.

260
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,550
Mr. Chen found this

261
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,520
on the ship. On the side of the ship.

262
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,180
I found it just now.

263
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,580
You know what it proves?

264
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,460
That this ship

265
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:05,790
was attacked.

266
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,770
Attacked by whom?

267
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,850
How would I know?

268
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,220
We'll have to wait for

269
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,220
further identification by archaeological experts.

270
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,860
If you ask me,

271
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,840
this ship from late Qing dynasty,

272
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,320
which is less than 100 years old,

273
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,160
really doesn't have much archaeological value.

274
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,420
It's been seven years since we started investigating,

275
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,770
and nothing was found.

276
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,910
We don't even know

277
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,250
who the owner of this ship was.

278
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,070
We do know.

279
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,390
The owner was an Italian.

280
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,470
We don't even know his name.

281
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,620
It's not even recorded in the county chronicles.

282
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,570
After the excavation was restarted,

283
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,060
we did get some new information.

284
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,410
Yes.

285
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,170
For example,

286
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,550
besides these, there's also

287
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,560
a compass,

288
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:47,930
a pocket watch,

289
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,610
a fountain pen, and that

290
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,430
water-damaged notebook.

291
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,710
Chen Rui

292
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,950
has made a significant discovery

293
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,470
out of

294
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,750
the restored photocopy of this notebook.

295
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,560
Is that so?

296
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,680
But now, he's not that sure.

297
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,860
The canal expo is happening at the right time.

298
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,690
I told him to go to Beijing to see the exhibition,

299
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,580
find the expert who was in charge of the excavation back then,

300
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,590
and ask about it.

301
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,550
He'll also take the opportunity to tell him that

302
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:12,610
the excavation work on the ancient ship has restarted.

303
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,070
That's great.

304
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,420
Maybe these seven years of waiting weren't in vain.

305
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,460
Sure. Sure.

306
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,550
That kind of ship

307
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,450
was actually quite common in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang area

308
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,790
in the Qing Dynasty.

309
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,180
But since there weren't any precious artifacts on the ship,

310
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,010
we returned to Beijing quite soon.

311
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,020
Yes, I understand.

312
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,440
But what was unearthed back then wasn't just some small items.

313
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,680
There was also a notebook.

314
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,420
I made a copy of that notebook,

315
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,080
and I've studied ancient Italian for a few years.

316
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,680
I have some new discoveries.

317
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,100
What new discoveries do you have?

318
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,280
I found out that the owner of that ship was an Italian.

319
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,280
And that notebook

320
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,380
was actually a diary.

321
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,110
It recorded his observations and experiences during his travels.

322
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,110
Actually, in that era,

323
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,280
there were indeed quite a few Westerners coming to China.

324
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,410
The related records

325
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,870
are also abundant.

326
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,190
But if the person's status at that time

327
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,550
wasn't prominent enough,

328
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,230
it actually doesn't have much research value.

329
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,190
Yes, yes, I understand.

330
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,470
From a macro-historical perspective, it might be so.

331
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,110
But there's one coincidence.

332
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,980
There are several surnames of attendants in that notebook,

333
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,920
namely Xie, Zhou, Xia, and Shao.

334
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,070
These coincide with the surnames

335
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,310
of several households in our Flower Street courtyard.

336
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,310
You mean

337
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,910
they are very likely to be

338
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,990
descendants of the shipwreck survivors?

339
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,600
I think that's possible.

340
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,190
So I'm here to ask you

341
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,750
for the original copy of that notebook.

342
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,070
I want to know the ship owner's

343
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,590
real name and identity.

344
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,050
Well, I'll have to go back and ask about that.

345
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,110
Since there were

346
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,550
no valuable cultural relics on that ship,

347
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,830
after we salvaged it,

348
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,830
we put everything in the warehouse.

349
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,750
How about this?

350
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,470
I'll have them look for it again, okay?

351
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,750
Okay, great.

352
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,670
Thank you, Professor Su.

353
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,830
You're welcome. Let's go.

354
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,340

You take your time and enjoy it. I need to catch up on sleep.

It's alright.

382

It has its ups and downs.

these couple of years,

404
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,270
we should work harder

405

a young girl,

00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,920
Wanghe told me

416
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,570
that Fenghua is doing really well

417
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:40,810

now that he's working at the headquarters,

00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,930
A high school teacher.

High school?

456
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,920
A woman. A woman.

457
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,430

Hold on. Hold on.

459

Her appearance...

460
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,830
It's a blind date, isn't it?

461
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,550
Well, that might be their intention.

462
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,550
What do you mean "intention"? It's really... Really not cool.

463
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,150
Alright, forget it.

464

466
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,640
Hey, what's wrong with me staying single?

467
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,270
Aren't you single all along as well?

468
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,750
We're different.

469
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,460

471
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,869

Where?

473
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,870
Dad.

474
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,030
Tell me the truth.

475
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,230
Back then, was it hard to get married again,

476
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,790
or did you not want to?

477
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:40,890
You see,

478
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,530
you managed to endure the loneliness for me.

479
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,910
Why can't I do the same?

480
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,250
That's not necessary.

481
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,690
Look, the neighbors

482
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,900
have been arranging things for you from all sides.

483
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,270
Even if you're unwilling,

484
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,810
you should at least meet her once.

485
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,740
Otherwise, you'll be disappointing everyone's good intentions.

486
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,830
Don't you agree?

487
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,580
Right. I agree.

488
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,270
You keep watching TV.

489
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,400
I'm going upstairs.

490
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,130
This one, this one.

491
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,000
Look, they're about the same age.

492
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,500
She looks really quiet. How nice.

493
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,540
And this one.

494
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,630
I think this one should also be our focus.

495
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:20,830
She's really nice.

496
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,630
Is that so?

497
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,030
Her conditions are good.

498
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,580
You're not trying to find a match for Yanlin again, are you?

499
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,830
Boss Xie, take a look.

500
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,760
What do you think of this woman?

501
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,690
Looking like that, she's not going out to film movies, is she?

502
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,250
She's a high school Chinese teacher, an intellectual.

503
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,990
But... But have you

504
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,990
asked for Haikuo's opinion?

505
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,370
He's also grown up, an adult now.

506
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,890
If I ask him, that's a bit...

507
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,690
Why don't we have our son ask him?

508
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,590
Right, right. Let Wanghe ask him.

509
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,210
They're of the same generation, and they're good friends.

510
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,140
They'll definitely speak their minds to each other,

511
00:18:59,140 --> 00:18:59,830
right?

512
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,720
And then we'll know.

513
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,800
Xiaohui didn't come?

514
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,240
She has a class reunion.

515
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,330
I didn't bother to go back either.

516
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,860
Go ahead, what did you want to talk to me about?

517
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,700
What's wrong? Is it so hard to say?

518
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,170
If you can't say it, then don't.

519
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,160
They want to find a partner for your dad.

520
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,380
They wanted to ask for your opinion.

521
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,470
If you don't agree, then...

522
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,150
I agree.

523
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,500
All these years,

524
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,710
my dad has stayed single and struggled alone.

525
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,870
It's not right.

526
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,290
Don't you want your parents to reconcile?

527
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,690
I've tried.

528
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,510
It did't work.

529
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,490
I've already given up.

530
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,740
Last year,

531
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,020
I asked my mom to come home for New Year's.

532
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,870
She had agreed at first,

533
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,890
but a few days before New Year's,

534
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,520
she said there was a role for her.

535
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,610
It was just a cameo.

536
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,690
Only for a few days.

537
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,930
What? Is this what you wanted to see me for?

538
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,280
What do you want for late-night snacks? My treat.

539
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,050
Why?

540
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,020
You feel sorry for me?

541
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,620
No need.

542
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,410
I'm not as fragile as you think.

543
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,210
Fine, I'm the fragile one, okay?

544
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,060
I've been under a lot of mental stress lately.

545
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,810
I urgently need emotional support.

546
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:44,530
Alright, alright.

547
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:45,290
Stop acting.

548
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,120
Your pity party won't work on me.

549
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,950
I'm telling the truth.

550
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,470
I'm about to be parachuted

551
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,500
in Haidian.

552
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,900
Besides the competition from Yuntu

553
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,620
and Eat Well,

554
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,950
I also have to deal with

555
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,530
the complex interpersonal relationships in the company.

556
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,000
If I'm only asked to handle business, there's no problem.

557
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,960
I'm confident.

558
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,680
But when it comes to office politics,

559
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,320
I'm still a bit insecure.

560
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,270
When you have time,

561
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,620
read "Comprehensive Mirror in Aid of Governance".

562
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,060
If you want to achieve great things,

563
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,130
don't hold back.

564
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,250
As long as you're sure you are in the right direction,

565
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,850
just push straight through.

566
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
If you get stuck,

567
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,870
it means you're not pushing hard enough.

568
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,240
Put in more effort.

569
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,770
No one can take you down on your own battlefield.

570
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:36,470
Come on.

571
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,030
You can definitely do it.

572
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,660
You have so much confidence in me?

573
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,350
Back then,

574
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,390
during the group-buying war,

575
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,430
you were in Xiamen.

576
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,930
You realized the trend was changing,

577
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,010
and you called your boss overnight,

578
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,620
telling him to shift the strategic focus

579
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,680
from group-buying to food delivery.

580
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,620
If it weren't for that call,

581
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,540
whether Bee would still exist now would be unknown.

582
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,910
So your boss should be very clear

583
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,230
who he should support.

584
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,820
Hope so.

585
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,880
Brother-in-law!

586
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,560
How could they do that?

587
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,940
I was doing well at the Haidian branch,

588
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,540
and suddenly they decided to parachute someone in,

589
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,260
saying it's to assist me. Do they think I'm stupid?

590
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,910
What are they really up to?

591
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,700
You didn't do a good job yourself.

592
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,790
The higher-ups have concerns.

593
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,330
If the higher-ups have concerns, they can bring them up to me.

594
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,040
I never said I wouldn't correct my mistakes.

595
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,230
But now, all of a sudden,

596
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,580
they sent someone to take over our territory.

597
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,490
What's that supposed to mean?

598
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,620
Was all our previous work for nothing?

599
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,290
Do you know anything about Xie Wanghe?

600
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:41,890
He's just a ground promoter.

601
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,340
Why should I know about him?

602
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,020
During the group-buying war,

603
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,940
Xie Wanghe's achievements were remarkable.

604
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,140
If it weren't for him,

605
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,860
Bee might not even exist today.

606
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,300
When dealing with someone like him,

607
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,760
you absolutely can't confront him head-on.

608
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,310
Otherwise,

609
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,780
you'll only embarrass yourself.

610
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,880
According to what you're saying,

611
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,640
we might as well just hand over Haidian's business

612
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,990
to him and be done with it.

613
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,990
Why even bother discussing it then?

614
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,880
Mr. Qiu, Mr. Xie is here.

615
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:14,710
Mr. Song.

616
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,720
Sorry to keep you waiting.

617
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,070
It's all right. Here, let me introduce.

618
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,000
This is Xie Wanghe, Mr. Xie.

619
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,230
This is Qiu Lin,

620
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,590
head of the Haidian branch.

621
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,810
Pleased to meet you.

622
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,300
What kind of tea would you like?

623
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,220
No need for tea.

624
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,850
Room temperature water is fine.

625
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:32,720
How about bottled water?

626
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,430
Alright.

627
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,920
Qiu Lin.

628
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,950
Go get some bottled water.

629
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,860
Mr. Song, we're all quite busy, so let's get straight to the point.

630
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,860
Let's forget about the water, okay?

631
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,530
Okay, no problem.

632
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,120
I'll get to the point then.

633
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,000
Alright then.

634
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,470
Let's sit down and talk.

635
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,390
Qiu Lin.

636
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,400
Offer your seat to Mr. Xie.

637
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,700
Come on.

638
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,330
Mr. Xie, please.

639
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,690
Mr. Song.

640
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:09,790
Mr. Qiu.

641
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,760
The headquarters is

642
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,840
very dissatisfied with

643
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,600
the work of the Haidian branch.

644
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,550
Do you have any idea how fierce the competition is

645
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,710
in Haidian?

646
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,430
Let Mr. Xie finish first.

647
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,140
For the food delivery industry,

648
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,140
the Beijing market

649
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,920
is extremely important.

650
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,930
And Haidian is the most crucial area.

651
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,640
However, our current

652
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,930
market share in Haidian is less than 30%.

653
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:36,010
It has even been declining recently.

654
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,050
With shortage of money

655
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,080
and manpower,

656
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,540
under such circumstances,

657
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,290
the fact that we can maintain a market share

658
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,670
of 30% in Haidian is already quite good.

659
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,460
Everyone in the industry knows

660
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,300
that to compete for this market,

661
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,580
every platform is offering subsidies.

662
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,190
Look at Yuntu

663
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,600
and Eat Well.

664
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,370
They've already offered three rounds of subsidies just this year.

665
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,370
What about us?

666
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,560
Since the day I started working here,

667
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,200
we've only offered subsidies once,

668
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,860
and it wasn't even as substantial as the others.

669
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,600
Under such fierce competition,

670
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,460
I still managed to maintain

671
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,210
the market share in Haidian

672
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,240
steady at 30%.

673
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,600
If the head office is still not satisfied,

674
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:20,950
I'll quit. How about that?

675
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:21,830
Sure.

676
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,080
I'll write a report to the headquarters,

677
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,680
and you'll just need to sign.

678
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,640
It's not like that, Mr. Xie.

679
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,730
Qiu Lin

680
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,310
is just short-tempered

681
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,590
and speaks a bit harshly.

682
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,870
Please don't take offense.

683
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,380
It's fine. We're all on the same team.

684
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,110
Who's on the same team with you?

685
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,720
Who do you think you are?

686
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:41,830
Qiu Lin.

687
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,190
Are you done yet?

688
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,600
Do you still want to work here? If not, get lost!

689
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,880
Mr. Qiu.

690
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,710
Two years ago,

691
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,820
during the group-buying war,

692
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,320
all platforms were burning money.

693
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,980
Mr. Meng wanted to do the same in the first place,

694
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,550
but we didn't have enough funds.

695
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,350
Financing wasn't going well either.

696
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,110
In the end, we were forced to

697
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,580
leave Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen,

698
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,180
and we had to look for opportunities in second, third, and fourth-tier cities.

699
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,250
Fortunately,

700
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,070
our strategic direction and execution were on point.

701
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,670
In over 70 cities

702
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,540
and more than 1,000 sales points,

703
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,820
we cooperated closely to break through.

704
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,300
In the end, we successfully implemented

705
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,310
the strategy of encircling the cities from the rural areas.

706
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,260
Our survival in that round

707
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,030
wasn't due to funding,

708
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,670
but our determination and courage to fight with our backs against the wall.

709
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:32,550
Next,

710
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:36,090
Bee will shift from group-buying to food delivery,

711
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,600
focusing on local life services.

712
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,350
So, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen

713
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,270
are markets we must conquer.

714
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:44,780
Before I came,

715
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,780
I made a pledge to Mr. Meng that

716
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,710
within a year,

717
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,000
I will increase Bee's market share in Haidian

718
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,360
to 50%.

719
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:55,670
50%?

720
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,310
That's wishful thinking.

721
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,070
If I don't reach the goal,

722
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,310
I'll resign.

723
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,160
Then you'll definitely have to resign.

724
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,920
However,

725
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,180
I'll take the responsible parties

726
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,220
with me when I go.

727
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,330
Dear passengers.

728
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,270
For your safety and the safety of others,

729
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:30,070
please do not bring flammable, explosive, toxic, or dangerous items,

730
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:33,440
or oversized and overweight items into the station or on the train.

731
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,910
Please cooperate with the security check.

732
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:35,430
Sir.

733
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,230
Thank you for your cooperation.

734
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,630
How much does a welder make per month?

735
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,690
That depends on your skill level.

736
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:43,980
I...

737
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,100
I used to do car repairs,

738
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,290
and I can weld too.

739
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,230
Do you have a certificate?

740
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,970
Certificate...

741
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,570
That's easy.

742
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,370
He can make one himself.

743
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,440
Officer Xia.

744
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,890
I've already changed my line of work.

745
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,120
Are you sure?

746
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,300
I am.

747
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,890
Prison food isn't good.

748
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,050
I've got the munchies.

749
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,850
A bowl of noodles would suffice.

750
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,870
Everything in Beijing is good,

751
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,980
but not the noodles.

752
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,150
Then why do you seem to enjoy them?

753
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,590
Where are you from again?

754
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,790
I'm from Honghuai, Jiangsu Province.

755
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,450
It's a small city by the canal.

756
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,870
How long have you been in Beijing?

757
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,420
I came here in 2008. You know that.

758
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,820
Did you come by yourself?

759
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,560
With those buddies. We came together.

760
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,010
Yeah, right.

761
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:35,070
Where are they now?

762
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,530
Officer Xia.

763
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,900
Are you taking a census?

764
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,720
For someone like you who disrupts social stability,

765
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,980
it's necessary to check thoroughly. No problem with that.

766
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:48,440
I've done legitimate businesses before.

767
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:51,840
But they all failed, didn't they? I've already confessed.

768
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,440
Then do you know

769
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,500
why you failed?

770
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,750
I was just unlucky.

771
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,730
It's so hard to make a living without a diploma nowadays.

772
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,420
How much can you really make,

773
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:04,790
selling fake IDs?

774
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,910
If you hadn't caught me, I'd be making quite a bit.

775
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,040
I could make tens of thousands a month.

776
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:11,660
Then why don't you sell drugs?

777
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,190
That makes even more money.

778
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:17,040
Hey, Officer Xia, what do you mean by that?

779
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,110
Even if I had the desire, I don't have the guts.

780
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:21,170
You shouldn't even have that desire.

781
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,430
Work hard and honestly in Beijing,

782
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,560
and opportunities will come your way.

783
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,680
What opportunities could someone like me have?

784
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,370
Do you know

785
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,910
how much a food delivery rider

786
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,000
makes in a month?

787
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:42,750
How much?

788
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,240
I didn't know before, but I've asked around.

789
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,670
When business is good, they can make 7,000 to 8,000 yuan a month.

790
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,130
It's even possible to make over ten thousand.

791
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,180
Really?

792
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,050
Of course.

793
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,300
But it's hard work.

794
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,800
Especially when the weather is bad.

795
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,020
Even when there's strong wind, heavy rain, or heavy snow,

796
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,080
they still have to work day and night.

797
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,090
When they get busy, they don't even have time to go to the toilet.

798
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,150
Isn't that what we're out here for? To make money?

799
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,610
Who's afraid of hard work?

800
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:04,660
Are you interested?

801
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,850
If you're interested, I can hook you up.

802
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,790
There's a food delivery station in our area.

803
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,450
Mentioning my name will help.

804
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,280
Xingchi.

805
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,410
Well, I've looked into your background.

806
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:17,450
You have records of acts of bravery from both last year and the year before.

807
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,010
You're quite a righteous guy.

808
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:21,070
Your heart's also in the right place.

809
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,550
Don't ever go down a path of no return.

810
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,000
Alright, eat up.

811
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:28,970
Don't just sit there.

812
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,550
Here, bubble tea.

813
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:38,810
What about yours?

814
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,010
Jiang Xiaohui, Zhou Haikuo.

815
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,240
Visiting each other during work hours.

816
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,830
Each of you will be deducted three points.

817
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,410
I'm... I'm sorry, team leader.

818
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,040
I was just delivering bubble tea to him.

819
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,060
I'll get back to work right away.

820
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,220
Don't just say sorry.

821
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,680
Is it fun to keep doing this?

822
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,040
I know you two are close,

823
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,780
but you can't be lovey-dovey all day.

824
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,030
This is a workplace.

825
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,020
If you want to date,

826
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,990
there's a park downstairs.

827
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:57,430
Why don't you go there?

828
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,080
Is this any of your business?

829
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,890
What does it have to do with you?

830
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,670
You said it yourself that this is a workplace.

831
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,870
It's not a prison.

832
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,560
We're not convicts.

833
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,420
What's with your attitude?

834
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,630
Openly violating company rules.

835
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:09,990
Zhou Haikuo, you think you're in the right?

836
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,700
What? What's wrong with my attitude?

837
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,170
You're acting like you've got some special authority.

838
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,500
You like deducting points, huh?

839
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,150
Go ahead, deduct all my points.

840
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:15,670
Let's go. Let's go.

841
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,200
If you're so tough, fire me!

842
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,390
You...

843
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,510
Hey.

844
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,070
What are you doing?

845
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,880
You asked me to go to the park, didn't you?

846
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,800
I'm going to drink bubble tea there.

847
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,220
Let's go, Haikuo.

848
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,460
If you've got the guts, don't come back!

849
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,540
What are you looking at?

850
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,040
Too much free time, huh?

851
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,190
Each of you, three points deducted!

852
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,330
Get back to work now!

853
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,750
-Mr. Xie.
-Bye-bye, Mr. Xie.

854
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,310
Bye-bye.

855
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,110
Mr. Xie.

856
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,380
Mr. Xie.

857
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,110
Li, what's wrong?

858
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,440
There's something I want to tell you.

859
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,970
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

860
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:05,880
This afternoon,

861
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,460
I overheard Mr. Qiu chatting with some other delivery riders.

862
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,260
I didn't pay attention at first.

863
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,030
But then,

864
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,380
as I kept listening,

865
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,670
he started encouraging them

866
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,870
to jump ship to Yuntu.

867
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:15,440
What?

868
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,280
At first, I also thought I had misheard.

869
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,260
Later, I asked an employee about it.

870
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,520
It turns out to be true.

871
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:26,480
He said we can't compete with Yuntu,

872
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,050
and that if they could work well at Yuntu,

873
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,780
they could get company shares.

874
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,980
What should we do, Mr. Xie?

875
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,790
Don't do anything for now.

876
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,020
Let's observe secretly for a while.

877
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,490
Li.

878
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,770
We are the only ones

879
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,110
coming from the headquarters.

880
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,350
I'm counting on you.

881
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,200
Understood,

882
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:48,930
Mr. Xie.

883
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,230
In this company,

884
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,500
from top to bottom,

885
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,960
they're all Mr. Qiu's men.

886
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,720
You've been parachuted in

887
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,460
with just me as your assistant.

888
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,510
Although Mr. Meng supports you,

889
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,060
to get things done,

890
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,070
the most important thing

891
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,820
is to have your own team.

892
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,050
I understand.

893
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,980
When I'm not around,

894
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,780
keep an eye on them for me.

895
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,330
Leave the rest to me.

896
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,000
Okay.

897
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:12,840
Go ahead.

898
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,590
Mr. Xie.

899
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,980
In this company,

900
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,310
from top to bottom,

901
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,970
they're all Mr. Qiu's men.

902
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,490
You've been parachuted in

903
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:36,220
with just me as your assistant.

904
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,290
Although Mr. Meng supports you,

905
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:40,890
to get things done,

906
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:41,910
the most important thing

907
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,590
is to have your own team.

908
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,850
Haikuo.

909
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,720
What do you want to eat?

910
00:33:58,730 --> 00:33:59,400
Up to you.

911
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,390
Let's go.

912
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,830
You shouldn't have talked back to him today.

913
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,440
That guy is really sneaky.

914
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,230
He'll definitely cause trouble for you in the future.

915
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,699
I'm just a programmer.

916
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,120
As long as I do my job well,

917
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,860
I'm not afraid of those things.

918
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:18,040
But I just think it's unnecessary.

919
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,409
When you can't bear it anymore,

920
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:21,750
there's no need to endure further.

921
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,500
People like him

922
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,739
should be given a direct, hard blow.

923
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:26,750
Otherwise, he'll get more and more out of line.

924
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,730
When he first joined the company,

925
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:31,020
he couldn't even figure out how to partition a hard drive.

926
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,230
We all helped him.

927
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,330
But what happened?

928
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,980
Later, by means of sweet talk

929
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,800
and his ability to tattle,

930
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,330
he worked all his way up and became a team leader.

931
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:38,460
On his first day as team leader,

932
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,060
he fired a colleague who had helped him before.

933
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,699
In this kind of company,

934
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:45,500
work ability isn't the top priority to begin with.

935
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,270
So,

936
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,380
I don't want to work here anymore.

937
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,880
Actually, I've wanted to quit for a long time.

938
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:56,290
What's gotten into you?

939
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,520
My roommate

940
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,410
has been sending resumes everywhere since she quit.

941
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:01,140
It's been about half a year now,

942
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,630
and she's only had one interview.

943
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,700
She didn't even get the chance to say anything

944
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,650
before they said "Thank you" to her.

945
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:06,290
So,

946
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,780
she's still stuck at home.

947
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,260
With my abilities,

948
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,800
finding a job shouldn't be too difficult, right?

949
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,350
But it's very stable here,

950
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,630
and the work pressure is low.

951
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,740
I just feel it's too stable.

952
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:18,550
It's really boring.

953
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,330
I can't get excited about anything I do.

954
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,850
The work is also simple, and there's no challenge.

955
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:25,080
My brain is almost rusted.

956
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,670
Why are you here?

957
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:48,540
Why are you back so late?

958
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,600
I had something to do.

959
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,890
What could you possibly have to do?

960
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,330
Why is it so messy here?

961
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,730
Have something to eat.

962
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,430
I've eaten.

963
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,680
What did you eat?

964
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,740
Fried Sauce Noodles.

965
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,100
Then I'll eat alone.

966
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:43,190
How often do you wash your socks?

967
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,020
What?

968
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,500
Are you offering to wash them for me?

969
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,600
If you don't want to wash them,

970
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,380
you can pile them up and wash them all together later.

971
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,370
It also saves water.

972
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,970
That's what I did in college.

973
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,370
What's wrong with you?

974
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:00,960
Don't you know biological weapons are against the international law?

975
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:03,790
Spit it out.

976
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,580
What do you want from me?

977
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,730
Can't I just come to see you without a reason?

978
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:12,060
Haikuo may come to see me without a reason,

979
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,350
but you...

980
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,060
Our company

981
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,930
has a branch in Haidian.

982
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:32,210
I'm being parachuted there.

983
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:34,270
I'm planning to make a big splash.

984
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,010
That's great.

985
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,680
Congratulations.

986
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:41,970
I want you to come with me.

987
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,640
I've never worked in food delivery before.

988
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,770
I'm not interested.

989
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,000
If you've never done it,

990
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,870
how do you know you're not interested?

991
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,430
When Fenghua was busy before,

992
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:53,490
I went to help out for a couple of days.

993
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:54,370
It was boring.

994
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:04,320
Food delivery and express delivery are two different industries.

995
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,120
They're completely different.

996
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,560
What's the difference?

997
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,100
Isn't it just delivering from one point to another?

998
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,110
You're wrong.

999
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,870
China's food delivery industry

1000
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,460
is a market worth trillions.

1001
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,590
In the future, it will employ tens of millions of people.

1002
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,060
Isn't that great?

1003
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,660
Just work hard.

1004
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,990
I wish you prosperity and wealth.

1005
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,810
I'm being parachuted

1006
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,660
in Haidian.

1007
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,090
No one respects me.

1008
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:35,150
I need my own team.

1009
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,600
You have money. Just hire your own team.

1010
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,800
It's a big company.

1011
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:41,770
Isn't everyone desperate to get into cutting-edge industries?

1012
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:42,500
Hey.

1013
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,950
Why are you so unwilling to help me?

1014
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,360
Do you have any concerns?

1015
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,790
If you have concerns, just say it.

1016
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:54,400
There's nothing we can't talk about, right?

1017
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,330
It's not like that.

1018
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,990
I'm just worried I'll hold you back.

1019
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:01,950
I'm telling you,

1020
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:02,660
you won't.

1021
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,330
It's not like you lack ability.

1022
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:06,730
You just didn't choose the right industry.

1023
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:08,680
Think it over carefully.

1024
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,410
Take your time. I'm in no hurry.

1025
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:18,670
Chen Rui.

1026
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:19,880
Wanghe.

1027
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,150
I saw Siyi.

1028
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:23,340
For real?

1029
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,500
Where are you?

1030
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,820
Houhai Bar Street.

1031
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:26,730
Okay.

1032
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,870
We'll be right there.

1033
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:28,730
It was Chen Rui.

1034
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:29,860
He said he saw Siyi.

1035
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,490
Let's go.

1036
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:47,910
Chen Rui.

1037
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,510
Where is she?

1038
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,170
She's gone.

1039
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,640
Where did she go?

1040
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,640
Tell me!

1041
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,540
I don't know.

1042
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:01,490
The boss said she did perform here before.

1043
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:10,130
That girl is pretty good.

1044
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,070
She has a great voice,

1045
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,510
and she's beautiful.

1046
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:14,740
♫Far away, so far away♫

1047
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,150
She just didn't talk much.

1048
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,670
Sometimes customers would ask her to drink with them,

1049
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,840
but she never agreed.

1050
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:19,120
♫The hometown I can never return to♫

1051
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,270
After every performance,

1052
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,920
she'd take her salary and leave.

1053
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,220
Do you know where she went?

1054
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,830
♫Sitting quietly in the city♫

1055
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:21,870
She didn't tell me.

1056
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,790
She sang here for about two months.

1057
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:28,040
♫Listening to the river flow♫

1058
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:24,630
The last time,

1059
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,670
she said she was going on a long trip.

1060
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,250
I offered her a raise, but she wouldn't take it.

1061
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,360
When was that?

1062
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,170
Last month.

1063
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,660
♫Hometown, oh hometown♫

1064
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:31,380
Mid-last month.

1065
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,260
Well,

1066
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,290
I need to get back to work.

1067
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,440
You guys enjoy yourselves.

1068
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:37,150
♫Now a distant place I can't go back to♫

1069
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:36,580
Thank you.

1070
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:40,640
♫Sitting quietly in the city♫

1071
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,610
♫Listening as time drifts by♫

1072
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,150
Siyi

1073
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:50,950
♫The sunsets in the city♫

1074
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,310
sang here for over two months.

1075
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:51,860
I passed by here every day,

1076
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:54,910
♫Hold no poetry, no distant dreams♫

1077
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,860
yet I never ran into her.

1078
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:59,500
♫Walking through a world like a song♫

1079
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:04,120
♫From oblivion to oblivion♫

1080
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:05,000
It's not our fault

1081
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,180
♫The love that passed through those remaining years♫

1082
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,300
she never contacted us.

1083
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,330
It's my fault.

1084
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,180
It's my fault.

1085
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,610
♫Without complaints or piano music♫

1086
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,610
If I...

1087
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:17,000
♫The coolness after the gentle breeze♫

1088
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,900
If I hadn't waved my hand

1089
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:21,950
♫I'm destined to be like you♫

1090
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,280
and hadn't shouted,

1091
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,920
Siwei wouldn't have jumped.

1092
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,240
I'm sure Siyi doesn't see it that way.

1093
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,760
Then how does she see it?

1094
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,400
Tell me how she sees it.

1095
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,490
After all these years,

1096
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,890
why couldn't she just contact us?

1097
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,240
Why?

1098
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,070
Siyi takes things to heart.

1099
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:43,690
♫Hometown, oh hometown♫

1100
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:44,750
She's worried she wouldn't be able to repay our favors.

1101
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,860
We never asked her to repay us.

1102
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:47,870
♫Now a distant place I can't go back to♫

1103
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,880
We're all family.

1104

♫Sitting quietly in the city♫

1105
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,580
Who asked her to repay anything?

1106
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,600
What's with that shouting?

1107
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,740
♫Listening as time drifts by♫

1108
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,670
Alright.

1109
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,390
Sorry about that.

1110
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:56,120
Let's drink.

1111
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,830
Why are you shouting?

1112
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,840
What's wrong with you?

1113
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,820
-Wanghe.
-Wanghe.

1114
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,960
What are you doing?

1115
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,010
Next,

1116
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,070
I'll sing a song for you.

1117
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:12,580
This song...

1118
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,290
Buddy, you can't come up here.

1119
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:15,650
Is dedicated to

1120
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:19,710
a friend who left without saying goodbye.

1121
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,990
Her name is Ma Siyi.

♫My friend♫

1123

Buddy, you can't sing here. Come down, come down.

00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:28,390
It's okay, it's okay.
