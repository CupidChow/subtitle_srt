[Episode 6]

3
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:49,990
Why did you try to wreck the car?

4
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,060
Crippled Sun didn't pay his debts.

5
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,880
My mom cried all night at home.

6
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,710
I just couldn't take it anymore.

7
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,570
The police's talk with you that day did work.

8
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,050
If this were before,

9
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,740
you'd have smashed the car for sure,

10
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,350
and then been caught on camera,

11
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,080
making your parents pay for it.

12
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,070
Honestly, I was worried about that.

13
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,200
At worst, I'd take responsibility myself.

14
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,120
I just feel that

15
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,200
I'm about to turn eighteen,

16
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,120
and I wanna change the way I live

17
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,630
instead of acting recklessly.

18
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,060
Siyi was right.

19
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,030
I should seriously think about my future path.

20
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,400
Don't worry,

21
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,870
you'll be fine.

22
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,790
You'll make a big fortune in the future.

23
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,520
How do you know that?

24
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,760
I've known it since childhood.

25
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,790
I knew it from the first time

26
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,390
I helped my mom watch the stall

27
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,240
on the street.

28
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,230
Three youtiao.

29
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,220
Three bowls of soy milk.

30
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,070
One yuan and fifty cents in total.

31
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,680
Pay now.

32
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,170
Pay for what?

33
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,430
No payment, no food!

34
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,990
What are you doing?

35
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,950
Give me the youtiao.

36
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,100
Give me that!

37
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,480
Give it to me!

38
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,810
What's wrong, Fenghua?

39
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,270
Madam, he's not paying!

40
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:10,670
I'll pay.

41
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,130
Mom, you don't need to pay.

42
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,420
Why?

43
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,070
I gave her mom a good idea.

44
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,270
And she said I could eat anything for free.

45
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,910
What idea?

46
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,390
Why don't I know about this?

47
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,660

[Breakfast]

49
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,790
with the crowds on Flower Street

50
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,150
and everything being so cheap,

51
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,290
despite a whole morning of her hard work,

52
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,530
she would only

53
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,480
earn a little bit of money.

54
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,540
I suggested

55
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:32,200
she prepare the soy milk first

56
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,280
and then hire someone to sell it at the school gate.

57
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,400
To sell various flavors of soy milk,

58
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,420
like red bean, chocolate, and such.

59
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,510
The daily turnover is basically

60
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,560
over 100 yuan.

61
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,430
Really?

62
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,160
Yes! It's true, of course.

63
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,300
Just one casual idea from you,

64
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,020
and my mom earned several hundred more each month.

65
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,480
She always praised you at home.

66
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,520
It drove me mad.

67
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,660
That was on your dimwittedness,

68
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,980
not my fault.

69
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,560
Most people are dimwitted compared to you.

70
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,360
Fenghua,

71
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,160
I don't have money.

72
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,600
I'm not asking you for money.

73
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,149
Look how scared you are.

74
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,160
You've never praised me like this before.

75
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,560
It's indeed scary.

76
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,150
I didn't praise you

77
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,480
just to keep you humble.

78
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,980
Then why now?

79
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,600
It'll be too late

80
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,890
If I don't praise you

81
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,320
before we graduate.

82
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,090
How could it be too late?

83
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,090
Well...

84
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,940
Who knows where we'll each end up in the future?

85
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,250
Maybe we'll go our separate ways

86
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,650
right after graduation.

87
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,070
I'm definitely going to Beijing.

88
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,910

What about you?

91
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,380
Depends on my mood.

92
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,570
Do you want me to go with you?

93
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,150
Nope.

94
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,100
Then I'll go!

95
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,080
I'll follow you wherever you go.

96
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,650
You make money, and I'll make money too!

97
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,370
You hit rock bottom,

98
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,430
and I'll sit by and watch the show.

99
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,350
Do I owe you something?

100
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,430
Yes, you do!

101
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,830
You promised to buy me a car when we were kids.

102
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,990
When did I say that?

103
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,390
Do you have any proof?

104
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,100
Fine...

105
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,750
I promise you.

106
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,760
I'll buy you one.

107
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,480
When I get my first paycheck,

108
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,380
I'll buy you a car.

109
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,680
What kind of car?

110
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,100
A three-wheeler.

111
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,400
Then you can drive it to make money.

112
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,610
Five yuan to Flower Street, twenty to Huai'an.

113
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,270
That's so little!

114
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,990
Flower Street...

115
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,650
Five yuan to Flower Street...

116
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,440
If you really strike it rich one day,

117
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,280
can you promise me one thing?

118
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:09,750
What is it?

119
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,460
Invite Jay Chou to our home

120
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,040
and have him sing a song just for me,

121
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,460
"Cute Girl."

122
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,000
Do you really think I'll make it one day?

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,750
Of course!

124
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,720
I've always believed

125
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,500
you can definitely work miracles.

126
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
So,

127
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,909
please have faith in yourself too.

128
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,380
Fenghua,

129
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,240
how about I lend you some money?

130
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
Why?

131
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,710
To buy new pants and ditch your worn-out ones.

132
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,040
They're embarrassing.

133
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,670
You know nothing

134
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,090
about fashion.

135
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,990
Have you heard of Paris Fashion Week?

136
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,820
How could I not know about Paris?

137
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,490
There's Notre Dame.

138
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,780
And you're that

139
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,920
Quasimodo.

140
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,080
You...

141
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,710
You love talking back, huh?

142
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,510
You look so much like him!

143
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,190
Would it kill you not to talk back?

144
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,480
You're the Quasimodo on Flower Street.

145
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,120
Stop there!

146
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,170
Don't hit me!

147
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,890
You deserve this!

148
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,150
Quasimodo!

149
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,140
Stop there!

150
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,230
Don't you feel cold at night?

151
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:56,430
What's up?

152
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,260
Nothing,

153
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,410
I just passed by

154
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,590
and wanted to drop in on you.

155
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,280
I got into a fight with someone today.

156
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,300
Did you win or lose?

157
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,770
I lost.

158
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,710
It was a total fiasco.

159
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,700
I was utterly crushed.

160
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,190
I don't think I've ever won

161
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,570
in my entire life.

162
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,960
Isn't it pathetic?

163
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,010
I can't even respect myself.

164
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,610
Hello, who is this?

165
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,890
Hello, Zhimei.

166
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,610
This is Granny Ma.

167
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,780
Granny Ma!

168
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:26,710
Excuse me, sir.

169
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,880
I need to take a call.

170
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,360
Granny Ma,

171
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,110
hello, what's the matter?

172
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,160
Zhimei,

173
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,710
How are you doing?

174
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,940
I'm doing well

00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,330
What's wrong?

691
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,730
Did you cry?

692
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:18,980
No.

693
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,350
Then why do you look so dejected?

694
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,010
What happened?

695
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,290
Really, it's nothing.

696
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:26,110
Tell me.

697
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,400
Mom,

698
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,860
I just saw Siyi.

699
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,670
I think she's working at Uncle Zhou's shop.

700
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:37,750
What kind of work?

701
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,170
It seemed to be food delivery.

702
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:43,100
I hid and didn't dare to ask her.

703
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,480
What's wrong with delivering food?

704
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,880
Do you think it's a shame?

705
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:47,080
Not at all.

706
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,470
That's it!

707
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,660
If she's not troubled,

708
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,230
why didn't she tell me?

709
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,740
You're so young,

710
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,920
yet your mind is full of twists and turns.

711
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,850
You've watched too many TV dramas.

712
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,200
Siyi always thinks too much

713
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:05,800
and keeps everything to herself when she encounters difficulties.

714
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,470
I really don't want to add to her stress.

715
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,840
Madam, I want some mung bean cakes, please.

716
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,770
Coming right up!

717
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,460
If you're real besties,

718
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,410
you'd better show some sincerity.

719
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,070
Avoiding it

720
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,590
won't fix anything.

721
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,370
How old are you?

722
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:24,070
None of your business.

723
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,770
What are you doing?

724
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:31,400
You really are photogenic.

725
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:43,650
Siyi.

726
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,590
This is our homemade salted pork.

727
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,660
Use it to make a dish for your grandma tomorrow.

728
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,630
No, thanks.

729
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,910
It's for your grandma,

730
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,180
not for you.

731
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:55,010
Just take it.

732
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,170
Thank you, Uncle Zhou.

733
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,080
I'll head back now.

734
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,610
OK.

735
00:36:58,990 --> 00:36:59,780
Be careful on your way.

736
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,510
OK.

737
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,710
Fenghua,

738
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,780
you really scared me!

739
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:35,140
Where have you been?

740
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,320
The library.

741
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,700
Nah,

742
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,080
it doesn't smell like the library.

743
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,330
It smells more like kitchen grease from a restaurant.

744
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:44,390
Huaiyang cuisine.

745
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,050
Go away.

746
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:50,050
Is it worth working part-time at the cost of your studies?

747
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,530
Don't worry,

748
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,510
I won't tell your grandma.

749
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,270
How did you know that?

750
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,760
Your hair smells like kitchen grease,

751
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,640
and your hands smell like dish soap.

752
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,620
And this.

753
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:17,070
Did you buy it at the library?

754
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,000
Don't tell anyone else, anyway.

755
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:21,940
I won't say anything.

756
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,720
Aren't you afraid Uncle Zhou will tell your grandma?

757
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,470
He won't.

758
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,570
I made him promise to keep it a secret.

759
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,190
I have a better idea

760
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,470
to make money.

761
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,620
Want to give it a try?

762
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:33,880
Not interested.

763
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:34,910
Really?

764
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,720
We received a photographer at my mother's stall.

765
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,950
He said being a model makes money really fast.

766
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:39,750
Model?

767
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,000
Come on, let's go to my place.

768
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,130
I'll show you.

769
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,880
This guy takes photos for ads.

770
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:51,750
He saw me and said I was photogenic enough

771
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,300
to be a print model.

772
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:56,410
A set of photos can be done in just a few hours.

773
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:58,330
Eight hundred yuan, paid in cash.

774
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:03,130
Sounds fishy.

775
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,250
Fine, you'll see.

776
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:14,090
Look, he took these random photos of me.

777
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,440
What do you think?

778
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:20,410
His skills are pretty good.

779
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:23,310
The skills are not the key.

780
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:24,730
It's all thanks to my good looks.

781
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,530
I look great in anyone's camera.

782
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,470
Are you really planning to try?

783
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,440
It doesn't hurt to try.

784
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,200
He has a studio in the city.

785
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,670
I'll find time to check it out later.

786
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,320
Would you go with me?

787
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,710
He invited you.

788
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:44,980
Why should I go?

789
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:48,360
I'm a bit scared to go alone.

790
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:49,810
What if it's a scam?

791
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,900
Then ask Wanghe and the others to go with you.

792
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:54,370
No.

793
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,590
I'll have to pose for the photos.

794
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:57,650
If those three see me like that,

795
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:59,110
I'd die of embarrassment.

796
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,190
Go with me, please.

797
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:06,290
Let's go together

798
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:07,270
and earn 800 per week.

799
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:08,920
That's over 3,000 a month!

800
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,760
Isn't that better than working at the restaurant?

801
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,600
Don't worry.

802
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,940
He even thinks I'm pretty.

803
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,680
So imagine how he'll see you.

804
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,990
You can take

805
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,680
a few more sets and post them online later.

806
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,090
You might become a famous model!

807
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,440
Then you could charge several thousand for a set

808
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,920
with your photos all over those websites.

809
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,660
People might ask for your autograph on the street.

810
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,720
Even Jay Chou might want you to star in his music videos.

811
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,370
I'll think about it.

812
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:53,840
Ms. Liang.

813
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,630
Siyi.

814
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:57,750
Let me help you.

815
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:59,050
No, thanks. It's too heavy.

816
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:00,750
So don't bother. I'll handle it.

817
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,390
It's okay.

818
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:03,370
You...

819
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:09,760
Let me take it.

820
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:13,890
Goodbye, then.

821
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:14,660
Wait...

822
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:16,770
Come in and have some water. C'mon.

823
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,580
Take a seat.

824
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,760
Where's Wanghe?

825
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,730
Who knows?

826
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,220
He's hanging out all the time, never at home.

827
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:31,140
Here.

828
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:32,480
Thank you.

829
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:34,590
If he were as sensible as you,

830
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,870
I would wake up laughing from my dreams.

831
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,660
He just doesn't like studying.

832
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,140
He'd surely score high if he were into it.

833
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,400
Let him be.

834
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:44,050
As long as he can graduate from high school.

835
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,380
What about you?

836
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,630
Have you decided which university to apply for?

837
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,290
Honghuai Normal University.

838
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,060
Is it a key university?

839
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,380
It's second-tier, but close to home.

840
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:59,010
I can come home every week to be with my grandma.

841
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,280
Good girl.

842
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:17,270
But...

843
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,440
Being too sensible isn't always good.

844
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,400
You might suffer a lot in your life.

845
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,030
Just drink it.

846
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,870
Thank you, Ms. Liang.

847
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:34,930
I'll take my leave.

848
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:36,740
Bye-bye.

849
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:38,480
Have a good rest!
