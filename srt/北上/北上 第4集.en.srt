3
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,490
Cut it thinner.

4
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,100
Are you braising it or stir-frying it?

5
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,479
Braising.

6
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,500
You're using such high heat for braising?

7
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,430
Alright. Got it.

8
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,950
Control the heat.

9
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,380
Boss!

10
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,200
Someone's looking for you.

11
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,180
Our boss is here.

12
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:04,710
Siyi.

13
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,670
Uncle Zhou.

14
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,690
Why are you here?

15
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,210
I'm here to find a job.

16
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,220
A part-time job.

17
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,720
I can wash dishes, serve tables, and sweep floors.

18
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,910
Except for cooking,

19
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:16,710
I can basically do all the other jobs.

20
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,990
H-Hold on a second.

21
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,410
What's wrong? What happened?

22
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,550
Besides, I can come to work every weekend.

23
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,410
I'll also take half the usual wage.

24
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,670
It's just I was wondering if I could get an advance payment.

25
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,810
An advance payment?

26
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,670
How much do you want?

27
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,820
4,700.

28
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,510
Why such a specific amount?

29
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,370
What exactly happened?

30
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,800
I can lend you the money,

31
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:49,840
Siyi,

32
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,579
but I can't offer you a job.

33
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:52,960
Why?

34
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,250
You tell me.

35
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,790
You're in your final year of senior high school.

36
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,030
Your only task right now

37
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,510
is to study hard,

38
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,290
okay?

39
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:00,820
Never mind then.

40
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,470
If you can't give me a job,

41
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,870
I'll try somewhere else.

42
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,190
Don't tell Grandma about this.

43
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,070
Sorry for bothering you.

44
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,360
Stop there.

45
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,920
Even your grandma doesn't know about this?

46
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,590
What exactly happened?

47
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,750
It's your mother who needs the money,

48
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,470
right?

49
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,410
How about this?

50
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,070
You can come here on weekends

51
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,450
and see if there's anything you can help with.

52
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,550
But

53
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,810
when there's no work to do,

54
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,940
be good and do your homework properly.

55
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,430
Okay.

00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,329

Thank you, Uncle Zhou.

You're welcome.

00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:51,990

68
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,980
Your teacher called me today,

69
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,630
saying that during class,

70
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,630
you were using Morse code to send secret messages to a female classmate.

71
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,970
Is that true?

72
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:22,590
Why are you smiling?

73
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,920
Did you teach him that?

74
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,200
It's not like that.

75
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,190
I only taught him that

76
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,830
as a hobby.

77
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,690
How was I supposed to know he'd use it for this?

78
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:36,440
Which classmate?

79
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,520
Ma Siyi?

It's a bit too early.

81

Is this how you teach children?

82
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,960
No dinner for you.

83
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:53,840
You eat.

84
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,580
Don't let this happen again.

85
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,950
Haven't I told you

86
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,810
not to hang out with those who play around all day?

87
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,320
Ma Siyi is alright.

88
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,300
She got into No. 1 High School.

89
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,550
Her grades are pretty good.

90

But look at those other kids.

91
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,530
They'll affect your grades.

It's not that serious.

93

Are you sure this ship is unclaimed?

102
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,150
We don't want to get caught later.

Don't worry.

104
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,909
I'll go down and take a look.

No, no.

106
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,190
I'll go. I'll go.

Hold this for me.

Be careful.

109
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,110
Shine the flashlight for me.

110

Be careful.

111
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,870
Be careful.

112
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,570
Slowly.

113
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,400
It's okay.

117
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,640
Check if there's any over there.

118
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,040
Shine some light for him.

119
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:57,800
Be careful.

120
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,830
Be careful, Wanghe.

121
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,760
Are you alright?

122
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,330
Be careful.

123
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:08,950
How is it? Did you find any?

124

Is there any?

125
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,780
Yes, a lot.

Here, here.

127
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,000
Give him the bucket.

128
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,850
Keep an eye out for people.

129
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:17,950
I'm going down.

130
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,380
Give him this bucket too.

131
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,310
I'll take this.

Go that way!

There are more people down there!

144
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:35,500
Stop!

145
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,180
Freeze!

146
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,580
Run! Haikuo!

147
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,640
Don't run!

148
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,510
Go that way!

149
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,150
Run!

We were just passing by.

156
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,500
We were just passing by!

157
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,360
We didn't do anything!

158
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,460
You little brat.

159
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,910
Officer, I was just passing by.

160
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,670
Passing by? Passing by with an oil bucket?

161
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,520
You know what?

162
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,740
There have been a lot of oil thieves lately.

163
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,060
It's not just you guys.

164
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,990
Sir. Sir.

165
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,970
Please, I'm begging you.

166
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,430
I'm still in school.

167
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,540
I'll get expelled.

168
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,210
Now you remember you're a student?

169
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:17,920
Get in!

170
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,460
What do we do now?

171
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,200
How about

172
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:36,340
we call Chen Rui

173
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,050
and let him ask his mom to find a way to bail Wanghe out?

174
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,840
Right. His mother is the district chief. She must know the police.

175
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,290
What if his mom refuses?

176
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,930
We won't know if we don't try.

177
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,110
If Wanghe gets detained today,

178
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,840
his dad might beat him to death.

179
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,460
Hello?

180
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:01,940
You want to speak to Chen Rui?

181
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,780
He's at home.

182
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,600
Who is it?

183
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:06,590
Hello?

184
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,320
I don't know.

185
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,530
You didn't even ask who it was.

186
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,980
Don't be too strict with the kid.

187
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,410
It's just a phone call.

188
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,410
Who allowed you to sit here?

189
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:21,930
What happened?

190
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,400
My friend got arrested by the police.

191
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,480
Who?

192
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,600
Which friend?

193
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,500
What for?

194
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,400
It must be a misunderstanding.

195
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,799
Why did he call you?

196
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,539
They want me to help?

197
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,530
Do you think I'm going to the police station to bail someone out for you?

198
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,530
You've done this kind of thing many times before, haven't you?

199
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,340
No.

200
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,170
This is the first time.

201
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,700
Sir.

202
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,100
Please let me go.

203
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,020
I won't dare to do it again.

204
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,360
Now you're begging for mercy?

205
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,790
It's a bit too late for that, don't you think?

206
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,360
You're not a child anymore.

207
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,600
You think you can just get away with it?

208
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,310
Sir.

209
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,800
Why don't you just beat me up

210
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,920
and consider it my punishment?

211
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,300
If I

212
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,900
personally send you to prison,

213
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,310
when your father finds out,

214
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,040
I suppose his expression would be quite amusing.

215
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,970
You know my father?

216
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,020
More than just knowing him.

217
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,720
Your father and I have a bit of a past.

218
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,880
Your father used to bully me a lot when we were kids.

219
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,070
He'd corner me every day

220
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,060
and take my stuff.

221
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,970
I got beaten up by him quite a lot.

222
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,510
Do you think there's a chance?

223
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,910
I don't know.

224
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,040
But Chen Rui is quite loyal to friends.

225
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,440
I think he'll do his best.

226
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,830
Let's take it one step at a time.

227
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,680
The college entrance exam is just around the corner.

228
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,160
If something goes wrong,

229
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,120
his life will be ruined!

230
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,280
This won't do.

231
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,390
I'll go find him.

232
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,550
What do you want to do?

233
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:19,950
Let go of me!

234
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:20,390
You can't go!

235
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,110
You'll only make things worse!

236
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,500
Let go of me!

237
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,670
-Don't be anxious.
-It's useless to be anxious.

238
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,330
Fenghua...

239
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,170
It's okay, Fenghua.

240
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,300
There's no point in being anxious now.

241
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,200
Tell me.

242
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,060
If I had insisted on not letting you go out today,

243
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,190
would he have avoided this trouble?

244
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,510
No.

245
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,300
It was everyone's decision.

246
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,390
It wasn't your fault.

247
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,050
You couldn't have stopped us.

248
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,780
If Wanghe really gets detained,

249
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,670
I'll drop out of school!

250
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,340
They say

251
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,340
life in prison is extremely hard.

252
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,860
Without money, it's impossible to get by.

253
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,140
If his parents give up on him,

254
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,480
I'll take care of him.

255
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,650
I believe Chen Rui

256
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,190
will take it seriously.

257
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,830
He should be working on it already.

258
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,950
We might as well go home and wait for news.

259
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,100
Let's go home first.

260
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,960
Wanghe is a lucky boy.

261
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,500
He always manages to turn bad luck into good.

262
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,910
Where are you going?

263
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:57,870
Get back here!

264
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,710
I'll be right back, Mom.

265
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,240
Chen Rui, stop right there!

266
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,350

267

I promise.

00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:02,770
What do you want to do?

269
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,120
I just want to go check on him.

270
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,720
Are you going to bail him out?

271
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,150
I'm not capable of that, Mom.

272
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,510
He's my best friend.

273
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,350
Even if I can't help,

274
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,390
I have to be there.

275
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,320
I won't allow it.

276
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,150
Please, Mom.

277
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,730
I'll really be quick.

278
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,390
Come home with me.

279
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,230
I'll be back...

280
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,470
I'll be back right away.

281
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:15,990
Mom.

282
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,150
Stop pulling and tugging.

00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,840
Keep it down.

289
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,890
Are you hungry?

290
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,950
You'd better eat something first.

Once you get there,

a Fried Stinky Tofu,

He does.

00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,320
He's been beating me since I was little.

316

He's broken several belts beating me.

so he gave up.

319

And you started to give up on yourself.

Let me tell you.

328

It's not too late

breaking even is considered a victory.

My dad used to be so impressive.

339
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,970

Now he's the one offering cigarettes to others wherever he goes.

he grovels to them.

00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,500
When I was a kid,

348
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,850
your father

349
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,610
used to set up a stall at the old pier,

350
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,010
selling fish and shrimp.

351
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,710
Every day, he'd get up before dawn

352
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,200
and take the best spot.

353
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,130
Only after he finished selling

354
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,860
would he let others sell there.

355
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:07,880
By the time I set up my stall,

356
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,560
the fish and shrimp would already be dead.

357
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,800
At that time,

358
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,440
the person I disliked the most was your father.

359
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,490
I remember when I was in my senior year of high school,

360
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,110
my mother fell ill.

361
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,940
No one in my family could take care of her,

362
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,470
so I had to drop out of school to look after her.

363
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,660
Later, I don't know who

364
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,260
told your father about this,

365
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,870
but one night, your father

366
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,740
suddenly came to my house.

367
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,430
I didn't dare to open the door.

368
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,620
Unexpectedly, he kicked the door open with a bang.

369
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,330
What do you want, Xie Tiancheng?

370
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,400
At first, I thought

371
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,990
it contained bricks.

372
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:10,819
I only realized after I opened it that

373
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,099
it was filled with cash.

374
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,710
A full 600 yuan.

375
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,470
It was 1987.

376
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:22,410
That was a huge sum of money back then.

377
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,050
I was completely stunned at the time.

378
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,099
I had no idea what he was up to.

379
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,110
Guess what your father said to me at that time.

380
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,080
He pointed at me and said, 'Kid,

381
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,360
don't you drop out of school.

382
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,030
Take this money and hire a caregiver.

383
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:38,750
If it's not enough,

384
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,630
let me know.'

385
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,180
I was completely dumbfounded at that moment.

386
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,470
Get into a good university

387
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,030
and find a decent job.

388
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,770
Things like street vending

389
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,850
are not for you.

390
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:57,720
Thank you.

391
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,990
During that time my mom was ill,

392
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,880
it cost us about 2,000 yuan in total.

393
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,150
During her entire hospital stay,

394
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,080
your dad

395
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,590
and his friends

396
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,640
took turns taking care of my mom.

397
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,330
Every time your dad came,

398
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,860
he'd bring the soup he made

399
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,760
for my mom with the fish he caught.

400
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,010
When my mom was discharged,

401
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,430
she secretly told me that

402
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,340
she'd never want to eat fish again in her life,

403
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,670
that she had had enough.

404
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,730
Kid.

405
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,690
Your dad was a jerk back then.

406
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,580
Of course, he still is now.

407
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,580
But in his life,

408
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,540
he's never owed anyone favors.

409
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,700
It's always others who owe him.

410
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,840
You're in your rebellious phase now.

411
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,550
You may be annoyed by him, and you may look down on him.

412
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,650
That's all normal.

413
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,060
But I hope you can understand that

414
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,260
no matter when,

415
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,510
and no matter what you become,

416
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,860
your dad is, and will always be,

417
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,790
a man of great integrity.

418
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,370
In the past,

419
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,710
your dad never brought shame to you.

420
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,530
In the future,

421
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,830
I hope you won't bring shame to your dad either.

422
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,270
If you dare to be such a jerk again,

423
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,120
I'll break your legs myself.

424
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,450
Boss, bill please.

425
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:17,930
Thank you.

426
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,000
It's truly a case of "raising a father for a lifetime and using him for a moment."

427
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,960
Wanghe.

428
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,650
You must kowtow to your father when you get back.

429
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,910
Tell me about it.

430
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,920
Uncle Xie is no ordinary man.

431
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,810
In the early years of seafaring, there were scammers

432
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,190
who put fishing nets deep in the river.

433
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,940
When a ship passed by, they'd rush out demanding compensation.

434
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,970
But our ships

435
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,340
have never been stopped, not even once.

436
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,300
Everyone knows Boss Xie isn't someone to mess with.

437
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,740
That's really true.

438
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:48,710
Wanghe.

439
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,470
Back in the day, your father was like Ghost Foot Seven.

440
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,830
Your dad is Ghost Foot Seven.

441
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,290
Uncle Xie is Wong Fei-hung.

442
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,210
Wong Fei-hung?

443
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,100
The Shadowless Kick.

444
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,200
You... I dare you say that to me again!

445
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,390
We can't count on the ships anymore.

446
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,590
We need to think of some other way to make money.

447
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,820
Maybe we don't have to give her money.

448
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,910
What do you mean?

449
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,470
When we were little, you bought her a schoolbag.

450
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,900
She didn't say anything at the moment.

451
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,590
She saved her pocket money for a year

452
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,710
and collected and sold Coke cans.

453
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,510
You remember, right?

454
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,800
In the end, she paid you back with a Casio digital watch.

455
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,390
This shows she doesn't like owing favors.

456
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,850
But we can't just ignore her situation, can we?

457
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,270
As the saying goes, give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.

458
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,780
Rather than giving her money,

459
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,820
maybe it's better to help her find a way to make money.

460
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,520
She's in her final year of senior high school.

461
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,750
This year is especially important.

462
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,150
She can't be distracted.

463
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,510
She's in the key class at No. 1 High School,

464
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,560
and she made it to the top three.

465
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,990
With a bit more effort, she could get into a top university.

466
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:41,870
If worst comes to worst, I'll sell

467
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:44,110
my equipment in the game Fantasy Westward Journey.

468
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,580
My five-digit QQ number

469
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,140
should be worth something.

470
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,100
My dad's Jialing motorcycle that he never rides

471
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,180
can also be sold.

472
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,410
No need, I have a plan.

473
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,350
What kind of plan?

474
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,540
Do you need my help?

475
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,110
No.

476
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,670
The only thing I need you to do is to keep your mouth shut.

477
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,380
That's right.

478
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,000
We must keep this under wraps and not let anything slip,

479
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,130
especially to Siyi.

480
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,670
What could I possibly say?

481
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:04,430
"Siyi.

482
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,110
Wanghe tried to steal oil for you

483
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,770
and almost got caught by the police."

484
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,100
Do you think I'm stupid?

485
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,690
You went to steal oil?

486
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,450
No, I didn't.

487
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,250
Of course not.

488
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,720
We were just taking a walk and happened to pass by.

489
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,060
Right?

490
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,720
Yes, these... These are all things we picked up.

491
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:20,710
Siyi!

492
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,510
Siyi. Siyi.

493
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:21,870
Stop hitting him.

494
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:22,550
Siyi!

495
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,580
Wanghe was just trying to help you.

496
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,790
He was worried you'd sell blood.

497
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,310
Yes, right.

498
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,650
Then the police came.

499
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,590
And then the police left.

500
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,110
It was a false alarm.

501
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,070
Right, right, it was a false alarm.

502
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:29,700
Yes.

503
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:30,570
Siyi.

504
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,380
I'm fine. You don't need to worry about me.

505
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,010
From now on, don't interfere with my business.

506
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,340
Xie Wanghe, you'd better watch yourself.

507
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,010
Siyi!

508
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,490
Why are you looking at me?

509
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,090
Siyi.

510
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,580
What's wrong?

511
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,600
Let me see.

512
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,320
You're crying?

513
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,740
Alright. Alright.

514
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,310
Who did you have a fight with?

515
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,150
You had a fight with Wanghe, didn't you?

516
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,300
No.

517
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,390
No?

518
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:24,530
If not, then why did you say

519
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,990
'Watch yourself' to him?

520
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,470
I'm not deaf.

521
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,030
I heard everything.

522
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,340
I'll go talk to Wanghe's mother then.

523
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,660
How dare he mistreat my granddaughter?

524
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,410
I'll give him a beating.

525
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,440
Grandma, Grandma, it's not like that.

526
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,630
He really didn't mistreat me.

527
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,380
His heart is in the right place. It's just he's an idiot.

528
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,040
He's always doing inexplicably stupid things.

529
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,310
So no one mistreated you?

530
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,200
Wanghe has been like that since he was little.

531
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,480
A bit of a fool.

532
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:00,020
He becomes a scatterbrain every time he sees you.

533
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,250
You might not see it,

534
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,500
but I can.

535
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:06,170
Don't you remember? When you were little, to cheer you up,

536
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,580
he almost crippled himself.

537
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:12,380
You might not see it, but I can.

538
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,230
Siyi.

539
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,210
Why are you so late, Wanghe?

540
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,780
We're almost done eating.

541
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,240
It's okay. I'm not hungry.

542
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,080
Let me ask you a question.

543
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,000
Do you all know Sun Wukong?

544
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,280
Sure we do.

545
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,080
Then do you know how Sun Wukong flies?

546
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,520
On his somersault cloud.

547
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,360
Correct.

548
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,560
Well, what I have in my hand

549
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,180
is a seven-colored auspicious cloud.

550
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,430
I can fly too.

551
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,760
Xie Wanghe, you're just bragging.

552
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,410
You don't believe me, right?

553
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,010
No, we don't.

554
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:45,810
No.

555
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,990
Follow me!

556
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,690
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

557
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:56,860
[Dangerous behavior. Do not imitate.]

558
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,090
I'm coming!

559
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,670
Does it hurt?

560
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:16,950
Are you okay?

561
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,480
-Are you alright?
-Are you okay?

562
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,830
-Are you alright?
-Are you okay?

563
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,110
Are you okay, Wanghe?

564
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,080
I was just messing with you guys.

565
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,910
It hurt like hell when I fell earlier,

566
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,060
but it doesn't hurt anymore.

567
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,740
The anesthesia hasn't worn off yet, right?

568
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,600
It'll be very painful once it wears off.

569
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,410
It's fine. I'm not afraid of pain.

570
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,720
You're not afraid of pain?

571
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,080
Then why did you cry?

572
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,840
Who cried?

573
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,900
You didn't cry.

574
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,920
It's just your eyes were sweating.

575
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,650
Can you stop doing this in the future?

576
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,660
What did I do?

577
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,850
Being naughty and making adults angry.

578
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,480
You were lucky this time.

579
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,380
You only broke your leg.

580
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,370
If you had fallen headfirst, you would have died.

581
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,370
Don't worry.

582
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,910
I'm a lucky person with a charmed life.

583
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:04,670
Shut up!

584
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,070
This time you broke your leg,

585
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,880
your mom's eyes are swollen from crying at home.

586
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,590
Grow up a bit, okay?

587
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:12,750
Have you all forgotten?

588
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,830
Didn't the teacher say

589
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,720
science comes from practice?

590
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,130
Aren't human inventions done

591
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:19,010
thanks to brave people like me?

592
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,290
They are brave,

593
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,620
while you're just trying to get yourself killed.

594
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,680
If you don't understand, don't talk nonsense, okay?

595
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,840
You understand?

596
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:25,710
Of course I understand.

597
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,150
Do you know the principle of the lightning conductor?

598
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,310
We learned about it in science class.

599
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,150
Then explain it.

600
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,230
What principle is that?

601
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,480
As if you know.

602
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,850
Of course I know.

603
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,820
Can someone get me a piece of wire?

604
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,050
I'll go.

605
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,470
You all know about conductors and insulators, right?

606
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,190
The plaster on my leg is an insulator.

607
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:43,310
If I electrify the wire, since the plaster insulates,

608
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,120
there's no way I can get electrocuted.

609
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,530
Let me demonstrate for you.

610
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,660
Everyone step back.

611
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,950
Witness with me

612
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,780
the great power of science.

613
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:14,920
[Dangerous behavior. Do not imitate.]

614
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,710
Watch carefully.

615
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,190
-Doctor!
-Doctor!

616
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,300
Help!

617
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,510
-Help!
-Help!

618
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:00,550
Mom.

619
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,870
You are still up?

620
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,680
I'm used to it.

621
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,120
Son.

622
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,050
How about

623
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,800
I rent a small house for you?

624
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:17,230
Staying up like this too often can lead to mental exhaustion.

625
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,330
Rent a house?

626
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,520
The two of us move out

627
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,830
and leave Dad alone at home to sleep?

628
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,450
It'd be better to have him move out.

629
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,360
From now on,

630
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,780
let him sleep on the ship.

631
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,250
Ask him not to come home unless necessary.

632
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,430
Did we make any profit this month?

633
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,240
It's good enough if we didn't lose money.

634
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,980
The gas price has increased again.

635
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,240
Labor costs are high too.

636
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,410
There's no shortage of work at construction sites in the city.

637
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,840
I've been thinking,

638
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,640
if worst comes to worst,

639
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,040
we can't keep this ship anymore.

640
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,030
We'll sell it, withdraw our shares,

641
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,660
and switch to a heavy truck for land transport.

642
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,280
Help me look it up online later.

643
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,620
No, Mom, don't.

644
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,550
Why are you unhappy about it?

645
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,710
Weren't you the one who kept telling me

646
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:11,080
to cut our losses if river transport wasn't profitable?

647
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,570
What happened?

648
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,180
You've changed your mind?

649
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,110
It's not that I've changed my mind.

650
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,480
I'm just worried Dad won't be happy.

651
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:20,820
Normally,

652
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,800
I feel like Dad is always listless.

653
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,840
But once he gets on the ship,

654
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,400
he becomes full of energy,

655
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,060
like he's a different person.

656
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,550
Your dad once told me

657
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,120
that in his previous life, he was a loach.

658
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,540
He can't stay too far from water,

659
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,540
or

660
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,500
he'll suffocate.

661
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,070
Mom.

662
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,060
I'm sorry.

663
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,630
I'm so useless.

664
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,450
What's wrong? Why are you saying such things?

665
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:06,370
Back in the day, a lot of people

666
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,320
were already successful at my age.

667
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,910
They could take care of their families.

668
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,770
But I'm still in school,

669
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,720
and I can't help with anything.

670
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,290
Silly boy.

671
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,110
The fact that you care

672
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,990
is enough to make me content.

673
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:28,830
Mom.

674
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,220
Please rest assured.

675
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,530
I'll definitely be successful in the future.

676
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:36,410
I'll make you and Dad proud of me.

677
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,320
In the future, when you go out,

678
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,790
you can have your nose in the air.

679
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:43,790
Alright.

680
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,770
Having our nose in the air.

681
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,860
I'm Xie Wanghe's mother.

682
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,580
Let me help you calculate.

683
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,100
When is Grandma coming?

684
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,440
Don't bring this up to me.

685
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,820
Just thinking about them coming

686
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,280
makes me shudder all over.

687
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:27,220
Last time when your grandma left,

688
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,650
she complained to you about being poor again, didn't she?

689
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:30,610
No, she didn't.

690
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,310
I heard it all.

691
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,290
Saying things like

692
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,720
the roof of her house was leaking again,

693
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,490
the villagers didn't care,

694
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:41,620
and they were demolishing her pigsty forcibly and such.

695
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,480
Why are they so mean?

696
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,560
Nonsense.

697
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,110
Your grandma built the pigsty right in the wind's path.

698
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:49,270
When the wind blows, it stinks up the whole village.

699
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,130
How can the villagers not hate it?

700
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,520
But she left you the family heirloom.

701
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,250
A jade bracelet.

702
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,360
At our wedding,

703
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,600
she wrapped it in layers and layers,

704
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,190
and solemnly handed it to me,

705
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,480
saying it was

706
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:04,990
a mutton-fat jade

707
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,770
from the Han Dynasty.

708
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,590
I was so happy.

709
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,960
Later, when I had it appraised,

710
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,060
it turned out to be majestic white jade.

711
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,590
It's even cheaper than this bag we are making.

712
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,260
Mom.

713
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,470
How much can we earn from this batch?

714
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,370
Why do you care?

715
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,280
How much can I get?

716
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,440
How much do you want?

717
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:43,210
200.

718
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,370
How about 250?

719
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,560
Sure.

720
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,440
Go look in the mirror.

721
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,550
You'll see an idiot staring back at you.

722
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,770
Mom, I'm not asking for much.

723
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,550
200.

724
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,860
Just 200.

725
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,550
Please.

726
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:01,290
What does a student like you need so much money for?

727
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,360
I want to buy jeans.

728
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,460
Didn't I just buy you a pair last year?

729
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,990
The style is outdated.

730
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,470
It looks a bit unfashionable.

731
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:10,930
You can't blame the clothes if the person wearing them is unfashionable.

732
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,330
Look at Siyi.

733
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,870
Even if she wears a big cotton padded jacket,

734
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:17,130
she can still manage to look like she's from Milan or Paris.

735
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,800
So who do you think is prettier, me or her?

736
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,130
How can you ask such a question?

737
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,560
Who gave you the courage?

738
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,630
Was it Fish Leong?

739
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:30,500
Mom!

740
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,640
Alright. Alright.

741
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,830
You're prettier.

742
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,760
Of course my daughter is prettier.

743
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,940
You're youthful,

744
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,170
radiant,

745
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,380
and smart.

746
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,630
Of course my daughter is the prettiest.

747
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,410
Anyway,

748
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,260
I have a better figure than Siyi.

749
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,500
My legs are longer than hers,

750
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,560
and my waist is slimmer too.

751
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,430
If your grades were better than hers,

752
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,040
let alone jeans,

753
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,660
I'd even buy you a cell phone.

754
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,690
Being good at studies is useless.

755
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,800
Why is that?

756
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,430
Wanghe's grades are at the bottom of our grade,

757
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,920
but in a few years,

758
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,150
he'll definitely be

759
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,080
the most, most promising one among all the students.

760
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,300
One 'most' is not enough?

761
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,560
You had to use it twice?

762
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:14,719
He has so many brilliant ideas in his head.

763
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,179
Any one of his ideas could make a lot of money.

764
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,230
You know what?

765
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,130
Today, Mr. Xu gave him a hard time,

766
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,989
but Wanghe left him speechless.

767
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:24,420
It was so satisfying.

768
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,239
Quite promising.

769
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,360
What about you?

770
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,650
You can't get into college,

771
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,179
your family is so poor,

772
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,550
you're not gentle,

773
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,870
and you don't want to work.

774
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,070
So, in the future,

775
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,980
who will want to marry you?

776
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:41,409
Who says I can't work?

777
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:43,469
Granny Ma said

778
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,000
my fried radish cakes are much better than Siyi's.

779
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,530
Well, that's true.

780
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:48,659
In the future,

781
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:50,949
Siyi will get into a top university,

782
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,900
and Wanghe will make a lot of money.

783
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,590
By then, he'll drive a Mercedes

784
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,060
to pick up Siyi

785
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,790
and come to your little stall

786
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,680
to eat your fried radish cakes.

787
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:04,120
Don't forget to give them a discount.

788
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:11,850
♫Oh, my dear dad♫

789
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:20,250
♫I love that handsome boy♫

790
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:28,430
♫I'm willing to go to Rosa Gate♫

791
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:34,950
♫And buy a wedding ring♫

792
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,810
Keep the change.

793
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:43,280
♫Yes, I must go♫

794
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,760
♫If you don't agree♫

795
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,830
Why hasn't she come out yet?

796
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,510
Where's Siyi?

797
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,070
Her grandma said

798
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,540
she left by herself early in the morning.

799
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,590
Is something wrong?

800
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,140
Would she have left on her own if nothing was wrong?

801
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,020
Full of nonsense.

802
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,380
So she's really angry with us?

803
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,040
You're talking nonsense too.

804
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,470
If Wanghe dared to treat me like this,

805
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,270
I'd beat him up too.

806
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,330
I'd give him a flying kick right away.

807
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,750
We've waited here for you for ages.

808
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,150
Why can't you wait for me?

809
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,890
So she's really angry?

810
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,230
She really doesn't want us to interfere anymore?

811
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,760
That can't be, right?

812
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,740
It's time to eat after finishing this.

813
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,520
Lao'er.

814
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,390
Let's go.

815
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,390
Time to eat.

816
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:24,610
Come on.

817
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,400
Give it to me.

818
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,040
Alright.

819
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,140
Here you go.

820
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,800
Peanuts.

821
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:35,670
Beef.

822
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,240
What's wrong?

823
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,110
Got bitten again?

824
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,620
That woman.

825
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,670
She bites when she's happy,

826
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,770
and when she's not happy,

827
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:50,570
she bites too.

828
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,550
So this time, was it

829
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,410
because she was happy or unhappy?

830
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:55,850
A mix of both.

831
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,840
You can't keep living like this, right?

832
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:01,880
I've told her a million times.

833
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,940
She just can't break this habit.

834
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,220
This time it's not so bad.

835
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,880
Look, it's not even swollen.

836
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,040
Last time, it swelled up this big.

837
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,870
Took a whole week to go down.

838
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,870
Do you know why?

839
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,880
Why?

840
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,040
Let me tell you.

841
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:19,310
Human teeth and dog teeth are both poisonous.

842
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:20,920
Really?

843
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,950
Of course.

844
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,520
Should I get a shot then?

845
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,630
I've heard of rabies vaccine,

846
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,850
but I've never heard of the vaccine for crazy people.

847
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:29,950
But since you keep getting bitten,

848
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:33,010
I suppose you should have developed antibodies by now.

849
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,640
Next time she does this to you,

850
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,050
give her a good scare.

851
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,170
How should I scare her?

852
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:41,570
Threaten to divorce her.

853
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,490
That won't work.

854
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:44,510
What if she agrees?

855
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,250
How is that possible?

856
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,230
Women don't divorce

857
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,630
at the drop of a hat, okay?

858
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,690
You're giving them too much credit.

859
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:52,760
However,

860
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,950
no matter what,

861
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:56,390
you need to set rules at home.

862
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:59,120
So

863
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,450
you have rules in your house?

864
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:01,650
Of course.

865
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,220
Go ask Haihong if she dares

866
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,540
to raise her voice at me.

867
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,260
She'd be out of line if she did.

868
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,570
If you don't believe me, go ask her

869
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:09,630
who the boss at home

870
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:10,970
is.

871
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,870
You need to let him know

872
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,000
that at home,

873
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,520
women are the boss.

874
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:19,910
In front of men,

875
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,750
we need to establish rules.

876
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,960
Anything is allowed at home,

877
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,450
but absolutely no physical violence.

878
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,650
Yes, right here.

879
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,730
The two of us

880
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:33,110
just got carried away in our conversation.

881
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,460
And he had been drinking.

882
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,790
It wasn't intentional.

883
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:38,090
That's still not acceptable.

884
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,210
Next time,

885
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,580
if he lays a hand on you again,

886
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,010
you come stay at our place.

887
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,230
If he dares to come to our place to get you,

888
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,030
you'll see how I'll deal with him.

889
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:45,900
Actually,

890
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,550
I understand him to some extent.

891
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,530
Recently, he's been having a hard time at work.

892
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:51,830
He's under a lot of pressure.

893
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:52,670
Just because

894
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:53,510
he's frustrated outside,

895
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:55,430
he comes home to take it out on his wife?

896
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,320
That's sick.

897
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:00,740
Shao.

898
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,190
I really envy you.

899
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,430
What do you envy about me?

900
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,120
I envy you for your wife.

901
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,310
Your wife

902
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:16,890
cooks various kinds of delicious food for you every day.

903
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:17,830
As for my wife,

904
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,950
she'd probably burn down the kitchen just frying an egg.

905
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,680
What delicious food are you having today?

906
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,740
Share some with me.

907
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,380
She had a fever yesterday.

908
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,980
She didn't have time to cook.

909
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:39,260
Why don't you hurry home and take care of her then?

910
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,490
What a great opportunity.

911
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:41,590
Show her some love.

912
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,990
We've been married for so long. We don't care about this anymore.

913
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,350
The longer you've been married,

914
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,010
the more she cares about this.

915
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,310
And you need to have a sense of ritual.

916
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,950
Remind yourself and your partner

917
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:53,680
that your feelings for each other haven't faded.

918
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,040
Is that really necessary?

919
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,180
Women

920
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,370
are emotional creatures.

921
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:01,790
If you show just a little bit of care,

922
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,000
they'll be incredibly touched.

923
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,070
My wife is just like that.

924
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:06,270
She really falls for this kind of thing.

925
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,220
Granny Ma, are you going home?

926

[Clock Fixing]

927

I'm going to get something.

928
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:29,130
Yanlin.

929
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,690
Granny Ma.

930
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,090
You've closed up? Let me help you.

931
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,350
No, I'm just going home to get some stuff.

932
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,740
Yanlin.

933
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,170
Well...

934
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,230
When Zhimei left,

935
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:44,230
why didn't you see her off?

936
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,500
She didn't ask me to.

937
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,700
From now on,

938
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:53,280
come by my place every day after work.

[Huihuang Tailor Shop]

940
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:54,990
Before Zhimei left,

941
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,390
she went to see an experienced traditional Chinese medicine doctor

942
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,520
who prescribed some medicine for you.

943
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,590
It's for liver protection.

944
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,640
She asked me

945
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,240
to brew it for you every day

946
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,600
and make sure you drink it.

947
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,040
She said you don't listen to your father,

948
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,370
but you'll listen to me.

949
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,830
My liver is fine.

950
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:12,370
She's just concerned about you.

951
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,120
Being a married couple is like this.

952
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,000
It's not easy, you know.

953
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,820
You support each other

954
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,630
and help each other.

955
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,300
How great this is.

956
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,670
Call her more often from now on.

957
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,540
Otherwise, being so far apart,

958
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:30,400
your feelings might fade.

959
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,440
Right.

960
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:35,560
But it's not like she's never coming back, right?

961
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,200
Yes, I know.

962
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:38,690
You still need to call her.
