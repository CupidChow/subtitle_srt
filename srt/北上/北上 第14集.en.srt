00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:44,030
Don't watch so many soap operas.

4
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,990
You're already not smart.

5
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:47,590
The more you watch, the dumber you get.

6
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,850
What are you thinking about? Go to sleep!

7
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:51,550
Who are you talking about?

8
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,350
Say that again!

9
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,640
Who are you calling dumb?

10
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,450
-Apologize!
-Sorry. Sorry.

Fenghua.

12
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,910
I thought of

13
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,100
a position in my future company

14
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,190
that's perfect for you.

15
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:12,870
What is it?

16
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,800
Security guard.

17
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,550
It's the perfect job

18
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,430
for you.

19
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,290
Sure, I'll keep you safe!

20
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,230
Go get some rest.

21
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:19,829
Good night.

22
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:20,670

You're back?

25
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,950
Have you had dinner?

26
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,310
Yes.

27
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,120

Soon.

33
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,270
Once he's discharged,

34
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,630
you won't have to work so hard, right?

35
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,710
Alright.

36
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,810
If you're tired, go to bed.

37
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,690
I'll go put away the food.

38
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,900

39
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,630
Come here.

00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,870
What's wrong?

41
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,600
I want to ask you something.

42
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,140
How can you tell

43
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,550
if someone likes you?

44
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,670
I'm not asking for myself.

45
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,000
It's for a classmate.

46
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,560
Well, about that,

47
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,240
you don't need to think too hard about it.

48
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,589
If he likes you,

49
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,890
you'll naturally know.

50
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,630
It's like

51
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,240
cooking rice.

52
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,470
When the rice is ready, you can smell its aroma.

53
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,010
What if

54
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,720
he likes someone else at the same time?

55
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,930
That won't happen.

56
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,640
If he likes you,

57
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,700
he'll only have eyes for you.

58

Your grandpa and I

59
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,770
fell in love at first sight.

60
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,950
At that time,

61
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,430
he only had eyes for me.

62
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,510
He followed me everywhere I went.

63
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,200
He was so clingy.

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,290
In the future,

65
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,110
you should find someone like that,

00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,300
it's not about me.

71
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,290
Okay. Whatever you say.

how wide the gap between No. 1 High School and us is.

00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,970
You should have some pride.

You can't lose too badly.

84

There's an old Chinese saying

that goes, "Victory and defeat are both common in war."

89

Get a few more cases of it.

106

A few more.

107
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,590
How many cases of water?

108
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,710
Seven or eight.

109

Yes. It sells very well.

Don't buy so many.

Back when we were seafaring,

bottled water and bread

129
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,420
were necessities.

Do as I say.

Supermarkets on land

00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,380
Go ahead!

351
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,110
Go ahead!

352
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:18,870
Siyi.

353
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,400
Go ahead!

354
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,270
Siyi.

355
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,430
Why did you come here?

356
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,670
Siyi, how could you?

357
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,230
Siyi!

358
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,310
Siyi, he's your brother!

359
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,600
I have no mother or brother!

360
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,070
The only family I have in this life

361
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,200
is Grandma!

362
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,080
Open the door.

363
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,430
Open the door!

364
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,540
Open the door!

365
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:47,620
Siyi.

366
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,070
Listen to me.

367
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:49,870
Be a good girl.

368
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,790
Listen to me.

369
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,880
Open the door.

370
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,190
Open the door.

371
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,860
He's your brother.

372
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,790
Open the door, Siyi!

373
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,430
Open the door.

374
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,660
Open the door.

375
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,820
Come, Siwei.

376
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,150
Come.

377
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,590
Let me help you up.

378
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,190
Stop crying. Come on.

379
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,140
Be good. Come on.

380
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,780
Get up, get up.

381
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,880
Come on, get up.

382
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,960
Grandma.

383
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,560
Naughty kids need to be spanked.

384
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,270
After being taught a lesson,

385
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,020
he'll behave better in the future.

386
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,260
If I were you,

387
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,790
I'd have kicked him.

388
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,310
He's the one getting beaten. Why are you crying?

389
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,570
Are your hands hurting from hitting him?

390
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,180
My heart hurts.

391
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,640
I feel sorry for my younger self.

392
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,900
I was also only 10 years old then.

393
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,060
My mom kicked me out,

394
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,050
like a bag of trash.

395
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,390
Don't cry.

396
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,810
This hoodie is clean.

397
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,360
You'd end up getting snot all over me again.

398
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,750
I won't cry.

399
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,150
Actually,

400
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,360
you should thank your mom.

401
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:45,900
That she didn't want you

402
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,970
and sent you here,

403
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,240
or you wouldn't have met me,

404
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,310
Wanghe, Xingchi, and Haikuo.

405
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,670
We're all your family.

406
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,750
If you had stayed with her,

407
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,080
you might have become depressed already.

408
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:00,540
Yeah.

409
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,750
Without you guys,

410
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:06,089
I don't know what I would have become.

411
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,900
You'd be miserable,

412
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,300
wallowing in self-pity all day

413
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,750
and washing your face with tears.

414
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,790
You'd get tuberculosis

415
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,849
and cough your lungs out at everyone.

416
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,400
What about you?

417
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,359
What if your mom abandoned you?

418
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,680
She'd never do that.

419
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:29,430
I mean, if she did.

420
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,720
We're different.

421
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,460
If I were you,

422
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,580
I'd scream and yell and roll on the ground.

423
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,910
I'd follow her around every day,

424
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,190
holding up a banner and making tearful protests.

425
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,780
So no one dares to abandon me.

426
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,980
The price is too high.

427
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,050
You're such a soft touch.

428
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,470
When you get hurt,

429
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,600
you just cry secretly under the covers

430
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,470
and even try to blame yourself.

431
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,780
"Have I not behaved well enough

432
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,670
and disappointed Mom?"

433
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,650
This is not right. You can't think like that.

434
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:06,970
I know it's not right,

435
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,140
but I can't change myself.

436
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,360
Today,

437
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,240
when I heard my brother crying outside the door,

438
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,320
at that moment, I actually felt

439
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,360
great.

440
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,880
It was like…

441
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,780
I was gloating.

442
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,980
Back then, it was because of

443
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,000
my brother

444
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,560
that my mom abandoned me.

445
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,280
Now he's in the same situation as I was.

446
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,090
I thought to myself,

447
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,640
"Now it's your turn."

448
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,910
But when I saw him

449
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,570
sitting on the ground crying,

450
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,460
I felt so sorry for him.

451
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,350
Because we're the same,

452
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,110
both thrown out like trash.

453
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,560
In the future,

454
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,860
he and I will have to rely on each other.

455
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,340
If you're going to rely on anyone, it should be me,

456
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,540
not that little brat.

457
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,130
He doesn't deserve it.

458
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,830
Well, that…

459
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,380
What color did you use?

460
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,530
A red sun.

461
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,690
He really stays?

462
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,330
What's your name?

463
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:53,900

466
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,440
pay for the boy last time?

467
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,300
Ask her about it.

468
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,240
Tell her we have a boy here.

469
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,150
Ask if she'll buy him.

470
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,470
Shut up.

471

Don't let them influence you.

Come on.

476
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,030
You'll give him a ride.

477
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,850
Don't let him fall, okay?

478
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,390
Hurry up.

you two don't look alike at all?

Are you sure he's your brother?

Look at the way he acts.

505

He clearly takes after his father.

506

According to the surveillance footage,

690
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:48,040
he left school early in the morning.

691
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,430
He went to the long-distance bus station

692
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,030
and got on a bus with the license plate ending in 8732.

00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,370
Suqian?

695
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,700
He went home.

696
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,700
It's my mother's home.

697
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,070
Officer,

698
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,030
how long until we reach Suqian?

699
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:33,160
It'll probably take about another half hour.

700
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,750
Can we go faster?

701
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,000
There's a speed limit on the national highway.

702
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,350
Even a police car can't exceed the speed limit?

703
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,870
Can't you shut up?

I'll fight you to the end!

This is her family business.

Let her handle it herself.

You don't even have the keys?

The lock has been changed.

719
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:52,010
This house has probably been sold already.

720

This isn't your home anymore!

721

729
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:01,560
Are you full?

00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,650
Let's go home.

No.

732
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,820
I want to find my mom.

733
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,470
Actually, you've impressed me.

734
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:33,020
I was just like you back then,

735
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,570
dumped at Grandma's house.

736
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,030
I thought about running away

737
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,430
and going back to Mom too,

738
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,370
but I only dared to think about it.

739
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,800
I never took action.

740
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,270
You're braver than me.

741
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,880
I take after my dad.

742
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,580
My dad dares to do anything.

743
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,240
Is that why he ended up in jail?

744
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:57,940
Back then,

745
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:59,850
I hated my mom very much.

746
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,300
I always wondered

747
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,670
why she abandoned her daughter

748
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:04,730
after having a son.

749
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,620
But then

750
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,890
she abandoned you too.

751
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,510
I felt instantly better.

752
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,990
My mom didn't abandon me!

753
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,110
Why are you yelling?

754
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,370
Do you think yelling can make her show up?

But the best thing she ever did

761
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,750
was send me to live with Grandma.

762
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,460

763
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,470

765

I didn't feel warm there.

00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,480

If he were my brother,

I'd have beaten him so hard that he couldn't get out of bed.

He's also your brother now.

Where did he go?

just fall when they push you

945

997

999
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:36,010

it'd be good enough if she didn't hold him back.

We're all friends.
