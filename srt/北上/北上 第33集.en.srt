00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,289
Where's Fenghua?

4
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,120
Sleeping in the bedroom.

5
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:52,870
What's up with her?

6
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,680
She's been feeling dizzy lately, sometimes even unable to stand.

7
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,850
She might be worn out.

8
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:33,970
Why are you here?

9
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,030
Let me take you to the hospital

10
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,400
for a check-up.

11
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,810
I've already had one.

12
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,290
Nothing serious.

13
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,490
This constant dizziness is no small matter.

14
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,220
Granny Ma used to have the same symptom.

15
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,680
I'm still young. How can you compare me to her?

16
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,530
Do you think someone at my age could have a stroke?

17
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,740
Just mind your own business.

18
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,400
I'll handle my own affairs.

19
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,180
Just stay out of this.

20
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,100
So what did you do?

21
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,090
I've been busy all day,

22
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,170
getting He a death certificate

23
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,710
and contacting a funeral parlor.

24
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,390
Has Bee made any effort at all?

25
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,360
Did it occur to you that, given his family's situation,

26
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,980
it was even uneasy for them to arrange a funeral?

27
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,810
Have you thought about giving He some final dignity?

28
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,970
Handle your own affairs? How dare you say that?

29
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,120
Yes, you're right.

30
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,970
I didn't take them into account.

31
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,880
I only

32
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,700
thought about getting more compensation for them.

33
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,190
I wasn't thoughtful enough.

34
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,530
I was wrong.

35
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,840
I'm really sorry.

36
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,430
I'll listen to your advice.

37
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:16,829
And I'll adapt.

38
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,920
You should also listen to my suggestion.

39
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:22,940
What suggestion?

40
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,300
Go for a medical check-up.

41
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,660
Let's go to Xiehe Hospital

42
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,250
for the best doctor.

43
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,830
Not now.

44
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,630
Not before I wrap these things up.

45
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,250
How much compensation can there be?

46
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,270
We're still working on it.

47
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,820
We hope...

48
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,480
We hope to get the highest level.

A new day has begun.

00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,680
Be careful on the way, everyone!

51
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,600
Okay!

52
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,090
Follow the traffic rules!

53
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:04,920

57
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,070
Let's go!

58
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,890
Go!

59
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,530
Listen to me.

60
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,720
That guy doesn't look like a good person!

61
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,390
Mom,

62
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,800
if the people from Yuntu are not good,

63
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,560
are the people from Bee any better?

64
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,750
How can you believe those people will settle it?

65
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,270
Haven't you seen the attitude of their company?

66
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,480
If they had any conscience,

67
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,720
would Tianming have had an accident?

68
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,840
But I think

69
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,360
something's fishy about this matter.

70
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,190
I don't care if there's anything fishy!

71
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,750
You really can't go!

72
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,630
Listen to me, okay?

73
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,560
You promised Ms. Xia before.

74
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,750
You're breaking your promise if you go now.

75
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,360
What did I promise her?

76
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,510
She said Xie Wanghe would get us compensation.

77
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,330
So where's the money?

78
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,360
I can't see them right now,

79
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,800
let alone the money!

80
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,610
They're obviously going back on their words!

81
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,830
What's going on?

82
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,950
Please talk her out of it.

83
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,310
Let her stop messing around.

84
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,390
What does she want to do?

85
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,000
Someone came here

86
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,950
and said they'd pay for our lawsuit

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,390
to claim compensation from Bee.

88
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,390
They also talked about holding a press conference

89
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,430
to make this issue blow up completely!

90
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,460
Who said that?

91
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,340
I suspect it was someone from Yuntu.

92
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,630
Yuntu?

93
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,860
I have his business card.

94
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,600
What are you doing?

95
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,250
They're genuinely trying to help us.

96
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,190
They've put in money, effort, and labor.

97
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,700
Don't be ungrateful.

98
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,530
You believe that?

99
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,560
This is apparently a business battle.

100
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,690
They want to use this case

101
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,420
to completely ruin Bee's reputation.

102
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,950
I don't care about their intentions.

103
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,270
I only know they've paid real money.

104
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,690
How much?

105
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,440
How much money?

106
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
300,000.

107
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,860
I've received the transfer on my card.

108
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,800
No matter what,

109
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,140
they transferred the money before even signing an agreement.

110
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,190
What about you guys?

111
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,370
What have you done?

112
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,370
Can you shut up?

113
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Ms. Xia is doing this for our own good.

114
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,930
You should be grateful!

115
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,180
Anyone can say nice things.

116
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,240
If she really cares about us,

117
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,700
she should give us money.

118
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,900
I only believe in money now.

119
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,270
Return the money you received.

120
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,640
Just 300,000 yuan, right?

121
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,350
I'll pay it.

122
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,800
Where can you get that money?

123
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,030
Don't worry about that.

124
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,530
Just return the money right away.

125
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,710
I'll cover the losses.

126
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,210
Also, please give me one more day.

127
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,030
I'll make sure Wanghe

128

resolves the compensation issue as soon as possible.

129
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,540
Return it.

Are you available tomorrow morning?

134
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,940
I'd like to discuss something with you.

135
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,570
Can't we talk about it on the phone?

136
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,950
It's good news.

137
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:55,820
Let's talk when we meet.

138
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,450
See you tomorrow at 10 AM.

139
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,670
I'll send you the address.

140
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,380
Alright.

141
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,130
Send it to my phone.

142
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,870
Okay, bye-bye.

143

Now that your meeting is over, can we talk?

145
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,790
Go ahead.

146
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,760
How much compensation do you expect the company to pay?

147
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,880
The more, the better, of course.

148
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,300
You know He's family situation.

149
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,490
I know! And I feel sorry for them too!

150
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,980
But I don't want the company to pay a penny.

151
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,200
What?

152
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,550
We can pay as much as they want personally,

153
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,630
but the company can't. Do you understand?

154
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,030
Xie Wanghe,

155
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,810
the company is about to go public.

156
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,410
We're facing millions of delivery riders.

157
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,400
Any excessive compensation,

158
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,510
if set as a precedent,

159
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,780
will become a noose around our necks.

160
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,650
It's a domino effect.

161
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,560
Meng, how can you be so cold-blooded?

162
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,890
For a businessman,

163
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,570
"cold-blooded" isn't a negative term.

With the family's pillar gone,

166
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,800
it's hard for the widow and orphan to survive!

167
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,900
The company will definitely go public next year.

168

Have you calculated your own net worth?

169
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,780
If you really can't bear to see it,

170
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,240
just pay out of your own pocket.

171
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,190
Pay for peace of mind.

00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,810
which star shines the brightest?

512
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,130
How could I guess that?

Betelgeuse.

514

It's over 600 light years away from Earth

515
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,340
and is currently

516
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:12,100
the star most likely to go supernova.

517
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,930
I saw people saying online

518
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,210
that after we die,

519
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,110
our souls go over there.

520

Originally,

521
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,640
our souls came from there too.

522
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,030
This reminds me of the days we spent watching stars on the rooftop together

The news of a food delivery rider's accidental death

533
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:32,900
during his work in extreme weather

534
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,280
has drawn massive social attention.

535
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,030
The food delivery platform, Bee,

536
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,750
held a press conference yesterday regarding this issue.

537
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,350
They announced at the scene that Xie,

538
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,160
the person in charge of the Haidian Department,

539
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,960
bore undeniable responsibility for this accident.

Xie has now been dismissed.

Have you gotten through to Wanghe?

547

His phone's off.

Then what about F-Fenghua and H-Haikuo?

Fenghua went to look for him.

550

Where are you going?

553
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,160
I think Wanghe has been wrongly accused.

554
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,010
Why?

555
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,220
In the company.

556
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,750
every adjustment to the rules and regulations

557
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,690
must be reported to the higher-ups

558
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,340
and can only be implemented after their approval.

559
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,930
Despite Wanghe's radical way of doing things,

560
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,350
he definitely has his principles.

561
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,320
I guess the public opinions were out of their control this time,

562
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,390
so the company

563
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,930
made him a scapegoat.

564
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,830
That must be the case.

565
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:46,110
Yeah, Wanghe's been righteous and kind-hearted

566
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,590
since he was a kid.

567
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,200
He knows when to hold back

568
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,820
instead of acting recklessly.

569
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,680
-Exactly.
-He must have been wrongly accused!

With a record of this incident,

578
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,030
it'll be hard for Wanghe to find a job again.

579

Why bother finding a job?

can't he come back to start a business on the Flower Street?

C'mon,

680
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:28,020
just rest assured.

681
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:30,150
They'll be my staff from now on.

682
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,450
I'll take care of them.

683
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,830
That's a deal.

684
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:35,180
Okay!

685
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,120
I believe

686
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:40,920
you've all heard about our station's merging

687
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,640
with Mr. Sun's station.

688
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,710
It's great to have two strong parties join forces.

689
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,660
From now on, for all the steps like sorting, delivery, signing, to after-sales service,

690
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:53,020
you should follow the standards and requirements

691
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,410
stated in this manual.

692
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,210
So who do we listen to from now on?

693
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,670
After merging, you'll be one big family.

694
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,410
I've already talked to Mr. Sun.

695
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,250
You should all follow his lead from now on.

696
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,110
What does that mean?

697
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,110
After the merger, you...

698
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,690
You won't be in charge anymore?

699
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,100
I should step down.

700
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:21,460
Mr. Sun will be in charge from now on.

701
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,670
Then we're done for...

702
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,480
We are going to suffer!

703
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:32,020
Don't worry, everyone.

704
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:36,030
I've negotiated all the terms before the merger.

705
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,500
I've secured all your benefits

706
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,600
and needs,

707
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,780
like social insurance, housing fund,

708
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,370
paid annual leave,

709
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:47,270
and also year-end performance evaluations and awards.

710
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,590
As long as you work diligently,

711
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,860
your benefits won't be any less than those of big companies.

712
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,630
It's okay if you don't wanna stay.

713
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,340
I still have some connections with HQ.

714
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,050
if you need,

715
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,530
I can help you negotiate it

716
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,380
and get you into a nearby parcel delivery station.

717
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,850
I still say the same thing.

718
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,130
Take your time to make money.

719
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,910
I hope you all take care of yourselves.

720
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:20,980
Please, please,

721
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,310
be careful and stay safe.

722
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,220
I wish each and every one of you

723
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,220
a bright and wonderful future.

724
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:48,460
Wanghe?

725
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:49,410
Wanghe!

726
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,550
Wanghe.

727
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,150
Wake up, wake up.

728
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,320
Come on, Wanghe.

729
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,080
Get up! Fenghua has left!

730
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,230
Where did she go?

731
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:56,880
Home.

732
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,550
She's not coming back to Beijing after leaving.

733
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,340
What?

734
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,000
I wrote a time management software for her

735
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,880
and asked her to find someone to test it.

736
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,370
She told me to send it to Mr. Sun as she had quit

737
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,230
and wouldn't be managing that business anymore.

738
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,010
Hey, wait for me.

Put the things down!

769
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,580
Oh, Mr. Xie!

770
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:08,430
We've met before.

771
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,760
Mr. Sun.

772
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,440
Who let you move these?

773
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,310
You don't know that yet?

774
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,100
Ms. Xia has quit!

775
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,780
We used to work for the same company.

776
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,950
I've taken over this station.

777
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,960
No way!

778
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,240
Calm down, please.

779
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:25,800
Ms. Xia and I made this decision together.

780
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:26,930
Just a few days ago,

781
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,540
we went to inspect a factory.

782
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,500
I'm quite touched by this.

783
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,550
If she had stayed

784
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:35,900
to work here, things would have turned out even better!

785
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:03,700
So she really left, huh?
