5
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,530
Sorry, there was a bit of a traffic jam.

6
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,289
Where are the employees?

7
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,490
We didn't dare to be idle even though you hadn't arrived.

8
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,420
You told us yourself that

9
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,110
even without subsidies,

10
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,450
you could increase the market share

11
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,770
to 50%.

12
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,830
We'll definitely fully cooperate

13
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,350
with such a good plan.

14
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,710
Therefore, before you arrived,

15
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,610
I'd already notified the chiefs of each station

16
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,750
and the managers of each business line

17
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,669
to come down there

18
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:11,930
and get ready to be lectured by you anytime.

19
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,270
If you have any thoughts,

20
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,700
you can tell us in advance.

21
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,750
We can discuss it internally first.

22
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,579
There's no need for discussion.

23
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,990
Before coming here,

24
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,230
we've already used big data

25
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,350
to do a convergence.

26
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,700
Starting tomorrow, we'll adjust the delivery time.

27
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,160
Each order's delivery time will be shortened by eight minutes.

28
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,220
After the adjustment,

29
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,760
the commission will increase.

30
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,550
I've calculated it.

31
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,420
The average commission per order can reach six yuan.

32
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,750
That's wishful thinking.

33
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,230
The profit of the food delivery business

34
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,520
is already very low,

35
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,410
yet he wants to increase the commission for delivery riders.

36
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,520
So I want to ask,

37
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,470
what money will the company be making?

38
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,470
I've already discussed this with

39
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,000
the technical department.

40
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,190
The delivery time will be adjusted from 50 minutes

41
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,590
to 42 minutes.

42
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,650
That's two minutes shorter than Yuntu's.

43
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,970
If everything goes as planned,

44
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,560
the order volume will increase significantly.

45
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,790
Even if we increase the commission for delivery riders,

46
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,320
the profit won't decrease.

47
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,990
Don't blame me for not telling you then.

48
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,560
The original 50-minute delivery time

49
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,990
was already wearing the riders out.

50
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,250
Now you want to compress it to 42 minutes.

51
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,910
If you really dare to do this,

52
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,040
it will cost lives.

53
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,640

00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,550
How could we possibly manage that?

57
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,520

the commission was 5.9 yuan.

173

We rarely have the chance to meet up these days.

174
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,740
Well, um,

175
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:12,470
daughter,

176
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,350
listen.

177
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,730
Has Wanghe been promoted?

178
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,270
I heard from his father that

179
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,830
his monthly salary now

180
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,340
is over 10,000.

181
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:24,600
For a top university graduate, earning over 10,000 is considered low.

182
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,630
How much do you earn per month now?

183
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,700
Why do you care?

184
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,270
Anyway, I'll give you a big red envelope when I come back home for the New Year.

185
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,200
Don't worry.

If there's nothing else, I'll hang up now.

187

Don't hang up yet.

188
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,840
You know Mr. Shao from our neighborhood, right?

189
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,190
He has a classmate in Beijing

190
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:38,789
whose son

191
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,690
is a graduate from a prestigious university.

192
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,390
Your mother and I have seen his photo.

193
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,590
That young man looks handsome.

194
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,990
Really handsome, I mean.

195
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,680
What did I tell you?

196
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,350
Fenghua is

197
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,980
developing her own career in Beijing now.

198
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,630
How could she have time for dating?

199
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,130
But she can't stay single forever.

200
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:58,990
She's not young anymore.

201
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,990
So what?

202
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,400
People nowadays value

203
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,020
women's independence and autonomy.

204
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,610
Women should have their own careers.

205
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,590
I think Fenghua has been doing pretty good

206
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,260
in Beijing these past couple of years.

207
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,950
She's never mentioned wanting to come back home.

208
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,860
Let's not hold her back.

209
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,200
What do you mean by holding her back?

210
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,630
Why is this holding her back?

211
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,130
Not getting married at this age is what's holding her back.

212
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,010
With your limited perspective,

213
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,030
if I hadn't been held back by you, old man,

214

I would have gone to Beijing too.

215
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,960
I could have ventured out like Fenghua does.

216
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,760
Maybe I'd be a rich lady by now.

217
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,010
I'd have a lot of money.

There's more. The company will provide subsidies

340
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,660
for the riders to buy motorcycles.

341
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,590
The delivery speed will be faster.

342
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,790
All they need to do is get a driver's license.

343
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,120
Are you out of your mind?

344
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,950
Riding a motorcycle at that speed can be fatal.

345
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,470
It's just the initial idea.

346
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,610
Why are you so worked up?

347
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,960
You shouldn't even have such thoughts.

348
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,250
If you really do this,

349
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,930
don't say you know me anymore.

350
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:08,740
Alright. Alright.

351
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,710
Let's eat.

352
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,230
Eat more.

353
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,650
Is something on your mind?

354
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,400
No, why?

355
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,850
Then why do you look so worried?

356
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:31,810
You're not even paying attention to me,

357
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,340
just staring at your phone.

358
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,640
Is this about that mixed-race girl?

359
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,400
We've lost contact with her for years.

360
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,130
Everyone's worried about her.

361
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,030
Are you guys all secretly in love with her?

362
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,200
I'm certainly not.

363
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,720
What about Wanghe?

364
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,060
He...

365
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:56,650
He won't admit it.

366
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,950
So Fenghua likes Wanghe.

367
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,130
She won't admit it either.

368
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,830
You're all crazy.

369
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,580
Other people's youth is filled with passionate love,

370
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,660
but you guys

371
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:08,960
have all been bottling it up.

372
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,090
Aren't you afraid it'll make you sick?

373
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:12,740
You're right.

374
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,170
Are you still mad at me?

375
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:20,880
No, I'm not.

376
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,390
Then why aren't you talking?

377
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,610
I'm tired.

378
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,350
If you're tired, take a rest.

379
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:33,650
The competition among parcel delivery stations isn't as fierce now as before.

380
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,250
As if you've worked in parcel delivery before.

381
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,610
Every industry has its peak period.

382
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,430
The parcel delivery industry has passed its peak.

383
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,930
Staying stable is enough.

384
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,350
We're different.

385
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,040
We still need to grit our teeth and push forward.

386
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,520
In the end,

387
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,900
only a few companies will survive.

388
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,200
It's okay.

389
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,870
If your company fails,

390
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:57,820
I'll take you in.

391
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,660
Bah! God forbid.

392
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,860
I'm telling you, this time,

393
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,320
I'm putting everything on the line.

394
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,150
It's do or die.

395
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,030
In our senior year,

396
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,829
when you and Haikuo were doing ground promotion,

397
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,160
you said the same thing.

398
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,450
You lost everything,

399
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,180
but I didn't see you "die" then.

400
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,819
Although we lost money that time,

401
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,940
the boss saw my potential.

402
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,560
That's why I am where I am today.

403
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,290
So essentially, I didn't lose.

404
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,450
But Haikuo did lose.

405
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,740
He spent all that time and put in all that effort with you,

406
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,110
and got nothing out of it.

407
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,440
He almost missed his graduation defense.

408
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,000
Did he tell you that?

409
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,100
He's not the type to complain behind others' backs.

410
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,750
Even though he didn't say anything,

411
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,080
you should be aware of it.

412
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,020
When you make it big in the future,

413
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,320
these are all favors

414
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,150
you'll need to repay gradually.

415
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,020
Of course.

416
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,050
Besides Haikuo and

417
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,210
Xingchi,

418
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,480
I need to repay you as well.

419
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,230
You don't owe me anything.

420
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,320
There's no need to repay any favors.

421
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,120
I do owe you.

422
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,480
A lot.

423
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:02,640
For example?

424
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,090
Think about it carefully.

425
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,490
If you can't remember,

426
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,950
then let's pretend I don't owe you anything.

427
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,620
You're a big shot now.

428
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,560
It's good to have drive when starting a business,

429
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,230
but everything needs moderation.

430
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,430
You need to leave yourself a way out.

431
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,260
It's for your own good.

432

Got it.

Why are you even more nagging than my mom?

434

I'll call you auntie from now on.

435

Give it to me. I'm leaving.

436
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,920
Be careful.

Be safe.

I thought there was a burglar in the house.

When did you get here?

441
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,030
I just arrived.

442
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,430
I brought you some scallops.

443
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,470
I put them in the kitchen. Go cook them yourself.

444

What for?

450

Just those annoying things at the company.

Well, he's got to work.

460
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,620
At the beginning,

461
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,500
the salary won't be too high,

462
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,570
but there will be bonuses if you do well.

463
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,140
You'll definitely have to work harder,

464

but the income won't be lower than what you're making now.

What can a programmer like me do at a food delivery company?

Bro, there's a lot to do.

467
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,070
Food delivery also falls under the information and communication technology industry.

468

Don't worry.

469

why, and I'll make adjustments.

He also said

507
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:41,670
he deeply regretted not spending more time with you when you were in high school.

508
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,190
That's why you got so rebellious.

509
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,390
That's all nonsense.

510
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,220
I learned a new word recently,

511
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:47,910
called brainwashing.

512
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:48,870
You know?

513
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,160
He treats me and my mom the same way.

514
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,510
Don't you think it's despicable

515
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,470
to establish one's authority

516
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,270
by undermining others' confidence?

517
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,600
My mom is also like that.

518
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,310
I didn't listen to her back then

519
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,120
and went to Honghuai Normal University, right?

520
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,050
Now I've graduated, but I haven't found a proper job.

521
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,760
I didn't take the civil service exam either.

522
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,960
My mom feels it's really embarrassing.

523
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:12,070
She hasn't spoken to me in a long time.

524
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,540
So what do you do every day now?

525
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,700
I study the history and culture related to the canal.

526
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,500
Have you made any achievements?

527
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,630
Not much yet.

528
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:26,840
But recently, Grandpa Zhou and I have been studying that sunken ship,

529
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,100
and we've made some interesting discoveries.

530
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,710
Why are you studying that stuff?

531
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,850
Isn't that just a waste of time?

532
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,370
How is it a waste of time?

533
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,190
You know what?

534
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,030
The owner of that ship was an Italian.

535
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,490
He had a very interesting notebook.

536
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,580
Let me show you.

537
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,900
He had a group of followers.

538
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,000
The translator was called Xie Pingyao.

539
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,720
The porter was named Shao Changlai.

540
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,160
The captain's surname was Xia.

541
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,460
The sailor was called Zhou Yiyan.

542
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,260
The bodyguard's surname was Gu.

543
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,170
Don't you think that's quite a coincidence?

544
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,950
Xie, Shao, Xia, and Zhou.

545
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,540
After I get the original copy of the notebook tomorrow,

546
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,710
if I can find out

547
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,960
what that Italian's name was,

548
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,130
I can follow the clues all the way up.

549
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,980
Maybe their journey

550
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:11,790
will one day unravel the connections between our families,

551
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,430
and tie together these hundred-year-old threads.

552
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,350
Gosh.

553
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,260
It gives me goose bumps.

554
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,720
Right? And think about it.

555
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,870
Mr. Zhou has an Italian silver coin.

556
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,360
My grandfather has an Italian-made dagger.

557
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,900
Xie Wanghe's family has a wine flask.

558
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,910
It's also made of silver.

559
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,640
There's foreign writing on it.

560
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,460
T-There's a shoehorn in my house.

561
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,620
It also has foreign writing on it.

562
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,380
Fenghua's family has a

563
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,050
makeup mirror.

564
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,030
It also has foreign writing on it.

565
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,350
Y-You should check them all out.

566
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:39,980
No problem.

567
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,880
After I return, I'll go check them out.

568
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,540
If they all have Italian writing on them,

569
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,070
then we're on to something.

570
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,410
Now you don't think it's a waste of time, do you?

571
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,400
Oh my god.

572
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,350
If you can really connect all these families

573
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,630
together,

574
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,670
you'll be doing a great service.

575
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,670
I'll do my best.

576
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,840
Good luck. Good luck.

577
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,550
Be careful.

578
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,150
This was the only page that I didn't print clearly at the time.

579
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,530
Polo.

580
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,460
Polo.D.

581
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,300
A typical Italian name.

582
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,670
So what does the D stand for?

583
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,410
D...

584
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,900
That's hard to say.

585
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,640
But you can use the method of exhaustion

586
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,940
to trace all surnames that start with D.

587
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,780
Okay.

588
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:45,030
I remember he mentioned in his diary

589
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,320
a place named Verona.

590
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,900
Verona?

591
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,030
That makes it easier to search.

592
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,750
You can contact the local authorities in Verona

593
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,450
and ask them to help you with the research.

594
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,440
Yes, right.

595
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,340
Think about it.

596
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,210
In that era,

597
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,080
he was able to travel across the ocean

598
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,990
and afford so many attendants.

599
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,780
This indicates that he was

600
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,430
from a wealthy family there.

601
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,220
Italy's historical records of the nobility,

602
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:14,020
especially their family history, are relatively well-preserved.

603
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,070
I think it should be easy to trace.

604
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:16,690
Great.

605
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:17,900
I'll send an email

606
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,460
to the local cultural authorities when I get back.

607
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,090
Okay.

608
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:44,200
[Flower Street Boys]

609
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,060
Everyone.

610
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,380
I know you're all busy.

611
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,640
I'm heading back home.

612
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,740
Later, I'll start a WeChat public account

613
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,030
called "Chronicles of Flower Street".

614
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:52,410
The content will be about the canal and that sunken ship.

615
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,470
Please stay tuned.

616
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,910
-Mr. Zhou! Mr. Zhou!
-Mr. Zhou!

617
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:09,630
Here.

618
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,770
Mr. Zhou!

619
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,790
Chen Rui has some news.

620
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,780
Really?

621
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,680
That Professor Su from Beijing

622
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,330
found the original copy of the notebook.

623
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:32,370
And Chen Rui found the ship owner's signature

624
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:35,730
on the cover of that original.

625
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,220
Polo.D.

626
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,150
Little Polo.

627
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:43,790
Right.

628
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,490
It's Little Polo.

629
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,590
This is great!

630
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,770
Now we know his real identity.

631
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:52,790
That makes things easier.

632
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,670
Chen Rui

633
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,380
has written to the Italian Ministry of Culture,

634
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,330
hoping to learn more.

635
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,700
If everything goes well,

636
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,010
it won't be long

637
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,740
before we know Little Polo's

638
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,160
entire life story.

639
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,940
Great. That's great.

640
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,700
Ah, Little Polo.

641
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,630
Your story

642
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,880
is about to surface.

643
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,780
That's wonderful.

644
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:22,600
Wonderful.

645
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,790
Be careful.

646
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,910
There's no need to be nervous.

647
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:29,770
Let me tell you.

648
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,750
Mr. Zhou is a very kind and genuine person.

649
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,640
You are such a nice and decent person.

650
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,170
There won't be any problem.

651
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,800
He might

652
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,250
just be a bit quiet.

653
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,790
If there's a lull in the conversation later,

654
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:49,640
[By the Canal]

655
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,600
you need to find a topic to talk about.

656
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,990
So what is he interested in?

657
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,070
Food, I suppose.

658
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:50,150
He's a famous master of Huaiyang cuisine.

659
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,400
He's been cooking his whole life.

660
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,720
He's well-known far and wide.

661
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,500
He even made it on TV a couple of years ago.

662
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,430
Is that so?

663
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:56,980
You've arrived.

664
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,480
Come on, let me introduce.

665
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,040
This is Mr. Zhou, Zhou Yanlin.

666
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:01,790
Hello.

667
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:02,240
Hello.

00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,540
Ms. Bian, right?

669
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,620
Yes.

670
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,880
Well...

671
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,390
Well... Well...

672
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,430
Well,

673
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,110
go inside.

674
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,410
Okay.

Alright. Alright.

678
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:23,820
So...

679
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,830

Thank you.

Please, have some tea.

683
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:44,280
Ms. Bian, which high school are you teaching in?

684
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:46,010
No. 7 High School.

685
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,310
I teach Chinese.

686
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,590
Oh, you're a teacher of No. 7 High School?

687
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,810
My son graduated from No. 7 High School.

688
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,550
I've heard about that.

689
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:54,970
He's my junior.

690
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,060
Several years below me.

691
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,120
So you didn't teach him, did you?

692
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,510
When he graduated,

693
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,750
I was still in college.

694
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,150
I didn't get to teach him.

695
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,510
I heard you're a master of Huaiyang cuisine.

696
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:18,060
I'm no master, just a cook.

697
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:31,990
Well,

698
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:35,080
what do you usually like to eat?

699
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,050
Well,

700
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,470
I'm not picky about food.

701
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,640
Anything is fine.

702
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,910
I don't cook at home a lot.

703
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:46,660
When I'm hungry, I'll just go for some quick-frozen products. It's very convenient.

704
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:53,730
I've heard that chefs don't like to cook at home.

705
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:54,650
That's right.

706
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:58,190
We've already worked all day in the kitchen.

707

When we get home, we'd like to do nothing.

708

After work,

710
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,430
I just want to go home

711
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,990
and spend the whole evening scrolling on my phone.

712

713

So does your son have a girlfriend?

721
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,240
No, I mean,

722
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,520
homebodies are usually single.

723
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,870
They've gotten used to and enjoy

724
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,550
the solitude of being single.

725
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,470
He's not single, actually.

726
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,890
But

00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,130

No, they wouldn't.

731
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:48,920
They feel so free and happy being on their own.

732
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,780
Why would they want someone to control them?

733
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,660
Staying at home, eating snacks,

00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,930
That's right.

956
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,980

to reduce the overtime rate to 5%.

I want to ask you a question on behalf of everyone.

971
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,710
If what you said

972

973

Exactly. Right.

974
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,370
Then I'll cancel the penalties.

975

go ask Mr. Xie anytime.

00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:45,990
Get to work.

989
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,430
Okay.

990
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,470
Don't be afraid of causing trouble for Mr. Xie.

991
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:51,080
Mr. Xie doesn't mind the trouble.

992
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,120
Get to work.

Thank you, Mr. Xie.

994
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,570
What was that guy's intention?

Sit.

996

Why did he sound like he was picking a fight?

997

Does he have a grudge against you?

998

He's a local boss.

999

He was in charge of this area before.

1000

I suddenly parachuted in,

1001
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:27,910
so it's understandable that he wants to give me a hard time.

1002
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,030
Why bother talking to him then?

1003
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,270
Just fire him.

1004
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,840
He didn't make any mistake.

1005
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,240
How can I just fire him?

1006
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,500
Contradicting his leader face to face

1007
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,250
and embarrassing you in front of the employees.

1008
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,510
Isn't that considered a mistake?

1009
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:38,260
I'd have given him a good slap if it were me.

1010
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,360
Don't be reckless.

1011
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:41,760
I was kidding.

1012
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,280
I just heard him say

1013

We did, but time was too tight.

We didn't develop this navigation system.

Every time the interface needs to be modified,

1018
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:58,580
we have to wait for the developer's response.
