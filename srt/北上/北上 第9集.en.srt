really smart, don't you?

5
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,860
You think it's that easy to start a business?

6
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,820
You think so?

7
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,870
Well, if you're talking about studying,

8

and get your graduation certificate.

16

You can do whatever you want in the future.

17

With your grades,

you'll fall even further behind

23
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,570
if you delay another year.

24
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,710
Then I don't want the certificate.

25
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,110
I won't want to work for others in the future anyway.

26

00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,710
I'm sure I can succeed.

173
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,680
Once I've arranged my leave of absence,

174
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,620
I'll head straight to Beijing.

175
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,390
Wait.

176
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,150
Are you really taking a leave of absence?

177
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,630
Will your parents agree?

178
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:23,930
I can only try.

179
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,530
I have a complete business plan.

180
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,700
I think I can convince my mom.

181
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,490
Can you not take a break from school just yet?

182
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,110
If you need money, you can borrow from me.

183
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,830
Fine.

184
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,549
You really think you're a commercial star now, huh?

185
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,030
That company must be blind

186
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,150
to hire you as a model.

187
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:45,150
At least I have more money than you now.

188
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,350
Fine, fine.

189
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,770
You're something, okay?

190
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,190
I'm being serious.

191
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,310
There's only a year left, so just hang in there.

192
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,630
You can still start your business after you graduate.

193
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,130
I now earn several thousands a month.

194
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,140
What's yours is yours.

195
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,550
I can't be spending your money.

196
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,820
Why not?

197
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,480
I've spent your money before too.

198
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,300
When?

199
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,470
When we were kids.

200
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,110
When we go out to buy snacks and stuff,

201
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,350
weren't you always the one paying?

202
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,510
I don’t even know

203
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,320
how many pencil cases you’ve gotten me.

204
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,830
I haven't spent any money for you yet.

205
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:15,800
No need.

206
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,590
For the next two years,

207
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,990
just focus on your commercials.

208
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,300
Save up the money

209
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,400
because it's unlikely you will get into a university.

210
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,260
When I head north to start my own business,

211
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,050
you can use that money to invest in my company.

212
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,620
I'll lead you to riches.

213
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,650
In the future,

214
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,180
you'll be President Xia.

215
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,880
Okay.

216
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,530
That's your own words.

217
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,600
No backing out.

218
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,390
I said it.

219
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,310
I won't back out.

220
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,340
Chen Rui.

221
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,820
These are the notes I've taken recently.

222
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,390
Hurry up and copy them.

223
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,730
Ask me if there's anything you don't understand.

224
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,860
Please don't take offense

225
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,760
at the nonsense my mother

226
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,990
said to you last week.

227
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,390
She's just...

228
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,460
very straightforward when she speaks.

229
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,530
She actually doesn't mean any harm.

230
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,330
She's just...

231
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,750
I wouldn't be here if I really minded.

232
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,660
Here, everyone.

233
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,870
The noodles are ready.

234
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,110
Wanghe.

235
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,350
We can definitely build this website.

236
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,630
However...

237
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,920
Wouldn't we need substantial upfront investment?

238
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,350
It's not too bad.

239
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,770
We just need a computer

240
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,220
with decent specifications.

241
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,470
We can't keep going to internet cafés to get work done.

242
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,430
That's too passive.

243
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,590
[Industrial and Commercial Bank of China]

244
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,590
Let's buy it.

245
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,710
Where did you get the money from?

246
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,010
I sold my gaming account.

247
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,880
There's 10,000 yuan.

248
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,110
We’ll talk if it’s not enough.

249
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,040
Then let's do this.

250
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,350
Once we make money,

251
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,090
we'll first return 10,000 yuan to you.

252
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,500
Then we'll give it to Siyi.

253
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:19,590
You should give it to Siyi first.

254
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,710
I'm not in a hurry to use the money.

255
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,510
That won't do.

256
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,120
This counts as angel investment.

257
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,120
I'm sure we'll be working together for years to come.

258
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,190
So, we must to set the rules straight first.

259
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,230
Even brothers

260
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,240
settle accounts clearly.

261
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,160
Let's try to be as fair as possible.

262
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:33,990
Otherwise,

263
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,310
this brotherhood won't last.

264
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:36,680
I won't accept

265
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,830
this investment either.

266
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,470
[Industrial and Commercial Bank of China]

267
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,990
Alright, I agree.

268
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,640
Let's keep clear accounts even as brothers.

269
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,620
That's good.

270
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,750
We'll do as you say.

271
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,340
Alright.

272
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,790
Now that everything is ready,

273
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,400
we just need an office.

274
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,310
There's one available,

275
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,030
and it's free.

276
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:02,630
Where?

277
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,280
Hurry up, you two! Come on!

278
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,080
Coming, coming!

279
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,520
Don't rush, don't rush.

280
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:21,740
Not bad,

Xingchi.

282
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,030
This is a great idea.

283
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,500
Alright.

284
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,690
I announce that

285
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,030
the online smart question bank startup

286
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,910
is officially launched.

287
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,110
Let me tell you.

288
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,330
Back then, Steve Jobs

289
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,610
and Bill Gates

290
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,580
started their businesses in garages.

291
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,990
Today, we're starting in a ship's cabin.

292
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,320
So we're bound to succeed.

293
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,220
Right.

294
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,190
We'll definitely make it.

295
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,230
We're going to make big money!

296
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,530
Fortune 500 is just around the corner.

297
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:11,710
So,

298
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,010
once we create this smart question bank,

299
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,720
who are we selling it to?

300
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,340
Sell it to No. 7 High School.

301
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,690
No, sell it to No. 1 High School.

302
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,040
Let's annoy our principal.

303
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,630
That's for stealing our plan.

304
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,270
Don't be like that.

305
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,670
You are still too narrow-minded.

306
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,230
Come on, let's talk business.

307
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,260
I've already

308
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,610
bought a train ticket.

309
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,010
I'm going to Beijing.

310
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,700
You're really going?

311
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,670
Firstly,

312
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,930
we need to rent a server.

313
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,510
Secondly,

314
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,990
I need to visit Zhongguancun

315
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,310
to see what it's like over there.

316
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,450
After all, Beijing is the center of the country’s internet industry.

317
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,070
If I happen to run into some internet bigwig,

318
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,590
I'm confident I can persuade them

319
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,870
to support our startup.

320
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,380
The idea is great,

321
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,310
but isn't it a bit hasty

322
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,350
to go to Beijing now?

323
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,060
That's right.

324
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,840
So when do you think we should go?

325
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:58,790
After the college entrance exam?

326
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,670
We definitely need to take the college entrance exam.

327
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,710
Otherwise, your high school years would have been wasted.

328
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,750
Forget it.

329
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,910
You two might still do well if you push yourselves.

330
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,780
Does it even matter if I take the exam?

331
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,430
I will just make a fool of myself.

332
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,120
When we are in Beijing,

333
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,470
we must go to the best

334
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,620
office buildings

335
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,710
and rent a big office.

336
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,720
You two will each have your own room.

337
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,270
That's your own words.

338
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,310
Thank you Mr. Xie in advance.

339
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:32,540
Dad.

340
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,390
Uncle.

341
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,940
Why are you back so late?

342
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,200
You're already a senior.

343
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,760
Can't you take it more seriously?

344
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,350
Just because others aren't planning to take the exam,

345
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,150
does that mean you're not planning to either?

346
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,620
Or have you already decided to give up?

347
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,560
Wanghe, please stay.

348
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,150
In the future,

349
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,140
could you stop dragging him along with you?

350
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:06,910
Dad!

351
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,010
Can you not be so selfish when you speak?

352
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,910
I want you to study hard.

353
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,080
I want you to get into a top university.

354
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,590
I'm doing this for your own good.

355
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,190
I don't need it!

356
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:15,630
You...

357
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,340
Uncle! Uncle!

358
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,190
Uncle, Uncle!

359
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:19,850
Don't worry,

360
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,200
I won't interfere with Xingchi's studies in the future.

361
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,810
And Haikuo,

362
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,810
you too.

363
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,050
Both of you study hard

364
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,720
and do well in your exams.

365
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,790
As for my affairs,

366
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,140
you two don't need to worry about them.

367
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:32,990
Uncle,

368
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,630
I'm sorry.

369
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,450
Let's go home.

370
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,460
Make sure to talk to your dad nicely.

371
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,120
When are you shooting the commercial?

372
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,230
This weekend.

373
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:40,830
I'm going to the city for the shoot.

374
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,190
The studio is quite impressive.

375
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,680
Do you need me to accompany you?

376
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,390
No.

377
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,050
If you are watching from the sidelines,

378
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,980
I'll feel uncomfortable.

379
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,820
Why?

380
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,830
Would you be comfortable

381
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,450
having others watch you pose and preen?

382
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,900
They'll see it sooner or later.

383
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,480
This ugly daughter-in-law

384
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,870
will have to meet the in-laws eventually.

385
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,310
Well, when I become famous,

386
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,190
I'll print out my photos

387
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,430
and plaster them all over your room.

388
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,190
Fine.

389
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,240
Better print them in black and white.

390
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,310
I'll light two incense sticks for you,

391
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:11,990
lay out a couple of apples,

392
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,050
and set up a shrine for you.

393
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,270
Can you not keep running your mouth?

394
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:22,710
Fenghua.

395
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,470
Am I really that annoying?

396
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,820
Oh, so you're aware.

397
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,210
It's okay.

398
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,500
Don't put yourself down.

399
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,210
I'm not annoyed by you.

400
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,650
I cherish you, alright?

401
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,160
Could you be any more perfunctory?

402
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,310
Xie Wanghe,

403
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,550
I cherish you.

404
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,730
W-what terrible acting!

405
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,820
All those idol dramas you watched were for nothing.

406
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:25,710
If you ever like someone in the future,

407
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,990
please don’t behave like this.

408
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,270
You might scare them to death.

409
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,550
You're about to become a star,

410
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,070
so can't you be a bit more ladylike?

411
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,030
I won't.

412
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,070
I just won't.

413
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:42,600
Here.

414
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,820
Come closer, the wire isn't long enough.

and stronger.

430
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,300
For today's sports meet,

431
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,400
I still say the same thing.

432
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,190
Competition comes first,

433
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,510
friendship second.

434
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,190
Sir!

435
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,990
Competition first,

436
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,280
friendship second.

437
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,500
Friendship first,

438
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,580
competition second.

439
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,590
Alright, stop laughing everyone.

440
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,670
This sports meet is

441
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,740
specially sponsored by Dingsheng Group of Honghuai City.

442
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,140
Dingsheng, Dingsheng,

443
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,640
the mightiest in Honghuai!

444
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
What on earth is this?

445
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,370
What are you saying?

446
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,460
Your family sponsored it?

447
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,470
Obviously.

448
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,590
All the competition equipment,

449
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,150
prizes, and broadcasting equipment

450
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,350
were paid for by my dad.

451
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,250
Your dad has money to sponsor,

452
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,970
but none to pay for the transportation fees?

453
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,050
How can your dad be so shameless?

454
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,070
Say that again.

455
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,440
I said your dad is shameless.

456
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,270
I dare you to say that again!

457
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,100
What's wrong with saying your dad is shameless?

458
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:17,950
Xie Wanghe!

459
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,350
What are you doing?

460
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,480
Sir!

461
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,270
We're just fostering our friendship.

462
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,640
Get back in line!

463
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,060

Siyi!

470
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,120
Step here and

471
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,190
flip yourself over.

472
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,000
Hurry up and change.

473
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,970
Listen,

474
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,020
it's about to start.

475
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,240
Drink plenty of water later.

476
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,000
Be careful not to strain your voice from shouting.

477
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,400
Athletes on the track,

478
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,750
every step you take

479
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,150
echoes the melody of youth.

480
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,430
Every sprint

481
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,390
shines with the light of perseverance.

482
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:07,910
How's that?

483
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,700
Press on! For your dreams,

484
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,990
for glory,

485
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,030
sprint ahead!

486
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:12,870
This is our No. 7 High School's sports meet.

487
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,170
What is she doing here as a student from No.1?

488
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,670
I'm warning you, don't be a jerk.

489
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,490
She's wearing our school uniform too.

490
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,830
Look at how clever you think you are.

491
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,250
Mr. Xu!

492
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,310
Sun Sanliang, you have a death wish, don't you?

493
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:22,710
Ouch, ouch!

494
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,430
What now?

495
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,180
It hurts!

496
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,560
Same old problem. He's asking for a beating.

497
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,100
It's our No. 7 High School's sports meet.

498
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,030
What is she doing here?

499
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,070
Get lost!

500
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,330
You're asking for it, aren't you?

501
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:32,870
Back off!

502
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,150
The principal already said

503
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,550
fighting is strictly prohibited on the field,

504
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:36,650
or there will be severe punishment.

505
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,560
Scared now, huh?

506
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,310
Xie Wanghe,

507
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:41,270
our classes are in the same group for the 4x100 relay.

508
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,230
Let's settle our scores on the track.

509
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,310
Whoever loses

510
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,780
has to remove their bicycle seat

511
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:46,940
and ride home in public.

512
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,870
Alright,

513
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:48,840
you said it.

514
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:49,470
It's a deal!

515
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:49,920
Okay.

516
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,210
What's going on, what's going on?

517
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,580
What's happening here?

518
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:53,410
What are you two doing?

519
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,710
Every time you get together, there's trouble.

520
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,500
Alright.

521
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,470
Break it up, break it up.

522
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,470
Break it up!

523
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,340
Stop messing around.

524
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,920
Xia Fenghua, I've been looking all over for you.

525
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,710
The shot put competition is about to start.

526
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,140
Our class is counting on you.

527
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,920
Quick, come.

528
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:06,990
Let's go.

529
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,660
Dude,

530
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,200
stop being so nasty with your mouth.

531
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,710
In front of the long jump pit,

532
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,590
all of you are poised and ready.

533
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,930
Fenghua's competition starts at the same time.

534
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:19,890
Which one will you watch first?

535
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,820
Every jump

536
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,080
is a leap beyond your own limits.

537
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,120
All the best, Fenghua!

538
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,230
It's up to you now.

539
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,700
These shoes are great.

540
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,690
One, two, three, let's go!

541
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,790
Be gentle.

542
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,430
You can do it.

543
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,370
My hands will be weak soon.

544
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,790
Don't underestimate us just because we're small.

545
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,100
We might not lose.

546
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,070
Xingchi, Xingchi!

547
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,420
Don't feel pressured.

548
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,970
It all depends on you as the first leg.

549
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,030
Why are you looking at me?

550
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,540
Look ahead and focus.

551
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:52,250
Come on!

552
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,520
Come on!

553
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,420
Come on, Fenghua!

554
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,350
Come on, Fenghua!

555
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,030
Come on! Come on!

556
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,050
Come on, Fenghua!

557
00:23:58,930 --> 00:23:59,810
Run!

558
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,590
The 100-meter sprint

559
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:04,070
skims the track like lightning.

560
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,940
It's the ultimate pursuit of speed.

561
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,870
Athletes,

562
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:12,110
write your legend with your legs.

Xie Wanghe has fallen!

593
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,790
Sun Sanliang bursts through the finishing line.

594
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:07,760
Class Four has won first place in this competition.

595
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:08,610
Are you okay?

596
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,800
What's going on here?

597
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,440
Are you okay?

598
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,430
Are you all right?

599
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,750
It's all because of these damn shoes.

600
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,520
Hey,

601
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,740
don't just throw them away.

602
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,280
Do you admit defeat?

603
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,100
You can't win, so you are blaming your shoes, right?

604
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,240
Say that again?

605
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,720
Xia Fenghua!

606
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,860
Xia Fenghua!

607
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,170
Come back, come back.

608
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,140
What are you doing?

609
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,050
It's a matter of fact that we lost.

610
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,890
Let's not go looking for trouble.

611
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,270
We need to stay calm and composed.

612
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:38,040
The women's javelin is about to begin.

613
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,830
All athletes, please take your positions immediately.

614
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,630
Xia Fenghua.

615
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,130
It's all up to you this time.

616
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,430
Fenghua.

617
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,170
Be careful.

618
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,390
That thing is sharp.

619
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,190
It's up to me again?

620
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,130
You good?

621
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,160
You don't usually have such high hopes for me.

622
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:49,710
It's not that.

623
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:52,270
Our class should at least have one good result, right?

624
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,930
We don't even have a single first place yet.

625
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,820
I was counting on them...

626
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,710
Alright, stop laughing!

627
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,060
Go for it, Fenghua!

628
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,820
Come on, Fenghua!

629
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,750
Go for it!

630
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,720
Move aside!

631
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,640
Come on!

632
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,240
Stop looking.

633
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,320
Let's go.

634
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,100
They all deserve our highest respect.

635
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,430
Shoes, shoes, shoes!

636
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,800
Hold on to me, I can't see.

637
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:29,240
Now, a lost and found announcement.

638
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:29,940
Blargh!

639
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,010
A student has lost a set of keys on the field.

640
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,450
Hurry up.

641
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,020
Rinse it off for me.

642
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,180
Rinse his head.

643
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:40,910
Slow down.

644
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,990
Have a rinse.

645
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:42,920
Water's cold!

646
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,820
Take good shots and I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

647
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,210
They dropped the ball at the crucial moment.

648
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,490
When will those three ever give me a break?

649
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,840
Why are you counting on me instead?

650
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,820
Of course I'm counting on you.

651
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,910
Xia Fenghua.

652
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:24,310
I know you're the type who stays quiet

653
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,740
until you're ready to make a big impact.

654
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,830
Our class is relying on you,

655
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,140
so do your best!

656
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,770
Don't be discouraged, Fenghua.

657
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,090
You may have lost in shot put,

658
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,110
but there's still javelin.

659
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,510
I'm not bragging,

660
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,390
but javelin isn't about strength,

661
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,320
it's about flexibility and coordination.

662
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,020
Aren't you in Go Club?

663
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,420
Go is just my hobby.

664
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,710
My mom was on the provincial track and field team.

665
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,050
I practiced every day when I was little.

666
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,870
On the 100-meter track,

667
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:52,550
you expressed youth through speed.

668
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,620
You ignited hope with passion.

669
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:59,550
Go for it! Let the wind cheer you on.

670
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:02,470
Let your hearts applaud for you.

671
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,790
Come on, Fenghua!

672
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,510
Who's that?

673
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,290
What's happening here?

674
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:25,820
Don't look, don't look!

675
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,780
Don't look, don't look!

676
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,210
Who is playing it?

677
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:29,710
Who is playing it?

678
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:30,550
Turn it off!

679
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:32,770
Stop watching!

680
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,690
Stop the broadcast immediately and turn it off!

681
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,600
Is anyone there? Unplug it!

682
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,220
Still showering?

683
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:47,920
Having fun?

684
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,360
Are you out of your minds?

685
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,990
You're the one who's out of your mind.

686
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,260
Peeping at boys showering.

687
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,650
Aren't you afraid of getting a sty?

688
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,240
It's being broadcast on the big screen.

689
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,940
The whole school is watching you!

690
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,300
-Who did it?
-Who did it?

691
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,410
Naked Pig Warriors.

692
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,320
Naked pig.

693
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,590
Naked pigs!

694
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,250
I'll keep it for now and return it to you tomorrow.

695
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,680
You know, I'm quite envious of you.

696
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,750
What do you mean?

697
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,730
What's there to envy?

698
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,520
You have such a good friend who treats you so well.

699
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,040
It’s all worth it in this lifetime.

700
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,220
It's alright, Fenghua.

701
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,500
If he doesn't want you, I do.

702
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,190
Are you crazy?

703
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:39,480
Stop right there.

704
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,070
Just kidding.

705
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,890
I said stop!

706
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,340
Liang's idiocy is no exaggeration.

707
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,470
Fenghua may seem loud and easygoing,

708
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,380
but she's actually quite girly deep down.

709
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,050
You should treat her better from now on.

710
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,060
Let's go.

711
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,730
KFC, here we come.

712
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,500
I'm not in the mood to go.

713
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,190
Cut the crap.

714
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,230
You said it yourself.

715
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,070
You promised to treat us after the competition.

716
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,430
Fried chicken and burgers until we're stuffed.

717
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,630
Don't even think about backing out.

718
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,480
Let me.

719
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,610
Let's go!

720
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:20,620
♫Walking towards the distance♫

721
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,420
♫In a faraway city♫

722
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,500
♫Where there's you and me♫

723
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:34,410
♫The shallow wheel tracks...♫

724
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:39,200
♫Walking towards the distance♫

725
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:43,230
♫In a faraway city...♫

726
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,450
Are you really not going?

727
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,590
I’m not going. My grandma will never agree.

728
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,460
Let me persuade her.

729
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,210
I've already begged her several times.

730
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:58,630
Forget it.

731
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,230
If you're really scared,

732
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,710
ask Wanghe and the others to go with you.

733
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,230
No.

734
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,310
He annoys me.

735
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:07,590
What's wrong?

736
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,920
Did he bother you again?

737
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,150
You should be asking,

738
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,830
when has he not bothered me?

739
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,970
Alright, I'm leaving then.

740
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,310
Didn't you go for a photo shoot?

741
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,310
Why are you back again?

742
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:42,730
Mom,

743
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,660
can I discuss something with you?

744
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,510
Go ahead.

745
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,870
About that 10,000 yuan...

746
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:51,620
What about it?

747
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:53,390
Did you change your mind?

748
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,210
No.

749
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,070
Granny Ma won't let

750
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,470
Siyi model with me.

751
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:02,430
But if she continues to work as a delivery person,

752
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,430
how long will it take her to earn that money?

753
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,990
It will definitely affect her studies.

754
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,740
So I was thinking,

755
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,780
can I give half of it to Siyi first?

756
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:13,950
Let her pay it back first.

757
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,760
I'm about to start earning money from commercials anyway.

758
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,320
The gifts for you and Dad...

759
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,630
I can buy it later, right?

760
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,150
No.

761
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,000
Mom,

762
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,230
Siyi's features are much better than mine.

763
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:32,550
They signed me because of Siyi.

764
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,410
You think your mom is that petty?

765
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,450
It's your money.

766
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,000
You can use it however you want.

767
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,340
Thank you, Mom.

768
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,670
Didn't Wanghe gave me this when I graduated

769
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:56,750
from elementary school?

770
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,970
You still have it?

771
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,860
"I have to keep all the gifts Wanghe gave me."

772
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,130
If I had thrown it away,

773
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,310
you would have killed me, wouldn't you?

774
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,900
I wouldn't have.

775
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,040
This money,

776
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,070
your dad and I didn't spend it.

777
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:13,210
We're saving it all for you

778
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,530
as your dowry.

779
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,840
In the future,

780
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,990
along with this little fat piggy,

781
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,100
we'll send it all

782
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,850
to the Xie family with you.

783
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:25,790
Mom!

784
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,840
Mr. Xu, Mr. Xu!

785
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,240
What are you doing?

786
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,390
Let go of me.

787
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,710
This is my application for a leave of absence.

788
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,810
My parents have already signed it.

789
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:44,620
Please take a look.

790
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,800
[Parents' signature: Xie Tiancheng, Liang Haihong]

791
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,370
Are you sure your parents signed this?

792
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,470
Of course!

793
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,250
I wouldn't dare make such an important decision on my own.

794
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,630
You still plan on running that test prep center?

795
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:58,650
I'm not doing that.

796
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,310
Isn't the school running it?

797
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,700
I'll do something else.

798
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,310
What else do you want to do?

799
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,960
It's a secret.

800
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:10,310
But as soon as it's done,

801
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,889
I'll tell you right away.

802
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:13,040
Don't worry, it's just for one year.

803
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,770
If it doesn't work out, I'll come right back.

804
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,340
What if you succeed?

805
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,780
I'll come back then too.

806
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,400
No. 7 High School will always be my home.

807
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,550
Mr. Xu's kindness

808
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,480
is higher than the sky

809
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,469
and deeper than the sea.

810
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:23,949
Mr. Xu.

811
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:24,900
Go away.

812
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,350
I'd be a fool to believe you.

813
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,929
Mr. Xu, please agree.

814
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:29,290
My parents have already signed.

815
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,639
-Please agree.
-Let go of me.

816
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,710
Stop pulling me.

817
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,270
Mr. Xu.

818
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,030
Let go of me.

819
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,310
Mr. Xu, I'm begging you.

820
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:35,790
Please.

821
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:36,710
Please sign it.

822
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,010
It's crooked, Liangliang.

823
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,030
Straighten it up.

824
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:39,969
That's right.

825
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,210
Hai.

826
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,280
You're here.

827
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:52,670
Just you alone? Where's Siyi?

828
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,350
Her grandma didn't agree.

829
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:55,150
Why?

830
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,620
Maybe she's conservative.

831
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,070
I'll try to persuade her again later.

832
00:34:59,390 --> 00:34:59,830
Alright.

833
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:00,760
Then we'll shoot you first.

834
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,060
We'll shoot some women's clothing today.

835
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:05,990
I'll pick out an outfit for you.

836
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,460
Here, this one.

837
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,290
Okay, go get your makeup done.

838
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,550
Don't move.

839
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,430
Yes.

840
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,250
You've never curled your eyelashes before?

841
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,010
No.

842
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:26,680
The only time was when I secretly used my neighbor's lipstick as a kid.

843
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,630
Neighbor?

844
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,420
My mom doesn't wear makeup.

845
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,380
I have a neighbor.

846
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,400
She's an actress.

847
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,620
She loves...

848
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:35,350
She loves wearing makeup.

849
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,310
Don't move.

850
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,650
What kind of shows has she been in?

851
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,810
I don't know.

852
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,150
I'll ask her next time.

853
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:41,710
Okay.

854
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,480
How is it? Does it look good?

855
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,350
Yes, it does.

856
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,560
It looks amazing.

857
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:20,590
But it feels like...

858
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,200
I'm not myself anymore.

859
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,100
If it’s not you, then who else could it be?

860
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,950
How long will this makeup last?

861
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,530
If you don't wash it off, it'll stay on.

862
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,050
Okay.

863
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,020
Then I won't wash it off.

864
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:34,760
I'll keep on it for a month.

865
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:35,640
Alright.

866
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,500
It makes me happier.

867
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,220
Does that sound good?

868
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:42,800
It sounds good.

869
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:43,590
Ready?

870
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,060
I'm coming!

871
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,510
Not bad.

872
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:47,530
You're getting better.

873
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,880
That's great.

874
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:49,850
Very nice.

875
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,040
Good.

876
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:10,990
That's a wrap.

877
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,490
So fast?

878
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,560
Let's go with this set, shall we?

879
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,490
I can't find a single flaw.

880
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,120
It's really good.

881
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,620
You look pure and innocent

882
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:22,890
with a touch of rebellion.

883
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:24,630
Right.

884
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,670
There's a sneaker advertisement tomorrow.

885
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:27,890
I've decided to use you.

886
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:29,020
Alright?

887
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,310
Don't leave tonight.

888
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,030
Just stay here.

889
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,910
There are rooms available here.

890
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:32,730
I'll have them prepare one for you.

891
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,760
You can go back tomorrow.

892
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,270
I should probably just go back.

893
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,660
Otherwise, my mom will worry.

894
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:39,530
Look,

895
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,270
the journey

896
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:42,460
takes about 3 to 4 hours for a round trip, right?

897
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,480
By the time you come tomorrow, your condition won't be as good.

898
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:46,130
Just do as I say.

899
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:46,710
Liangliang.

900
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:47,270
Yes?

901
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,230
Go prepare a room.

902
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,720
A standard room, okay?

903
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:50,980
Look at the photos,

904
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,550
then rest early.

905
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:09,430
You're the only one in my heart, not her.

906
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:12,810
You have to believe that my love is true.

907
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:15,580
Only you are my dream.

908
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,470
Only you can make me worry.

909
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:21,040
She's not in my heart.

910
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:24,790
You're the only one in my heart.

911
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:24,700
[08 Chris Lee]

912
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,970
[08 Chris Lee]

913
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:26,790
Hey, Mom.

914
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,950
It's me, Fenghua.

915
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,750
I'm staying in the city tonight.

916
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:34,950
I have another shoot tomorrow.

917
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,870
Don't worry.

918
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,030
I'll just stay in the room.

919
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,190
I won't go anywhere.

920
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:41,820
I'll come back right after the shoot tomorrow.

921
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,260
I know, I know.

922
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,960
I'm just letting you know.

923
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,370
Okay, I'll hang up now.

924
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:51,500
Bye.

925
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:00,360
You're the only one in my heart, not her.

926
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:03,890
You have to believe that my love is true.

927
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:06,340
[08 Chris Lee]

928
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,590
Only you are my dream.

929
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:09,910
Only you can make me worry.

930
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:12,630
Since I sent you home that day,

931
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,950
that day...

932
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:15,830
Who is it?

933
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,220
It's me, Hai.

934
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,800
Is something up?

935
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,060
I have some good news for you.

936
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,130
The client is extremely satisfied

937
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,090
with the photographs we took today.

938
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,440
They insist on treating you to dinner.

939
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,390
I've already eaten.

940
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:30,350
Maybe next time?

941
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:31,030
No.

942
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,550
The client is downstairs right now.

943
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,430
Just go down quickly and say hello.

944
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:35,790
Have a couple of drinks and it'll be over.

945
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,460
Well, I'm tired.

946
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,090
I want to rest early.

947
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:43,890
It's okay.

948
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,100
It won't take long.

949
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,740
It won't take long, really.

950
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,690
It's just downstairs.

951
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:49,260
Besides, those people are all respectable.

952
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,360
They won't do anything inappropriate.

953
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,750
Come on, open the door.

954
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,190
I can't afford to offend a big client.

955
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:54,900
Open the door.

956
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:58,290
Your contract didn’t say anything about meeting clients.

957
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,720
What are you doing?

958
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,150
It's just going down to say hello.

959
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,430
What's wrong with having a couple of drinks?

960
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:11,550
I don't drink.

961
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,770
Then just make do with soft drinks.

962
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:13,470
They really...

963
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:14,030
I'm telling you,

964
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:14,910
they're all respectable people.

965
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:15,880
I told you I'm not going.

966
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,840
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

967
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,440
Don't shout.

968
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:22,030
This is a task arranged by the company for you,

969
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:22,670
isn't it?

970
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,500
If you don’t go, wouldn’t that be a breach of contract?

971
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,500
You are just having dinner, not sleeping with them.

972
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,550
Don't pull me!

973
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,230
Let's go.

974
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:29,990
Let go of me.

975
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:30,870
Help!

976
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:32,220
You're trying to run away?

977
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,230
Are you taking my kindness for granted?

978
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,410
Who do you think you are?

979
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,560
You think it's so easy to earn 1000 yuan?

980
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:40,450
Trying to run away? Who do you think you are?

981
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:42,320
What’s wrong with asking you to join in for a drink?

982
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,910
Even international models have to entertain clients.

983
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:44,510
Why can't you do it?

984
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,020
Help!

985
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,490
Why can't you just have a drink with them?

986
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:48,040
Someone help!

987
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,150
Help!

988
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,950
You think it's so easy to earn 10,000 yuan?

989
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,430
That money is easy money, huh?

990
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:53,400
Are you going or not?

991
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:54,400
Scream?

992
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,770
Who's coming even with your screams?

993
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,560
How dare you hit me?

994
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:07,980
Wait and see.

995
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:09,260
Come back!

996
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,760
Come back! Don't run!

997
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,800
Stop! Come back! Stop!

998
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:16,430
Come back if you don't want to die!

999
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:34,080
What's wrong? Can't run anymore?

1000
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:36,760
Let's rest for a bit.

1001
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,060
What happened to your leg?

1002
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,430
How did you get hurt?

1003
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,640
I...

1004
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,360
When I was fighting him earlier,

1005
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:49,810
I must have gotten cut.

1006
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,290
It's fine, no broken bones.

1007
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:56,980
It hurts, doesn't it?

1008
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,350
Sit here and don't move.

1009
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,700
I'll go find a pharmacy.

1010
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:13,870
Don't go.

1011
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,040
Come on, I'll carry you on my back.

1012
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,710
You usually act all bold.

1013
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,600
But when something happens, you cower away.

1014
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,800
I despise you.

1015
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,550
If you dare tell anyone about what happened today,

1016
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,010
I'll kill you.

1017
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,530
I won't say anything.

1018
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,430
If you want to cry, just let it out.

1019
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,650
I won't laugh at you.
