gets a chance to flow against the tide.

11
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,530
The ancient canal that has flowed for thousands of years,

12
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,270
in a new millennium,

13

Great!

Hello, fellow citizens and friends.

Hello!

38
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,940
To celebrate the Grand Canal becoming a World Heritage Site,

39
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,310

54
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,850
Mayor Gu,

55
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,829
Mr. Zhou just said

56
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,200

57
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,829
will greatly boost Flower Street's economy.

58
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,320
Being a World Heritage Site

59
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,270
doesn't just bring benefits to Honghuai

60
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,590
and Flower Street.

61
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,390
It also brings responsibility.

62
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,390
The Grand Canal has been flowing for over 2,000 years.

63
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,390
It's the mother river for all of us.

64
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,900
Each of us has the responsibility

65
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,110
to protect and revitalize it.

66
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,630
Yes.

67
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,870
It wasn't easy.

68
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,990
We waited for so many years.

69
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,580
There was no news a couple of days ago,

70
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,010
and I thought we failed.

71
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,110
How could that be?

72
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,780
Good things are worth waiting for.

73
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,280
The construction of the Grand Canal

74
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,050
began during the Spring and Autumn period

75
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,700
and didn't end until modern times.

76
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,269
Countless people worked tirelessly

77
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,510
for over 2,000 years.

78
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:22,960
It took over 2,000 years

79
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,850
for it to finally take shape.

80
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,830
In the history of human civilization,

81
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,260
it's the largest-scale hydraulic project,

82
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,260
bar none.

83
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,050
Bar none.

84
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,740
Yes.

85
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,190
L-Let's have a toast

86
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,820
to our great mother river.

87
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,870
Come on.

88
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,600
Cheers.

89
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,330
Cheers.

90
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,960
While everyone is here,

91
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,310
there's something I'd like to say.

92
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,870
I'm thinking of taking advantage of this success

93
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,550
to revitalize Honghuai City and Flower Street.

94
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,840
Now, the most crucial thing is people,

95
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,610
especially young people.

96
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,470
As we all know,

97
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,770
our young generations, after growing up,

98
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,880
have gradually left their homes

99
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,230
to start businesses elsewhere.

100
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,270
Now, the government

101
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,230
has formulated corresponding policies

102
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,130
in the hope of attracting

103
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,000
young people back to start businesses in small towns.

104
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,650
As far as I know, all your children are away from home.

105
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,390
I hope you parents

106
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,340
can spread the word about our policies.

107
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,670
We'd like to have them back

108
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,340
to restore our glory.

109
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,770
Great!

110
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,870
Mayor Gu,

111
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,510
I'll be the first to respond to your call.

112
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,670
Later, I'll ask my son to come back.

113
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,330
Chen Bo's son has been

114
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,830
staying in Honghuai all along.

115
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,540
We'll call them immediately

116
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,990
and force them to come back if necessary,

117
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,470
telling them not to go anywhere else

118
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,260
and just stay on Flower Street, right?

119
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,070
Yes, yes.

120
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,610
That's not necessary.

121
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,500
As their parents, you just need

122
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,150
to inform them about the policies.

123
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,350
If they're willing to come back,

124
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,600
we certainly welcome them.

125
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,680
But if they have any opinions or suggestions

126
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,860
about our policies,

127
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,830
they can come to me and talk with me directly.

128
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,690
We're willing to make changes.

129
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,470
I hope

130
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,940
those children will come back

131
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,920
not because their parents force them to,

132
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,310
but because they're attracted by the bright future

133
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,590
of Flower Street.

134
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,260
Only in this way

135
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,560
will they have the enthusiasm and motivation

136
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,710
to make Flower Street better.

137
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,560
-Great. 
-That's right.

138
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,100
Mayor Gu makes a great point.

139
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,350
Anyway, no matter what,

140
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,670
today I've truly felt that

141
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,030
the Grand Canal

142
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,500
is a miracle.

143
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,760
We should all take pride in it.

144
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,160
Then let's have another toast to this miracle.

145
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,790
Come on.

146
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,790
Cheers.

147
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,080
To our pride.

148
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,470
To our pride.

149
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,850
To our pride.

150
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,530
In the past, when Boss Xie and I were seafarers,

151
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,860
we sailed all the way north.

152
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,290
At that time, the places close to the river

153
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,470
had many tall buildings,

154
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,570
and business was booming,

155
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,190
while the places far from the river

156
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,800
were not as good, right, Boss Xie?

157
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,030
Yes, exactly.

158
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:44,650
That's right.

159
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,240
In our country,

160
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,909
the canal still plays a crucial role

161
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,090
in commerce.

162
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,630
The canal connects the north and south,

163
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:51,770
benefiting the entire nation.

164
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,670
Although these years...

165
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,670
Haihong, what's wrong?

166
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,790
You're upset?

167
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:56,420
In terms of cargo capacity…

168
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,230
No.

169
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,110
The canal still plays the most important role.

170
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,660
I just feel that

171
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,070
at such a joyous moment,

172
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,530
if all our children were here with us,

173
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,740
it would be wonderful.

174
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,310
Then ask them to come back.

175
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,450
Let's eat.

176
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,720
Cheers!

177
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,450
Happy.

178
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:22,870
I'm so happy.

179
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,230
I feel like singing right now

180
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,110
to praise the Grand Canal.

181
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,120
Too bad there's not a suitable song.

182
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,350
There is.

183
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,070
Here it goes.

184
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:36,600
The great river…

185
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,800
That's about the Yangtze River,

186
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,050
not the canal.

187
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,070
The Yangtze River and the canal are connected.

188
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,700
We all grew up by the water.

189
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,550
Anywhere near the water is our home.

190
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,360
Why that face? Am I wrong?

191
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,870
You're right. I just didn't expect

192
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,240
you to say something so philosophical.

193
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,700
Fenghua!

194
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,600
Since everyone's here today,

195
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,430
I suggest we go home together for the Mid-Autumn Festival.

196
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,720
I agree!

197
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,100
Well,

198
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,590
I didn't go back last Mid-Autumn Festival.

199
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,250
My mom nagged me for ages about it.

200
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,570
Can we get time off?

201
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,530
Why are you looking at me?

202
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,270
Aren't you your boss's favorite? Like the historical figure He Shen.

203
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,210
Your words should carry weight.

204
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,160
He Shen?

205
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,340
I-I didn't say that. Y-You're

206
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,970
more like Li Hongzhang in the company.

207
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,250
Is that a compliment or an insult?

208
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,070
A compliment!

209
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,600
Minister Li was a renowned statesman of his time.

210
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,620
He contributed greatly to prolonging the Qing dynasty.

211
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,580
Knock it off.

212
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,799
Alright, I'll ask about it.

213
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:46,440
If it works with the schedule, we'll go back together.

214
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,290
Great, Minister Xie!

215
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,630
Here, try this.

216
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,350
I don't want this. I want fish.

217
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,300
Okay, fish it is.

218
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,910
Please.

219
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:57,610
Fill my glass.

220
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,000
Alright. I'll do it myself.

221
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,870
Cheers!

222
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,680
Cheers.

223
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,700
Xingchi.

224
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,300
Cheers.

225
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,540
Cheers!

226
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,980
Cheers.

227
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:12,940
I'm leaving.

228
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:13,430
Take care.

229
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,350
Don't stay out late. Bye-bye.

230
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,530
Let me know when you're home.

231
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,540
Bye-bye.

232
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,910
I'm heading off too.

233
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,470
I'll walk home. See you tomorrow.

234
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,380
Watch out for cars.

235
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,550
Be careful.

236
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,650
Let's go. You can stay over at my place tonight.

237
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,080
You want to drink more?

238
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,460
Wanghe,

239
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,560
what do you think of my abilities?

240
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,090
In what aspect?

241
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,250
Management.

242
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,500
I didn't have experience before,

243
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,060
but after running around for a while recently,

244
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,390
I think I'm ready.

245
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,350
Well,

246
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,970
I want to apply for a station

247
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,410
with me as the chief.

248
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:55,720
Bro,

249
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,310
you've never managed a station before.

250
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,680
Food delivery is a new industry.

251
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,710
Every station chief starts from scratch.

252
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,520
I'm ready, Wanghe.

253
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,020
Trust me.

254
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,500
I'll work hard. I won't embarrass you.

255
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,190
I hate to discourage you…

256
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,700
Then don't.

257
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,630
I've never asked you for anything in my life.

258
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,960
I've thought it through this time.

259
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:26,330
Instead of wasting my life away,

260
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,270
I want

261
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,240
to give it my all

262
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,810
when I'm still young.

263
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,690
I'm done living in the basement.

264
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,660
I just hope

265
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:43,200
my life can get a little better every day.

266
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,530
I don't want a drastic change.

267
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,470
Just a little better is enough.

268
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,100
You like her that much?

269
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,070
So do you.

270
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,110
Cut the crap.

271
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,090
Let's do our best and see

272
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,680
who saves up enough to marry her first.

273
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,350
Alright.

274
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,770
I accept

275
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,220
your challenge. Good luck to you,

276
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:25,920
and good luck to me.

277
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,580
Good luck to you.

278
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,130
Chief?

279
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,970
Xingchi isn't experienced enough,

280
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,890
but I believe he's capable enough.

281
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,250
If he fails at it,

282
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,430
you'll be affected.

283
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,180
Those in Haidian are waiting to laugh at you.

284
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,550
If he fails,

285
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,570
I'll take full responsibility.

286
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,660
How?

287
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,050
I have stock options.

288
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,940
If Xingchi fails,

289
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,620
just calculate the losses

290
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,360
and deduct them from my options.

291
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,730
Let me tell you, whether a system is strong or not

292
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,510
all comes down to the order rejection rate.

293
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,550
Take Yuntu, for example.

294
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,570
If the number of rejected orders gets too high in one day,

295
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,360
the system will automatically...

296
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,250
Xingchi.

297
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,190
That won't do.

298
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:17,520
Take it.

299
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,790
Wanghe.

300
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,270
The boss agreed.

301
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,830
I owe you big time.

302
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,190
Alright, knock it off.

303
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,920
Just work hard.

304
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,500
But don't put too much pressure on yourself.

305
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,570
There will definitely

306
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,840
be gossip in the company.

307
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,560
Don't take it to heart.

308
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,430
From now on, you need to use your actions

309
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,040
to prove them wrong.

310
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,420
Don't worry.

311
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,940
They'll know they're dead wrong!

312
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,080

from today on,

we sink or swim together.

316
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,300
I don't know

317
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,760
how things are in other stations.

318
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,830
But here, the most important thing

319
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,580
is fairness.

320
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,370
Great!

321
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,640

323
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,110
At our station, I will

324
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,270
do my best to distribute orders fairly.

325
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,270
I won't make you take orders from over three kilometers away.

326
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,070
When something unexpected happens,

327
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:14,830
don't panic, stay calm,

328
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:15,750
and call the station.

I'll handle it.

If there's a dispute with a customer,

don't panic either.

332
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,870
Calm down

333
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:24,000
and handle it according to the customer manual.

334
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,240
If you can't handle it,

335

leave it to me.

Great!

338
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,270
Alright.

Don't get excited yet.

What if I'm fooling you all?

341
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,870

Okay, I'll go call them now.

518
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,510
I'll go now.

Okay.

Alright, we're leaving, Master.

[Test Results of the Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease]

535
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,350
Everyone,

536
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,540
I'll get straight to the point.

537
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,210
Mr. Zhou

538
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:12,270
was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease a couple of days ago.

539
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,370
I gathered everyone here today

540
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,070
to inform you all about this

541
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,620
so that you can be prepared.

542
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,940
H-Has it been confirmed?

543
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,930
This disease…

544
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,720
is not easy to treat, is it?

545
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,980
Well, people with this disease

546
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,190
will gradually forget the people

547
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,270
around them.

548
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,390
In the most severe cases,

549
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,470
they will even forget their families.

550
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:37,340
So we all need to be mentally prepared.

551
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,280
You mean,

552
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,160
he'll forget

553
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,010
all of us?

554
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,990
That's why we need to take this seriously.

555
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,850
If Mr. Zhou has a memory lapse one day,

556
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,800
we all need to stay calm.

557
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,220
We should play along

558
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,010
and not let him sense anything unusual.

559
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,880
But we don't know when he's normal

560
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,070
and when he's having a memory lapse.

561
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,660
I'll ask my friend working at the hospital about it.

562
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,510
We should observe a patient

563
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:05,430
to understand what this disease is really like.

564
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,870
Then we'll know how to handle it.

565
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:09,190
We need to know more about it, right?

566
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,820
Now that Mr. Zhou is ill,

567
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:13,490
can he still take care of his daily needs by himself?

568
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,510
For now, he can.

569
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,140
But we don't know about the future.

570
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,600
Yeah.

571
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,390
Then we need to get someone to watch him all day,

572
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,880
don't we?

573
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,520
We can't let him get lost.

574
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,860
Watch him all day?

575
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,990
Who can do that?

576
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,990
How could this happen?

577
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,070
W-We were just talking the other day

578
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,070
about going to Italy together.

579
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,670
I was just about to apply for a visa.

580
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,420
Forget about Italy.

581
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:10,050
It's too far. Forget about it.

582

585
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,330
G-Go ahead.

586
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,240
Just tell me what I can do to help.

587
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,460
My dad doesn't know about his illness,

588
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,750
and we don't want him to know.

589
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,600
So,

590
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,090
could you help me keep an eye on him?

591
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:34,010
I'm worried he might get lost.

592
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,710
No problem. We're together every day anyway.

593
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,650
I'll keep an eye on him. Don't worry.

594
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,510
Don't tell Haikuo

595

about it.

596
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,590
Why not?

597
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:49,210
He's in Beijing and can't come back.

598
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,390
It would just make him worry.

599
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,300
That's true.

600
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,360
Haikuo.

601
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,200

602
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,400
What took you so long?

603
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,260
I waited for you for ages.

604
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:03,890
Mr. Zhou,

605
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,680
pleasure to meet you.

606
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,380
Welcome.

607
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:05,780
Today,

608
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,390
I'm going to show you three apartments.

609
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,180
Take your time.

610
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:08,730
You'll surely find a satisfying one.

Let's go.

Mr. Zhou,

614
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:13,570
please, this way.

615
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:15,410
This is one of the best-selling new developments

616
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,460
within the Fourth Ring Road.

617
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,840
Take a look.

618
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,580
This apartment is

619
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,030
north-south facing with good ventilation.

620
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:24,350
It has two bedrooms, two living rooms, and one bathroom.

621
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,200
There's a lot of

622
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:25,980
space.

623
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,770
Look at this living room.

624
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,120
It's 32 square meters in total.

625
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,780
Mr. Zhou, take a look.

626
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,550
Haikuo,

627
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,110
come over.

628
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,200
The view is great.

629
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,310
Mr. Zhou?

630
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,580
Are you not satisfied with this apartment?

631
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,230
It's okay.

632

I have other options for you.

633

Let me show you.

636
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,690
No need.

637
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,620
Thank you.

638
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:47,710
I'm busy today.

639
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,630
Maybe next time.

640
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,700
Let's go.

641
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,460
Haikuo!

642
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,370
Haikuo!

643
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:53,610
Haikuo!

644
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,920
Zhou Haikuo, what do you mean?

645
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,160
I'm not planning to buy a house.

646
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,390
Why not?

647
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,200
I don't have money.

648
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,550
Didn't Xie Wanghe say

649
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,170
he would help you get stock options?

650
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,300
I don't even know if the company will survive,

651
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,550
so don't depend on the stock options.

652
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,700
You think starting a business guarantees success?

653
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,880
Then we can ask our parents for some money.

654
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,630
I don't want to use my parents' money.

655
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,880
Think about Mr. Du and Wenwen.

656
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,990
Their parents paid the down payments for them,

657
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,260
and then they'd pay off the mortgage themselves.

658
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,890
In life,

659
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,790
one should have a home of their own, right?

660
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,980
Are you saying without a house, there's no home?

661
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,350
I'm not asking for a big house.

662
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,580
At least let me have

663
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,920
a bedroom I can decorate myself.

664
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,320
Even a small apartment would do.

665
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,110
After we become rich…

666
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,430
I'm very satisfied with the house I live in now.

667
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,110
I don't want to change.

668
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:40,820
Wait.

669
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,940
Are you going to live in a rental house for the rest of your life?

670
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,530
What's wrong with renting?

671
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,360
Is life so unbearable in a rental house?

672
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,110
Yes!

673
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,380
Zhou Haikuo, if you leave now,

674
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,390
don't ever come back to me!

675

[Amour Bar]

676
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,000
Enough.

677
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,960
Stop drinking.

678
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,880
Xiaohui isn't wrong.

679
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,840
Having a house gives her peace of mind.

680
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,080
My parents had a house.

681
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,620
Did they have peace of mind?

682
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:12,880
That's different.

683
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,210
How is it different?

684
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,390
In my opinion,

685

687
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,190
a house,

688
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,120
and children—

689
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,600
these things all seem to be the bonds of marriage

690
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,590
that can make the relationship between two people stronger

691
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,340
and more stable.

692
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,800
But a truly unbreakable marriage

693
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,490
doesn't need any of these things.

694
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:32,000
Love alone is enough.

695
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:35,300
Any relationship that needs external things to maintain

696
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,590
is fragile

697
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,340
and will fail sooner or later.

698
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:41,050
My parents are a prime example.

699
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,040
In my opinion,

700
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,940
you just don't love Xiaohui enough.

701
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,620
If you really loved Xiaohui,

702
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:46,310
you'd not just give her a house

703
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,210
but also your life.

704
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,980
Shut up!

705
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,830
Let me put it this way.

706
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,640
If Xiaohui got sick

707
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,990
and needed a kidney, would you give her yours?

708
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,710
Of course.

709
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,470
That's it.

710
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,300
You'd give her a kidney

711
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:56,950
but not a house?

712
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,330
Are you crazy?

713
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,440
You're the one who's crazy.

714
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,420
I can understand that.

715
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,190
Giving her his kidney

716
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,670
means Haikuo loves her.

717
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,300
It shows he cares for her.

718
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,900
But being forced

719
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,980
to buy her a house

720
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,360
makes you feel like she doesn't trust you.

721
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,230
It almost feels like

722
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,110
she doesn't love you.

723
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,910
That's it!

724
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,410
I love her.

725
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,130
I want to give her

726
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,140
a better life,

727
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:29,250
and I'll work hard for that.

728
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,080
But she can't force me!

729
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,470
It makes me feel that

730
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,810
our relationship

731
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:36,090
is bought with this house

732
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,410
and it's fragile.

733
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,120
Understand?

734
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:38,850
Fine.

735
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,830
If you really break up with her,

736
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,000
don't come crying to us.

737
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,410
I'll change the locks.

738
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,890
Go cry to Xiaohui.

739
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,390
Alright.

740
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,280
You two drink.

741
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,160
I'm leaving.

742
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:53,840
I'm leaving!

743
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,500
Go ahead.

744
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,740
I'll talk to the river.

745
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,590
I'm really leaving!

746
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,150
Take care.

747
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:01,870
Go ahead and jump.

748
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:02,880
You're not stopping me?

749
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,960
Jump.

750
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:08,990
What are you going to do?

751
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:09,840
Dance!

752
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,480
Come here!

753
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,610
Come here!

754
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:27,890
Hurry up!

755
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:41,990
Not bad.

756
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,180
Your response

757
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,590
is faster than I expected.

758
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,070
You're young and full of energy.

759
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,200
Yuntuan will catch up soon.

760
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,880
Then surpass them again.

761
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,060
Competition is all about spirit.

762
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,530
We need more people.

763
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,910
Yuntuan's HR department alone

764
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,470
takes up half a floor.

765
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,280
I know it's been hard for you.

766
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,100
Hang in there.

767
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,870
I've already started reaching out for Series D funding.

768
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:07,860
Which company?

769
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,380
I can't tell you for now.

770
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,200
I'll let you know when it's done.

771
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:17,990
Mr. Meng.

772
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,820
Well…

773
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,540
What's it?

774
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,910
If we get the funding,

775
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,380
before Series E,

776
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,340
can you give my two friends

777
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,580
some stock options?

778
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,590
The amount doesn't matter.

779
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,140
The gesture itself matters.

780
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,350
I hope Bee can make them

781
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,980
feel included.

782
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:47,400
So without stock options, they don't feel included?

783
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,590
Not exactly...

784
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,350
In the whole company,

785
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,750
how many people have stock options?

786
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,590
I can share mine with them.

787
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:01,550
Just don't tell them.

788
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,810
You're close friends.

789
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,310
After you succeed,

790
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,120
buy them a nice car.

791
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,110
That'll be enough.

792
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,400
I'm not teaching you to be stingy.

793
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,230
It's just that

794
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,820
people are unpredictable.

795
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,830
Great kindness can lead to resentment.

796
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,860
Look at me.

797
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,070
I started my business in college.

798
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,850
And today, none of my old friends

799
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,120
are still around.

800
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,420
It's a hard-learned lesson.

801
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,240
We're different.

802
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,590
We're childhood friends.

803
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:36,710
We were neighbors.

804
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:37,910
So what?

805
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:39,560
Even blood brothers

806
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,000
fight tooth and nail

807
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,050
over a bit of inheritance.

808
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,230
And think about

809
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,070
those successful big companies.

810
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,070
How many can you name

811
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,910
that are still owned by their founding members?

812
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,490
Naive.

813
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:08,680
Son.

814
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:10,630
Mom?

815
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,350
Get in.

816
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,290
What are you doing here?

817
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,550
Let's go have dinner.

818
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,830
The head chef of this restaurant

819
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,210
was your father's apprentice.

820
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,020
The restaurant's owner poached him with a high salary.

821
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:47,230
Try it and see if it tastes the same.

822
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,530
Not bad.

823
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,190
I'll give you a card later.

824
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,840
Bring Wanghe and the others here to eat.

825
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,010
How's your dad doing lately?

826
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,100
Don't you two call each other?

827
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,280
We haven't been in touch for a long time.

828
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,500
We're both busy.

829
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:10,820
I occasionally call your grandpa to check on things,

830
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,920
but he only shares good news with me.

831
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:14,700
Because there's no bad news.

832
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,830
You're the same.

833
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,270
Every time I ask, you say everything's fine.

834
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,460
You won't tell me anything.

835
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,830
It's true that everything's fine,

836
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,350
or I would definitely tell you.

837
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,130
What about you and Xiaohui?

838
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,930
Why did you two fight if everything was fine?

839
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,460
She went to you?

840
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,390
Yes.

841
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,550
She kept crying.

842
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,370
It's your fault.

843
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:46,720
Why make such a fuss over a house?

844
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,770
As a girl,

845
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,160
she needs to feel secure.

846
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,260
You hurt her feelings.

847
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,150
Can a house

848
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,190
really make her feel secure?

849
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,050
Of course.

850
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,250
Having a house means having a home.

851
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:05,060
But you and Dad had a house and a home.

852
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:09,960
At your age,

853
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,429
you should be past your rebellious phase.

854
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,219
This is your problem.

855
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,159
Don't bring up your dad and me.

856
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,440
We had a house.

857
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,480
Life was not bad.

858
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,670
My dad is down-to-earth.

859
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:26,409
I believe you didn't feel insecure.

860
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,070
No.

861
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:27,780
I didn't feel insecure.

862
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:31,330
But you still left.

863
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,590
So, a sense of security

864
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,219
is not important for marriage,

865
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,370
and it's not a necessity.

866
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,810
You felt secure,

867
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:45,389
yet you still found the mundane life boring.

868
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:46,590
So why should I pursue

869
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,699
the so-called sense of security?

870
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,990
Sorry, Son.

871
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,720
What happened between your dad and me

872
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:02,890
traumatized you.

873
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,750
That's not what I mean.

874
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,100
When you were young,

875
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,040
there were things you wouldn't understand even if I told you.

876
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,690
Now that you've grown up,

877
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,910
I can tell you about them.

878
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:20,700
I've only loved one man in my entire life.

879
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,080
That's your dad.

880
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,650
I still love him.

881
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,200
But

882
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,830
the life he gave me…

883
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,400
made me feel depressed and suffocated.

884
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:37,060
I'd rather face all kinds of hardships outside

885
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:40,570
than go back to that unchanging life

886
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,730
where I could see how it would end.

887
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,560
So,

888
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,240
your dad and I parted on good terms.

889
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,690
We both have resentment in our hearts,

890
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,550
but we also wish each other well.

891
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:01,160
Are you sure Dad wishes you well?

892
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,420
Of course!

893
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,750
He loves me very much too.

894
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,950
That's why he let me go.

895
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:12,030
As for you and Xiaohui,

896
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:13,920
I don't care about what will happen in the future.

897
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,730
If you truly love her,

898
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,240
I hope you think through a few things.

899
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:20,220
First,

900
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,710
can you give her the life she wants?

901
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:23,990
Second,

902
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,700
will that kind of life

903
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,060
make you miserable?

904
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,500
Third and most importantly,

905
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,310
after breaking up with her,

906
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,030
will you regret it?

907
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:40,740
How about you?

908
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:41,950
Do you regret it?

909
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:49,740
I know what my answer is.

910
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,710
You need to figure out what your answer is.

911
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:56,000
Everyone is responsible for their own life.

912
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,850
Neither your dad nor I have the right to make choices for you.

913
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,900
♫Inexplicable and strange♫

914
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,730
♫I can't both love you and let you go♫

915

♫How can I decide♫

928
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,100

♫Which is messier, the beginning or the end?♫

935

♫That even my tears feel like they're burning?♫

936
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,300
All right.

937
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:12,800
I won't leave.

938
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:14,600
♫Maybe it's a relief that we're not meant for each other♫

939
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:13,920
Don't worry.

940

♫No need to suffer too long♫

941

♫Why can you forget my kindness♫

943
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,520
♫The moment you let go?♫

944
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:22,980
♫Making me look like a fool♫

♫I'll say goodbye and disturb you no more♫

948
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,680
I wonder

949
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:39,710
if he'll break up with Xiaohui.

950
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,460
It won't come to that.

951
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,550
How do you know?

952
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,430
Xiaohui loves him so much.

953
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,320
He didn't reply to her messages for a few days,

954
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:48,920
and her eyes were swollen from crying.

955
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,050
She dragged me to meet Haikuo's mom with her.

956
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,310
She was so humble.

957
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,270
If you were her,

958
00:38:58,690 --> 00:38:59,690
what would you do?

959
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,110
You mean the house?

960
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,840
What kind of house do you want?

961
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,110
I don't want

962
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,320
a house

963
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,580
but an RV.

964
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:12,630
The kind you can drive around everywhere.

965
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,140
When I've earned enough money,

966
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,420
I'll drive my RV

967
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,030
to travel all over the world.

968
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:18,770
Wherever I go,

969
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:19,810
I'll set up a tent,

970
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:20,830
build a fire,

971
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:21,830
grill some skewers,

972
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:22,760
and open a beer.

973
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:23,690
Perfect.

974
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,940
Where do you want to go the most?

975
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,280
The place doesn't matter.

976
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,830
What matters is who I travel with.

977
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:33,830
Yes.

978
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,040
What about you?

979
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:40,070
If the company goes public

980
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,410
and you achieve financial freedom,

981
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,020
how do you plan to live your life?

982
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,430
Travel with the girl I love.

983
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,830
That's my dream.

984
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:53,100
What about your own dream?

985
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,920
Dreams can overlap, you know.

986
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,990
If I were to travel,

987
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:58,690
I'd sail a ship

988
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,380
along the canal to leave the country,

989
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:03,220
cruising along the coastline.

990
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,300
Greece is by the sea, right?

991
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,470
Yes.

992
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,420
Then I'll take wedding photos by the Aegean Sea.

993
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,870
They must look great.

994
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,020
Wedding photos?

995
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,730
With whom?

996
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,010
Certainly not with you.

997
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,950
You don't know that.

998
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,830
I said the shrimp is good.

999
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:29,840
Trust me.

1000
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:30,940
This restaurant is great.

1001
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,100
Welcome.

1002
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:33,510
Let's drink tonight.

1003
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:36,670
Go in.

1004
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,190
Wait, wait.

1005
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:37,950
Sorry.

1006
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,860
I-I made a mistake.

1007
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,070
It's not this restaurant.

1008
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,100
The shrimps here are very small.

1009
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,740
Let me take you somewhere else.

1010
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,560
Bye.

1011
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:54,870
Fenghua.

1012
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,070
Are you still using that plaster?

1013
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,220
Yes.

1014
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,730
My lower back hasn't been hurting much lately.

1015
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,400
Avoid heavy lifting.

1016
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:04,500
Don't stay up late.

1017
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:05,650
Eat meals on time.

1018
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,130
Brush your teeth with warm water.

1019
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,780
The foot bath water should be hot. You hear me?

1020
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:11,700
I got it. You nag even more than my mom.

1021
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:12,870
Bye.

1022
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:14,680
Well,

1023
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,900
wait for me a moment.

1024
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:26,990
Here, this is for you.

1025
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,750
What is it?

1026
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,550
Read it, and you'll know.

1030
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,070
Xia Fenghua,

1031
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:46,610
I sincerely invite you again

1032
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:48,220
to join Bee.

1033
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,240
Not interested.

1034
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:53,560
Why not?

1035
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:55,460
When I took over this station,

1036
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,390
it was almost going under.

1037
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,240
At that time, we were all at a loss,

1038
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,030
not knowing what the future held.

1039
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:05,850
People were leaving every day.

1040
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:08,700
At the toughest time, only four people were left.

1041
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,430
We didn't know where the next meal would come from.

1042
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,990
I was really scared.

1043
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,900
So I secretly set a goal for myself:

1044
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,030
within three years,

1045
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:19,020
I would not only keep this station running

1046
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,470
but also make sure everyone earned money,

1047
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:24,480
and I'd be the station chief of the year.

1048
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,960
That goal hasn't been achieved yet.

1049
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,880
I can't give up now.

1050
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,200
Compared to them,

1051
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,920
I need you more.

1052
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,430
Wanghe,

1053
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,850
I know you care about me

1054
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:39,150
and don't want me to push myself too hard.

1055
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,390
But it's okay.

1056
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,660
I'm quite happy.

1057
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,620
Being needed

1058
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:46,240
makes me feel powerful.

1059
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,510
All these years in Beijing,

1060
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,620
I've been like a wild grass,

1061
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,870
struggling to survive.

1062
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,520
Making it to today,

1063
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,110
I feel like

1064
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:58,950
I'm finally about to bloom.
