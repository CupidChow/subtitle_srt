174
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,420
How dare you bring that up?

175
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,280
It really upset me.

176
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,890
I'd have killed you guys if Wanghe didn't make it up to me.

177
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,560
How did he make it up?

178
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,390
He took me to Chris Lee's concert.

179
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,970
I bought tickets too.

180
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,350
When I arrived that day,

181
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,520
they said you two had just left.

182
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,140
If Chris Lee has another concert,

183
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,530
let's go together.

184
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,710
Sure.

185
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,170
Just the two of us.

186
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,620
No one else.

187
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:33,980
Fenghua.

188
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,950
If you ever get sick of Beijing, are exhausted,

189
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,730
and want to move back home,

190
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,180
I'll join you.

191
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,240
No matter where you go or what you do

192
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,490
in the future,

193
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,790
I'll be with you.

194
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,740
I haven't decided

195
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,030
if I'm moving back.

196
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,450
And I don't need your company.

197
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,450
I love being alone now.

198
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,230
Really.

199
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,240
So...

200
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,740
do you plan to stay single forever?

201
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,600
In the future...

202
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,240
I'll find someone

203
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,810
who really spoils me.

204
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,720
I'll go wherever I want.

205
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,480
New York,

206
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:29,560
Paris,

207
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:30,930
Maldives.

208
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,200
I'll do whatever I want

209
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,630
and eat whatever I want.

210
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,430
He'll send me flowers every day.

211
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,670
I can use his credit card as I please.

212
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,910
And our garage

213
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,870
will be overloaded with cars.

214
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,680
I hadn't seen much of the world as a kid.

215
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,300
Even getting free ice cream

216
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,640
made me happy.

217
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,400
Now that I'm grown up,

218
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,930
I think it's better to be more practical.

219
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,270
Am I right?

220
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,160
You're right.

221
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,390
Come on,

222
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,760
let's toast to

223
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,780
our future happiness.

224
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,270
Absolutely.

225
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,520
Still here?

226
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,420
Almost done.

227
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,510
There's still a market analysis that

228
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,910
Finance needs to review.

229
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,550
It's a day before New Year's Eve.

230
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,350
Not going back to your hometown?

231
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,750
I'll finish it and then drive back

232
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,650
right away.

233
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,850
Don't push yourself.

234
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,670
I'll stay with my mom for the Eve.

235
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,670
Let's drive back together on the 2nd or 3rd of the New Year.

236
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,400
Just spend time with your mom.

237
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,600
I need to go back.

238
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,150
I need to talk to Fenghua.

239
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,170
Can't you talk over the phone?

240
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,080
No,

241
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,320
I must talk to her in person.

242
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,100
Alright then.

243
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,630
Be careful on the road later.

244
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,560
I'll be off then.

245
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,030
Say hello to your mom for me.

246
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,940
Go home soon.

247
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:27,810
Drive safely.

248
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,180
Aunt Yan.

249
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,200
Wanghe, you're back for the New Year.

250
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,440
How did you come back?

251
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,720
By car or plane?

252
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,580
I drove.

253
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,250
Where's Fenghua?

254
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,600
Looking for her as soon as you're back?

255
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,700
That girl

256
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,450
came back without saying a word

257
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,500
and didn't wait for me.

258
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,500
So disloyal.

259
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,040
I know. That child...

260
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,390
It'd have been nice to come back together!

261
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,150
I'll call her. She's sleeping.

262
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,610
Fenghua.

263
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,590
Fenghua.

264
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:01,600
Fenghua?

265
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,000
Wanghe is back.

266
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,800
Still sleeping in.

267
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,770
When she wakes up,

268
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,290
I'll tell her to find you.

269
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,250
Still sleeping at this hour?

270
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,120
She went out drinking with Xingchi yesterday.

271
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,580
She came back at midnight.

272
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,200
Go rest at home.

273
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,830
You must be tired from driving.

274
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,830
Come here to eat when you're hungry.

275
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,480
I'll tell her to find you when she wakes up.

276
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,160
Alright.

277
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,440
I applied

278
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,570
for your leave with Meng.

279
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,100
Your year-end bonus was cut by 70%.

280
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,640
It doesn't matter.

281
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,790
I expected nothing anyway.

282
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,460
Save some for me.

283
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,400
You don't deserve it.

284
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,010
Because of you,

285
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,920
the delivery riders at Station 203

286
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,140
aren't getting year-end bonuses.

287
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,810
If you keep sneezing these days,

288
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,520
it's because they're cursing you behind your back.

289
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,430
Let them.

290
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,470
A few curses won't hurt.

291
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,960
How's Fenghua?

292
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,770
Didn't you two drink last night?

293
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:45,750
What's wrong?

294
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,600
I can't even

295
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,290
drink alone with her anymore?

296
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,070
She hasn't been feeling well.

297
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,970
What did you two talk about?

298
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,160
Can you tell me

299
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,859
what you two talked about?

300
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,180
Wash the dishes after you're done.

301
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,580
Fenghua.

302
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,920
Just got up?

303
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,830
Morning.

304
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,260
Did you...

305
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,480
drive back?

306
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:25,940
I drove all night.

307
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,470
Just got here this morning.

308
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,540
Are you tired?

309
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,140
I'm fine.

310
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,820
If you want to make it through the night,

311
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,020
you should take a nap.

312
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,350
Let's go somewhere tonight

313
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,550
to set off fireworks.

314
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,450
We'll see.

315
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,090
It's so cold. I don't feel like going out.

316
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,390
Get some sleep first.

317
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,450
I'm going to help out at my mom's shop.

318
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,330
Fenghua.

319
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,810
Are you...

320
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:05,950
feeling better?

321
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:08,830
Don't worry.

322
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,120
I'm already better.

323
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,070
This fatty is quite funny.

324
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,180
Come, come.

325
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:36,220
Fenghua.

326
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,350
Stop watching TV.

327
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:37,960
Hurry.

328
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,350
Let's have New Year's Eve dinner.

329
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,080
Careful, don't burn yourself.

330
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:41,640
Hurry.

331
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,120
Pour the wine.

332
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,730
Fenghua.

333
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,110
Aren't you hot wearing so much?

334
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,160
Don't you remember? You and your dad

335
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,590
saved up to buy this for me.

336
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,160
It's so precious, so I never wear it.

337
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,160
But I've to wear it for the New Year.

338
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,550
It's so festive for the New Year.

339
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,510
Red and prosperous.

340
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,200
Exactly.

341
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:57,960
Try the egg dumplings.

342
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,490
Let's...

343
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,510
have a toast first. Cheers!

344
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,720
Come on, come on.

345

355
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,920

397
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,130
Nothing's wrong.

398
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,370
Then why have you been avoiding me?

399
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,700
I haven't been avoiding you.

400
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,340

403

just tell me.

There's nothing to say.

407
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,640
I didn't want to say anything

408
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,500
in case I hurt you.

409
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,870
But since you've asked...

410
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,640
I really liked you before.

411
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,930
I've liked you since we were kids.

412
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,160
In my life,

413
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,690
I've only liked two people.

414
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,730
One is Chris Lee,

415
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:39,900
and the other is you.

416
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,290
But after we kissed that day,

417
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:48,180
I felt like everything fell apart instantly.

418
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,920
Fell apart?

419
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,050
Why?

420
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,070
I felt really deflated.

421
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:58,770
It felt meaningless.

422
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,140
I realized afterwards

423
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,290
that my liking you

424
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,540
was just a habit since childhood.

425
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,170
It wasn't my true feelings.

854
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,710
because I don't want to spend my family's money.

855
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:36,190
I want to rely on my own efforts.

856
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,810
But I can't wait any longer.

857
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,790
I'm almost 30 years old.

858
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,570
After all these years in Beijing,

859
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,230
among my college roommates,

860
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:47,030
even the least successful one lives in Swan Bay

861
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,190
and drives an X5.

862
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,440
But me?

863
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,040
I have to be alert every time I take a cab.

864
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,110
When there's traffic and the driver takes a detour,

865
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,280
I start to panic.

866
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,940
I'm a graduate from a top university.

867
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,840
I've won first-class scholarships.

868
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,820
Is this any way for me to live?

869
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:10,640
Being poor

870
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:13,030
is still the original sin, huh?

871
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,220
Haikuo.

872
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,430
I know you've been trying hard,

873
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:19,270
but I'm sorry.

874
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,900
I no longer have the time

875
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,980
or patience to chase after your empty promises.

876
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,260
Do you get what I'm saying?

877
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,260
Yes.

878
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,320
You again?

879
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,630
Officer Xia.

880
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:54,540
Didn't you get a proper job?

881
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,880
Why are you causing trouble again?

882
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,140
He deserved a beating.

883
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,540
If you were me, you'd have hit him too.

884
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,080
Don't tell me all that.

885
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,630
Tell that to your superior.

886
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,710
My superior?
