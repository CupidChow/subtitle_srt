Taking a look.

00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,370
At what?

6
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:10,720
Nothing.

I found him!

10
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,260
He's in that barbershop we just passed.

11
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:20,860
What's he wearing?

12
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,120
What does he look like?

13
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,590
I didn't really notice

14
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,300
what he's wearing.

15
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,560
He's big and burly,

16
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,240
and wearing a silver earring.

17

Okay. Go home.

Go home.

20
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,310
Was it you who led the attack on Xie Wanghe,

Yes. What about it?

23

Why did you guys beat him up?

24
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,480
I didn't like the look of him.

25
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,730
What's the problem?

26
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,320

00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,660
Always up to no good.

178
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,950
Causing trouble for me all the time!

179
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:56,850
Alright.

180
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,230
Stop shouting.

181
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:58,910
We're here.

182
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,490
Wanghe,

183
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,130
you have a visitor.

184
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,720
What's going on?

185
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,800
What's with all this racket?

186
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,820
No idea.

187
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,680
You know him, right?

188
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,500
I'm sorry, Xie.

189
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:42,890
I did wrong.

190
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,860
You beat him up like that,

191
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,300
and you think a simple "sorry" will do?

192
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,560
I won't beat him again.

193
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,880
If I break your bones

194
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,930
and casually say "sorry" to you,

195
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,020
will you let me off?

196
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,580
This is a society governed by law.

197
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,790
You've beaten Wanghe to this state.

198
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,760
If we don't accept mediation,

199
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,230
you'll end up in jail, you know that?

200
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,370
Did you hear that?

201
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,540
I did.

202
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,670
From now on, when I see Xie,

203
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,380
I'll keep out of his way.

204
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:12,910
Get lost!

205
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,030
I'm really sorry about this.

206
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,910
What's your problem?

207
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,790
Seriously.

208
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,590
Mr. Xie,

209
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:26,920
I'm really sorry.

210
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,100
If you need anything else later,
just let me know.

211
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,840
This kid came to apologize.

212
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,230
Maotian.

213
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,220
It's been a while.

214
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:38,950
I'm sorry.

215
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:39,950
My son...

216
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,550
Well, if you'll excuse me.

217
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,070
Okay.

218
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,190
Alright, we're done.

219
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:46,920
All settled.

220
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,720
You can go back now.

221
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,810
Uncle Xie.

222
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,310
Get lost.

223
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,550
Bye, Auntie.

224
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,080
Bye, Uncle.

225
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,940
What are you having?

226
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,950
Home-style tofu.

227
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:58,670
Tofu.

228
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,730
You had dinner yet?

229
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,700
I've got bread.

230
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,590
Fenghua.

231
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,990
Make sure he takes his meds.

232
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,560
They're paying

233
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,830
all the medical bills.

234
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,510
And that guy,

235
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,950
Hai,

236
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,150
is now in custody.

237
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,890
Let's consider this as settled now.

238
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,810
If we don't accept mediation,

239
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,470
they will have to pay even more.

240
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,670
We could send that guy straight to jail.

241
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,110
That would create a feud.

242
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,710
Not ideal.

243
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,830
You're very generous indeed.

244
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,090
If this happened to me,

245
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,830
my mom would try to kill them.

246
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,540
We used to run ships on the same canal.

247
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,780
There's no need to make things so tense.

248
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,030
Oh, Wanghe,

249
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,250
don't let your mom know about this.

250
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,720
Just tell her

251
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,140
you got injured playing basketball.

252
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,530
I was thinking the same thing.

253
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,260
Why?

254
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,710
Your mom would try to kill them.

255
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,700
So would my mom.

256
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,670
As if things aren't bad enough already.

257
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,600
Give me the meds.

258
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,910
Go home.

259
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,470
Wait.

260
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,730
Can you manage on your own?

261
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,780
I'll be fine.

262
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,810
Remember to take your meds.

263
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,370
Almost forgot my bowl.

264
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,160
Uncle, I'm off!

265
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,300
Dad.

266
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,620
Who is this Xie guy?

267
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,550
Why are you so afraid of him?

268
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:39,570
It's not fear.

269
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:40,870
It's respect.

270
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,350
Why?

271
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,400
When we were young and making a living on ships,

272
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,450
the upstream guys

273
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,450
ganged up on us.

274
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,270
Boss Xie decided it was too much

275
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,640
and risked his life to seek justice for us.

276
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,680
He had three ribs broken.

277
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:08,920
I owe him.

278
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,240
Many people on Flower Street

279
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,580
owe him.

280
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,250
The once much revered "Water Dragon King"

281
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,870
is now

282
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,370
like a piece of driftwood fallen from a ship.

283
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,940
Drifting aimlessly all day long,

284
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,870
without any direction for the journey.

285
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:52,740
My dad

286
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,430
is dejected.

287
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,730
My mom is sticking it out alone for the family.

288
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,500
I wonder

289
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,420
when this kind of life

290
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,390
is going to end for us.

291
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,670
Seven seven zero nine five.

292
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,610
This is the one.

293
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,030
Who are you

294
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,060
to get in the truck?

295
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,140
Chen has a fever.

296
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,240
I'm his buddy.

297
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:41,910
I'm covering

298
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:42,510
for him.

299
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,620
Why didn't he tell me about this?

300
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,680
You're Liang Haihong, right?

301
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,360
Yes.

302
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,320
Then there's no mistake.

303
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,220
So who should I spilt the pay

304
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,510
for this trip with?

305
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,390
Me.

306
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,240
Let's go.

307
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,740
You have the licenses with you?

308
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,580
Yes.

309
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:19,670
That's him!

310
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,540
What's the big occasion...

311
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,270
Xie Tiancheng!

312
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,339
Xie Tiancheng!

313
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,260
Xie Tiancheng!

314
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:26,599
Mr. Xie.

315
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,630
Our savior!

316
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,040
It was my mother-in-law who
jumped into the canal yesterday.

317
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,310
Our kid was misbehaving

318
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,430
and had a little argument with her.

319
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,150
We never thought she would take it so hard

320
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,110
and jump into the canal.

321
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,630
It was nothing.

322
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,030
If it weren't for you,

323
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,750
our family would have been ruined.

324
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,230
We're indebted.

325
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,020
Please, please, don't.

326
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,630
We're indebted to you.

327
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,910
Please get up.

328
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,510
I was just passing by and lent a hand.

329
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,630
It's nothing, really.

330
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,270
Sir.

331
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:59,460
[To Xie Tiancheng, for his bravery to risk his life to save others]

332
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,830
What are you doing?

333
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,170
What are you trying to do?

334
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,470
Come on.

335
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,370
It's not like you're still a virgin.

336
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,630
We're always out driving around.

337
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,360
I mean...

338
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,420
I wanted something exciting for us.

339
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,260
Get out.

340
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,600
I said get out.

341
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,940
You hear me? I'm asking you to get out!

342
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,990
Don't be unreasonable!

343
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,040
Don't you know

344
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,730
how old you are?

345
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,070
Stop being so pretentious!

346
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,430
I dare you to say that again!

347
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,150
I said what I said.

348
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:41,640
What are you doing?

349
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,960
I'm going to have my way with you today!

350
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,640
Who do you think I am?

351
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,840
What are you trying to do?

352
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,950
I'm so going to have my way with you today!

353
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,060
You wish!

354
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:47,940
How dare you!

355
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,060
Who do you think I am?

356
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,340
I'll let you have your way.

357
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,580
Get out, now.

358
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,010
Get out.

359
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,130
Open the door!

360
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,050
Open the door!

361
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,820
You're crazy!

362
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,510
How are you going to get to Changsha
by yourself?

363
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,620
Open the door. Come on, open it!

364
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,920
Open the door!

365
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:25,670
You...

366
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,430
Stop!

367
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,040
Stop now!

368
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,500
Stop!

369
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,850
Stop!

370
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,700
Stop!

371
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:37,680
[To Xie Tiancheng, for his bravery to risk his life to save others]

372
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:38,630
Hey, son.

373
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,780
Come out and take a look.

374
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,770
Is it beautiful?

375
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,170
Beautiful. Very beautiful.

376
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,210
Honestly,

377
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,400
can you be any more insincere?

378
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,050
You're back.

379
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,750
You're back. Let me.

380
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,300
Mom. You're back.

381
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,240
What happened to your arm?

382
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:23,720
I'm fine.

383
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,400
How did it happen?

384
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,620
I fell while playing basketball.

385
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,390
Right, Dad?

386
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:27,990
I'm fine.

387
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,960
I'll go back to my homework.

388
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,930
You're not a kid anymore.

389
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:30,930
I'm fine, really.

390
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,230
Listen,

391
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,370
it takes a lot of time to recover
from a fracture.

392
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,270
Don't mess...

393
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,580
I know.

394
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,560
Alright.

395
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,560
Come on.

396
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,420
[To Xie Tiancheng, for his bravery to risk his life to save others]

397
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:51,600
Well...

398
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:52,710
You went into the canal to save someone again?

399
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:55,320
I just happened to be there

400
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,990
and lent a hand.

401
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,740
Come have a drink with me.

402
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,510
It'll help get you refreshed.

403
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,410
Here.

404
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,270
You promised me before, didn't you?

405
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,640
Do you remember?

406
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,510
Do you remember what you promised me?

407
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,630
It's not winter now, right?

408
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:37,440
And it was by the canal.

409
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,760
There were lots of people around.

410
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,070
Lots of people?

411
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:39,510
There was no danger.

412
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,310
Why didn't anyone else get in there?

413
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,350
Only you could do that?

414
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,190
"Those who can swim drown, and those
who're stubborn get beaten to death."

415
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,350
Who is that saying meant for?

416
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,310
It's exactly meant for people like you.

417
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:46,670
Okay, okay, okay.

418
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,150
You know that?

419
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,540
From now on, when I see

420
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,150
someone fall into the water, I won't save them.

421
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,080
I'll just let them drown. Okay now?

422
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:57,780
Okay.

423
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,830
Do whatever you want from now on.

424
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,030
I won't nag you again.

425
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:03,870
I mean...

426
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:04,630
This makes no sense.

427
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,070
It was wrong of me to save someone's life.

428
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,910
It wasn't wrong.

429
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,150
You're a great hero.

430
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,900
I'm the one who's wrong.

431
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,030
If you have time to save other people,

432
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,190
have you ever thought about saving me?

433
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,110
Saving you?

434
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:20,890
From what?

435
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,150
You think I'm doing fine, don't you?

436
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:22,950
Are you not?

437
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,870
Every time I come back from a trip, I tell you

438
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,590
how much money I've made.

439
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,420
In your eyes, apart from being a bit tired,

440
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,950
I don't have any other problems, right?

441
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:39,750
Xie Tiancheng,

442
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,500
come on,

443
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,270
look at me.

444
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,490
Do I even look like a woman now?

445
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:44,910
Look!

446
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,850
I'm practically a man now!

447
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,910
Why am I

448
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,380
making myself look like this?

449
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,140
This is the only way for me

450
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,520
to be a bit safer out there.

451
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,860
Do you know that?

452
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,860
But I'm still a woman after all!

453
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,230
Now I'm out all day

454
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,420
on the highway from dawn to dusk.

455
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,480
Have you ever worried about me at all?

456
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,600
Have you worried at all?

457
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,490
During the day, when I'm out driving,

458
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:09,910
I...

459
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,630
I have to keep my eyes wide open like a cow,

460
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:12,750
not daring to be distracted for a moment.

461
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,670
But at night,

462
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,670
I'm torn between sleeping

463
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,830
and staying awake.

464
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,870
If I'm deep in sleep, someone might steal
my gas in the middle of the night.

465
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,690
If I sleep lightly, I might be
too tired the next day

466
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:20,510
to drive safely.

467
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,560
But even so,

468
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,270
when I'm half asleep,

469
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,310
there are still people who can

470
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,670
take advantage of me.

471
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:25,350
So tell me...

472
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,510
Hold on.

473
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,430
What did you just say?

474
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,430
Someone took advantage of you?

475
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,270
Who was it?

476
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,050
Tell me now.

477
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,590
Who?

478
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,640
Mom.

479
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,210
Mom, are you okay?

480
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:33,950
You.

481
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:34,960
Get away.

482
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,930
You get away!

483
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,820
Go on!

484
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,750
What are you doing?

485
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,310
Go on!

486
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,550
Xie Tiancheng, that's enough!

487
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,790
If you're mad, hit me!

488
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,760
Hit me!

489
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,200
Don't hurt my son!

490
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,650
Hit me instead!

491
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,380
Are you even a man anymore?

492
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,750
Do you know how dangerous it is for a woman

493
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,750
to do long-distance truck runs?

494
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,530
Do you know how hard it is?

495
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,390
If you were serious with the supermarket,

496
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,790
I wouldn't say anything.

497
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,810
But look at you.

498
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,110
Occupied with eating,

499
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,830
drinking,

500
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:04,870
and playing!

501
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,660
One month into running the supermarket
and you're losing money every day!

502
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,800
I printed out reference materials
on the retail industry for you.

503
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,060
Did you ever read them?

504
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,840
You come home and drink

505
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,510
until well past midnight every day.

506
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,940
You think you're the only one who's suffering?

507
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,670
You're the only one in the world
who's suffering?

508
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,010
Mom is out there on the road,

509
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,950
enduring it all alone for this family.

510
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,690
If you can't take care of her,

511
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:27,680
I will!

512
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,660
I can give up the college entrance exam!

513
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,530
I'll accompany Mom on her truck runs.

514
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,320
I'll protect my mom!

515
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,330
Son...

516
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:40,550
Haihong.

517
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,130
Breakfast is ready.

518
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,420
Haihong.

519
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:20,830
Haihong.

520
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:24,960
It's me!

521
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,780
It's me!

522
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,350
A nightmare, isn't it?

523
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,260
I've decided.

524
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,910
Starting tomorrow,

525
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,110
I'll accompany you on your truck runs.

526
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,440
For a woman,

527
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,270
this work is too hard.

528
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,890
I'm losing money

529
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,560
running that floating supermarket anyway.

530
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,990
And Maotian and his wife

531
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,020
are arguing about this all the time.

532
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,750
It'd be best if I

533
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:16,270
got out of this.

534
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,910
I've thought it all through.

535
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:24,490
At my age,

536
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,230
I can't really

537
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,220
accomplish much anymore.

538
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,720
Why are you crying?

539
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,810
What's wrong?

540
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,120
I don't want you to suffer.

541
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,630
How would I be suffering?

542
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,440
You're the one who's been suffering.

543
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,860
I'll try to get a driver's license too

544
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,910
sometime soon.

545
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,180
We'll bite the bullet for two more years.

546
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,510
We need to earn enough

547
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,410
for our son's tuition, right?

548
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,030
Right.

549
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,180
Let's eat.

550
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,080
I've made breakfast.

551
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,970
I'll go get the rice.

552
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,060
Wait for your mom.

553
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,800
From now on,

554
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,440
take good care of yourself.

555
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,320
Don't make us worry about you.

556
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,860
That would be a great help to us.

557
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,800
Understood?

558
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,290
Understood.

559
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,510
I promise not to upset the teachers.

560
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,600
Stay out of trouble and don't
go to internet cafes too often.

561
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,050
For meals,

562
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,840
go eat at Fenghua's place.

563
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,890
Don't upset her.

564
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,550
I'm not a three-year-old.

565
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,750
You can rest assured.

566
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,560
I actually wish you were three years old.

567
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,590
Dad.

568
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:58,810
What's this?

569
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:00,580
If you get bored,

570
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,490
have a listen for some amusement.

571
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:09,820
Well?

572
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,730
Are we ready?

573
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,190
Don't rush me.

574
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,060
We have everything now.

575
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:15,730
Son...

576
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,390
Let's go, come on.

577
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:18,880
Be good.

578
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:19,890
Come on, let's go.

579
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:20,760
Be good!

580
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:22,930
Be safe.

581
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,790
Drive slowly in the rain. Don't rush!

582
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:27,770
I know!

583
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,490
Take care of yourself!

584
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:50,610
What's wrong?

585
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,510
Nothing.

586
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,980
All good.

587
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,190
Just keep driving.

588
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:06,540
What's that?

589
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,130
Before we left, our son

590
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,770
gave me this tape.

591
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:11,940
He said I could listen to it on the road.

592
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,900
Why didn't you take it out earlier?

593
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,040
I forgot.

594
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:17,590
Okay, next up,

595
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,630
Xie Wanghe, a student from
Honghuai No. 7 High School,

596
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,429
has dedicated a song to his father.

597
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:22,750
This song is called

598
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:23,929
"Love You Dad."

599
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:25,600
Let's listen together.

600
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:37,230
♫Dad, you've got a big belly♫

601
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,239
♫A bad temper and no hair♫

602
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,440
♫You do not bend easily in life♫

603
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,310
♫You grow the hard way♫

604
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:43,960
Am I bald?

605
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,230
♫I'll be by your side♫

606
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:46,469
Isn't my hair still

607
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:47,070
right here?

608
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,949
♫Even though you're getting balder every day♫

609
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,690
♫I love you, Dad♫

610
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,750
It's just a song.

611
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,510
That's just one of the lines.

612
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,429
Don't take it so seriously.

613
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,730
♫I love you, Dad♫

614
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:08,950
♫I love you, Dad♫

615
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,190
♫Love your hair♫

616
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,830
♫I love you, Dad♫

617
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,870
♫Be sure to come home soon after work♫

618
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,760
Not bad.

619
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,350
Out of 17 calculation questions,

620
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,900
you only got two wrong.

621
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,470
Wanghe,

622
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:31,590
if you work a little harder,

623
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,320
you might really have a chance.

624
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,640
Remove the "might."

625
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,840
I definitely have a chance.

626
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,950
Do you think Siyi

627
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,430
is acting strange lately?

628
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,160
Remove the "Do you think."

629
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,960
Something's off with her.

630
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,640
Right?

631
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:57,620
Even though she's never been talkative,

632
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,860
she used to talk back when we teased her.

633
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,510
These past couple of days, she's been gloomy

634
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,770
and hasn't said a word.

635
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,440
I hope it's not because of her mom again.

636
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,830
Should I ask Fenghua to check on her?

637
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:09,860
That works.

638
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,350
Go get her.

639
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,300
I'll talk to her.

640
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,190
I, I, I...

641
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,520
Go, go, go. Hurry up.

642
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,690
Wanghe,

643
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,520
your math and English should be fine.

644
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,540
But your Chinese needs some work,

645
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,640
especially the writing part.

646
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,180
How do I work on that?

647
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,350
Maybe you could ask Xingchi's dad?

648
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:37,290
No way.

649
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,510
Uncle Shao can't speak without using archaisms.

650
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,770
It gives me a headache.

651
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:48,860
What?

652
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,430
Fenghua,

653
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,890
is something wrong with Siyi lately?

654
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,080
What's wrong?

655
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,830
She seems a little down.

656
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:57,550
She's not talking

657
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,500
or smiling.

658
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,410
Isn't she always like that?

659
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:01,440
Well,

660
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:04,490
I feel like it's been worse
these past couple of days.

661
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,470
Go ask her if everything's okay.

662
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:09,270
If there's anything wrong,
we can work it out together.

663
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,560
She shouldn't keep it to herself.

664
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,080
Go now.

665
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:13,710
Hurry up.

666
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:16,480
Mind your tone.

667
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,370
Go, go, go. Just go ask her.

668
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,160
Fenghua,

669
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,500
just go ask her.

670
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,540
Busy?

671
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,320
Not really.

672
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,480
Can we talk somewhere else?

673
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:30,910
Wanghe

674
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:31,950
asked me to ask you

675
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,550
if there's something going on at home.

676
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,420
Like what?

677
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,760
He thinks your mood has been off
these past couple of days.

678
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,870
He's a bit worried.

679
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:45,710
Oh.

680
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,020
Just "oh"?

681
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,330
What do you want me to say?

682
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,990
Why don't you come up with an excuse for me?

683
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,610
Actually, I'd like to know as well...

684
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,380
what's on your mind.

685
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,310
What can be on my mind?

686
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:16,160
I just want to focus on the college entrance exam.

687
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,630
Nothing else matters.

688
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,390
What about after the exam?

689
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,910
We can leave that for later.

690
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:29,120
I don't have time to think about
anything else right now.

691
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:30,880
I see.

692
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,640
What exactly do you want to ask?

693
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:47,990
Just say it.

694
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,680
So... do you like him?

695
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,240
The word "like"...

696
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,410
is too much of a luxury for me.

697
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,890
At least for now...

698
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,050
I don't deserve it.

699
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,070
As for you,

700
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,590
whether you see me as a rival or not,

701
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,490
I don't care.

702
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,370
I've always seen you

703
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:46,260
as my closest and best sister.

704
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,520
Other than my grandma,

705
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,410
you're the person I'm closest to.

706
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,210
If one day

707
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,840
we really fall out,

708
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:00,030
I hope it won't be over something so trivial.

709
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:03,540
What else then?

710
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:06,240
You really want to fall out with me?

711
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,010
Fenghua,

712
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,170
I have only one piece of advice for you.

713
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:21,550
Work hard, and then harder.

714
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,190
Always look straight ahead.

715
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,070
Don't look up to people.

716
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,460
Being humble is a disease,

717
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:29,750
a terminal one.

718
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,560
You'll understand when you're older.

719
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:48,110
Why are their lights off?

720
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,270
Come on now. Let's figure it out tomorrow.

721
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:22,470
You've been brushing your teeth there
for half an hour now.

722
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:24,310
Your teeth must be smoking.

723
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:25,730
Fenghua,

724
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,710
I waited for you till midnight last night.

725
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:31,050
Let me get that for you.

726
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,250
How did your chat go?

727
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:37,000
Come on, tell me what you two talked about.

728
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,890
Don't bother me, I'm so tired.

729
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:39,750
Just tell me.

730
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,710
Fenghua.

731
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:44,160
Siyi!

732
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,100
Wait for me!

733
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:45,780
Siyi.

734
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,040
I haven't got my backpack yet.

735
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,560
Move aside.

736
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:57,060
What did you talk about?

737
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,070
Are you not going with me?
