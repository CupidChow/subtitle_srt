175
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,330
But they haven't replied to me yet.

176
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,730
So I looked it up on their foreign website.

177
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,670
During the Qing Dynasty,

178
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,110
there were indeed quite a few merchant ships

179
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,510
traveling between China and Italy.

180
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,640
Some documents were destroyed during World War II.

181
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,909
However, some customs records still remain.

182
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,440
I think we can look into it.

183
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,440
We still need to know who those families are.

184
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,140
Thank you.

185
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,110
Be careful.

186
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,500
Don't we already know this?

187
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:44,710
Little Polo, right?

188
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,850
Mr. Zhou

189
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,940
the name Polo is very common in Italy.

190
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,480
It's like in our country,

191
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,310
if you go to the police station to look for someone named Wang Jianguo.

192
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,630
If you only know the person is called Wang Jianguo

193
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,610
and nothing else,

194
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,800
it would be exhausting to search.

195
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,650
Yes.

196
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,720
I have an idea.

197
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,830
Don't a few families

198
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,590
in the notebook have surnames?

199
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,960
Let's start with the

200
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,530
county records and family genealogies along the canal.

201
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,160
We can look for some clues.

202
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,250
Right.

203
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,310
Let's start by investigating our own families first.

204
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,120
I remember

205
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,820
our family has a genealogy book.

206
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,330
Let me make a call to my hometown

207
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,150
and ask them to make a copy and send it over.

208
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,020
Just the genealogy book might not be enough.

209
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,770
Let's also check if there are

210
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,770
any related old items in our own homes.

211
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,870
Like the old silver coins in our family.

212
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,600
We also have a shoehorn at home.

213
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,590
Ask your mom to check her side of the family.

214
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,230
But because of her work,

215
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,540
she moves a lot.

216
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,830
They might not have been able to keep old items.

217
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,250
I remember Xingchi told me

218
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,810
that the Xie family has a small wine flask, right?

219
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,420
The Xia family has one with a foreign language too.

220
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,990
Xingchi knows about it too?

221
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,850
We talked about it in Beijing.

222
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,030
He was so excited when he heard about it.

223
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,090
Said he'd give us great credit for it.

224
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,330
Did he say when he'll be back?

225
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,250
No, he didn't mention that.

226
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,380
Well, whatever.

227
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,790
Let's see how long he can hang in there for.

228
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,120
The kids have grown up.

229
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,120
Don't force them.

230
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,110
If parents are too strict,

231
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,490
it's easy to create resentment.

232
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,310
If he could be sensible

233
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,480
like Chen Rui or Haikuo,

234
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,640
I wouldn't worry.

235
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,220
As long as he doesn't cause trouble, I'm content.

236
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,110
Even if he stays at home all day,

237
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,270
doing nothing,

238
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,700
I'll be happy if he just lies around at home.

239
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,440
Shipping has resumed.

240
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,320
When can Boss Xie return to the river?

241
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,560
Master Zhou!

242
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,070
Ms. Bian.

243
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,040
What brings you here?

244
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,630
Do you have a moment?

245
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,240
I'd like to take up a few minutes of your time.

246
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,710
I have time.

247
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,350
You taught me a few quick dishes last time, right?

248
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,150
I tried them at home, but they didn't turn out well.

249
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,500
Why not?

250
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,010
It just didn't taste good.

251
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,220
I was wondering if

252
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,770
there was something wrong with my method.

253
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,190
I bought some groceries again today.

254
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,020
Please teach me.

255
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,080
Could you demonstrate it for me once?

256
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,030
Listen, Ms. Bian,

257
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,390
you're underestimating the complexity of cooking.

258
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,850
It's not that simple.

259
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,160
You need to learn gradually,

260
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,690
practice little by little.

261
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,030
When I first started learning to cook, it was the same for me.

262
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,240
My food wasn't good either.

263
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,320
I had to learn too.

264
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,810
I even had to find a master to teach me, right?

265
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,880
Then let me become your apprentice.

266
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,190
I've been really interested in cooking lately.

267
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,390
Please teach me.

268
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,210
I'm quite easy to teach.

269
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:53,960
Ms. Bian,

270
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,020
I think we should

271
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,710
stop beating around the bush.

272
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,110
Becoming an apprentice is fine,

273
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,130
but

274
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,480
I don't think we're a good match.

275
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,430
Well...

276
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,670
You haven't even tried.

277
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,760
How do you know we're not suitable?

278
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,650
There are many things about my situation that you might

279
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,680
not be aware of.

280
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,050
I

281
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,210
still want to wait for her a bit longer.

282
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,770
I know.

283
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,760
But she's been gone for a long time.

284
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,720
Master Zhou,

285
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,600
I think

286
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:30,290
you have the right to pursue your own happiness.

287
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:31,670
Are you saying

288
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,650
you plan

289
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,340
to just keep waiting like this?

290
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,730
Until when?

291
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,490
Don't tell me

292
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,570
you're going to wait your whole life.

293
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,960
I don't know if I'll wait for my whole life or not,

294
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,290
but I know if I stop waiting

295
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,960
and she happens to come back,

296
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,130
I'll definitely regret it.

297
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,880
Understand?

298
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:06,850
[Fenghua Express]

299
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,680
He, you're back.

300
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,630
Yes, I'm back.

301
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,270
Are you okay?

302
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,590
Is Auntie alright?

303
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,110
I'm fine.

304
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,490
It's nothing. Just a slight fracture, no big deal.

305
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,280
It's okay.

306
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,850
Come, come.

307
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:11,930
Thank you, thank you.

308
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,040
Go on with your work.

309
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,830
Take it easy.

310
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:15,620
Let me do it.

311
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,820
Fenghua.

312
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,860
Did you get all the medical checkups done?

313
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,560
Yes, we had X-rays taken.

314
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,680
It's nothing serious.

315
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,470
X-rays can only show bones.

316
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,710
You should've taken this opportunity

317
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,170
to have a thorough physical examination.

318
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,450
What's the point of a checkup?

319
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,550
I'm as fit as a fiddle.

320
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,030
You can't be too sure about that.

321
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,080
When I was young,

322
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,140
one of the neighbors in our courtyard,

323
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,190
an old lady,

324
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,130
she seemed fine normally,

325
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,400
but one day, she suddenly had a stroke.

326
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,470
That's not a very auspicious thing to say.

327
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,510
Let's not talk about it anymore.

328
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,610
Anyway, you need to be careful.

329
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,840
Find some time to get a full physical examination.

330
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,700
I got it, Fenghua.

331
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,050
Go back to your work.

332
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,380
Go.

333
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,030
Will you be alright?

334
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,290
Yes, yes, I'll be fine.

335
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:08,970
Hello, Fenghua.

336
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,750
Mom.

337
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,190
What's wrong? Is something the matter?

338
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,030
I miss Granny Ma.

339
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,460
Could you burn some joss paper for her later?

340
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,710
It's not Qingming Festival today.

341
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,670
I insist.

342
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,000
Alright, alright.

512
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,650
You won't do well here either.

513
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,310
You might as well go out and try.

514
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,510
That's not what I meant.

515
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,250
Enough. No need to explain.

516
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,300
If you want to go, then go.

517
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,870
A grown man

518
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,910
supporting his family is nothing to be ashamed of.

519
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,420
If you go to Bee and see Xie Wanghe later,

520
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,530
throw a pebble in his sandals for me.

521
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,060
When he eats instant noodles,

522
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,920
throw away his seasoning packet.

523
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,350
Old Mr. Zhou,

524
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,550
good morning.

525
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,600
Thank you.

526
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,830
You haven't had breakfast, have you?

527
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,030
Thank you.

528
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,300
Have a bowl of hot tofu pudding.

529
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,700
Thank you, thank you.

530
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,720
Um,

531
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,710
Does Mr. Zhou

532
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,020
have time recently?

533
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:21,870
Yes.

534
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,410
What's the matter?

535
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,800
Remember that Ms. Bian from last time?

536
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,110
He didn't like her, right?

537
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,050
Well,

538
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,670
I have found another one for him.

539
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:32,240
She runs her own company in the city.

540
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,670
She's capable in business and is beautiful too.

541
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:36,070
Her age is also suitable.

542
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,680
How about we

543
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,890
meet her sometime?

544
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,250
We'll see.

545
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,010
I think

546
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,240
Yanlin isn't very interested in this matter.

547
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,680
Why is that?

548
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,250
He probably hasn't moved on his heart.

549
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,150
Let him be.

550
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,260
Yanlin is

551
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:57,880
stubborn.

552
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,910
He doesn't listen to anyone.

553
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,020
I'll ask Granny Ma to persuade him later.

554
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,360
Granny Ma?

555
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,570
Before, when Yanlin

556
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,650
had a falling out with that Zhimei,

557
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,820
it was Granny Ma who reconciled them.

558
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,530
I'll find her later

559
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,110
to persuade Yanlin.

560
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:26,760
If you arrange more matches,

561
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,500
let Granny Ma take a look too.

562
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,060
She's good at judging people.

563
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:51,870
Who's in charge of the Haidian District's business now?

564
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,310
The data that we worked so hard to improve

565
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,860
has dropped so much.

566
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,180
It's my oversight.

567
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,630
For this week's requirements,

568
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,450
I assigned them to two of Mr. Xie's subordinates.

569
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:00,710
They're still in the adjustment period.

570
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,970
Are they adjusting or just slacking off?

571
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:03,990
Go

572
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,130
and tell those two to come see me now.

573
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,610
Now!

574
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,250
Alright.

575
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,800
Mr. Meng, they've arrived.

576
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,270
Mr. Meng.

577
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,650
What's going on?

578
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,500
I'm sorry, Mr. Meng.

579
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,990
It's my fault.

580
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,020
If you want to fire someone, fire me.

581
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,940
Fire you?

582
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,910
Who do you think you are?

583
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,530
Would firing you solve the problem?

584
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:42,970
Mr. Meng, I think

585
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,660
our strategy for dealing with Yuntu's subsidy war

586
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,710
still needs optimization.

587
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,510
Who's in charge of the strategy?

588
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,800
What's going on with Xie Wanghe?

589
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,550
He went to Tianjin.

590
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,400
His father is in the hospital.

591
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,860
What for?

592
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,870
Wanghe's father was stabbed while trying to help someone.

593
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,330
He's under observation in the hospital now.

594
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,670
Is his life in danger?

595
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,550
No.

596
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,110
Go.

597
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,000
Call Xie Wanghe and tell him to come back.

598
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,480
Tell him to come back today.

599
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,830
If he doesn't come back today,

600
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,180
don't ever come back!

601

How's your father doing?

He'll be discharged after two days of observation.

I wouldn't let you go?

They're still a bit green.

641
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,570
Yuntu is pushing hard.

The upcoming battle will be tough.

We can't keep up with the subsidies anymore.

646

They're hoping to force us to burn money.

Then the only option left is to shorten the delivery time.

Wanghe,

656
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:58,390
it's been almost three years since you graduated, right?

657
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,900
Since it's been almost three years,

658
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,110
you should understand what society is

659
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,640
and what a company is by now.

660
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,270
A company

661
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,760
is like a machine,

662
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,940
a precisely

663
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,750
structured machine

664
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,550
that runs on schedule.

665
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,190
Therefore, it cannot tolerate

666
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,210
any part malfunctioning.

667
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,820
But the parts aren't malfunctioning now.

668
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,670
Not keeping up with the machine's operating intensity

669
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,060
doesn't count as malfunctioning?

670
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,400
At 8,000 RPM,

671
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,090

Either fix it

00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:31,590
or replace it.

675
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,290

676
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,010
to reflect on it.

00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,800
Have Song and Qiu Lin

683
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,810
done anything these past couple of days?

684
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,180
Just some grumbling,

685
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,740
saying you left without notice,

686
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,470
that you don't care about the company, and such.

687
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:18,400
Basically, they've labeled you as unprofessional.

688
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,750
That's all they're capable of.

689
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,280
When I was canvassing, I heard from Yuntu's sales rep that

690
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,850
they've got a new

691
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,400
high-performance server.

692
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,690
The program is being upgraded

693
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,020
and will be online soon.

694
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,510
What's online isn't important.

695
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,550
The key is the offline delivery speed.

696
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,140
However,

697
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,460
in terms of the app,

698
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:43,210
Yuntu's user experience is indeed better than Bee's.

699
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,530
Then change it.

700
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,060
Who's stopping you?

701
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,810
I'm by myself.

702
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,820
Yuntuan has over a dozen people just on the UI team.

703
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,880
And they were all from big companies.

704
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,170
If you have ideas, write them down first.

705
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,920
I'll immediately give feedback to the programming department.

706
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,940
Haikuo wrote it.

707
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,900
He submitted it, but there's been no response at all.

708
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,400
If there's no response, then follow up.

709
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,770
We're nobodies.

710
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,120
What right do we have to push them?

711
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,520
The programming department acts like they're all big shots.

712
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,510
Do I have to handle everything myself?

713
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,430
What are you two here for then?

714
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,700
Should I canvass for you?

715
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,140
Should I code for you?

716
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:20,240
Maybe I should collect your salaries for you too?

717
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,430
The delivery time

718
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,430
needs to be shortened further.

719
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,770
How is that possible?

720
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,960
How do you know it's impossible if you haven't tried?

721
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,790
We've already shortened the delivery time

722
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,830
by five minutes.

723
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,520
That's all squeezed out of the delivery riders.

724
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,900
Squeezed?

725
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,110
Are they not earning more money?

726
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,430
Did I force them to work overtime?

727
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,970
Cut the crap.

728
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,140
If you want to do it, do it. If not, get lost!

What does he mean?

00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,960
What's he trying to say?

731
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,400
He was talking about the delivery riders, not you.

732
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,450
As if I'm willing to work for him?

You came here and didn't say anything.

It's not me.

780

It's market demand.

781
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,469
The volume of food delivery orders is much larger than that of express delivery.

782
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:52,730
It's normal for people to go where

783
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:53,989
the wage is higher.

Going public is just the first step.

788
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,080
The real challenge comes after that.

789
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:19,190
We have to fight to the bitter end.

790
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,150
We need to dominate this market,

00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:29,620
you should be very rich, right?

795
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,370
Money doesn't matter.

00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,360
It just needs to be enough to spend.

797

but mostly, I wish you well.

808
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,070
I think if you really made it big,

809
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,290
you could help us out.

810

Even if there were no real benefits,

811
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,560
we could at least brag about it.

812
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,040
You know Xie Wanghe, right?

813
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,680
He's my childhood friend.

814
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,980
We lived across from each other.

815
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,520
We could even hear each other sleep talking at night.

816
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,890
Alright, I'll work hard then.

817
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,930
In the future, if you get drunk at a dinner party,

818
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,420
just video call me.

819
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,070
I'll definitely answer.

820
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,630
I'll greet each of them.

821
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,270
You'll definitely look impressive.

822
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,670
That day will never come.

823
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:40,880
Why?

824
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,060
I need to stay away from a company that doesn't treat

825
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,090
its employees as human beings.

826
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,620
Or else I'll have bad karma.

827
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,710
Did they call you?

828
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,270
I don't need them to tell me.

829

this past half year.

832

Let me say something harsh.

833
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,530
Even Emperor Qin wasn't as ruthless as you when he was building the Great Wall.

834
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:16,750
Capital has its demands.

835
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,520
Once we've raised funds, we must expand rapidly.

836
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,880
We need to seize the market.

837
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,400
The market is only so big.

838
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,670
If we don't grab it,

839
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,160
others will survive instead.

840
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,070
I don't want to become

841
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,350
a stepping stone for others' success.

842
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,590
You won't be.

843

You already have the potential for success.

844
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,320
Cold-bloodedness.

845
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,310
You say that too?

846
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,750
What do you all mean?

847
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:41,980
Don't be angry.

848

All you've ever thought about since childhood was success.

851
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,720
I guess you got what you wanted.

852
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:20,470
Then what do you think I should do?

853
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,270
Increase the commission?

854
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,240
Reduce pressure?

855
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,600
Should I be a philanthropist

856
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,800
and have everyone wait to die together?

857
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,170
I don't care about others,

858
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,910
but don't be too harsh

859
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,910
on my old employees.

860
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,670
Don't just drink.

861
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,740
Eat something.

862
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,780
He's under a lot of pressure too.

863
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,170
Who isn't under pressure?

864
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,270
When I resigned,

865
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,780
Xiaohui disagreed with it from the bottom of her heart.

866
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,170
Why did she disagree?

867
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,810
For startup companies,

868
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:33,870
only one or two

869
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,550
in the same category can survive in the end.

870
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,940
Bee just raised its Series C funding,

871
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,530
but the money is almost burned through.

872
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:41,400
If it's burned through, just raise Series D then.

873
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,460
You think raising funds is that easy?

874
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,350
Each round dilutes the shares.

875
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:47,010
When shares are diluted to a certain extent,

876
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,160
and you can't go public,

877
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,640
you can only sell to a big company.

878
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,610
By then, the management will all be replaced.

879
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:52,750
Wanghe has equity.

880
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,120
Even if Bee is acquired, he won't lose out.

881
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,040
I know you want to talk about us two.

882
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,370
That's not what I meant.

883
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,590
You had a proper career before,

884
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,800
so you feel like you've lost out.

885
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,970
I had nothing,

886
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,430
so even if we fail,

887
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,390
I don't feel like I've lost anything.

888
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,990
We have different mindsets.

889
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,360
I just feel that...

890
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,930
Wanghe has changed.

891
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:25,070
That's normal.

892
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:29,810
Before, we were brothers.

893
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:30,970
Now, he's the boss.

894
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,580
We look at issues from different angles.

895
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,400
So what if he's the boss?

896
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,370
Does being a boss mean he can be unreasonable?

897
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,780
Can he just run his mouth without any consideration?

898
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,210
If this was back in the day,

899
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,480
someone like Wanghe would…

900
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,320
Enough.

901
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:46,680
Has your grandpa's spirit possessed you?

902
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,420
I really want to go to his house right now.

903
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,240
What for?

904
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:57,920
I...

905
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,190
I... I want to stuff chewed gum

906
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,610
into his keyhole.

907
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:03,840
I…

908
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,630
I'll go too.

909
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,760
I'll put cockroaches

910
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,430
in his bed sheet and quilt cover,

911
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:08,840
and pull out the fuse.

912
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,490
Eat something.

913
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,140
Boss!

914
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:22,760
Give me a pig brain.

915
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:23,570
Sure thing!

916
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,940
Nourish your brain and appease Xiaohui.

917
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:44,740
Open the door.

918
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,270
Who is it?

919
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,810
It's me, your dear old dad.

920
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:47,960
My dear old dad?

921
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,360
We don't have anyone like that here.

922
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,200
Cut the crap and open the door.

923
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,470
I'm holding in my pee.

924
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,270
Apologize.

925
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,350
What should I apologize for?

926
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,500
"If you want to do it, do it. If not, get lost."

927
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,690
Who said that?

928
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,860
I wasn't talking about you guys.

929
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,730
That won't do.

930
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,710
Haikuo and I are both law-abiding citizens.

931
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:05,950
We don't associate with reactionary bullies,

932
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,420
landlords, or capitalists.

933
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,840
Are you going to open it or not?

934
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,260
What can you do if I don't?

935
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:17,090
What are you doing?

936
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:22,670
Stop it.

937
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,670
Are you crazy?

938
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:42,550
My bladder was about to burst.

939
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,570
You really drank the Latour?

940
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,490
What's Latour?

941
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:54,830
Do you know?

942
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:56,040
I don't know.

943
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,140
Never heard of it.

944
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,610
Not a drop left for me.

945
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:06,230
You're sitting on my leg.
