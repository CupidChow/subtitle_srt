173
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,000
It doesn't matter. Just take it as doing a good deed.

174
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,620
What would you like to eat? It's my treat.

175
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,080
What are you thinking about?

176
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,310
Nothing.

177
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,890
Worried about Fenghua?

178
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,930
She always shares the good news but never the bad.

179
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,760
This is the first time she's surrendered

180
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,010
and said she's tired.

181
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,740
How much pressure can there be in the express delivery industry?

182
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,850
If she can't handle it,

183
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,390
she should just reduce the delivery areas.

184
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,610
Fenghua has quite a few people working under her.

185
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,890
If she can't afford to pay them, she should fire them.

186
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,170
She's running an express delivery business, not a charity.

187
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,550
She's soft-hearted.

188
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,690
She likes to take on everything.

189
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,790
She spoils all her subordinates.

190
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
Everyone says she's nice.

191
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,470
She bears all the pressure alone.

192
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,780
This can't go on forever.

193
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,760
If she wants to bear it, let her.

194
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,910
When she can't handle it anymore,

195
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,950
she'll naturally let it go.

196
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,950
When that time comes, we'll help her

197
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,070
with whatever she needs.

198
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,110
We'll make sure she doesn't suffer or go poor.

199
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,730
But she's feeling wronged right now.

200
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,070
That's her own doing.

201
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,440
When I went to Bee,

202
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,820
I wanted her to come with me.

203
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,700
The salary would have been much higher than now.

204
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,510
With me there,

205
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,180
I could have taken care of her if anything happened.

206
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,490
She absolutely refused to do it.

207
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,150
Why?

208
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,820
Because she couldn't let go of those employees.

209
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,210
And what happened?

210
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,820
Other companies offered 300 yuan more per month,

211
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,390
and those people left without a second thought.

212
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,420
Fenghua got wasted

213
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,960
and came to my doorstep at night, sobbing,

214
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,670
asking me how much she was worth.

215
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,330
Why was 300 yuan was enough to betray her?

216
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,610
What could I have said?

217
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,780
It was her own fault?

We were all worried about you before.

Xie Wanghe begged me.

259
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,890
I had to give him some respect, at least.

I begged you too.

But you didn't give me respect.

Wanghe is indeed having a tough time now.

He's under a lot of pressure.

Now, everyone in the company

is waiting for him to fail.

266
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,900
I went over with Haikuo

267
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,270
to help him.

268
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,360

280
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,910
I'm afraid I'll wake up one day

281
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,050
and all my employees will be gone.

282

287

Don't let him do anything reckless.

for the sake of performance.

290
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,640
When he was doing ground promotions with Haikuo before,

291
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,980
he dared to climb over the wall into a school in broad daylight.

292

00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,310
Are things not going well at work?

510
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,800
A few more employees jumped ship today

511
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,340
to Bee.

512
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,190
Why?

513
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,100
It pays better than this.

514
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,460
You can't leave.

515
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,640
Ms. Xia has been good to our family.

516
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,250
As long as she's here,

517
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,280
we can't leave.

518
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,300
Got it?

519
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,850
Stop drinking.

520
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,110
Stop drinking. You've been at it all night.

521
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,340
I'm afraid if she still doesn't think of a way,

522
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,410
we'll have to close too.

523
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,470
When that happens,

524
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,020
what are we going to do?

525
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,610
Our whole family will end up living under a bridge.

526
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,880
When I first came to Beijing,

527
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,150
I loved seeing the lights from all the households.

528
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,960
I thought that as long as I worked hard,

529
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,630
one day,

530
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,270
I could have

531
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,000
my own home here too.

532
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:36,850
But

533
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,150
after working hard all these years,

534
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,700
I realized that

535
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,520
in this place that seems to have infinite possibilities,

536
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,660
everyone is being held hostage

537
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,400
by cruel competition.

538
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,870
As for me,

539
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,360
I'm just an insignificant person.

540
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,280
I can't change anything.

541
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:13,560
Wanghe.

542
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,270
Mr. Meng.

543
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,750
I've brought you the liquor you wanted.

544
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,220
You're really willing to give it to me?

545
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,140
What are you talking about?

546
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,320
I've even given you the car.

547
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,720
A bottle of liquor is nothing.

548
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:22,860
From now on,

549
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,180
just take whatever you like.

550
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,680
As long as you all can help me

551
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,730
completely take over Haidian District,

552
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:29,740
I'll even drive you all

553
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,330
to and from work every day if you want.

554
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,710
I wouldn't dare.

555
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,550
Then let's wait

556
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,640
until we've completely taken over Haidian

557
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,720
and drink this at the celebration party.

558
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,510
Alright.

559
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,430
Let me formally introduce you all.

560
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,150
Zhou Haikuo.

561
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,370
Shao Xingchi.

562
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,070
Hello.

563
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:45,620
Mr. Meng.

564
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,340
Hello.

565
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:48,800
Hello.

566
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:52,060
The three of us grew up together since we were babies

567
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,820
in the same courtyard.

568
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,480
Then I must toast to you all.

569
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,200
One hero needs three helpers, right?

570
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:58,870
Come.

571
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,610
Resigning is not a small matter.

572
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,480
Have you really thought it through?

573
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,820
Although Bee is on a roll,

574
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,000
the food delivery industry is so competitive.

575
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,700
I think it's hard to say if they can even survive.

576
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,690
But I'm happy doing it.

577
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:21,670
How should I put it?

578
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,870
It feels like

579
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,150
as soon as I open my eyes every day, I really want to work.

580
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,970
I just want to keep charging forward.

581
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:27,890
And working under Wanghe,

582
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,060
I feel like there's something to look forward to.

583
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,450
Wanghe really has charisma.

584
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,690
You all just do whatever he says.

585
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,950
What, are you jealous?

586
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,610
I just think he's really good at sweet-talking people.

587
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:41,390
It's like he's on a constant adrenaline rush.

588
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:44,160
People like him should do sales.

589
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,820
You know what?

590
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,870
if he did sales, he'd definitely get rich.

591
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,560
When we were in high school,

592
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,870
he even had our homeroom teacher and the principal

593
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,670
under his thumb.

594
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:59,130
He set up a test prep center and caused chaos.

595
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,920
He had endless energy back then.

596
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,980
Childhood friendships are precious,

597
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:10,390
but after growing up, you still have to rely on yourself.

598
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,610
Then I'll just refuse to grow up.

599
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,570
Friends walk together for life.

600
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:24,540
Those days won't come again.

601
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,610
One promise for a lifetime.

602
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,590
One lifetime of friendship.

603
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:34,780
One cup of liquor.

604
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,090
Let's drink.

605
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,500
Cheers!

606
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,710
Come on, come on.

607
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,540
[A lifetime of friends, you'll understand]

608
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,340
[You'll get hurt and feel pain]

609
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,550
[You still have to go, you'll still have me]

610
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,440
Fenghua,

611
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,740
after they arrived,

612
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,710
things have been smooth for us.

613
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,660
We're going to take over

614
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,280
Haidian District soon.

615
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,650
If you want to join now, it's not too late.

616
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,950
Is this why you called me here?

617
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,260
Celebrating our success is priority.

618
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,720
Poaching you is second.

619
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,130
I know

620
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,540
you can't let go of your employees.

621
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:13,540
Fenghua, if you're willing to come,

622
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:15,450
I'll take all your employees.

623
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,490
To do what?

624
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,030
To do food delivery.

625
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,140
What else?

626
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,800
I trust the people you've trained.

627
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,460
I'm telling you,

628
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,380
the income from food delivery

629
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,110
will definitely be much higher than express delivery.

630
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,120
It's a win-win.

631
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,310
What if I refuse?

632
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,760
Why would you refuse?

633
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,310
I'm not interested. Is that okay?

634
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,190
Why aren't you interested?

635
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,880
Alright, alright.

636
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,490
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

637
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,650
If you really don't want to come, I can't force you.

638
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,000
But you should at least tell me your actual situation.

639
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:57,920
Why?

640
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:02,100
I came here today for entertainment,

641
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,850
but you insist on talking business.

642
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,050
Okay, let's not talk about it.

643
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,930
Let's sing and drink.

644
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,100
What are you doing?

645
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,090
Are you stealing oil?

646
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,480
Stop!

647
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,230
How dare you steal oil?

648
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,060
Stop!

649
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,500
Stop!

650
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,740
How dare you steal oil?

651
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,180
You dare to steal oil?

652
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,360
Boss!

653
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,750
You dare to steal oil!

654
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,390
Go, go, go!

655
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,060
Little rascals!

656
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,060
Stealing oil?

657
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,800
Boss, what's wrong?

658
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:37,800
I was too careless.

659
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,890
Help!

660
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,750
Help!

661
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,770
Help!

662
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,520
Someone, help!

663
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:54,610
Mom?

664
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,570
Is he okay?

665
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,110
Okay, okay, I got it.

666
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:02,950
I'll be right there.

667
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,100
What happened?

668
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,940
My dad was stabbed while driving long-distance.

669
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:07,290
He's in emergency care at Tianjin Hospital now.

670
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,310
I need to get there quickly.

671
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,340
You've been drinking. How can you drive?

672
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,090
Substitute driver.

673
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:13,950
What?

674
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,170
Give me the car key.

675
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,050
You can't go.

676
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,700
You and Haikuo need to stay here.

677
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:20,850
It's a critical moment now.

678
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,150
We need to watch out for Qiu Lin and Mr. Song.

679
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:23,370
They might cause trouble.

680
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,030
Where are you going?

681
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,140
I have an emergency.

682
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:25,820
I'm sorry.

683
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,030
Let's meet again next time.

684
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,300
You two, be safe.

685
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,370
Drive carefully!

686
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,910
My dad, I swear,

687
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,660
he still gets so worked up over nothing at his age.

688
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,770
I can't stand him.

689
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,370
When you see him, watch your language, okay?

690
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,900
Don't start arguing again.

691
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:52,090
If he's the one causing trouble, can't I say something?

692
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:53,880
When people get old,

693
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:54,990
they're like children again.

694
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,300
They get agitated when you scold them.

695
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,810
Why isn't Grandpa Zhou like that?

696
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:01,040
He's always so gentle and mild-mannered.

697
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,540
Your dad has a good temper too.

698
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,390
I've never seen him talk back.

699
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,130
My dad does talk back.

700
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,580
He just mutters it so others can't hear it.

701
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,440
I think

702
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,680
I should take this opportunity

703
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,340
to get them both to stop working

704
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,320
and retire soon.

705
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,300
Why should they retire?

706
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,940
I'm capable of supporting them now.

707
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:25,390
They'll be happy that you're making money,

708
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,430
but their generation really can't stand being idle.

709
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,340
It's even more impossible for them to be comfortable spending their children's money.

710
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,260
Why?

711
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,700
Their joy comes from showing off.

712
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,180
The more successful their children are, the happier they are.

713
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,240
A couple of years ago,

714
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,690
my mom used to complain to me.

715
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,270
She said,

716
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,910
"When will I be able to enjoy the fruits of your success?"

717
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,320
Later, when I made some money and bought her jewelry,

718
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,670
she yelled my ear off.

719
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:52,470
She said, "You should've saved this money for your dowry.

720
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,050
Your father and I are still young.

721
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,440
You don't need to worry about us."

722
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,770
How old are they?

723
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:58,840
Still think they're young, huh?

724
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:03,510
It's precisely because they've reached this age that they can't admit to being old.

725
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,220
Otherwise, they'd really be old.

726
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,620
Let's go a bit faster.

727

You two came together?

731
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:42,940
Well, I had some drinks,

732
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:43,820
so I couldn't drive.

733
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,870
How's my dad?

734
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,270
Don't worry, the doctor said he's fine now.

735
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,719
He got a dozen stitches on his stomach.

736
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,989
What happened?

737
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,810
Someone was stealing oil.

738
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,120
Your dad acted like the Good Samaritan

739
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,880
and pushed the thieves too far.

740
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,219
It's okay now.

741
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,690
The doctor said he was treated in time.

Which ward?

In the blink of an eye,

you've grown into a young lady.

751
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,590
You shouldn't just focus on your career.

752

At your age, you should be looking for a man.

Pressuring for marriage is a traditional New Year activity.

It's not New Year yet.

With the information he's researched,

00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,460
he could change careers and open a matchmaking agency.

Yes.

keep an eye on Wanghe for me.

Yes, that's right.

Fenghua refuses.

786
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,670
Why? Is it because the pay is too low?

00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,240
It's not about the money.

788

Then it's about feelings?

Actually, Fenghua didn't have to come to Beijing.

Besides this,

Wouldn't there be many more opportunities?

If she came, she and Wanghe would be superior and subordinate.

Wouldn't that completely ruin any chances for them?

Does Wanghe know about this?

803

You're the one who's sick.

00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:00,620
What's wrong with having a fight?

848
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,220
He was reckless.

849
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,340
Can't I say that?

850
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,710
That's just how your dad is.

851
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,020
He loves to meddle and stand up for others.

852
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,150
He doesn't think he's wrong,

853
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,430
but you insist on him admitting his mistake.

854
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,710
Isn't that just asking for a fight?

855
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,960
If he would listen, that'd be fine.

856
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,390
The problem is that he can't change.

857
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,260
Even if he can't change, he has to.

858
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,200
Fine.

859
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,070
Go ahead inside.

860
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,260
You two have a fight.

861
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,640
Beat him into submission, then force him to admit he's wrong.

862
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,950
Is this how you're supposed to give advice?

863
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:36,970
Eat.

864
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,510
I bought it for your mom.

865
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,060
Have you eaten already?

866
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,060
I'm full from anger.

867
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:50,210
Don't provoke me.

868
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,550
Why didn't you bring me a bottle of water?

869
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,360
Serves you right.

870
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,680
The remaining few businesses have all signed as well.

871
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,370
The task has been completed successfully.

872
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,660
Good job.

873
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:18,780
Where's Mr. Xie?

874
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,910
He had something to attend to.

875
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:22,520
He went to Tianjin.

876
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,360
Why?

877
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,130
We're in the middle of a fierce battle with Yuntu right now

878
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,230
and he took time off?

879
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,980
Does he not have any sense of organizational discipline?

880
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,090
His father was hospitalized.

881
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,390
So what if his father was hospitalized?

882
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,950
Even if his father were dying right now,

883
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,860
he couldn't just leave without saying a word.

884
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:38,330
Just let us know if there's anything that needs to be done.

885
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,620
We'll handle it.

886
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,310
These past few days,

887
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,700
our market share has indeed increased,

888
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,370
but the number of orders has decreased.

889
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,510
That's impossible.

890
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,460
So what if you had successful street canvassing?

891
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,440
So what

892
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,540
if you signed agreements

893
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,910
with all the merchants?

894
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,560
The merchants aren't placing orders now.

895
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,660
What can you two do about it?

896
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,390
Why aren't they placing orders?

897
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,330
Yuntu has increased their subsidies.

898
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:01,670
They're subsidizing an average of three yuan per order.

899
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,090
They're crazy.

900
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:05,000
How long can they keep burning money like this?

901
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,220
That's why I've been telling you all along

902
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,460
to quickly apply to headquarters

903
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:08,890
for us to increase our subsidies as well.

904
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,480
Mr. Xie won't agree to that.

905
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:14,190
For him to disagree,

906
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,470
he has to be here, right?

907
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:17,190
We can't just stand by and watch

908
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:19,070
as Yuntu takes our territories one by one,

909
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:20,700
without even the strength to fight back.

910
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:21,990
Isn't that embarrassing?

911
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,670
What will the entire industry think of us?

912
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:25,740
Alright.

913
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,440
How about this?

914
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,270
Let's put the subsidy issue

915
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,540
on hold for now.

916
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:32,160
Let's do what we can.

917
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:34,220
Continue to optimize the delivery process,

918
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,040
and further reduce the delivery time.

919
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:38,000
Further reduce it?

920
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:38,550
We're already at the limit.

921
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,630
Leave it to us.

922
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:41,020
We'll figure something out.

923
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,880
We'll give our all for the company.

924
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:46,440
We can't.

925
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:49,120
Hurry up.

926
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:54,560
Brother-in-law,

927
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:56,090
the illness

928
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,900
of Mr. Xie's father happened

929
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,450
at quite an opportune time, didn't it?

930
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,370
Stop looking.
