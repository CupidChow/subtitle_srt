00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:34,470
Right,

174
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,090
our family isn't well-off,

175
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,480
but your father and I can figure something out.

176
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,480
It's not your time to earn money now.

177
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,179
Don't you understand, Son?

178
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:44,169
But when my dad was my age,

179
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,270
he was already fishing in the river to help support the family.

180
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,550
That was a totally different era, okay?

181
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,470
Back then,

182
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,020
how many high school graduates were there in the whole country?

183
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,880
What about now?

184
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,420
Someone like you

185
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:57,050
wouldn't even be qualified to be a security guard at a factory.

186
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,870
-Mr. Xu, you…
-Mr. Xu?

187
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,910
What brings you here?

188
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,190
Come on in. Come on in.

189
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,590
Wanghe, you're back.

190
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,890
Hurry up and make some tea.

191
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,130
Please, have a seat.

192
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,590
Mr. Xu, please have a seat.

193
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,210
Alright.

194
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,490
Please, sit.

195
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,450
Is his leave request ready?

196
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,660
Yes, it is.

197
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,510
Wanghe went to Beijing to see an exhibition this time.

198
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,390
He didn't even inform you teachers.

199
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,700
Please excuse him.

200
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,760
-I'll go...
-What exhibition?

201
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,670
I went to Beijing to rent servers.

202
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,510
Mr. Xu.

203
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,720
Thank you.

204
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,500
Thank you.

205
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,470
Wanghe's mom, please sit.

206
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,390
Wanghe, you sit too.

207
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,190
Sit, sit.

208
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,630
Wanghe's mom.

209
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:01,950
The reason I came here

210
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,030
is to have a good talk

211
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,120
with you parents.

212
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,500
I want to know your honest thoughts.

213
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,210
Feel free to say anything.

214
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,050
There's no need to hold back.

215
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,600
Sure. No problem.

216
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,040
This kid has been willful and disobedient since he was little.

217
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,040
It's all my fault. I've spoiled him.

218
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,380
This time, he skipped school to go to Beijing

219
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,040
without telling either of us.

220
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,670
His father and I were both furious about it.

221
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:25,480
Right.

222
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,830
The principal was furious too.

223
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,140
But we all know Wanghe is a good kid.

224
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,720
If it were someone else,

225
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,120
the punishment would at least be a warning.

226
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,220
Wait.

227
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,570
Are you saying

228
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,770
this time,

229
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,210
there won't be any punishment?

230
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,190
Are... Are you serious?

231
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,750
Great! Many thanks to the principal.

232
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,870
Thank you, thank you.

233
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,750
Come on, say thank you to your teacher.

234
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,230
I traded my business plan for this.

235
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,160
What plan could you possibly have?

236
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,390
Thank you.

237
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:56,850
It's nothing.

238
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,880
Wanghe is very smart.

239
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,030
It's just he prefers certain subjects over the others.

240
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,310
When he treats math, physics, and chemistry exams seriously,

241
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,870
he gets pretty good grades.

242
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,830
It's just his Chinese grades are a bit unsatisfactory.

243
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,800
I think

244
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,040
if Wanghe starts working hard

245
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,950
from now on

246
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:12,810
and makes a final sprint,

247
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,670
it's not impossible for him to get into university.

248
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,950
Really?

249
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,310
Mom, don't listen to his nonsense.

250
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,150
Shut up.

251
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,480
Mr. Xu, please continue.

252
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:24,850
Once,

253
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,450
Wanghe fell asleep in class.

254
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,450
I scolded him,

255
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,840
saying "Rotten wood cannot be carved."

256
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,470
"Rotten wood"

257
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,100
means deadwood.

258
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,300
It's useless.

259
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,880
This is what Confucius

260
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,310
said to his student Zai Yu when he scolded him.

261
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,540
It's a famous quote.

262
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,190
The main point was to express his anger at the student's lack of effort,

263
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,850
hoping he could put his mind on the right things.

264
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,870
As soon as I finished speaking,

265
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,110
Wanghe

266
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,070
raised his hand and stood up.

267
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,350
He gave me a long speech,

268
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,590
providing examples to explain

269
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,980
that even rotten wood

270
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,710
has its own value and uses.

271
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,720
He gave more than ten examples.

272
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,070
When I heard that,

273
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,360
I realized each example

274
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,470
could develop into an industry.

275
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,240
Many of his classmates were stunned.

276
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,840
Just wait until your father gets home.

277
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,990
Wanghe's mom, the reason I'm telling you this

278
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,520
is to let you know that

279
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:19,150
I believe Wanghe is very talented.

280
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,310
As long as he starts working hard now,

281
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,170
it's not too late for everything.

282
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:23,790
I mean it.

283
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,310
What?

284
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,270
You don't have confidence in yourself?

285
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,310
Do you know

286
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,430
Google?

287
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,430
Yes, I do.

288
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,830
The best search engine in the world.

289
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,460
When Google started,

290
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,310
Yahoo was already there,

291
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,450
which was the world's number one search engine,

292
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,970
an internet giant.

293
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,070
Even Silicon Valley investors tried to dissuade Google,

294
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,630
saying that with Yahoo ahead,

295
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,030
they'd have no future.

296
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,930
But they didn't give up.

297
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,110
They persevered in the search engine field

298
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,030
and carved out their own space.

299
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,230
Let me ask you,

300
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:13,970
what was the key

301
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,590
to their success?

302
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,320
Technology, I guess.

303
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,410
And what's the source of technology?

304
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,940
Knowledge.

305
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,250
And

306
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,660
deep thinking.

307
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,790
In terms of mere knowledge,

308
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,600
I believe with your IQ,

309
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,030
even if you study at home,

310
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,020
you can still manage.

311
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,800
But systematic learning

312
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,830
can help you establish

313
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,910
a scientific and effective thinking framework in the shortest time.

314
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,450
It's like the foundation.

315
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,050
How tall a building can be

316
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,330
depends on how deep its foundation is,

317
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,060
right?

318
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,980
Last time,

319
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,730
you mentioned that ebony wood

320
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,180
is priceless.

321
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,510
It was a great point.

322
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,400
But have you thought about this?

323
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,770
For a tree to become ebony wood,

324
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,220
it's not just about the passage of time.

325
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,820
First, it has to be a tree,

326
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,490
and it has to grow well.

327
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,470
If it were green foxtail,

328
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,050
even after thousands of years,

329
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,410
it still wouldn't become ebony wood.

330
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:20,970
Right?

331
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,910
Mr. Xu, this...

332
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,830
This is great.

333
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,690
Did you hear that?

334
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,080
Mr. Xu was praising you,

335
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,760
saying you're promising.

336
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,850
Mr. Xu.

337
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:37,970
Did you hear that?

338
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,450
You must study hard.

339
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,820
If you don't study well,

340
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,130
your dad and I will beat you up together.

341
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,100
Mr... Mr. Xu.

342
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:49,370
Please take extra care of him at school.

343
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:56,480
Alright.

344
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,550
I'll also count on you, Wanghe's mom.

345
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,650
After all, with the support of parents,

346
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,000
we teachers

347
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,630
can do more with less,

348
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,350
right?

349
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,130
Sure. Sure.

350
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,920
P-Please take extra care of him.

351
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,110
Well,

352
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,390
since we're not at school after all,

353
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,520
we don't know what's going on in there.

354
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,270
If he misbehaves at school,

355
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,790
just discipline him as needed.

356
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,950
His father and I

357
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,820
don't mind.

358
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,370
But Mr. Xu does.

359
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,490
Alright, I'll be on my way.

360
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:27,380
Alright.

361
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,130
Thank you for everything.

362
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,390
Goodbye, Mr. Xu.

363
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,520
Alright, goodbye.

364
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,600
I won't hit you,

365
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,900
but with your father's temper,

366
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,760
you better think about what to do.

367
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,770
Mr. Xu has left?

368
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:58,450
Yes.

369
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,520
How was it?

370
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,820
Are you two alright?

371
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,740
You owe us both a beating.

372
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,670
How was Beijing?

373
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,270
It was alright.

374
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,800
Did you go to Zhongguancun?

375
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:08,790
I did.

376
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,290
It's not quite what I imagined.

377
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,620
Don't leave already.

378
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,580
Tell us about it.

379
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:15,390
How's it different from your imagination?

380
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,010
Before going to Beijing,

381
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,860
I thought I was smarter than everyone else.

382
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,470
I thought I could see further into the future than anyone.

383
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,890
But after I got there, I realized

384
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,540
there are too many smart people.

385
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,560
Taking a stroll around Zhongguancun,

386
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,470
I saw graduates

387
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,450
from top universities across the country

388
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,880
all struggling

389
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,900
and working hard.

390
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,510
Everyone already knows

391
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,780
those little tricks I learned online,

392
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,510
and they're already putting them into practice.

393
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,570
Only after going there did I realize

394
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,810
I was just like a frog in a well.

395
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,750
So what are you thinking now?

396
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,100
I haven't figured it out yet.

397
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,970
I think

398
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,660
maybe you should give it a shot

399
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,390
and try to get into university.

400
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,830
Even if it's not for your parents,

401
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,620
you'll have more options in the future.

402
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,420
That's right.

403
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,800
With your brains,

404
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:04,960
if you really work hard for the exam,

405
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,790
you could at least get into a second-tier university.

406
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,920
Is it a matter of taking the exam or not?

407
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:11,760
Given my family's situation,

408
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,130
and Siyi...

409
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,150
Siyi is going to try to get enrolled in a normal university, which is tuition-free.

410
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,329
Your dad should be able to make some money

411
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,740
from selling the ship.

412
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:25,560
When our parents tell us

413
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:26,859
they're doing things for our own good,

414
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:28,150
isn't it really annoying?

415
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,430
It's the same the other way around.

416
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,500
When you do things for your parents' good,

417
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,750
don't they get annoyed too?

418
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,700
They do.

419
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,320
Don't take this the wrong way,

420
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,710
but what you're doing

421
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,600
is called emotional blackmail.

422
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,470
Why are you wearing so much in this weather?

423
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,600
Are you going to the North Pole or what?

424
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,970
Wanghe is definitely going to get a beating tonight.

425
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,140
Your Uncle Xie said

426
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,050
he wanted to teach him a lesson.

427
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,670
I have to try to stop it a bit,

428
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,200
right? We can't let the kid get hurt too badly.

429
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,280
He won't.

430
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,790
Do you think Wanghe is the type to take a beating quietly?

431
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,160
If it really hurts,

432
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,310
he'll beg for mercy.

433
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,480
There are things you don't know.

434
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,040
Your Uncle Xie has been

435
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,810
in a bad mood lately.

436
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,030
I'm worried he might not stop once he starts beating him,

437
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:58,860
unable to control himself.

438
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,860
He's in a bad mood?

439
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,800
Are you really going to sell the ship?

440
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,550
How do you know?

441
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,610
My mom told me.

442
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,230
Has Uncle Xie agreed?

443
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,030
Business hasn't been good lately.

444
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,660
After selling the ship, we'll see if we can

445
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,960
find something else to do.

446
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,390
Besides seafaring,

447
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,620
what else can you do?

448
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,460
Why would you say that?

449
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,590
You're looking down on me, aren't you?

450
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,890
Let me tell you,

451
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:33,360
Fenghua, back in the day, your Uncle Xie and I

452
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,070
traveled all over the country.

453
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,230
We've done so many businesses,

454
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,990
like electronic watches and foreign cigarettes.

455
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,450
You don't know how many of those we bought and resold.

456
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,470
We even ran a video hall once,

457
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,670
showing Hong Kong and Taiwan films, action movies, and romance movies.

458
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,190
Your mom loved watching those the most.

459
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,970
What nonsense are you talking about?

460
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,630
It was "The Legend of the Condor Heroes", right?

461
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,130
We did whatever was profitable back then.

462
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,060
So why can't you do it now?

463
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,270
Well...

464
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,980
It's not that we can't do it now.

465
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,660
But after all, times have changed.

466
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,780
right?

467
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,430
We need to find a new way to make a living.

468
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:11,670
In recent years, so many people lost their jobs,

469
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,150
but I haven't seen anyone starve to death.

470
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,710
Dad.

471
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,540
I actually have an idea.

472
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,300
You don't have to sell the ship.

473
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,250
Really?

474
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,160
If this idea can be implemented,

475
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,950
Uncle Xie won't feel so bad anymore,

476
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,550
and Wanghe might be able to avoid this beating.

477
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:46,170
♫Girl, you sit on the bow♫

478
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,530
♫I tow the boat on the shore♫

479
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:55,160
♫In deep love♫

480
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:56,810
Bro.

481
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,540
You went drinking again.

482
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,340
Lao'er.

483
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,260
You're still up?

484
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,430
Yeah.

485
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,430
There's something I want to discuss with you.

486
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:08,390
Be careful.

487
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,100
Alright.

488
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,090
Go ahead.

489
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,310
Here's the thing.

490
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,650
It's my daughter's idea.

491
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,250
A floating supermarket.

492
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,110
That is to say, we stock up on goods

493
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,510
and sell them on the ship.

494
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,770
We can make extra money

495
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:22,790
while seafaring.

496
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,280
It'll be killing two birds with one stone, right?

497
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,590
Let me finish, bro.

498
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,170
Tell me, how many seafaring ships

499
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,150
are there on the river now?

500
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,900
Talking about setting up a floating supermarket.

501
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,710
Who are you going to sell the goods to?

502
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,410
You'd be better off setting up a roasted sweet potato stand by the roadside.

503
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,160
It would be more profitable than this.

504
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,950
It's not like that, bro.

505
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,480
About this matter,

506
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,670
Yan also thinks we could give it a try.

507
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,390
You're listening to

508
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,670
women's opinions now?

509
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,470
Don't worry.

510
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,760
Even if we can't do seafaring business anymore,

511
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,330
as long as you stick with me,

512
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,820
you won't be poor.

513
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,280
How did it go?

514
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,150
He didn't agree?

515
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,790
I'll talk to him again later.

516
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,490
How about we ask Wanghe to talk to him?

517
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:19,500
He's quick-witted.

518
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,280
When it comes to making money,

519
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,480
I think Uncle Xie will listen to him.

520
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,860
Why bother talking to him?

521
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,590
He used to make the call on everything on the ship,

522
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,820
and now we still have to listen to him about opening the supermarket or not?

523
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,280
It's none of his business!

524
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,240
We're so poor that we can barely put food on the table.

525
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,240
If we still don't have any income in the near future,

526
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,780
the whole family will be left with nothing to eat.

527
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,800
What's wrong with you?

528
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,630
Why are you saying these things

529
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,710
in front of our daughter?

530
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,750
You're just too easily swayed.

531
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,780
You're a grown man, yet you don't have your own opinions.

532
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,210
You always listen to Boss Xie on everything.

533
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,380
Who's listening to him?

534
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,240
You just won't let it go, will you?

535
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,990
This is ridiculous.

536
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,390
Don't go in yet.

537
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,270
I have something to ask you.

538
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,730
Wait until I'm done beating him up.

539
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,220
You're not listening to me anymore, are you?

540
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,340
Wanghe mentioned his idea of dropping out of school

541
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,880
to you before, right?

542
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,440
He mentioned it briefly.

543
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,300
Why didn't you tell me about it?

544
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,030
Well,

545
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,190
I didn't expect him to just

546
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,250
go through with it.

547
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:21,610
Wanghe said

548
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,810
you didn't object at the time.

549
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,560
Is that true?

550
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,240
But I didn't agree either.

551
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,710
What kind of talk is that?

552
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,910
Xie Tiancheng, what were you thinking?

553
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,100
Are your brains damaged from all the drinking?

554
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,870
It's his last year of senior high.

555
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,240
You can't wait for such a short time?

556
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,450
You even said we were both useless,

557
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,660
and we'd need our son to provide for us.

558
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,910
What were you thinking?

559
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,290
What kind of talk is that?

560
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,470
What are you talking about?

561
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,230
This... You...

562
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:42,950
Let me beat him first.

563
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,630
Don't beat him.

564
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,950
Beat me instead.

565
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,630
I deserve to be beaten.

566
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:45,950
What are you doing?

567
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:46,710
I don't earn money,

568
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,950
and I failed to raise our son well,

569
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,230
making him worry about the family.

570
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,130
Beat me. Beat me.

571
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,200
Just beat me to death.

572
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,830
Dad!

573
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,800
Mom!

574
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,030
I'm sorry.

575
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,270
I was wrong.

576
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,380
I was wrong!

577
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,060
What are you doing?

578
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,030
Get... Get ready.

579
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:13,830
If you

580
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:17,410
truly realize your mistake,

581
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,850
make up for the time lost.

582
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:25,870
Don't make your mother worried and angry anymore in the future.

583
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,490
Dad.

584
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,030
Aren't you warm?

585
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,570
I am. I am.

586
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,480
Let's go.

587
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,590
Haihong.

588
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:52,790
Why did you get up so late?

589
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,250
Do you know what time it is?

590
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,050
Yan.

591
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:02,010
I have something to tell you.

592
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:02,760
Go ahead.

593
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,960
I don't want to run my stall anymore.

594
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,010
Why?

595
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,390
There are too few customers, so I can't make enough money.

596
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,290
I want to get a driver's license

597
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,420
and go drive a truck.

598
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,120
Are you out of your mind?

599
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,140
Is truck driving a job for women?

600
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:19,720
I've asked around.

601
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,360
Zhang who lives at Flower Street has a truck.

602
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,970
He's sick and can't drive long distances anymore,

603
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,230
so he rented his truck to a transport company.

604
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,640
He complains that the rent is too low.

605
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,920
I've talked to him,

606
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,650
and once I get my driver's license, I'll rent his truck.

607
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:35,250
I'll rent his first, then buy my own after I've made enough money.

608
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,840
This is no small matter.

609
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,280
Have you discussed this with your husband?

610
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,030
I'm not discussing it with him.

611
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:46,050
He won't agree to this kind of thing.

612
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,600
I'll get the license first.

613
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,620
And once I start driving and making money,

614
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,040
it'll be too late for him to object.

615
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,890
As long as it's your decision,

616
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,210
I'll support you.

617
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,490
Oh, right.

618
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,530
Don't worry about Wanghe's meals.

619
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,790
I'll take care of them.

620
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,390
Then I...

621
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,760
I'll thank you in advance.

622
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,240
Don't worry.

623
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,440
Also, one more thing.

624
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,270
Don't tell anyone about this for now.

625
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,270
Understood.

626
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,270

629
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:23,140
There's something I want to tell you too.

630
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:23,930
Well,

631
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,670
I've discussed with my husband Maotian,

632
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:29,530
and we're planning to open a floating supermarket.

633
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,990
Can you make money from that?

634
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,570
Fenghua looked it up online.

635
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,680
It should work.

636
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,790
It's just we'll have to work harder.

637
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,760
We'll have to work from dawn to dusk.

638
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,990
As long as you can make money,

639
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,060
a little hardship is fine.

640
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:42,660
Just do it.

641
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,120
We've got plenty of strength, right?

Be careful. It's very hot.

683
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,720
Our Ma family's braised meat

684
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,260
is a secret recipe passed down through generations.

685
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,490
Do you really want to learn it?

686
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,230
I do.

687
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,910
Then you'll have to marry into our family first.

688
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,430
Then I'll learn it too.

I've loved Granny's braised meat since I was little.

Once I've learned it,

692

I won't starve wherever I go.

So I must learn English well.

Otherwise, when the time comes,

717

I won't even be able to understand financial statements.

718

If I go out to raise funds and meet a foreigner,

719
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,550
I won't even last one round.

If you really think like that,

you might as well work on other subjects too.

723
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:44,820
And while you're at it, get yourself into a Project 985 university.

No, it's not that.

729
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,470
But this is too sudden, isn't it?

730
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,820
How did you come to this decision?

731
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,400
It's just that one day,

732
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,980
you'd suddenly realize that besides studying,

733
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,540
there's nothing else you can do.

734
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,600
Mr. Xu is also to blame.

735
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,760
During the home visit, he went so far saying good things about me.

736
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,200
He gave my parents hope.

737

Anyway,

738
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,890

why don't you give it a shot too?

745
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:01,050
By then, we'll all be admitted to universities in Beijing,

746
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:03,110
and you'll be the only one left at home.

If you get in,

00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,960
I'll set up a breakfast stand at your school gate.

752
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,630
I'll tell everyone I meet that I was your first love,

753
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:25,870
and I was abandoned by you.

but a truck runs thousands of kilometers on the highway,

Nice.

Now we know what it means to shoot ourselves in the foot.

864
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,350
Wanghe.

865
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:35,750
Actually, you could

866
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:36,990
continue working on the intelligent question bank after our college entrance exam.

867
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,300
I can't think that much right now.

868
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,650
I can't focus on two things at once.

869
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:41,010
The top priority now is that

870
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:42,580
I have to catch up on the coursework

871
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,150
I missed in the first two years.

872

No matter what, I can't get lower grades than Xiaopang, right?

Give it a rest.

874
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,020
I could score higher than you with my eyes closed.

Not necessarily.

876
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:52,880
Wanghe got full marks on that function word problem yesterday,

can do after graduating from high school?

She won't be able to get into college.

I'm so worried.

891

we can't let her set up a stall like we do.

That's for sure.

895

If she starts setting up a stall like us at such a young age,

We'll hand them over to the Public Security Bureau

and let them decide whether what you did is illegal or not.

Don't worry.

They wouldn't risk losing their business over 10,000 yuan.

Anyone with half a brain wouldn't do that.

Rob us? Kidnap us?

1003
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,440

Eat up.

00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:57,350
♫At moonset cry the crows♫

1020
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:54,360
Don't be stubborn.

1021
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,830
Just do as I say.

1022
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,690
How much do you think she makes in a day?

1023
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,230
Who cares how much money she makes?

1024
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:04,390
As long as she treats Fenghua's father well.

1025
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:08,120
♫Streaking the frosty sky♫

1026
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:06,910
Granny, Auntie.

1027
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,470
When did you arrive?

1028
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,280
We just got here.

1029
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:11,830
Fenghua.

1030
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,220
It's only been a few years since we last saw you,

1031
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,860
and you've grown so much.

1032
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,700
Girls really do change a lot as they grow up.

1033
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:19,630
♫Dimly lit fishing boats♫

1034
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,470
I remember back then, Sister-in-law, your daughter

1035
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,910
was only about this tall,

1036
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,150
and now she's grown so tall.

1037
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:23,750
She's getting uglier as she grows.

1038
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,150
Not even as good-looking as she was when she was little.

1039
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:30,390
♫Sadly lie beneath maples♫

1040
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,070
Back then, she still looked like a girl.

1041
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:27,790
But now,

1042
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:28,590
look at her.

1043
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:30,630
What did she do to her teeth?

1044
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,320
She's doing great, okay?

1045
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,390
Just the other day, someone invited her to shoot a commercial.

1046
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,590
They even wanted to sign her as a model.

1047
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,080
Her, a model?

1048
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:40,190
She even shoot commercials?

1049
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,320
What kind of commercial?

1050
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,100
Pig feed?

1051
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,590
Mom, where's Dad?

1052
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:47,010
♫Beyond the city wall♫

1053
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:45,670
He left early this morning.

1054
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,930
Do you need something?

1055
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:49,980
What are they doing here?

1056
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,700
What else? Of course for money.

1057
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:58,070
♫From Temple of Cold Hill♫

1058
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:53,380
They called last time,

1059
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,350
saying the village was going to build two-story houses,

1060
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:56,510
all part of a unified plan.

1061
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:59,110
Just different ways to trick me out of my money.

1062
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,430
Who's that child?

1063
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:02,450
Who cares? It doesn't matter.

1064
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:04,840
I'm not giving them a single penny this time.

1065
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:09,470
♫The sound of bells in the midnight♫

1066
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:06,270
If they really push me too far,

1067
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:07,640
I'll flip the table on them.
