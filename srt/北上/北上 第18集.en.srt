[Episode 18]

3
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,750
There's some more here.

4
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,180
Here.

5
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,850
I forgot I left it in my pocket.

6
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,200
Boss, Haihong.

7
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,870
You haven't eaten?

8
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,829
This is not much.

9
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:18,910
You can use it first.

10
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,990
No, no.

11
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,829
You need it yourself too.

12
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:22,270
No.

13
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,350
No, take it.

14
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,190
Boss.

15
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,030
This matter

16
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,420
happened because of this 10,000 yuan.

17
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,890
As her mother, I made a mistake.

18
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,829
I didn't stop her

19
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:32,329
from doing such a stupid thing,

20
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:34,010
implicating Wanghe.

21
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,040
Wanghe did it for Fenghua.

22
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,390
So take it.

23
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,420
Saving the child is more important.

24
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,310
As you know,

25
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,430
our money is on the goods.

26
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:42,960
Yes.

27
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,840
Yes, we...

28
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,230
Gathering money?

29
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,730
Here.

30
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,430
What are you doing?

31
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,829
You always meddle when something happens.

32
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:52,150
Your money didn't fall from the sky.

33
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,910
No, it's an emergency.

34
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,390
Why are you talking so much?

35
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,590
Take it. I'm leaving.

36
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,860
Don't worry, Haihong.

37
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,550
Sorry.

38
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,180
We're really sorry.

39
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,030
Don't worry.

40
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,750
Yanzi.

41
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,990
Let's stop at that.

42
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,350
I won't stand on ceremony.

43
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,190
I'll take

44
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,310
this money.

45
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:11,310
Also,

46
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,910
I remember

47
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,430
everyone's kindness.

48
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,430
We'll pay you back later.

49
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,430
No need.

50
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,110
We should pay for it.

51
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,870
Don't worry.

52
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,190
Eat first. Your health is more important.

53
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,190
I'm leaving.

54
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,430
Hurry up and eat.

55
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,310
Give it a count.

56
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,350
How much?

57
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,230
Siyi.

58
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:38,950
Grandma.

59
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,790
This is 2,000 yuan.

60
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,750
It's not much.

61
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,150
It's just to show our sincerity.

62
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,230
Take it to Ms. Liang.

63
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,829
Go.

64
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,750
I can't take this.

65
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,270
You owe too much. You don't want to live anymore?

66
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,110
We are lending this to you. Not like you're not returning this.

67
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,910
Right?

68
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,110
We're live in the same courtyard, I'm not afraid of you running away.

69
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,390
Pay me back when you have money.

70
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,050
Don't pay it back if you don't.

71
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,950
Thank Mr. Shao for me.

72
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,550
Alright, go back.

73
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,340
Siyi, you're here.

74
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,020
Aunt Liang.

75
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,850
Grandma asked me to bring 2,000 yuan here.

76
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,230
Take it back.

77
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:17,910
Take it back.

78
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,149
Grandma said it's our sincerity.

79
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:20,640
We got it.

80
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,150
But bring the money back.

81
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,150
Take it.

82
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:23,990
Bring it back.

83
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,990
Tell Grandma

84
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,070
when I leave to drive the trucks,

85
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,950
allow Wanghe to have meals at your place.

86
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,510
We'd appreciate that.

87
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,310
Yes.

88
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,150
Take it.

89
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,000
Bring it back.

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,200
Siyi, they've got us.

91
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,700
Go back and tell Grandma.

92
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:36,310
We're here. Don't worry.

93
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,480
Go back in.

94
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,530
Be good.

95
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,830
Reassure your grandma.

96
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,360
They've got us, you don't have to do anything.

97
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,270
Granny...

98
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,420
Let's go back.

99
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,970
That's all?

100
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,880
It's about 100,000 yuan. There's a long way to go.

101
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,740
Then let's

102
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,980
borrow more.

103
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,590
Anyway,

104
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,740
I'll go drive with you.

105
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,620
Let's earn it slowly.

106
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,180
We can pay them back no matter what.

107
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,110
I've borrowed everything I could.

108
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,140
Who else can I look for?

109
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,400
It's not enough.

110
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Can you give me another 20,000 yuan?

111
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,170
I'm afraid you won't be able to pay back more than that.

112
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,350
By driving the truck,

113
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,880
I earn about 100,000

114
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:35,390
I can make quite a lot of money.

115
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,150
I'll pay you back the principal and interest together when the time comes.

116
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,210
Not a penny less!

117
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,440
It would be better if you had some collateral.

118
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,030
It's not that I don't trust you,

119
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,030
but I need to explain it to my family.

120
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,580
How about this?

121
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,930
At home,

122
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,950
I have two pieces of gold jewelry.

123
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,590
You can have them as collateral. How's that?

124
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,300
Fly!

125
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,510
Fly!

126
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:23,980
Fly!

127
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,940
Fly!

128
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,930
The big plane is taking off!

129
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:32,950
Grandma,

130
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,070
I'll take you to fly over the Pacific Ocean.

131
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,900
All right, let's fly over the Pacific Ocean.

132
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,860
Play by yourself.

133
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,790
I'm tired. I'll take a rest.

134
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,230
Okay.

135
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,030
Go play.

136
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,830
I'm going to hit you!

137
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:52,950
Fly!

138
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:53,720
Fly!

139
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,170
Fly!

140
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,670
Fly!

141
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,280
Take my

142
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,310
punch!

143
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,830
Take my kick!

144
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:23,710
Oh no!

145
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,450
My hand has fallen off.

146
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,290
Lao'er even went to ask Fenghua's aunt.

147
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,590
It's still not enough.

148
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,170
We still have a lot to go despite adding it all together.

149
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,480
They said

150
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,070
they didn't have much money left.

151
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,470
They said they're going to go borrow money.

152
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,909
Who knows how much they can borrow?

153
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:40,850
Don't borrow money from loan sharks.

154
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,070
With the interest,

155
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,180
you could go bankrupt.

156
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,520
Haihong must have gone to borrow money.

157
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,680
She can do anything

158
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,380
for Wanghe.

159
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,220
This morning,

160
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,000
I saw her leave Flower Street.

161
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,190
She was in a hurry.

162
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,909
What should we do?

163
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,850
I saw those who borrowed from loan sharks

164
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:58,560
would have their houses

165
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,320
taken away in the end.

166
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,140
Those people

167
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,050
have no conscience, they smash and burn everything.

168
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,560
They can do anything.

169
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,550
Exactly.

170
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,420
One can never repay their high-interest loans.

171
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,890
Even when Wanghe's released from jail,

172
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,030
he'd still have to shoulder this debt.

173
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,110
Then this child

174
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,740
will be doomed.

175
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,280
Wanghe only took on this matter for Fenghua's sake.

176
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,880
Look at the mess we're in now.

177
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,150
Watch this.

178
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,970
How dare you hit me!

179
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,280
Watch me turn into a fighter jet too!

180
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,309
Siwei, Grandma is resting.

181
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,390
I'll take you to Fenghua's house for some treats.

182
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,110
Okay.

183
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:44,010
To Fenghua's house!

184
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,390
Can you keep an eye on him for me?

185
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,150
I need to go out and take care of something.

186
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,930
Make sure you do your homework properly.

187
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,260
What are you going to do?

188
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,150
Grandma is sick.

189
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,030
She can't cook.

190
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,800
You're in charge of his dinner.

191
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,600
Sister.

192
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,810
Siyi.

193
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,960
What's wrong?

194
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,060
Is your offer to lend me money still valid?

195
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,940
Of course, it still stands.

196
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,870
I have over 30,000 in my account.

197
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,000
How much do you need?

198
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,090
20,000.

199
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,740
I'll pay you back with bank interest later.

200
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,270
No need.

201
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,780
No, I've already–

202
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:51,830
Let's do it your way, okay?

203
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,810
All right, I'll go get my card.

204
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:53,570
Wait for me.

205
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,520
Sis.

206
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,320
Sis?

207
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,240
Fenghua!

208
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,770
I want to go see a movie.

209
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,120
"Iron Man."

210
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,220
It's interesting.

211
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,240
Everyone in my class has seen it.

212
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,910
I'm the only one who hasn't.

213
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,120
Have you finished your homework?

214
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,610
Yes, I have.

215
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,550
Let's go then.

216
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
I'm going to see "Iron Man"!

217
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,780
Hurry up!

218
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,020
Slow down, slow down.

219
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,190
Sister, the Iron Man in there...

220
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,500
Ms. Liang.

221
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,850
Please take this money.

222
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,120
Get Wanghe out quickly.

223
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,980
We can't let this affect his college entrance exam.

224
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,200
Where did you get so much money?

225
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,470
I didn't steal nor rob,

226
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,010
don't worry.

227
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,870
It's within my personal means.

228
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,730
No.

229
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:02,700
You must explain clearly where this money came from.

230
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,150
Ms. Liang,

231
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,590
Wanghe's grades have improved rapidly recently.

232
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,690
If nothing goes wrong,

233
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,390
he will definitely get into college.

234
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:10,990
At this time,

235
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,450
freedom is the most important thing for him.

236
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,000
You don't need to see me out, Ms. Liang.

237
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'll be going now.

238
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,240
Get some rest early.

239
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:33,730
Grandma.

240
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,550
I'm back.

241
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,590
Grandma, have you had dinner yet?

242
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,350
Grandma?

243
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,470
Grandma!

244
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,940
Granny.

245
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:14,040
[Police]

246
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:22,960
Thank you.

247
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:32,890
[If you admit your mistake, you can turn over a new leaf.]

248
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,350
Uncle.

249
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,530
I'm sorry.

250
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,720
[If you admit your mistake, you can turn over a new leaf.]

251
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,010
You need to use your brain when you do things in the future.

252
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,140
[If you admit your mistake, you can turn over a new leaf.]

253
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:45,470
Go on.

254
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,310
They're waiting for you at home.

255
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,770
Don't worry about Fenghua.

256
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,030
We've watched him

257
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,930
delete all the photos in his records,

258
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,180
and punished him according to the law.

259
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:05,230
[Police]

260
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:14,800
Wanghe.

261
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,550
Have a good talk with your father when you get home.

262
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,750
Don't make him angry.

263
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,570
Thank you, Uncle.

264
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,700
Where's your uncle?

265
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,270
He said he had something to do and left early.

266
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,430
Dad.

267
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,520
Mom.

268
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,290
I'm sorry.

269
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,950
I've caused trouble for the family again.

270
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,670
Sit down and eat.

271
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,900
Sit down, sit down.

272
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,970
Come on.

273
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,280
Thank you, Dad.

274
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,280
I'm not used to the food inside.

275
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,350
You should eat too, Mom and Dad.

276
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,970
In the future,

277
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,820
before you do anything,

278
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,630
you need to use your head.

279
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,680
You can't be so impulsive anymore.

280
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,790
For your college entrance exam,

281
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,500
we had to pay that Pang Dahai

282
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,620
100,000 yuan in compensation.

283
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,920
100,000?

284
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,150
On what grounds?

285
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,110
Do you know what that bastard did?

286
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,230
If we didn't pay the 100,000,

287
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,570
they would refuse mediation,

288
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,360
and you would...

289
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,710
You would be kept in there.

290
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,160
It would affect your college entrance exam.

291
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,570
So what?

292
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,390
Let them keep me locked up!

293
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,250
I'll stay in jail!

294
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,040
What are they going to do, execute me?

295
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,040
I'd rather die

296
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,530
than bow down to these thugs and scoundrels!

297
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,220
Can you be mature?

298
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,150
Isn't that what you taught me, Dad?

299
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,710
You said a person should have a sense of responsibility.

300
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,870
Yes, I was impulsive this time,

301
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,640
but my intentions were good.

302
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,660
If you back down from these thugs,

303
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,600
they'll just take advantage of it!

304
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,670
Enough!

305
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,030
You really know where to go.

306
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,280
I'm not hungry.

307
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,190
At the end of the day,

308
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,830
it's really my fault.

309
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,330
You

310
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,490
are quite like me when I was young.

311
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:07,390
I did a lot of stupid things back then,

312
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,000
and was even proud of it.

313
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,190
Standing up for justice, huh?

314
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,089
Well,

315
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,829
you did that

316
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:20,430
for your friend too.

317
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,890
To prevent them from being wronged,

318
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,270
you resorted to violence

319
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,530
without considering the consequences.

320
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,900
This is a problem that needs to be solved.

321
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,470
Dad,

322
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,480
I was impulsive this time,

323
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,350
but I don't think I was wrong.

324
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:50,530
That bastard bullied Fenghua

325
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,080
and uploaded those photos.

326
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,660
If I were a coward,

327
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,030
who knows what might happen in the future?

328
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,750
So I absolutely refuse to bow down to such people.

329
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,430
I was protecting my family and friends.

330
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,310
Was I wrong?

331
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,990
To compensate them that 100,000,

332
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,700
the neighbors

333
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,270
chipped in.

334
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,830
We also

335
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,680
borrowed

336
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,160
some money

337
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,600
but it still wasn't enough.

338
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,510
After Siyi learned about this,

339
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,800
she ran out

340
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,310
to borrow money from her classmate.

341
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,010
By the time she came back,

342
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,450
Granny Ma had already passed away.

343
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,570
It was cerebral hemorrhage.

344
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,180
Because there was no one around,

345
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,790
she didn't get timely rescue.

346
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,220
I feel...

347
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,780
Grow up quickly.

348
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,090
Your mother and I are old.

349
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,240
We can't keep up with your antics anymore.

350
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,300
Eat up.

351
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,060
I'm not hungry.

352
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,950
You haven't eaten for a whole day.

353
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,440
Hurry up.

354
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,550
I said I'm not hungry.

355
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,330
Grandma.

356
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,710
I'm back.

357
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,440
The doctor said

358
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,740
Grandma passed away in her sleep.

359
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,700
She left peacefully.

360
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,960
Last night,

361
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,990
I dreamed about Grandma.

362
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,300
She told me

363
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,700
she's been very tired lately

364
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,520
and wanted to take a break.

365
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,460
She asked me not to blame her.

366
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,350
I knew it was a dream,

367
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,350
so I told her in the dream

368
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,330
not to leave.

369
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,490
But she left anyway.

370
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,960
I just went out for a moment,

371
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,430
how could I lose my grandma just like that?

372
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:36,490
Dad...

373
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:38,630
Mom...

374
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,670
I'm sorry.

375
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,690
I was wrong.

376
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,810
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

377
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,210
This matter,

378
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,950
at the very bottom of it,

379
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,150
is your responsibility.

380
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,630
From now on,

381
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,310
be better to Siyi.

382
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,210
Do your best in this lifetime

383
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,260
to spare her from suffering.

384
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:27,520
This is what you owe Granny Ma.

385
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,050
Don't cry anymore.

386
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,950
Go to bed early.

387
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,570
You have school early tomorrow morning.

388
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,820
I feel terrible inside.

389
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,800
We all do.

390
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,630
All these years, Granny Ma

391
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,580
has been so good to us.

392
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,580
She left so suddenly.

393
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,050
We didn't even have a chance to be good to her.

394
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:22,470
That day...

395
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,960
Siyi asked me to watch her place...

396
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,650
I didn't take it seriously...

397
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,050
I even took Siwei to watch a movie.

398
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,230
If we had been at home,

399
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:40,350
Granny Ma wouldn't have passed away...

400
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,990
Don't think like that.

401
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:49,060
Cerebral hemorrhage is very dangerous to begin with.

402
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,840
Even if we had taken her to the hospital,

403
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,970
we might not have been able to save her.

404
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,430
At least there would have been a glimmer of hope.

405
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,600
It's all my fault.

406
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:09,680
I shouldn't have gone out.

407
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,150
Don't cry.

408
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,460
Sister.

409
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,120
I'm hungry.

410
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:02,640
There are instant noodles. Make it yourself.

411
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,510
I don't want instant noodles.

412
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,040
They give me a stomachache.

413
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,380
Go buy something to eat yourself.

414
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,390
Are you eating?

415
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,130
I'm not hungry.

416
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,990
But you haven't eaten for two days.

417
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,010
Go and come back quickly.

418
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,040
Sis,

419
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,590
please go and eat something with me.

420
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,670
Fine.

421
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,510
I'll go eat by myself then.

422
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,660
Hello, Grandpa.

423
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,420
Go to the shop for a bowl of eel noodles later.

424
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,540
You can't keep starving yourself.

425
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,400
No need.

426
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,120
I'm not hungry yet.

427
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,480
Thank you, Grandpa Zhou.

428
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,270
If you get hungry,

429
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,080
your grandma will come to our dreams and scold us.

430
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,470
She wouldn't do that.

431
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,190
Who says she wouldn't?

432
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,810
Don't you remember?

433
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,030
That year,

434
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,370
when you and Wanghe went down to the river

435
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,430
to learn how to swim

436
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,140
and choked on some water,

437
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,140
someone mimicked it to your grandma

438
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,120
and it made her so mad.

439
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:18,450
She went door to door scolding everyone, young and old.

440
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,670
None of us had a peaceful meal that day.

441
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,030
I remember Wanghe and Haikuo both got hit.

442
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:30,800
Xiaopang ran away from home after just two hits.

443
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,790
That incident scared me too.

444
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,670
You were your grandma's soft spot.

445
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:42,740
Except for her,

446
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,750
no one could touch you.

447
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,980
Last month,

448
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,880
on a night,

449
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,350
your grandma suddenly came to my house.

450
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:58,780
Mr. Zhou,

451
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,860
I

452
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:04,270
have had someone write a power of attorney. Have a look.

453
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,590
In case I...

454
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:14,220
I'll have to trouble you...

455
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,270
to help me sell that house.

456
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,830
You can keep the money,

457
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,950
and you can give it to Siyi monthly.

458
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:24,770
We must ensure Siyi finishes university, no matter what.

459
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,440
If...

460
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,340
If this money isn't enough,

461
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,540
then

462
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,830
I'll have to trouble everyone.

463
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,140
I'm sorry to everyone.

464
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,980
I...

465
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:52,240
I can only repay this in my next life.

466
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,250
I'm counting on you.

467
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:15,990
We'll talk about whether we have to sell the house later.

468
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:20,740
This time, I represent

469
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,370
the neighbors from this courtyard

470
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,370
to tell you that you

471
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,900
don't need to worry about money.

472
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,050
Even if you study for a doctorate,

473
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,630
we'll support you.

474
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,700
I know

475
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,030
if this happened to another family,

476
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:44,030
and if another child was left alone,

477
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,820
as long as Granny Ma was around,

478
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:49,030
even if she had scrimp and save,

479
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,580
she wouldn't stand by and watch.

480
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,920
We all know

481
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,300
you're independent and strong-willed,

482
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,330
but

483
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:05,340
you should accept everyone's kindness

484
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,940
on behalf of

485
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,760
your grandma.

486
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,340
From this moment on,

487
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,240
you,

488
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,910
Ma Siyi,

489
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,320
are the child

490
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,870
of all of us.

491
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,590
Grandpa Zhou...

492
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,260
Look, look.

493
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,260
What are you doing?

494
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:45,750
Shoo.

495
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,280
Don't cause trouble here.

496
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,140
Go over there.

497
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:58,800
You messed it up.

498
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,530
You're back?

499
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,020
How did it go?

500
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,840
How was it?

501
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:09,770
Mr. Zhou.

502
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:14,100
I've talked to Siyi.

503
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:18,190
Her emotions were relatively stable.

504
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,600
So,

505
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,780
later,

506
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,860
everyone should pay more attention.

507
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,250
Communicate with her regularly.

508
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,670
It's the last semester.

509
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,190
It's crucial.

510
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:31,260
We must not let it affect her grades.

511
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,020
Siyi is a good child.

512
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,670
She has always been sensible.

513
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,330
If it were just her alone,

514
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,730
there's no need to worry.

515
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:38,770
But she has

516
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,270
a younger brother.

517
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:43,810
Someone needs to pick him up from school.

She has to cook when they get home.

519
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,030
And help with his homework.

520
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,620
I feel for this child just thinking about it.

521
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,620
Siyi is still just a teenager herself.

522
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:56,520
It's not easy for her to take care of herself,

523
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,460
let alone look after her brother,

524
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,570
and preparing for the college entrance exam.

525
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:00,030
It's definitely too much.

526
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,850
Actually, if you ask me,

527
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,250
we should all try to persuade Siyi's mother

528
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:09,430
to take Ge Siwei back with her first.

529
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,540
At least for this semester.

530

We can't let this affect Siyi's studies.

532

That mother of hers

533

they're still her own children.

When Granny was around,

538
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:26,820
she left him here.

539

Now that she's gone,

540
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:30,130
she still won't take care of her own son?

541
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,580
You never know.

542
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,110
Given the old lady's situation before,

543
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,650
she still had the nerve to come asking for money.

544
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,440
That's right, she was extorting the old lady.

545
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,610
As if the old lady owed her something.

546
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:38,510
Exactly.

547
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:39,180
Well then,

548
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,130
let's see her attitude first.

549
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,020
If she's friendly,

550
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,760
we'll be polite to her.

551
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:47,950
Right?

552
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,850
Let's try not to fall out with her.

553
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:51,740
Yes, yes.

554
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,560
If she's unreasonable,

555
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,950
we'll pressure her together.

We won't let her bully the children.

-Yes.

Exactly.

559
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,570
Siyi can't keep pushing herself like this.

560
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:10,570
If she continues like this, her health will collapse.

561

I've tried to persuade her, but she won't listen.

562
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,400
My mom told her to go back to sleep,

563
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:18,530
but she got up again after lying down for just a moment.

564
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,790
She stays up all night when she does that.

565

If this continues,

00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,130
♫And my heart♫

689
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:13,790
♫The purple♫

690
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:15,030
♫The wind blows gently♫

691
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,400
♫Blowing through summer♫

692
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:21,350
♫And red blossoms♫

693
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,630
♫Blowing through the eaves♫

694
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:26,590
♫Bloom everywhere♫

695
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:24,620
♫It blows past me♫

696
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:29,530
♫My warm love♫

697
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,550
♫How many years♫

698
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:31,390
Siyi.

00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:36,010
♫Have you changed?♫

701
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:33,960
Grandma...

702
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,940
Siyi.

703
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,530
The government gave us low income payouts.

704
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,890
♫How many years♫

705
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,770
♫How far has the old times♫

706
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,300
And the neighbors take care of us.

707
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,440
But

708
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,870
♫We miss gone♫

709
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:47,380
you must never rely on others' means.

710
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,270
♫I was lost in a distance♫

711
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:48,670
Understand?

712
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:49,570
Yes.

713
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,950
♫I couldn't forget♫

714
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,420
♫The first growth♫

715
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,290
So from now on,

716
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:00,040
I'll teach you how to cook.

717
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,270
Because I don't know how long I can stay with you.

718
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,420
I'll teach you how to cook.

719
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,670
I'll teach you how to fry fried radish cakes

720
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:12,790
and teach you how to make a living.

721
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,380
Even if grandma is gone,

722
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:19,910
you can still rely on this skill to support yourself.

723
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:20,750
Okay?

724
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:22,890
Okay...

725
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,290
Siyi.

726
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,900
What would you like to eat?

727
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,300
Come over, child.

728
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:04,100
♫Thinking of you deeply♫
