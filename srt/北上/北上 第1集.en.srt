It has been a few months since I came

00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,250
[Year 1901]

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,100
to China from Italy to study the Grand Canal.

4
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,230
Today,

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,950
as I was lifted into the air in a hanging basket

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,750
before the gates of Wuxi,

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,320
I felt for the first time what it was like

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,670
to rise above the world of smoke and fire.

9
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,110
It's also here that

10
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,780
I met my Chinese translator,

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,030
Xie Pingyao.

12
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,940
He will go northward with me

13
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,870
and start our journey on the canal.

14
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,550
You, the one wearing the red hat!

15
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,930
Add five cents more!

16
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,910
Pull me up! I'm stuck!

17
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,960
Who let them stop? Wait!

18
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,800
They want more money.

19
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,440
Otherwise, they won't pull you up.

20
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,039
This thousand-year-old canal

21
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,310
carries the enduring history and cultural legacy

22
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,190
of the Chinese civilization.

23
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,700
It has nurtured and enriched

24
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,660
the lives of countless families living by the canal.

25
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,740
Ships traveling north and south

26
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,229
carry memories that span across the ages.

27
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,020
For people living by the canal,

28
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,070
the canal is more than just a waterway.

29
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,770
It's also a compass,

30
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:49,110
pointing the way to the world.

31
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:53,509
The canal is their vanguard in discovering the world.

32
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:55,900
It stands for them,

33
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,240
and journeys in their place

34
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,080
to a wider and more expansive world.

35
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,840
The canal even signifies

36
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,610
their entire lives.

[Year 2000]

40
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:55,829
In the year 2000,

41
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,600
as the new millennium arrived,

42
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,770
the children living by the canal

43
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,330
may still struggle to discern between the directions.

44
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,630
However, they had already begun to know that

45
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,710
if one heads left at the end of the bridge,

46
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,010
it leads to the Forbidden City, the Great Wall,

47
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,790
and Quanjude roast duck.

48
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,160
If one heads right,

49
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,160
it leads to the dazzling neon lights of Nanjing Road

50
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,399
and White Rabbit candy.

51
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,500
If one heads down,

52
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:24,900
there will be an endless supply of free watermelon.

I'll tell your dad to punish you!

If you dare to steal my watermelons,

93
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,540
I'll make sure to skin you alive!

94
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,600
My name is Fenghua.

This is the 10-year-old me.

As you can see, my baby teeth have yet to fully fall out.

The ones running ahead

98
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,330
are my neighbors,

We all live on Flower Street.

00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,030
At that time,

102
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,970
we were fooling around every day,

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,290
and our little gang was well-known.

104
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,010
We were excellent swimmers

105
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,800
and notorious troublemakers.

106
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,990
We were known for catching mussels and prawns, and stealing watermelons.

107
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,070
Summer

108
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,280
is our happiest time of the year.

109
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,680
As the saying goes, with protection comes ease of mind.

110
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,540
Under the protection of the canal and our families,

111
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,200
our childhood days

112
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,730
were carefree.

113
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,860

176
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,500
Okay.

177
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,690
Hello, I'm Xie Wanghe.

178
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:35,570
This is Zhou Haikuo.

179
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,500
This is Shao Xingchi.

180
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,230
-Hello. Hello.
-Hello. Hello.

181
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,630
You can play the guitar?

182
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,730
A little.

183
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,570
Play it for us.

184
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,830
This is my dad's guitar.

185
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,950
Why can't I touch it?

186
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,950
Go away. Go away.

187
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,950
Let's go back.

188
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,070
She's a girl.

189
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,310
Don't run so fast!

190
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,470
Let me carry the guitar case for you.

191
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,590
You naughty boy!

192
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,130
All you know is to run wild all day long.

193
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,450
He's driving me crazy.

194
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,930
Granny Ma is back.

195
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,950
Granny Ma!

196
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,070
This is...

197
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,150
Siyi?

198
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:07,590
Siyi!

199
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,790
Look at this kid.

200
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,270
Look.

201
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,200
You've grown up.

202
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,380
Right?

203
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,110
You've grown so tall.

204
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,110
Siyi, look.

205
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,950
This is Aunt Liang,

206
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,470
Aunt Yan, and Aunt Ling.

207
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,210
Is she here for vacation?

208
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,460
Yes.

209
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,720
She's staying here for a while.

210
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,030
Go on with your work.

211
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,550
I'm leaving.

212
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,530
Siyi, say goodbye to your aunties.

213
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,460
Bye.

214
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,350
Bye, Siyi.

215
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,270
Go on with your work.

216
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:32,960
Alright.

217
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,550
Go back and rest.

218
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,310
Don't worry about it.

219
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,430
We're all here.

220
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,950
Just tell us if you need anything.

221
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:38,870
Okay.

222
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,530
Be careful.

223
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,680
Why did she bring

224
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,400
the child back all of a sudden?

225
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,160
She said the child would be staying for a while.

226
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,360
What about the kid's mother?

227
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,920
Didn't her daughter-in-law remarry?

228
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,330
She just had a son.

229
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
They must think

230
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,460
the child's an eyesore.

231
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,610
Slow down.

232
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,900
They are quite mischievous.

233
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,860
Siyi!

234
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,320
Siyi.

235
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,580
Siyi, come play with us.

236
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:09,970
Yes.

237
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,510
Let's go out and play.

238
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,870
She's too tired today.

239
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,390
She'll play with you tomorrow, okay?

240
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:14,740
Okay.

241
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:15,610
Okay.

242
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,800
See you tomorrow.

243
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,090
I'm making wontons for dinner, so come over and eat.

244
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:19,940
Okay!

245
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,100
Let's eat together.

246
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,760
This is our home.

247
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,760
Come in.

248
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,360
Siyi.

249
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,010
You must be tired today.

250
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,950
I'll take you to school tomorrow

251
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,150
for the procedures.

252
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,050
Let me put your luggage in your room.

253
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,500
It was a typical summer day when Siyi

254
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,590
came to our Flower Street courtyard.

255
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,450
In contrast to our cacophony,

256
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,310
Siyi was quiet

257
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,390
and headstrong.

258
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,920
She also seemed troubled.

259
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,340
At that time, we had no idea that

260
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,330
this foreign-looking girl

261
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,860
who doesn't talk much

262
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,580
will eventually change our life.

263
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,930
Want to see where you're sleeping?

264
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:26,760
Come.

265
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:27,890
Here.

266
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,210
It's here.

267
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,370
You'll sleep here with me at night.

268
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,270
Look at your guitar case.

269
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,550
Shall we put it here?

270
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,110
Here.

271
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,360
Yes, give it to me.

272
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,620
Okay.

273
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,190
Grandma.

274
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,850
Will I be staying here from now on?

275
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,810
What did your mother tell you?

276
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,810
She said you're old,

277
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,950
so she asked me to help take care of you.

278
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,390
Exactly.

279
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,900
I'm getting old,

280
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,200
so I need you to take care of me.

281
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Isn't it?

282
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,420
All's good.

283
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,430
Look, there's a desk here.

284
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,210
Come on.

285
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,030
A desk for you.

286
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,620
I prepared these for you.

287
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,070
It comes with a chair.

288
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,120
Sit here.

289
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,670
Try it out.

290
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,330
From now on, you'll do your homework here.

291
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,340
Okay?

292
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,720
Did she say for how long?

293
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,530
Oh, let me show you the kitchen.

294
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,730
There's a kitchen.

295
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,290
Come, let me take you to the kitchen.

296
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,810
Later,

297
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,040
I'll make you some wontons.

298
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,670
In the future, just tell me what you want to eat.

299
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,150
I'll make it for you.

300
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,410
The kitchen is over there.

301
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,430
Here.

302
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,990
Look, this is the kitchen.

303
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:09,410
[News]

304
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,590
Mom.

305
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,840
Mom!

306
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,610
Mom.

307
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,990
What are we eating today?

308
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:15,990
You.

309
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,790
Listen,

310
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:17,870
if you dare to steal watermelons again,

311
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,890
I'll break your hand.

312
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:19,430
Go.

313
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,460
Borrow some onions from Aunt Liang.

314
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,590
Aunt Liang, do you have onions?

315
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,450
Yes, leek or spring onion?

316
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,100
Mom, leek or spring onion?

317
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,350
I'm cooking fish.

318
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,750
What do you think?

319
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,950
You didn't say you were cooking fish.

320
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,210
Didn't you see what this is?

321
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,610
Spring onion it is. Here.

322
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,510
You don't even know what type of onion to get.

323
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,670
Can you use your cleverness

324
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,740
in your studies?

325
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,950
How dare you steal from people?

326
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:47,310
Grandma!

327
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,150
Alright. Alright.

328
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,740
Why are you yelling?

329
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,450
I could hear you from far away.

330
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,720
I'm not cooking these tonight.

331
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,630
Share it with everyone when you're done.

332
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,310
Okay, I'll do it.

333
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,510
Thank you, Granny Ma.

334
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,910
I'm going to Grandma's house to eat wontons.

335
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,950
You're going to Grandma's house for dinner again?

336
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,430
Alright. Let's go.

337
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,480
Siyi!

338
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,060
Siyi!

339
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,460
Grandma's wontons are delicious.

340
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,350
She made them for me every day when you were not around.

341
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,080
Aren't they especially tasty?

342
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:17,870
How old are you?

343
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,020
I'm 10 years old.

344
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,520
Me too.

345
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,030
You don't look like you're 10.

346
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,780
You seem more mature than me.

347
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,010
But maybe it's

348
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,670
because you don't talk much.

349
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,090
If I don't talk,

350
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,230
would I look more mature?

351
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,320
Alright.

352
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,530
I think

353
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,670
only these wontons can keep you quiet.

354
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,000
You're so talkative.

355
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,670
Granny Ma, please teach my mom when you're free.

356
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,870
No matter what my mom cooks,

357
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,270
it tastes like soy sauce.

358
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,990
Your mother is the wife of a seafarer.

359
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,830
She likes things with a strong flavor.

360
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,990
Where are you from?

361
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,270
Me?

362
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,870
I'm from Shandong.

363
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,390
Shandong, Linqing.

364
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,070
Siyi's grandfather's ancestors

365
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,230
were foreigners.

366
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,690
Really?

367
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,790
Why would I lie to you?

368
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:11,590
Here.

369
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,910
I have photos.

370
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,990
Let's see...

371
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,510
See?

372
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,830
Aren't these people

373
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,350
all foreigners?

374
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,030
Right?

375
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,070
This one is her grandpa.

376
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,270
Am I right?

377
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,020
Who is this?

378
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,550
This is my dad.

379
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,750
This is me.

380
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,220
Your dad is so handsome.

381
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,270
Big eyes and a high nose bridge.

382
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,950
I knew it, you are a foreigner.

383
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,590
I'm Chinese.

384
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,970
Okay, Chinese.

385
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,030
Grandma.

386
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,200
Which country is Siyi's grandpa from?

387
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,780
China.

388
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,610
He was born in China.

389
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,520
It's just that his ancestors were Italians.

390
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,630
Where is Italy?

391
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,840
I don't know either.

392
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,990
Ask Grandpa Zhou when you have time.

393
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,550
Grandpa Zhou must know.

394
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:06,510
I only know

395
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,670
Italy is very far away.

396
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:10,220
Go back.

397
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,910
Grandma, when we grow up,

398
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:13,910
I'll drive a ship

399
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,910
and take Siyi to Italy.

400
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,380
You should come with us.

401
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,109
Sure.

402
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,790
I'll be waiting.

403
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,390
Eat up.

404
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:25,560
Siyi, eat quickly.

405
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:28,060
I'll show you around the neighborhood later.

406
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,920
Show me around?

407
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,990
This is our courtyard.

408
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,720
As you enter and turn right,

409
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,110
the Zhou's occupy the first house.

410
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,210
Grandpa Zhou is cultured.

411
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,290
He's very nice.

412
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,690
We hide at his house whenever we're in trouble.

413
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,070
Grandpa Zhou!

414
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,770
Fenghua.

415
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,910
I know.

416
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,560
You're here to eat again.

417
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,990
No.

418
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,160
No?

419
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,540
This child is really good-looking.

420
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,030
Her name is Ma Siyi,

421
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,630
Granny Ma's granddaughter.

422
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,900
-Siyi?
-Hello.

423
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:05,440
Hello.

424
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,590
You've grown so tall.

425
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,690
Zhou Haikuo!

426
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,590
Zhou Haikuo!

427
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,820
You even know about this door?

428
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,120
Grandpa Zhou's grandson

429
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,040
is Zhou Haikuo.

430
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,470
He is my classmate.

431
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,870
He is a good student.

432
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,510
If you want him to do your homework for you,

433
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,460
just give him money.

434
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,310
Fast and good, right?

435
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,270
I see.

436
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,670
You're doing people's homework for money?

437
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,200
Grandpa,

438
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,860
don't listen to them.

439
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,010
I only let Wanghe copy my math homework twice.

440
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,010
Grandpa Zhou, we're leaving.

441
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,910
I didn't take any money.

442
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:42,940
Uncle Zhou.

443
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,240
Fenghua.

444
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,500
Who is this doll?

445
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:48,710
Ma Siyi,

446
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,350
Granny Ma's granddaughter.

447
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:51,790
Hello, Uncle.

448
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,490
Hello.

449
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,680
You can speak Chinese?

450
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,060
Oh, yes.

451
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,950
You're Granny Ma's granddaughter.

452
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:58,880
Alright.

453
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,670
I'm heading to the kitchen.

454
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,210
Oh, right.

455
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,070
Do visit my restaurant, By the Canal.

456
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,620
I'll cook you something delicious.

457
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,350
Okay?

458
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,140
Bye.

459
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,030
Uncle Zhou is a cook.

460
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,860
He's a master of Huaiyang cuisine.

461
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,260
He opened a restaurant called By the Canal.

462
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,770
It's in the alley on Flower Street.

463
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,320
Haikuo's mother performs Kun opera.

464
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,130
She’s prettier than you.

465
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,800
This is my home.

466
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,720
My dad's Xia Lao'er,

467
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,980
a seafarer.

468
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,190
My mom is Li Yan.

469
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,270
She runs a breakfast stall.

470
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,500
You met her before.

471
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,910
Is your mom good to you?

472
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,960
No, she's always scolding me.

473
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,900
She's super talkative.

474
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,070
She'll suffocate if she's silent for three minutes.

475
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,280
Who are you talking about?

476
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,010
Run!

477
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,790
You naughty kid!

478
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,510
Aunt Liang!

479
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,710
This is Aunt Liang's house.

480
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,330
She runs the breakfast stall with my mum.

481
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,430
Hello, Aunt Liang.

482
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,870
Have you had dinner?

483
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,080
Yes.

484
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,590
Wanghe.

485
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,710
Xie Wanghe!

486
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,630
Xie Wanghe.

487
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,350
Wanghe.

488
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,440
Xie Wanghe!

489
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,040
Xie Wanghe!

490
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,390
What?

491
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,910
I'm introducing Siyi to everyone.

492
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,440
We're brothers from now on.

493
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,480
Fenghua, who taught you to say that?

494
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:07,950
Uncle Xie,

495
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,990
Xie Wanghe's dad.

496
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,480
My dad is Xie Tiancheng.

497
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,430
He's the boss of the Flower Street portion of the Grand Canal.

498
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,890
Everyone has to listen to him on the river.

499
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,350
He's like the Dragon King.

500
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,230
He's a seafarer with my dad.

501
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,570
He makes a lot of money.

502
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,910
Who told you that?

503
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:20,940
My mom.

504
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,700
He doesn't make that much money.

505
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,830
If we really made money,

506
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,560
we would have bought a house

507
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,100
instead of renting from Granny Ma.

508
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,220
Siyi, come with me.

509
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,310
Don't hang out with her anymore.

510
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,370
She is unreliable.

511
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,570
A boy holding a girl's hand.

512
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,240
Isn't that shameful?

513
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,120
I'm afraid she'll get lost.

514
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,350
Stay away from Wanghe.

515
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,390
He's a bad kid.

516
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,590
And you are a good kid?

517
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,190
At least I'm not being punished by the teachers every day.

518
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,230
Fenghua, you...

519
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,260
Shao Xingchi!

520
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,740
Let's go play!

521
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,910
I'm not free today.

522
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:47,700
I'm not going.

523
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,190
No.

524
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,670
Why are you cooking for yourself again?

525
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,810
My mom is sick.

526
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,350
Why is your mom always sick?

527
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,070
Go away if you have nothing else to say.

528
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,980
Xingchi,

529
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,070
what did your dad teach you?

530
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,310
You can't be this rude.

531
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,770
Mom, eat it while it's hot.

532
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,720
They are so annoying.

533
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,930
Stop it.

534
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,740
Auntie, what's wrong with you?

535
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:04,890
I'm fine.

536
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,830
My back is hurting again.

537
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,130
Where is Uncle Shao?

538
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,550
He probably got off work and is on his way.

539
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,880
He hasn't come back yet.

540
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,090
Do you need something?

541
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,520
I'm here to introduce Siyi to everyone.

542
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,410
Siyi.

543
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,760
Come play with them whenever you're free.

544
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,950
Uncle Shao works at the cultural museum.

545
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,890
He's a writer who writes articles.

546
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,910
He was even featured in the newspaper before.

547
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,830
Don't play outside for too long.

548
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,290
Your dad will be back soon.

549
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,660
Siyi, let's go.

550
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,510
Let's go stargazing.

551
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,190
Look.

552
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,950
Go that way.

553
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,610
Haikuo!

554
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,090
Haikuo!

555
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,230
Haikuo!

556
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,440
Haikuo!

557
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,030
Haikuo!

558
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:44,830
Haikuo!

559
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,550
Here.

560
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,220
Siyi, look.

561
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,890
Dad.

562
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,720
Why are you back so late?

563
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,480
Did you drink again?

564
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,880
Why would I drink?

565
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,460
Why are you sitting there?

566
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,510
Come down.

567
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,050
Mr. Shao.

568
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,390
Mr. Zhou.

569
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,350
You had a drink again?

570
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,830
I have something to tell you.

571
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,280
Really? Come on.

572
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,740
Mr. Zhou.

573
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,450
I heard at the cultural museum today that

574
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,720
Boss Xie is planning to change ships.

575
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,120
Change ships?

576
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,240
Isn't the current ship pretty new?

577
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,890
Exactly.

578
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,950
So why the need?

579
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,350
How would I know?

580
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,320
We all chipped in

581
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,990
to help buy his current ship.

582
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,670
It's only been a while

583
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,670
and he wants to change the ship.

584
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,990
What is he trying to do?

585
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,280
Who told you that?

586
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,790
I heard it from Zheng who sells antiques

587
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,590
in front of our cultural museum.

588
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:03,810
His son

589
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,670
works in a shipyard.

590
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,450
He said that

591
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,840
Boss Xie has been negotiating with the shipyard people

592
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,300
for several rounds now.

593
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,610
You must talk to him about this.

594
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,990
Don't let him do anything stupid.

595
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,020
You...

596
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,630
Don't worry. It's fine.

597
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,730
When he comes back tomorrow,

598
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,460
I'll ask him about the details.

599
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,280
Tiancheng

600
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,700
is meticulous.

601
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,030
He won't do anything reckless.

602
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,350
Don't worry.

603
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,880
You have to talk to him tomorrow.

604
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:30,790
Okay.

605
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:31,990
I'm leaving, Mr. Zhou.

606
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:32,270
Okay.

607
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:32,870
Take care.

608
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:33,240
Okay.

609
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:33,990
Will you be fine?

610
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,510
No problem.

611
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,070
Okay, take care.

612
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:38,790
Xingchi.

613
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,280
What time is it now?

614
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,250
Go home now!

615
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,230
Have you finished your homework?

616
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,470
I'll be back later.

617
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,190
Okay.

618
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,950
Why are you laughing?

619
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,230
Have you finished your homework?

620
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,540
Yes.

621
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,350
Can you stop drinking?

622
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,830
When did I drink?

623
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,310
Wanghe!

624
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,360
Look at the time. Don't you know when to stop?

625
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,510
Let's go home.

626
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,160
♫When the moon hangs in the sky♫

627
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,520
Siyi.

628
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,640
She just got here and you're already dragging her along.

629
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,420
♫And it's cooling in the yard♫

630
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,520
Time for bed.

♫Who is still by your side?♫

632
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,470
Hurry up

633
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,480
Yan!

634
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,350
Take Fenghua home to rest.

635
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,270
It's late.

636
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,430
♫As time passes♫

637
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,950
I'm not sleepy yet. Let me play some more.

638
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,800
You should behave more like a big brother.

639
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,100
Don't you know when to stop playing?

640
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:15,720
♫Is a lifetime really that long?♫

641
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,990
Do I have to tell you what to do?

642
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,270
Do you need to be scolded to be good?

643
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,190
♫When youthful company fades♫

644

[Welcome]

649
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,430
Boss!

650
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,500
You're back!

651
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:40,750
Let's have a drink sometime!

652
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,680
Sure thing.

653
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:44,230
I'll order thirty more packs of instant noodles from you.

654
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:44,760
Alright.

655
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:45,760
Got it.

656
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:51,830
Si!

657
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:52,810
Come here!

658
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,530
Take it.

659
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,280
Okay.

660
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,450
Xia!

661
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:02,110
Let's go.

662
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:02,780
Let's go.

663
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,020
Okay. Come again.

664
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,020
Will do.

665
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,500
The kids will be so happy to see us back.

666
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,160
Definitely!

667
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,220
Look at this puppy.

668
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,130
You must have made quite a bit on this trip, right?

669
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,330
Here, have some fresh water chestnuts.

670
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:23,470
These are really fresh.

671
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:23,870
Of course.

672
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,600
Only the best for our children.

673
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,910
Boss, please consider my son.

674
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:28,790
He's graduating next year.

675
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,640
Can he join and work for you?

676
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:31,670
Sure.

677
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,930
Leave your son to me.

678
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,100
Thank you, Boss Xie.

679
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,430
Take my son along to see the world too.

680
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,750
Your son is not even a month old yet.

681
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,810
You... Fine, fine.

682
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,660
I've already split them into stacks.

683
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,370
It's all in this bag.

684
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,190
Okay.

685
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,390
I'll leave this matter to you.

686
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,050
Okay.

687
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,030
In my opinion, the canal

688
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,920
is a main pillar of transportation.

689
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,160
There was a ship

690
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,750
carrying foreigners.

691
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,390
It was called Little Polo.

692
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:56,760
It carried Italians.

693
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,600
More than 100 years ago,

694
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,510
Flower Street might not have existed.

695
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,600
Look at you.

696
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,270
Ask...

697
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,150
Ask Mr. Shao.

698
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:05,050
I can testify.

699
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,250
See?

700
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,470
See what I said?

701
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,440
I said the ship must have sunk here.

702
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,110
Little Polo must have been

703
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,250
related to her.

704
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,350
Is he talking about that ship again?

705
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:15,830
Yes.

706
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,150
He's obsessed.

707
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,330
Shao Xingchi.

708
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,220
Look at him.

709
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,210
Come on.

710
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,570
Come on.

711
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,260
Is she your granddaughter?

712
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,080
Yes.

713
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,310
Fenghua! Stop!

714
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,490
I'll beat you!

715
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,590
Give it to me.

716
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,340
Enough.

717
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,550
Are you not performing today?

718
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:39,990
Yes.

719
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:42,010
I took time off to come back.

720
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,270
The restaurant has gotten busy.

721
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,610
If I don't come back,

722
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,230
Yanlin will quarrel with me.

723
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,270
He wouldn't dare.

724
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,830
It's not that. Our son misses her.

725
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,260
That's true.

726
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,330
Are you playing with Grandpa?

727
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,750
Why are you so wet?

728
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,110
Who is this girl?

729
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:02,510
Siyi.

730
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,510
Ma Siyi.

731
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,050
-Granny Ma's granddaughter.
-Granny Ma's granddaughter.

732
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:06,880
You're here.

733
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:09,340
How nice. You're so pretty.

734
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,710
You're back.

735
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,150
Everyone is here!

736
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,070
Long time no see.

737
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:19,280
Let me report to you.

738
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,660
This time,

739
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,880
This seafaring trip with Xia and I

740
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,300
earned us...

741
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,920
24,000 yuan!

742
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,570
As usual,

743
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,920
half the money is mine.

744
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,590
As for the rest,

745
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:36,980
it will be divided

746
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,280
according to your shares, okay?

747
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,650
Okay!

748
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,550
Xia!

749
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,460
Split the money!

750
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,900
Okay.

751
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,910
This looks pretty cool.

752
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,510
His mother bought it for him.

753
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:50,740
That seems advanced.

754
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,450
Thank you.

755
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,080
That seems really advanced.

756
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,790
I have a suggestion.

757
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,870
Since we have this new gadget,

758
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,020
why don't we take a photo?

759
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,320
Okay?

760
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,590
I can do it myself.

761
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,970
He even has a temper.

762
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,970
This is amazing.

763
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,020
Haikuo, come on.

764
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,820
Come on.

765
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,600
One, two, three.

766
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,400
Cheese!

767
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,550
Happy holidays!

768
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,870
Happy holidays!

769
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,270
Happy holidays!

770
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,870
Don't kick up a fuss.

771
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:31,430
Go have dinner.

772
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:31,960
Hurry up.

773
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,190
Hurry up.

774
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,310
Let's eat.

775
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,910
The dishes are getting cold.

776
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,580
Since everyone is here,

777
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,950
I want to discuss something major with you.

778
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,660
Do you all know?

779
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,990
Recently, construction is happening all over the country.

780
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,800
The demand for transportation of materials

781
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,900
is rising every day.

782
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,050
And transportation fees keep rising.

783
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,080
I think our 500-ton ship

784
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:58,730
is not big enough

785
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,180
to meet transportation demands.

786
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,800
Look at the 1,000-ton ships.

787
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,580
We have to make two trips

788
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,780
to match their single trip.

789
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:07,120
And the fuel costs aren't that different.

790
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:07,580
Right?

791
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,050
More critically, we are wasting time.

792
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:10,930
We're wasting time, isn't it?

793
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,480
So I think

794
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,070
now

795
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,790
is the best time to change ships.

796
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,720
This is what I'm thinking.

797
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,420
We'll sell the old

798
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,500
500-ton ship

799
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:25,770
and top up 300,000 yuan

800
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:28,430
to get the 1000-ton ship.

801
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,460
Our common account

802
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:32,170
currently has

803
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,280
200,000 yuan.

804
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,210
So,

805
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,250
we still need 100,000 yuan.

806
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:40,460
100,000 yuan is not a small amount.

807
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,520
Of course.

808
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,180
Why are you poking me?

809
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,310
Do you have 100,000 yuan?

810
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,070
Of course, I know 100,000 yuan

811
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,570
is a big amount.

812
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,230
But I did a rough estimate.

813
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:52,670
After we get the 1,000-ton ship,

814
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,100
we'll definitely break even

815
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,360
if we work hard for two years.

816
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,440
The rest

817
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,350
will be...

818
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,100
Pure profit.

819
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,120
Pure profit.

820
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:00,770
Right.

821
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:05,010
Boss, I think we should...

822
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,640
discuss this matter a bit more.

823
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,180
The Beijing-Shanghai Expressway

824
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:12,060
will be completed at the end of the year.

825
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,870
I'm just a little worried that

826
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:17,540
our canal's traffic may be affected.

827
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:19,100
It's best to be more careful.

828
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:19,940
About that,

829
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,250
I did a thorough research.

830
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,070
The queue for buildings above 20 floors

831
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,870
has been lined up till 2008.

832
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,900
I know that highway transportation

833
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,430
is much faster.

834
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,920
But it costs a lot.

835
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,400
We just need to focus on

836
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,420
the Honghuai transportation route

837
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,840
to make a small fortune.

838
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:41,960
Right?

839
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,660
Yes.

840
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,920
Jiangnan Shipyard has enough orders

841
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,360
lined up for the next two years.

842
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,160
See?

843
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:48,400
But the problem is...

844
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,470
Enough.

845
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:52,170
If you don't want to do it, withdraw your shares.

846
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,700
I'll cover the rest.

847
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:54,950
Don’t say that.

848
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:57,280
I didn't say I want to withdraw my shares.

849
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,220
Let me tell you.

850
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,230
The canal

851
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,980
raised us.

852
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,120
We must not forget our origins.

853
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,050
Mr. Zhou.

854
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,110
I'll go.

855
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,040
No, Mr. Zhou.

856
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,140
Yanlin was just looking out for us.

857
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,620
Let's drink.

858
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:24,700
Come on.

859
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,360
Come.

860
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,750
Let's soak your feet.

861
00:31:59,240 --> 00:31:59,940
Slowly.

862
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:03,920
I can do it myself.

863
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:04,950
I can do it myself.

864
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,800
Changing ships is a big deal.

865
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,060
Don't do anything reckless.

866
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,540
I don't care about others.

867
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,060
But Granny Ma

868
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:24,250
is raising her granddaughter alone.

869
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,680
If we lose money,

870
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,190
even if it means we have to pay,

871
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,070
we can't let their family suffer a loss.

872
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,340
Why don't you have any faith in me?

873
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:33,350
No...

874
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,590
What are you talking about

875
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,390
after listening to others?

876
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,110
Have I ever lost money in business?

877
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,020
Have I?

878
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,000
Let's talk about this ship.

879
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,880
Since I bought it,

880
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,050
did I lose any money?

881
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,810
Haven't I been leading everyone

882
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,500
on a steady path towards prosperity?

883
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,700
Think about how much they profited too.

884
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,800
You're worried for nothing.

885
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,180
Let's decide

886
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,920
after everyone has come to a consensus.

887
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,480
Do you know how much it costs to drive

888
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,200
a truck on the highway?

889
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,210
You have to pay for the bridge.

890
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,370
You have to pay for the road.

891
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,580
If you enter the city,

892
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,020
you have to pay the parking fee.

893
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,430
How much will it cost?

894
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,110
These are all free

895
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,560
on the canal.

896
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,370
I don't understand.

897
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,700
What's wrong?

898
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,540
What's with the attitude?

899
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,070
Have you lost some weight lately?

900
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:38,390
No.

901
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:40,230
You don't feel as full as before.

902
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,510
I think I gained weight though. Feel it.

903
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,290
Nonsense, that's your ribs.

904
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:45,700
Where am I supposed to feel?

905
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,970
Here, feel down here.

906
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,010
We have to check

907
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,730
your body thoroughly tonight.

908
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:51,830
Look at my waist.

909
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,590
What time is it?

910
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,880
Still fooling around?

911
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,550
Wanghe.

912
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,830
Let me ask you something.

913
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,530
How much is one jin of watermelon now?

914
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,400
25 cents.

915
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:15,139
No, 26 cents.

916
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:16,400
It has risen recently.

917
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:17,810
So can't our family

918
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,420
afford it

919
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:20,489
or something?

920
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,210
How dare you

921
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,159
steal from the ship?

922
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,210
Why are you hitting me?

923
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:28,239
You stole things when you were young too.

924
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,670
What did I steal?

925
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,650
You stole sweet potatoes

926
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:31,409
and chives.

927
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,060
You stole whatever was in the field.

928
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,100
Who told you that?

929
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:35,639
Granny told me that!

930
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,780
Why bring this up with your dad?

931
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,179
You still want to...

932
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:44,469
How dare you talk back?

933
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,389
How dare you talk back?

934
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:47,840
I'll kill you!

935
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:48,590
Stop!

936
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:49,360
You can't hit me.

937
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,590
How dare you talk back?

938
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,650
Mom!

939
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:54,210
Mom, Wanghe is getting beaten again!

940
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,230
Do you know why his father is beating him?

941
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,480
He stole watermelons.

942
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,480
What about you?

943
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,440
You stole them too, don't you know?

944
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:01,940
Enough.

945
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,590
Listen to me.

946
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,550
Enough.

947
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,460
I'll beat you.

948
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:05,710
Alright, alright.

949
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,470
Why are you hiding?

950
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,720
Stand still.

951
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,510
In just one essay,

952
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,990
you have over ten wrongly written characters.

953
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,800
Your handwriting is atrocious.

954
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,210
You even misused idioms.

955
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:16,190
Are you trying to piss me off?

956
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:18,400
Don't yell at him.

957
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,770
If you feel uncomfortable,

958
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,770
we can withdraw our shares.

959
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,920
I'll go talk to Haihong about it, okay?

960
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,120
Don't withdraw it.

961
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,740
Why?

962
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:31,580
Our pride's on the line, that's why.

963
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,630
No one else is withdrawing.

964
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,750
If I withdraw now,

965
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,330
what will people think of me if this gets out?

966
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,010
Wouldn't I look petty?

967
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,100
So you know that too.

968
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,420
What do I not know?

969
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,610
Let me tell you.

970
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,520
People are social creatures.

971
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:46,930
No other creature is more sociable than us.

972
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,590
That's why even when

973
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,860
an individual clearly knows

974
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,060
the group is making a wrong decision,

975
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,550
in order to not be isolated from the group,

976
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,910
it is forced

977
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:58,450
to follow the group's wrong decision.

978
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,780
For example, the Second World War.

979
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,930
So many people were

980
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:02,730
against the war.

981
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,550
But if you throw them in Germany,

982
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,020
would they dare to speak up against the war?

983
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,690
They would be thrown into a concentration camp!

984
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:10,790
Let's still withdraw.

985
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:11,920
I'll go talk to them.

986
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,460
Come back.

987
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,190
I'll be join in this round, okay?

988
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,510
I'll stop.

989
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,660
It feels like someone forced you.

990
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,340
No.

991
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,480
No one forced me.

992
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,000
I did it willingly.

993
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,210
What are you looking at?

994
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,110
Have you reflected on yourself?

995
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,800
I confess.

996
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,610
This was written

997
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,360
by Haikuo.

998
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:48,450
I even bought him three sticks of ice cream.

999
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:49,490
I kept it a secret.

1000
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:53,500
How dare you do this?

1001
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:55,540
Was that beating too light?

1002
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:56,710
Help!

1003
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,400
Stop!

1004
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,070
Granny Ma!

1005
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:58,870
You naughty brat!

1006
00:36:58,870 --> 00:36:59,430
Stop!

1007
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:00,330
Help!

1008
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,620
Haikuo!

1009
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,150
Damn you!

1010
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:07,870
Are you really changing the ship?

1011
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:12,930
He said we can make more money with a bigger one.

1012
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:13,930
Why not?

1013
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,050
Is there that much demand?

1014
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,650
He said yes.

1015
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,310
What do you think?

1016
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,470
I'm just his lackey.

1017
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,150
Why should I care so much?

1018
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,390
He said it, so he must be right.

1019
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,740
You've worked with him for so many years.

1020
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,500
Don't you know anything?

1021
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:33,550
You're a man

1022
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,210
but you have no opinion of your own.

1023
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,440
What a loser.

1024
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,480
Of course I have my own opinions.

1025
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,030
It was my idea and opinion

1026
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,040
to marry you back then.

1027
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:46,950
So many people opposed it.

1028
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,610
I didn't listen to any of them.

1029
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,470
Who opposed it?

1030
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:51,730
Your mother?

1031
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,000
Your third uncle, or your fourth aunt?

1032
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,830
Listen, Xia Lao'er.

1033
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,190
You had no house and no car.

1034
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,690
It's a blessing to your family

1035
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:02,940
that a pure maiden like me

1036
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,930
married you.

1037
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,560
You claim you're the good fortune of our family,

1038
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,220
but that's just your opinion.

1039
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:19,150
Xia Lao'er!

1040
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,210
We agreed not to fight!

1041
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:21,970
Stop!

1042
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,170
Xia Lao'er, don't run!

1043
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,820
Explain yourself!

1044
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,540
You always hit me!

1045
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,360
I can't explain anything to you!

1046
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,750
Xia Lao'er, are you really leaving?

1047
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,400
Come back here!

1048
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,770
Xia Lao'er, you bastard!

1049
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:37,790
How dare you say such things!

1050
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,330
What are you laughing at?

1051
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:46,920
I'm watching the videos Haikuo took during the day.

1052
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,620
It's so fun.

1053
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:50,680
Seriously.

1054
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,900
You said such off-putting words

1055
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,640
in front of so many people.

1056
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,410
How can Dad be happy about it?

1057
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,520
It's my fault.

1058
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,670
Let me tell you.

1059
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,670
Dad's feelings for the canal

1060
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,980
is not the same as ours.

1061
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,120
We can invest

1062
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,750
in that new ship.

1063
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,090
It's not a big sum of money anyway.

1064
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,260
It's fine if we make a loss.

1065
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,700
As long as my dad is happy.

1066
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,880
Make a loss?

1067
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,580
Will he be okay with that?

1068
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:15,990
Seriously.

1069
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,210
All my dad

1070
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:19,470
cares about is the prosperity of the canal.

1071
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,800
He doesn't care about money.

1072
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,780
Think about it. He prospered

1073
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:23,750
and suffered before.

1074
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:24,730
He's been through ups and downs.

1075
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,950
Nothing really fazes him anymore.

1076
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:31,620
Given that every family has to chip in for the new ship,

1077
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,450
do you think Granny Ma still has money?

1078
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,660
You're right.

1079
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:39,140
She spent her all savings

1080
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,090
on her son's medical bills.

1081
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,600
But he still died.

1082
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,360
At this age,

1083
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,810
she still has to raise her granddaughter.

1084
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:47,970
It must be hard to get by.

1085
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,650
What's wrong, Siyi?

1086
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,040
Can't sleep?

1087
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,480
I'm thinking about things.

1088
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,900
At such a young age?

1089
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,530
What are you thinking about?

1090
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,630
Our ancestors were Italians.

1091
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,830
It was chaotic back then.

1092
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,490
Why did they come to China?

1093
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,570
Wasn't it better to stay at home?

1094
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,110
Okay.

1095
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,480
Come.

1096
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,190
Come to me.

1097
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,720
Let me tell you

1098
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:40,020
about your family.

1099
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:44,800
Your grandpa told me this story.

1100
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,890
He said that

1101
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,100
his grandfather

1102
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,180
was named Marford.

1103
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,140
He was indeed an Italian.

1104
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,400
During the war,

1105
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:00,580
in order to protect his wife and children,

1106
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:03,060
he stabbed the Japanese

1107
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:05,810
and killed two of them.

1108
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,320
But later,

1109
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:09,360
the Japanese released hounds

1110
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,250
to attack him.

1111
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,070
He was badly wounded.

1112
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,260
Before he died,

1113
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:16,920
he told his son

1114
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,580
that

1115
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,300
his brother

1116
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,800
was coming from Italy to see him.

1117
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:27,110
He was on a ship on the canal,

1118
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,100
cruising northwards.

1119
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:32,010
He asked your great-grandfather

1120
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,780
to find his brother no matter what.

1121
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,670
Since then,

1122
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:42,760
your great-grandpa led the family

1123
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:47,500
to head southwards.

1124
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:51,410
When he reached Linqing,

1125
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,390
your grandpa married me.

1126
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:59,340
I then followed him to continue further south.

1127
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,010
So we ended up here

1128
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,010
at Flower Street.

1129
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:06,570
Later,

1130
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:11,320
our Ma family settled here on Flower Street.

1131
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:15,070
What about the person Grandpa was looking for?

1132
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:16,130
Have you found him?

1133
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,040
It's been too many years.

1134
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,000
We can't find him anymore.

1135
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:30,280
So what if we found him?

1136
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,770
That's how people are.

1137
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,190
We all have feelings.

1138
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,970
Just like our courtyard.

1139
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,500
Look at the neighbors.

1140
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:46,090
We respect, care for and support one another.

1141
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:49,310
We aren't relatives, but we're closer than relatives.

1142
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,490
Some blood relatives

1143
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,120
don't contact each other for a long time.

1144
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,250
Gradually, the relationship fades.

1145
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,660
Just like my mom and I.
