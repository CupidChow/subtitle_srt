3
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,430
You know what?

4
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,070
Wanghe's trip to Beijing wasn't in vain.

5
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,520
He's actually changed his ways.

6
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,030
Really?

7
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,340
He's studying so diligently now.

8
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,450
He's been studying until midnight every day.

9
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,450
I don't know what's gotten into him.

10
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,870
He went to Beijing and

11
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,200
visited Zhongguancun,

12
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,180
which was eye-opening.

13
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,040
Now he feels he's not good enough.

14
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,190
How do you know?

15
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,420
Did he tell you that?

16
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,750
Why does he tell you everything?

17
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,759
He rolls his eyes whenever I ask him anything.

18
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,360
He needs a good beating.

19
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,790
But you always start arguing with him before he can say much.

20
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,850
Who would want to confide in you then?

21
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,560
He listens when you talk,

22
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,380
and you listen when he talks.

23
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,190
It's a different scenario with me.

24
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,310
Whatever I say,

25
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,930
he always argues back.

26
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,210
He's really nice to you, don't you think?

27
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,180
How is he nice to me?

28
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,079
All he does is piss me off.

29
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,270
Didn't she go out of town to film a movie?

Grandpa, you scared me.

32
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,980
What? Did you go to the Internet cafe again?

33
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,630
Wow, you got a lot of nice stuff.

Alright, you carry on then.

37
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,180
I'll head inside.

38
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,550
Don't go yet.

39
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,590
Stay here and chat with me for a while.

40
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,250

00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,270
Why didn't you tell me

45
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,430
you were coming back beforehand?

46
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,110
I would have picked you up.

47
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,070
You haven't eaten, have you? I'll make you a bowl of noodles.

48
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,590
I ate on the plane.

49
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,840
You've eaten?

50
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,550
What delicious food can there be on a plane?

51
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,400
I heard that

52
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,690
you didn't pass the audition for that show, huh?

53
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,120
The director has no taste.

54
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,290
He cast some young vixen.

55
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,770
I can tell she can't act at a glance.

56
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:04,960
Once they start filming,

57
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,510
I guarantee he'll regret it.

58
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,170
What kind of director is that?

59
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,860
This show is definitely not going to be good.

60
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,190
When the time comes, I'll inform everyone on Flower Street

61
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,210
not to watch it.

62
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
We'll make sure it gets low ratings.

63
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,390
So you're not leaving again this time, right?

64
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,040
Are there other shows you're auditioning for?

65
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,430
No.

66
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,950
It's Ai Linlin.

67
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,000
She has a friend

68
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,650
who left the TV station

69
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,590
and started his own film production company.

70
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,790
They need a producer.

71
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,580
What does that mean? So...

72
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,590
You're going to be a producer?

73
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,510
But you're an actress. You...

74
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,810
Zhimei.

75
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,830
Look.

76
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,880
You love acting,

77
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,670
and I support you.

78
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,390
You can go act, right?

79
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,860
But being a producer

80
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,070
is not something you can just do casually, right?

81
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,680
Think about all the money spent,

82
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,790
with such a large crew

83
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,870
and so many people involved.

84
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,270
What if it can't be aired?

85
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,030
What if the company loses money?

86
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,060
We won't be able to bear that responsibility.

87
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:12,590
So you...

88
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,960
You can't be a producer.

89
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,500
It's not that serious.

90
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,190
Let me just give it a try.

91
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,400
Maybe it'll work out.

92
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,590
A producer needs social experience.

93
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,140
I think I can do it.

94
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,240
As long as I stay in this industry,

95
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,820
there will always be opportunities to act in the future.

96
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,020
Don't worry about it.

I heard her complaining to Granny Ma.

Now there's less water

in the canal,

130
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,000
and the river has narrowed.

131
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,890
In the past, the canal was full of water,

132
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,680
with many ships and people coming and going. It was so lively.

133
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,320
No matter how good it is, it's just a river, isn't it?

134
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,910
Even a river knows to flow,

135
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,390
let alone people.

136

You know,

140
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,750
I often feel so stifled that

141
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,360
I can barely breathe.

142
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,060

Why don't you talk to Yanlin again

00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,490
about going out to explore some more?

147
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,909
I don't have the energy to venture out anymore.

148
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:34,290
As we go through life,

149
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,680
more and more things get in our way and tie us down.

150
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,210
Actually,

151
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,210
even in my dreams,

152
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,909
I think about going out to see the world again,

153
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:44,710
and to have some more adventure.

154
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,440
But if I leave,

155
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,380
what about this family?

156
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,020
What about the kid?

157
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,670
Alas, life.

158
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,280
It's too difficult.

159
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,130
You're right.

160
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,030
It's not easy.

161
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,980
Since then,

162
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,270
I've been hoping

163
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,520
that my mom could

164
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,470
muster the courage to leave this place one day.

165
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,070
I hope so too.

166
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,590
But

167
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,290
it's tough for your dad.

168
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,380
After all, you have a family.

169
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,820
You have a husband and a kid.

170
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,590
Yet you're constantly

171
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,320
out and about, not coming home.

172
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,720
Don't you think you are being a bit selfish?

173
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,690
Who are you calling selfish?

174
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:37,070
You're the selfish one, okay?

175
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,549
What did you tell me

176
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,679
when we got married?

177
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,070
You said when the kid got a bit older, you'd have your father take care of him,

178
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,429
and we'd return to Beijing to start our own business.

179
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:45,830
Have you forgotten what you said yourself?

180
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,390
What's so good about Beijing?

181
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,160
What's not good about Beijing?

182
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,640
Look at Flower Street.

183
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,910
Look at the canal.

184
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,640
How many people are still here?

185
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,620
People always strive for better things.

186
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,590
Big cities offer better opportunities.

187
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,630
Do you know how many ring roads Beijing has built so far?

188
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,390
Even if it had a hundred ring roads, it wouldn't matter to me.

189
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,010
I was born and raised here.

190
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,380
I just like it here.

191
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,090
I think the air here

192
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,610
is better than Beijing's.

193
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,720
Is that not okay?

194
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,710
Since I came back from Beijing,

195
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,900
I've been like a completely different person.

196
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,900
I've also been more energetic here.

197
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,890
Of course you feel different.

198
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,370
It's because you're in your element here.

199
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,770
But what about me?

200
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,830
I'm an actress.

201
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,120
I need a stage.

202
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,070
Is there a stage for me here?

203
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,630
I've been learning opera since I was little.

204
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,500
Opera is particularly demanding.

205
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,940
My teacher said I had no talent.

206
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,940
I was very unwilling to accept that.

207
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,430
I got up at four in the morning every day,

208
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,120
rain or shine, to practice.

209
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,030
I had only one belief in my heart,

210
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,990
and that was to perform on stage.

211
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,190
I have to go on stage no matter where it is!

212
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,420
I want everyone to see me,

213
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,440
to like me and admire me.

214
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,340
As soon as I get on stage,

215
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,020
I want there to be applause and flowers.

216
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,150
Only then would I truly be alive.

217
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,510
Only then could I feel alive.

218
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,870
Do you understand?

219
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,010
You don't understand me at all.

220
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,610
I'm sorry, Zhimei.

221
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,350
I indeed failed to provide you with

222
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,810
a stage that's big enough.

223
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,790
If you feel that

224
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,930
this family is a burden to you,

225
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,030
we can get a divorce.

226
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,910
Let's get divorced.

227
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,480

228

Here.

235
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,610
I made chicken soup for you. Have some.

Siyi.

00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,070

♫Have you changed?♫

248

00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,950
Are you feeling unwell again?

250

♫How many years♫

251
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,590

♫How far has the old times♫

253
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,390
Don't be nervous.

00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,470

00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,010
♫We miss gone♫

256
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,230
talk to you about your mother.

♫I was lost in a distance♫

258
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,850
What about her now?

259
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,870
She came to see me.

260
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,100
♫I couldn't forget♫

261
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,030
She said

262
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,200
she still wanted to go south and explore.

263
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,570
♫The first growth♫

264
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,110
Some of her friends are going with her.

265
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,430
Let her be.

266
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,510
I don't care about her business.

267
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,290
She said

268
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,500
she wanted to let your little brother stay here with us.

269
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,820
Is she crazy?

270
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,420
That boy isn't even related to you by blood.

271
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,820
And he has his own father.

272
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,950
Well, as for Ge,

273
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,440
she said he was arrested and sentenced

274
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,670
for organizing gambling.

275
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,710
And with your mother going south,

276
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,380
there's no one to take care of your little brother.

277
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,790
Then let his own grandmother take care of him.

278
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,710
You're my grandma.

279
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,150
Why should you take care of someone else's grandson?

280
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,410
Do we owe him anything?

281
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,560
It's only for a year.

282
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,950
Not even for a month.

283
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,810
I absolutely disagree with this.

284
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,500
Siyi.

285
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,230
Your mother has had it tough too.

286
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,270
So do I or you have it easy?

287
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,860
She knows very well that I'm preparing for the college entrance exam,

288
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,710
yet she pulls this stunt.

289
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,670
What does she want?

290
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,230
Is she my real mother or not?

291
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,080
Don't yell.

292
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,070
Look at you.

293
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,230
I'm just discussing with you.

294
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,110
Look at us.

295
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,070
We have rent to collect,

296
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,510
and I can work at my stall,

297
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,270
right?

298
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,230
Grandma, you've had a stroke.

299
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,160
How can you still work at the stall?

300
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,230
Kind people are always taken advantage of.

301
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,630
It's not that big a deal. Just an extra pair of chopsticks on the table, right?

302
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,670
It's fine.

303
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,790
It's not fine by me!

304
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,440
I just can't accept it!

305
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,710
She dumped me here with you back then.

306
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,470
All these years, she has barely

307
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,030
ever come back to see me.

308
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,760
How could she have the nerve to ask you this favor?

309
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,070
Siyi.

310
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,070
I'm uneducated,

311
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,930
and I don't know many characters,

312
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,400
but I do know the character for "person."

313
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,130
One stroke leans left, and one leans right.

314
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,840
It means a person can't stand alone.

315
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,310
We need to support each other.

316
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,270
Your mother is also unlucky.

317
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,270
When she was little, her brother didn't care for her,

318
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,950
and her mother didn't love her.

319
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,150
She finally married your father,

320
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,870
had a few good years,

321
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,790
but then your father passed away too soon.

322
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,310
You are her own daughter,

323
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:22,310
and I was once a mother-in-law who loved her.

324
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,150
So tell me, if we don't help her now, who will?

325
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,510
Grandma.

326
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,290
I'm also annoyed with her,

327
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,640
but I have to thank her.

328
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,270
She gave birth to

329
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,720
the best granddaughter in the world.

330
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,530
I owe her.

331
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,450
So I have to pay her back.

332
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,200
Why should we?

333
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,510
Son, I'm home.

334
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,920
Did you bring me a gift?

335
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,960
I was in too much of a hurry this time.

336
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,890
Maybe next time.

337
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,290
When are you leaving?

338
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:38,070
Aren't you going to Beijing to work?

339
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,940
Your dad told you everything?

340
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,300
No.

341
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,210
You two had a fight,

342
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,650
and I assume it could only be because of this.

343
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,190
I'm not leaving for now.

344
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,910
Not before your college entrance exam.

345
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,700
You should go.

346
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,650
Don't use me as an excuse.

347
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,600
Even if you're here, I won't get into Tsinghua.

348
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,850
And without you here, I won't fail either.

349
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,590
You don't object to me going to Beijing?

350
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,670
You're my mom.

351
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,740
If you're happy, I'm happy.

352
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,680
If you feel suffocated

353
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,070
in this family,

354
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,250
then go somewhere else

355
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,820
and get some fresh air.

356
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,500
Grandpa is right.

357
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,110
Everyone

358
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,510
has the wish and right

359
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,150
to change their own fate.

360
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,590
Thank you, Son.

361
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:16,810
Mom.

362
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,490
Even if

363
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,690
you two get divorced,

364
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,870
you'll always be my mom.

365
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,790
When I was little,

366
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,640
I was afraid of you leaving

367
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,560
because I feared you would abandon me.

368
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,160
Now,

369
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,030
I've grown up.

370
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,550
So,

371
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,510
feel free to fly, Mom.

372
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,380
Fly to the highest sky.

373
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,810
Thank you, Son.

374
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,190
It's easy to get drunk

375
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,650
drinking alone.

376
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,840
You're off work.

377
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,070
Your wife's back?

378
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,570
But she's leaving again.

379
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:50,970
Again?

380
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:51,820
Where to?

381
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,820
Beijing.

382
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,660
She said a film production company

383
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,750
asked her to work there as a producer.

384
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,320
What does a producer do?

385
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,020
In charge of all sorts of things in the production crew, I guess.

386
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,420
I don't know the details.

387
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,800
Can she make money from it?

388
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,240
Our family's problem isn't about money.

389
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,450
So... What is it about?

390
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,780
Let's not talk about it.

391
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,550
I'm filled with anger

392
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,590
that I can't vent.

393
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,520
Come on. Cheers.

394
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,720
The past two years have been suffocating.

395
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,380
I'm also feeling suffocated these days.

396
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:42,470
What's wrong?

397
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,740
Did something happen to your family too?

398
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,040
You've been to big cities,

399
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,990
and you're more educated than I am.

400
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,430
Help me analyze.

401
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,470
Do you think there's still hope

402
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,380
for this canal?

403
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,250
There is.

404
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,740
How so?

405
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,230
The Grand Canal

406
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,110
is nominated for World Heritage status, you know?

407
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:19,310
W-What does 'nominated for World Heritage status' mean?

408
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,970
Being nominated for World Heritage status

409
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,980
means it's applying to be included in the World Cultural Heritage Protection List.

410
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,550
Once it makes it onto the list,

411
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,960
the Grand Canal, as a World Cultural Heritage site,

412
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,530
will be protected.

413
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,670
This way, it'll prosper again.

414
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,460
Are you serious?

415
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,340
Of course.

416
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,030
Look.

417
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,090
Last year,

418
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,870
the Grand Canal has already

419
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,990
been included in our country's tentative list for World Heritage nomination.

420
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:44,790
But of course,

421
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,680
whether the Canal can make it to the final list

422
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,210
depends on our own efforts.

423
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:51,510
Really?

424
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,330
Sure.

425
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:54,500
Look.

426
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,030
I'm so lucky to have come to see you

427
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,630
and asked you that question.

428
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,810
Fortunately,

429
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,390
I haven't sold my ship yet.

430
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,060
You'll have to sell that ship of yours.

431
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,310
Why?

432
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,120
Isn't the canal being nominated for World Heritage status?

433
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,190
It's exactly because of the World Heritage nomination.

434
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,550
If it really makes it onto the list,

435
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,110
the Grand Canal will be protected, right?

436
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,950
In the future, ships like yours that burn diesel

437
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,720
and those that cause severe pollution

438
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,150
will all be phased out.

439
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,370
Think about your ship.

440
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,090
It's seven years old.

441
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,130
You still want to keep it?

442
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,030
I'm telling you,

443
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,630
you could be fined to death when the time comes.

444
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,710

445

This... This...

446
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,040
Boss Xie, I know you feel upset.

447
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,170
I'm upset too.

448
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,870
Look at our Flower Street.

449
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,220
In these past few years,

450
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,890
it's lost its vitality.

451
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,730
Life is getting harder and harder.

452
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,020
But I'm just unwilling to leave.

453
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,670
Do you know why?

454
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,440
Because this is our home.

455
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,440
Our root!

456
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,670
How can I leave, right?

457
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,070
But of course,

458
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,020
as humans,

459
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,090
we must keep up with the times.

460
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,110
So, Boss Xie,

461
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,140
you should come ashore first.

462
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,830
Watch over this Grand Canal,

463
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,430
and wait for it to revive again.

464
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,570
When that day comes,

465
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,970
you can go back to the river.

466
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:39,970
That'll do, right?

467
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,060
Can we really go back?

468
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,250
Yes, we can.

469
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,870
We can make it back.

00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:25,160
Good job.

512
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,630
You passed on the first try.

513
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,560
That's because you taught me well.

514
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,640
Before this,

515
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:35,000
you really had never learned to drive?

516
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,280
I'm just a quick learner.

517
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,690
If you don't believe me, get a plane.

518
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:39,530
Let's see

519
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,330
how soon I can learn to fly it.

520
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,460
You're really something.

521
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,320
Liang,

522
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,180
for long-distance driving,

523
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,240
besides the truck,

524
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,770
there's something else you need to prepare.

525
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,150
What is it?

526
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,760
Good to go?

527
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,430
Mr. Chen.

528
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,700
Let me drive. You should get some sleep.

529
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,180
Okay.

530
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:03,730
Here.

531
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:14,540
Alright.

532
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:03,920
Dad.

533
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,190
Can't you drink less?

534
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,840
Your snoring is too loud.

535
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,150
Even your mother can't stop me.

536
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,150
You think you can?

537
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:17,270
I'm saying this for your own good.

538
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:19,000
It would be fine if you drink some good liquor,

539
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,570
but what kind of alcohol have you been drinking?

540
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,900
It's bad for your liver.

541
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,000
I feel uncomfortable if I don't drink,

542
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,350
but I feel worse after drinking.

543
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,660
Do you really want to sell that ship?

544
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,180
I do!

545
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,610
Tell me the truth.

546
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,260
If you don't want to sell it,

547
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,370
I'll figure something out and

548
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,300
try my best to keep the boat for you.

549
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,320
I can't keep it anymore.

550
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,030
You know,

551
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,390
one can't fight against fate.

552
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:13,970
Let me tell you.

553
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,220
Your father is a hero on the river,

554
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:16,880
but on land,

555
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,010
I'm no coward either.

556
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,670
Alright, let's sell it then.

557
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,710
I've found a buyer for you

558
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,590
online.

559
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,660
120,000.

560
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,710
Really?

561
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,540
The buyer is in Linqing.

562
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,470
He's engaged in earthwork business,

563
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,430
and he's in urgent need of second-hand ships.

564
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:38,480
There's only one condition:

565
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,830
payment upon delivery of the ship.

566
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,870
But what if he changes his mind

567
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,600
when we deliver the ship there?

568
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,340
I've checked the buyer's transaction history.

569
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,340
Last month alone,

570
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,560
they bought eight second-hand ships.

571
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,220
How about you give it more thought?

572
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,950
If you really decide to sell it,

573
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,730
I'll ask Uncle Xia

574
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,890
to go to Linqing and hand over the ship.

575
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:29,670

Don't worry, Boss Xie.

583

Go back.

584
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,280
Go back, Boss Xie.

00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:09,530
Okay.

590
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,060
You don't want some beer?

591
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,910
We have beer.

592
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,810
Beer is perfect for summer.

593
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,770
Come on, come on.

594
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,510
Let's have another bottle.

595
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,230
You're getting more?

596
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:17,670
Yeah.

597
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,270
There's enough.

598
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,860
Today we must

599
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:20,960
drink our fill.

600
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,880
Today, this...

601
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:22,910
Here.

602
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,480
Beers and drinks.

603
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:25,960
Come on.

604
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:26,990
Yanlin.

605
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:28,660
What's the special occasion today?

606
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,710
Everything's so lavish.

607
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,790
There's both wine and meat.

608
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,060
Indeed.

609
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,070
So extravagant.

610
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:35,270
Boss Xie bought all this meat.

611
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,110
As for the specific reason,

612
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,620
you can ask him yourselves when he comes back.

613
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,820
Is that so?

614
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:40,670
Let's eat.

615
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,660
Let's help ourselves.

616
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,350
Take it slow.

617
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,470
We should start drinking after Boss Xie comes back.

618
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,510
That's right.

619
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,760
You've started without me?

620
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,280
Boss Xie, you're back.

621
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,470
Come on, have a seat.

622
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,370
Eat.

623
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,430
We were just talking about it.

624
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,630
What's the occasion?

625
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,480
You've bought both wine and meat.

626
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,510
I'll say a few words then.

627
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,470
Um...

628
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,420
Well...

629
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,430
Well...

630
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:01,450
As you all know, over the past years,

631
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,580
seafaring hasn't been easy.

632
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,930
The longer we stay in the business,

633
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:06,060
the more we'll lose.

634
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,550
So

635
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:10,470
my wife and I decided to sell the ship.

636
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:11,780
We sold it.

637
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,270
But it didn't sell for much.

638
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,580
Only 120,000.

639
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,950
The two of us

640
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,170
thought we'd give

641
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,040
the money to you

642
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,920
according to your share.

643
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,670
Mr. Zhou, here's your share.

644
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,400
Thank you.

645
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,380
Well,

646
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,890
we've calculated carefully.

647
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:30,890
Plus the dividends from previous years,

648
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,670
fortunately,

649
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,190
you all

650
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,750
didn't lose money in this investment.

651
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,100
Well, that's already a blessing.

652
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,160
That's great.

653
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:42,660
What about yours?

654
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:44,470
We...

655
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,510
We won't keep any.

656
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:46,270
That won't do.

657
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,390
That's not acceptable.

658
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:49,220
This won't do, Boss Xie.

659
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,750
You've worked the hardest all these years.

660
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,070
That's right.

661
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:51,990
You were the one taking care of the business.

662
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,640
You're the one who's been making all the money.

663
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,170
Boss Xie.

664
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:56,250
We all know what kind of person you are.

665
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,170
You are loyal

666
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,060
and dignified.

667
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:58,920
Everyone knows

668
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,240
you never owe anyone a penny.

669
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,630
You only shortchange yourself.

670
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:05,330
You've worked extremely hard

671
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,610
for us all these years.

672
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,170
So we can't let your family suffer losses.

673
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:08,720
That won't do.

674
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,750
Yes, right.

675
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:10,770
That won't do.

676
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:11,740
See?

677
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:12,740
I told you

678
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,190
they'd definitely disagree.

679
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,110
So,

680
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,040
as I said before,

681
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,800
when we make money, everyone's in it together;

682
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,860
and when we lose money, everyone is still in it together.

683
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,340
Right.

684
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,170
Exactly.

685
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,310
It's a business matter after all.

686
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,920
It's about fairness.

687
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,910
The fairest way is to divide the money according to shares.

688
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:29,020
No more, no less.

689
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,670
As for this money,

690
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:31,930
we'll take

691
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,090
what belongs to us.

692
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,290
But we won't take

693
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,780
any money that we don't deserve.

694
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,240
That's right.

695
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:37,950
That's right.

696
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,170

00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,250
you'll be more easily accepted by clients,

854
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,190
and it'll be easier for you to make friends.

855
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,940
You just lack experience now.

856
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,840
When you figure out

857
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,640
what you want to do in the future,

858
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,730
you'll have an advantage.

859
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:44,330
You'll be faster than others

860
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,560
in gaining resources and connections.

861
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,430
Are you serious?

862
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,700
Don't lie to me.

863
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,500
Of course. Why would I lie to you?

864
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,300
You know what?

865
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,710
When you come to Beijing in the future, come work with me.

866
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,120
It's not because we're close,

867
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,320
but because I think you have potential.

868
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,790
Then what about Siyi?

869
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,780
Her?

870
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:18,770
With her personality,

871
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,260
she's suitable for academic work,

872
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,860
not for starting a business.

873
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,630
Will she be in your future?

874
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:30,400
What do you mean?

875
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:34,260
You won't start a business with her,

876
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,000
but what about other things?

877
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,570
What other things?

878
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,230
Like relationship and such.

879
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:53,490
Fenghua.

880
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:55,410
You watch too many soap operas.

881
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:57,190
Your IQ is not high in the first place.

882
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:59,920
You'll become an idiot if you keep watching them.

883
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:04,030
Who are you talking about?

884
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:04,830
Say that again.

885
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:06,190
-Who are you calling an idiot?
-I'm wrong. I'm wrong.

886
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:07,990
-Are you wrong or not?
-I am. I am.
