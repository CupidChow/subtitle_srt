About Siyi repeating a year,

5
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,110
I've been thinking,

6
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:51,320
our family will cover

7
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,630
the tuition fees.

8
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,420
Let's not have the other families pay.

9
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,229
What do you think?

10
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,710
Money is not a problem.

11
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,680
The key is her mentality.

12
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,470
Siyi takes things to heart.

13
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,470
It's hard to say if she'll agree to repeat a year.

14
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:10,789
If she doesn't repeat, what will she do?

15
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,940
She can't just waste time, can she?

16
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,590
Kindness can turn into resentment.

17
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,910
We also have to take into account the kid's psychological endurance,

18
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,190
don't we?

19
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,560
Raising one daughter

20
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,960
or two, there's no big difference.

21
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,790
At worst, we'll tighten our belts for two years.

22
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,579
We have to support Siyi through university no matter what,

23
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:31,560
right?

24
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,460
Even Fenghua isn't going to university.

25
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,620
You want to support Gu Siyi through university? Are you doing too well yourself?

26
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,480
Well, Fenghua isn't going to university

27
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,740
because she can't get in.

28
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,110
If she could get in,

29
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,760
I'd sell my blood to support her if I had to.

30
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,430
That goes without saying.

31
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,550
If Siyi doesn't want to go to university,

32
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,480
then let her be.

33
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,770
She can open a small shop with Fenghua in the future

34
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,030
and do some small business.

35
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,550
They can split the profits evenly.

36
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,350
In a couple of years, if she's getting married,

37
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,710
we'll scrimp and save

38
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,870
to prepare her dowry.

39
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,470
That would be enough as a neighbor, right?

40
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,740
No matter how much we want to help Siyi,

41
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,270

00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,340
What?

351
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,090
Where's the money?

352
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,060
Don't worry.

353
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:37,830
It's the only one in Beijing.

354
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,120
It's absolutely authentic. Hurry up.

355
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,340
Are you sure it can be verified?

356
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,710
It's registered on the Ministry of Education's website.

357
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,550
Otherwise, would I dare to sell it for 20,000?

358
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,970
Come on, 20,000 is too expensive, bro.

359
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,190
Can't you give me a better price?

360
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,510
Do you know what you're saying?

361
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,340
You think 20,000 for a doctorate is expensive?

362
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,830
Do you know how much it costs to actually get a doctorate?

363
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:58,300
Hurry up.

364

You've got to let me see the sample first, right?

Are you sure you'll buy it?

369
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:11,750
Yes, I'm sure.

370

You know what?

371
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,600
This does look quite real.

372
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,710

[Xingchi]

396
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,740
Judging from the current market demand,

397
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,870
Java is still the mainstream.

398
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,030
The underlying logic

399
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,320
of most commercial websites in the market today

400
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,070
is still primarily based on

401
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:35,920
Java.

402
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,110
So, Java's application platforms

403
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,500
include Java SE, Java EE,

404
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,620
and Java ME.

405
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,620
In common application areas,

406
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,390
it's obvious that

407
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,110
web applications are still dominant.

A headhunting company wanted to poach me.

441
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,330
We chatted for a bit.

442
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,880
Which company is it this time?

443
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:17,640
I didn't ask.

444
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,170
I guess it's either Yuntu or Eat Well.

445
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,760
Now everyone has realized the importance of ground promotion.

446
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,300
Many people in the ground promotion team I led before

447
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,620
have been poached.

448
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,390
Their salaries are now double what we offer.

449
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:28,510
Come on.

450
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:29,190
Look at that.

451
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,350
We've covered several more places.

452
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,720
Make sure you retain our core staff.

453
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,910
For someone at my level,

454
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,510
with stock options, it should be okay.

455
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,510
As for the lower-level staff, we still need to retain them with salaries.

456
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,930
And the top priority after that

457
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,110
is to refine management and training.

458
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,220
I have complied

459
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,270
the training manual for ground promotion.

460
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,460
I will arrange personnel to implement it step by step.

461
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,640
Good. It's very thorough.

462
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,860
We've had a pretty high market share in second and third-tier cities.

463
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:58,080
Next step, we're going to target first-tier cities.

464
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,070
From now on, you'll be based in Beijing.

465
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,150
Help me keep an eye on the business,

466
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,270
especially in Haidian.

467
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,660
Can you give me another district?

468
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,490
No.

469
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,450
You have concerns?

470
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,830
Qiu Lin, Chief of Haidian Distribution Station,

471
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,160
is Song's brother-in-law.

472
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,290
And Song is a veteran in our company.

473
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,570
It's impossible to handle.

474
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,500
Veteran.

475
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,150
What does being a veteran matter?

476
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,730
Even the company

477
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,360
is at a critical moment of survival.

478
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,600
Face-saving

479
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,030
isn't that important.

480
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,300
What will be my main responsibilities

481
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,390
after I relocate to Haidian?

482
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,300
In the shortest time possible,

483
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,270
increase our market share

484
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,160
to over 50%.

485
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:55,990
To achieve this,

486
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,580
you can use any means necessary.

487
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,050
Can I go against Song?

488
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,090
Why are you already thinking about flipping the table before you even arrive?

489
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:02,930
It's not like that.

490
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,580
If he doesn't cause me any trouble,

491
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,890
I certainly won't let him lose face.

492
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:09,440
But if he gets in the way of my work,

493
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,040
then don't blame me for not respecting the elderly.

494
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,220
Otherwise, I can't do the job.

495
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,830
I only care about market share.

496
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,640
On this premise,

497
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,140
there're no constraints.

498
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,130
Alright.

499
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,250
I was waiting for you to say that.

500
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,120
If I can't increase the market share to 50%,

501
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,040
you can fire me.

502
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,990
You said it.

503
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,750
Stand up straight.

504
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,560
Other than this,

505
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,440
don't you have any other means of making a living?

506
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:54,430
I do.

507
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,540
I used to run a karaoke bar.

508
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,460
and it closed down.

509
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:02,270
I also worked as a real estate agent.

510
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,430
I didn't make any money from that either.

511
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,730
Illegal money-making businesses

512
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,320
are all written in the law.

513
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,780
I'm not that greedy for money.

But

515
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,270
at least I have to survive, right?

516
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,670
There are so many people working in Beijing.

517
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,120
Did they all starve to death since they didn't take shortcuts?

518
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,650
Don't try to persuade me.

519
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,250
If I had any other way out,

520
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,020
I wouldn't have risked my own future.

521
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:19,950
Don't you agree?

Shao Xingchi, come out.

524
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:37,490
Let's go.

525
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,520
Officer Xia, I've brought him here.

526
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,420
Untie him.

527
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,280
Fill out the form first, then complete the procedures.

528
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,130
Keep your phone turned on.

Officer Xia.

530
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,140
What if my phone runs out of battery?

531
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,270
Are you crazy?

532
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,110
You're addicted to coming to the police station, aren't you?

533
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,010
Let's complete the procedures first.

-Let's talk outside.
-Alright, alright.

Who's going to process the paperwork?

536
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:03,250
I'll do it.

537
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:03,630
Come with me.

538
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,080
What are you going to do next?

539
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:28,720
None of your business.

540
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,140
Xingchi.

541
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,830
The police have already warned you.

542
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,980
If you don't change your line of work, you'll get detained again.

543
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:44,990
If you keep doing this,

544
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,680
I'll call your mother.

545
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,950
When I was learning how to modify cars,

546
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,150
I got burned by the exhaust pipe and got this scar.

547
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,160
This one was from

548
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,990
when I was running a karaoke bar. Someone got drunk

549
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:08,590
and stabbed me.

550
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,210
And this scar on my leg.

551
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,720
You deserve it.

552
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,760
It's all your own doing.

553
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,390
Do you know how I've been living?

554
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,220
My pirated DVD store got raided.

555
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,670
My street vending cart was confiscated by city inspectors.

556
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,750
I finally saved enough money to open a karaoke bar with some friends,

557
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:39,910
and someone was caught doing drugs inside.

558
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,350
So it got shut down!

559
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,750
Since I came to Beijing,

560
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,650
not a single thing has gone my way!

561
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,920
You can't blame others

562
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,860
for not doing well yourself.

563
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,910
You only have yourself to blame.

564
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,450
It's only been a few years.

565
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,740
How did he become like this?

566

Mom.

567
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:24,840
Son, why was your phone turned off?

568
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,580
I was in a meeting just now.

569
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,750
Where are you?

570
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,140
Your dad and I are resting by the roadside.

571
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,320
What's Dad doing?

572
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,420
He's changing the tire.

573
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,400
Son, how have you been lately?

574
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,790
Is your stomach still acting up?

575
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:37,910
I'm fine.

576
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,680
I had to wine and dine some clients in the past couple of days.

577
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,320
I'll take some stomach medicine, and I'll be fine.

578
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,720
You shouldn't take too much Western medicine.

579
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,590
You should see a traditional Chinese doctor for treatment.

580
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,520
I've seen one. Don't worry.

581
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,520
By the way, check your card.

582
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,820
I transferred some money to you yesterday.

583
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,070
I've received it.

584
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,390
With this money you sent

585
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,900
and this run we're making,

586
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,960
our family's debts will be completely cleared.

587
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,060
That's good.

588
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,360
This way, you and Dad can make fewer runs from now on.

589
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,750
Don't work so hard.

590
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,990
We'd just be sitting idle at home anyway.

591
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,570
At least we can enjoy the scenery while driving.

592
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,390
Alright.

593
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,270
Don't worry about your dad and me.

594
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,550
Just take good care of

595
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:14,740
your own health.

596
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,750
Okay.

597
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,970
There's no need to worry about me.

598
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:18,940
Keep an eye on Dad.

599
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,370
He's hot-tempered.

600
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,960
Keep an eye on him.

601
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,210
Okay. Okay.

602
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,460
Bye-bye.

603
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,720
Who was that?

604
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,960
Our son. Who else could it be?

605
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,140
How is he?

606
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,720
Same as always.

607
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,260
He only tells us good news and never bad news.

608
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,690
He never tells us the truth.

609
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,990
If we want to know what's really going on with him...

610
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,030
Don't get your hands dirty.

611
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,620
We'd have to ask those kids he hangs out with.

612
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:45,020
Weren't we also like that when we were young?

613
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,290
No matter how tough and tiring it was out there,

614
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,450
we had to endure it ourselves.

615
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,490
When we got home,

616
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,070
we could brag all we wanted.

617
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,920
With the money our son sent us,

618
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,390
our family's debts will be cleared.

619
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,500
After we complete this run,

620
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,650
let's take a break.

621
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,500
Here's what I'm thinking.

622
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,840
Look.

623
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,800
Our son has come of age.

624
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,190
It's time for him to get married.

625
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,400
What if they want to buy a house in Beijing?

626
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,270
We can't

627
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,700
contribute nothing, right?

628
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,110
Forget about taking a break then.

629
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:15,230
Let's keep working.

630
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,590
Why didn't your parents think of

631
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:19,830
buying you a house back then?

632
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:22,200
We've been renting for so many years.

633
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,870
Stop saying useless things.

634
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,670
Back then, it was...

635
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,320
Don't get your hands dirty. Give it to me.

636
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,870
Back then, the government allotted the house to us.

637
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,820
Now, to buy a house,

638
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,370
the whole family would be exhausted to death.

639
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,710
Your son definitely won't be like that.

640
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:34,470
I believe in him.

641
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,660
He's definitely better than you.

642
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,000
You are always right.

You're here.

You don't have to

647
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,810
bring gifts.

648
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,550
How could I come empty-handed?

649
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,350
About Xingchi's matter,

650
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:00,170
it's not that I don't agree.

651
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,300
The point is

652
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:04,850
whether he's willing to learn this craft or not.

653
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,220
Whether he wants to or not,

654
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,980
he has to learn.

655
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,690
If he doesn't learn, I'll break his legs.

656
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,070
Isn't he doing pretty well in Beijing?

657
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,440
Why are you urging him to come back?

658
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,590
Don't get me started.

659
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:18,990
If he doesn't come back soon,

660
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,950
his mother and I will worry ourselves to death.

661
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:22,960
What happened?

662
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,390
I don't mind telling you.

663
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,380
You know, when Xingchi

664
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,630
was a kid,

665
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,480
he was quite well-behaved.

666
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,070
But since he went to Beijing,

667
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,540
he's been causing trouble every other day.

668
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,960
He's been arrested and taken to the police station two or three times already.

669
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,440
Every time he'd say

670
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,510
it wasn't his fault.

671
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:42,570
He was just unlucky.

672
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,830
But you know,

673
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,950
other kids don't get themselves into that kind of trouble.

674
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,860
You know what kind of person I am.

675
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,230
I don't easily ask for favors.

00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,750
Mr. Du,

678
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,440
you really need to help me.

All the clothes here in my shop

682
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,900
are hand-embroidered.

683
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,140
They need it urgently.

684
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,680
I don't want to cause delays for them.

685
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,820
Please take your time to choose.

686
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,020
How did it go?

687
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,280
Mr. Du agreed.

688
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,510
That's great!

689
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,420
Give him a call

690
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,300
and ask him to come back quickly.

691
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,230
Okay.

692
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:27,080
I'll be off then.

693
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,390
Where are you going?

694
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,980
I'm going to the sunken ship.

695
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:32,180
Chen and Mr. Zhou are waiting for me there.

696
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,540
They said they had a new discovery.

697
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:34,350
I'm off then.

698
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,970
The sunken ship is even more important than your son.

699
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,270
Hello.

700
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,430
The subscriber you dialed is power off.

701
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:54,110
The canal in Tongzhou is different from what I thought.

702
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,650
It's quite beautiful at night.

703
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,340
You might as well open a restaurant.

704
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:03,940
We'll chip in some money for you.

705
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,000
Find a good location

706
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,190
and open a Huaiyang snack shop.

707
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,040
It won't make money.

708
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,510
How do you know it won't make money if you haven't tried?

709
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,870
Your cooking skills are so good.

710
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,590
If you have something to say, just say it.

711
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,020
I'm not that thin-skinned.

712
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,170
Is everything okay between them?

713
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,750
Yes.

714
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,510
I've already criticized Xingchi.

715
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,820
What did he say?

716
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,410
He believes he did nothing wrong.

717
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,380
Stubborn as hell.

718
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,700
For this kind of thing, we still need Wanghe to step in.

719
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,960
Do you believe those two could actually fight?

720
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,430
It can't be that bad, right?

721
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,960
They're as close as brothers after all.

722
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:35,920
What do you want to bet on?

723
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,850
Can't you just stay out of trouble?

724
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,600
Would it kill you to make some honest money?

725
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,830
There are so many people forging certificates.

726
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,170
Why am I the only one getting caught?

727
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,440
I'm contributing to society, right?

728
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,780
What's wrong with helping increase the employment rate?

729
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:48,090
I don't blame Fenghua for not understanding me.

730
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,680
I accept that.

731
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,390
How can you, Mr. Know-it-all, not tell right from wrong?

732
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,380
What kind of bullshit theory is this?

733
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,700
I can't tell right from wrong?

734
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:54,780
Bro,

735
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,680
how many messes have you made over these years?

736
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,280
Do you want me to list them all out for you?

737
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,220
And I'm the one that can't tell right from wrong?

738
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,500
It's always the same old story with you.

739
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,700
Are you senile or something?

740
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,740
Let's eat!

741
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,770
Aren't you hungry?

742
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,840
Wait a moment.

743
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,980
I've got something nice to show you.

744
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,210
[Graduation Certificate]

745
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,730
[Graduation Certificate]

746
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,120
Not bad, Fenghua.

747
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,940
You've finally grown a brain.

748
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:36,930
Just a moment.

749
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,240
Well done!

750
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,710
Name: Xia Fenghua.

751
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,780
Major: Business Management.

752
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:45,410
Self-study Higher Education Examination for Bachelor's Degree.

753
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,230
Passed all courses.

754
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,260
Approved for graduation.

755
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:50,130
Well done!

756
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,710
Come on, everyone.

757
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:56,300
Let's raise a toast to Ms. Xia.

758
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,230
Cheers!

759
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,060
Congratulations!

760
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,780
Is a self-study diploma also considered a diploma?

761
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,710
Xingchi, seriously?

762
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,510
With her diploma, would you let her come for an interview at your company?

763
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:08,330
I'm doing well with my own business.

764
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,610
Why would I interview at his company?

765
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,510
You've started your own business, why bother getting a diploma?

766
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,600
You must have too much time on your hands.

767
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,520
Xingchi, you're not doing badly because of us, right?

768
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,670
It has nothing to do with you.

769
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,679
I'm just unlucky!

770
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,070
It has nothing to do with any of you!

771
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,500
Then why are you like this all day?

772
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,510
Being all sarcastic

773
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,630
and having such an odd way of speaking!

774
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,710
As if we owe you something!

775
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,270
Stop it!

776
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,310
Let him speak!

777
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,420
A successful person, aren't you?

778
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:29,070
Give us backward folks

779
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,550
some advanced advice!

780
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,429
How much motivational crap do you have?

781
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,030
I'll take it all!

782
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,270
You bastard, Shao Xingchi!

783
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,480
Can't you stop fighting?

784
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,040
Are you two still high school students?

785
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:40,580
Sit down. Sit down.

786
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,330
You work in Haidian.

787
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,270
Why do you live so far away from work?

788
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,020
Don't you think

789
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,900
the smell here is similar to home?

790
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,070
If there were a ship,

791
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,750
we could sail

792
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,080
all the way home along the river.

793
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,090
You guys

794
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,560
must look down on me, right?

795
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:38,500
Yes.

796
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,070
You've been causing trouble these past two years.

797
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,220
When we tell you off,

798
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,900
we don't feel good about it either.

799
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,920
Then don't say anything.

800
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,250
I know what I'm doing.

801
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,630
You know what you're doing?

802
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,500
I don't even want to bother talking to you.

803
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:54,490
Yeah.

804
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,340
I got caught making fake IDs this time.

805
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,130
But it gave me a new idea.

806
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,580
What idea?

807
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,160
When I save up enough money,

808
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,710
I'll find some diploma mills abroad.

809
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:06,620
They're all real.

810
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,120
The certificates will all be genuine.

811
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,370
Let's see how the police can catch me then.

812
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,720
Can't you find some other way?

813
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,120
This is too risky.

814
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,280
As long as you're willing to work hard

815
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,450
and not try to exploit legal loopholes,

816
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,740
we'll all support you.

817
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,810
Who has the time to bother with you anyway?

818
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,850
We know you're in a bad state of mind,

819
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:24,570
and you feel anxious.

820
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:26,500
But we haven't made it big either.

821
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:27,830
We're also working hard from dawn to dusk,

822
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:28,790
gritting our teeth and pushing forward, aren't we?

823
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,230
You all went to prestigious universities.

824
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,940
After a few years of hard work,

825
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,770
you'll all have bright futures.

826
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,870
So what?

827
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,660
Is Fenghua a graduate from a famous university?

828
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,730
Look at her. With her IQ,

829
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,430
she couldn't even understand basic arithmetic.

830
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,390
But at this age,

831
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,100
she managed to self-study and get a degree.

832
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,630
You didn't support or encourage her,

833
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:46,960
and even made sarcastic remarks instead.

834
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,780
Do you think you're doing the right thing?

835
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,850
I'll go kowtow to her.

836
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:53,720
Stop it.

837
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,090
Can't you read the room?

838
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,790
Just try not to upset her again in the future.

839
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,280
Oh, right.

840
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,550
This.

841
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:18,370
For you.

842
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:20,560
What is it?

843
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:24,970
The money you paid as compensation when you got into a fight for me during our senior year.

844
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,750
Are you serious?

845
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,620
It's been so long.

846
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,550
You may have moved on, but I haven't.

847
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:35,790
That incident caused a lot of trouble for you and your family.

848
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,710
I didn't have the money back then,

849
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,730
so I could only pretend to be ignorant.

850
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,430
I've been saving money all these years.

851
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,330
I've finally saved enough.

852
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,370

Are you crazy?

854
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:48,230
Take it.

855
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:48,550
I won't.

856
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,430
Just take it.

857
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,040
I won't take it.

858
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,230
If you don't take it, I'll give it to your parents.

859
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,510
Even if you give it to them, they won't accept it.

860
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,470
Hey, Xie Wanghe.

861
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,790
Can't you stop being so selfish?

862
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:55,830
I'm selfish?

863
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,140
Because I feel

864
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:59,800
that I've worked hard on my own all these years

865
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,470
to make up for my childhood mistakes.

866
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,180
I'll feel a great sense of accomplishment.

867
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,350
You take it for now.

Sure.

Yes, they're gone.

An old lady?

902
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,330
When I was a kid,

903
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:02,620
I loved Beijing,

904
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,920
because Beijing is big enough,

905
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,690
unimaginably big.

906
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:08,950
It made me feel

907
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,980
there were endless possibilities here.

908
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:14,980
But now,

909
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,480
because of how big Beijing is,

910
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,960
it's pushing us further and further apart.

911
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:20,950
We are in the same city,

912
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,670
yet we barely see each other in a year.

913

there's an old lady.

00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,080
She has trouble walking

916
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,510
and doesn't go out much.

917
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,470
But every month,

918
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,590
she receives flowers sent from Guangzhou.

919
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:39,840
Sometimes it's roses,

920
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,600
and sometimes narcissus.

921
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,790
From Guangzhou to Beijing,

922
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,860
it's over 2,100 kilometers.

923
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,150
But for her,

924
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:49,920
it's very close.

925
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,490
As long as there's love,

926
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:55,720
distance isn't a problem.
