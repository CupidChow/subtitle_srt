Okay.

00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,070
It seems we've got ourselves a little Cinderella in the house.

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,480
Here. I didn't use soybean oil to stir-fry it.

10
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,580
I used rapeseed oil.

11
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,130
Stir-frying with rapeseed oil makes it more delicious.

12
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,730
You've learned well from me.

13
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,550
You're looking at it again.

14
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,680
You really want to be a model?

15
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,880
Mom, I also told Siyi about it just now.

16
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,570
If she could also do the shoot,

17
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,050
that would be awesome.

18
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,860
It's much faster money than working a regular job.

19
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,550
Aren't you worried they might prefer Siyi

20
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,610
and eliminate you?

21
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,820
That's not likely, is it?

22
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,340
Who would choose a Xiali when they could have a Mercedes?

24
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,290
I was just teasing you.

25
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,380
In my heart,

26
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,270
my daughter Fenghua is the prettiest.

27
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,550
Even prettier than Gong Li or Zhang Ziyi,

28
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,600
or anyone else.

29
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,190
What's wrong?

30
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,079
Are you worried?

31
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,800
If they could only choose one of us for the ad shoot,

32
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,700
I'd rather they choose Siyi.

33
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,760
I'm okay with that.

34
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,630
Why?

35
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,110
I have parents and everything.

36
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,070
Siyi needs the money more than I do.

37
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:22,730
What?

38
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,040
Is it wrong for me to think this way?

39
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,990
No, it's not wrong.

40
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,329
If you treat her as a friend,

41
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,790
it's right to think of her needs more.

"Why don't you come stay at our place?"

trying to create an opportunity for her and our son?

101

No, it's not like that.

102
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,350
I only did that for our son's studies.

103
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,990
His tutoring while in the hospital is the most important thing right now.

104
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,590
That girl has been helping Chen Rui.

105
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,600
And I thought since she's going through a lot,

106
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,130
I wanted to help her out too.

107

You're meddling too much.

110
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,670
Our son has complained to me many times in private,

If I don't take care of those things, who will?

117
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,720
I'm his mother.

118
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,600
And speaking of his friendships,

119
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,670
just look at those friends he made,

120
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,710
like Xie Wanghe.

121
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,290
Is there even one good student among them?

122
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,730
They'll all have a bad influence on him.

123
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,470
Poor grades don't mean they're bad people.

124
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,230
That's a different matter.

125
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,900
We are all neighbors. We know each other very well.

00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,150
It hasn't affected her studies.

129
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,350
She got into the same school as our son,

00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,080
Oh, please.

132
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,669
Can't you tell your son's got a crush

133
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,730
on Ma Siyi?

134
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,270
I can.

135
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,150
So what?

136
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,030
"So what?" Let me tell you.

137
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,260
This little spark of our son's puppy love

138
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,140
must be strangled at birth.

139
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,440
It's non-negotiable.

140
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,400
You're too cold-hearted.

141
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,540
You know what?

142
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,150
I was also

143
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,250
once our son's age.

144
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,600
It's normal for a boy to like a girl.

145
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,770
As the ancients said,

146
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:58,910
"A beautiful and virtuous woman

147
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,790
is what a gentleman pursues."

148
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,910
Back in my day...

149
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,790
What happened back in your day?

150
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,900
Back in my day...

151
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,890
Which year do you mean exactly?

152
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,920
And who's in that story?

153
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,750
Why haven't you ever told me about this?

154
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,610
Back in my day,

155
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,670
I didn't have the chance for puppy love.

156
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,480
But times are different now.

157
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,710
Our son is at this age when

158
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,910
the more you try to control him, the more he'll rebel, you know?

159
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,730
He'll do the opposite of what you say.

160
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,810
So according to you, I should just leave him alone

161
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:38,620
and let him be?

162
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,610
Free to date like you were?

163
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,710
You need to use the right approaches and methods.

164
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,390
We should learn wisdom from the ancients.

165
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,910
Look at how Yu the Great controlled the floods.

166
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,350
He mainly adopted the method of diversion and channeling instead of...

167
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,190
Don't give me that useless talk.

168
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,500
Let me tell you.

169
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,030
Regarding our son's puppy love,

170
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,470
you better handle it well.

171
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,470
Show me what great wisdom you have.

172
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,680
If you can't handle it properly,

173
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,780
we'll deal with it from the root.

174
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,470
Then you'll have to come clean with me:

175
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,430
Who was your puppy love?

176
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,030
What's her name?

177
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,410
Where is she now?

178
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,910
Are you still in contact?

179
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,970
Is our son taking after you?

180
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,860
Please rest assured, Boss.

181
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,920
I promise I'll complete the mission.

182
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,350
Dad.

183
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:42,860
What's up?

184
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,570
Can you do me a favor?

185
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,910
Go ahead.

186
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,730
Could you help me deliver this letter?

187
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,900
[To Ma Siyi]

188
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,620
A love letter?

189
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,950
No, it's not.

190
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:01,770
What are you talking about?

191
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,870
Don't make wild guesses.

192
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,790
[To Ma Siyi]

193
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,200
It's nothing like that.

194
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,260
We're just good friends, nothing more.

195
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:07,990
There's really nothing going on.

196
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,630
There's absolutely nothing ambiguous, you know...

197
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,030
Alright, forget it. Just give it back to me.

198
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,470
It's just the other day,

199
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,950
my mom said something inappropriate to her, right?

200
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,630
So I thought I'd explain to her.

201
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,760
You understand, right?

202
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,020
Why are you so nervous?

203
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,430
I'm not your mom.

204
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,000
Yeah, right.

205
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,590
Still...

206
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,710
Besides,

207
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,830
even if it is a love letter,

208
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,800
so what?

209
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,440
Everyone's written a love letter at some point.

210
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,940
You want to hear my story?

211
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,870
I promise I won't tell mom.

212
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,210
When I was in senior high school,

213
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,070
there was also

214
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,530
a female classmate I was close to.

215
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,280
Back then, we also wrote letters often.

216
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:00,930
Just the stamps alone,

217
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,050
I collected enough to fill a small, thick album.

218
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,600
So you'll be a second-generation celebrity?

219
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,840
I can't say whether I'll be a second-generation celebrity or not,

220
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,570
but I surely will have connections in the entertainment industry.

221
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,150
Isn't that Siyi?

222
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,750
Siyi!

223
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,270
Stop there!

224
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,120
Siyi!

225
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,920
What are you doing?

226
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,840
Are you working part-time?

227
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,700
It's none of your business.

228
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,130
Does Granny know about this?

229
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,530
If you dare to tell her, I won't forgive you.

230
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,760
Siyi.

231
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,840
How much more money do you need?

232
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,240
We'll make up the difference for you.

233
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,120
Go back to school immediately.

234
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:55,950
Do you hear me?

235
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,040
You should be the one to go to school and study, okay?

236
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,840
You don't have to worry about me.

237
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,350
I can't get into college, so a degree is enough for me.

238
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,360
But you can't do that.

239
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,690
This last year is very important for you.

240
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:05,960
You can't waste a single minute.

241
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,510
Go home!

242
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,530
If you don't go home, I'll tell your homeroom teacher.

243
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,500
I'll have her contact Granny.

244
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,190
Let go.

245
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,110
Go home!

246
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,040
Let go of me!

247
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,540
Can't you just listen to me?

248
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,840
Xie Wanghe!

249
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,170
You may be able to tell me what to do once or twice,

250
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,590
but do you think you can do that for the whole life?

251
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,230
I can!

252
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,150
I can't.

253
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:40,790
Siyi!

254
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,560
So,

255
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,190
in the end, which one of you

256
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,920
changed their mind first?

257
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,120
We...

258
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,910
We never confessed our feelings to each other.

259
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,210
So...

260
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:01,040
We can't really say who fell out of love first.

261
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,270
Why didn't you confess your feelings?

262
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,680
How should I put it?

263
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,680
Your generation,

264
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,660
when it comes to relationships,

265
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,450
it's more...

266
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:17,760
casual.

267
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,200
If you like someone, you just get together.

268
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,120
If you don't feel it anymore, you break up.

269
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,190
It was different back in our time.

270
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,950
Even if you liked someone,

271
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,900
you had to weigh it carefully in your mind.

272
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,090
Weigh it.

273
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,030
Weigh what?

274
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:35,870
What is it?

275
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,080
Whether you can make that person happy or not.

276
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,350
If you like someone,

277
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,600
you only need to be thick-skinned

278
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,780
to confess your feelings.

279
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,540
But if you truly like someone,

280
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,180
you must be clear about

281
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,330
what you can do for that person.

282
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,380
But if there's something I can't do now,

283
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,640
it doesn't mean I won't be able to do that in the future, right?

284
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,230
Right.

285
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,340
So if you want to make that person happy,

286
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,040
you must do everything you can

287
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,950
to make yourself stand out.

288
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
In a responsible relationship,

289
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,540
actions speak louder than words.

290
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,630
Right now,

291
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,460
you're relying on your parents.

292
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,540
If you can't provide that person

293
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,840
with enough support and care

294
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,500
on your own,

295
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,060
then it's not the time to be in a relationship.

296
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,400
Are you alright?

297
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,930
How are you feeling?

298
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,540
What time is it now?

299
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,750
We have to hurry up.

300
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,130
I still have to meet Jiu for the card game.

301
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,680
You're annoying.

302
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,510
Crippled Sun!

303
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,980
Xie Tiancheng, what are you doing here?

304
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,100
If you don't give me the money today,

305
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,270
I'll kill you!

306
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,860
I told you I have no money. Which part of that you don't understand?

307
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,910
No money? You have no money, but you are fooling around with a woman?

308
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,150
You even drive a Mercedes.

309
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,510
You've got some nerve, Xie Tiancheng.

310
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,710
You even dare to break in and steal.

311
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,829
Murder! Murder!

312
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,950
It's not very serious.

313
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,230
Rest more at home.

314
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,390
Keep that in mind, okay?

315
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,270
Alright.

316
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,080
Come on, come on.

317
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,780
Have a seat.

318
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,400
Come on, come on.

319
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,770
Have a seat.

320
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,530
Sit.

321
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,210
What are you looking at?

322
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,310
It doesn't seem

323
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,320
like a big deal.

324
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,410
I'm fine,

325
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,010
but you're not.

326
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:29,970
Aggravated assault.

327
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,950
That's enough for a few years in prison.

328
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,440
I only kicked you once.

329
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,390
You lost your balance.

330
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,060
You fell

331
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,510
and injured yourself.

332
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,620
How did that become an aggravated assault?

333
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,920
W-What do you mean I did it to myself?

334
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,590
I didn't take these X-rays, did I?

335
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,950
I got seven stitches

336
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,090
and a mild concussion.

337
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,440
Let me tell you something.

338
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,980
If I report this to the Public Security Bureau,

339
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,620
it would be assault and battery,

340
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,080
where the victim doesn't accept mediation.

You kicked me, didn't you?

You could have sued me

Even if it was just an attempt,

357
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,340
that would be enough to convict you.

00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,520
it'll be a disaster for the family.

514
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,020
You need to keep a close eye on her.

515
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,640
Also, be mentally prepared.

516
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,660
You are finally home.

517
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,270
Why don't you just live outside? Do you know what time it is?

518
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,400
I had things to do.

519
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,190
What could you possibly have to do?

520
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,110
All you do is eat and mess around.

521
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,380
Even the second-generation rich don't waste their time like you do.

522
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:39,980
Oh, right.

523
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,110
What did the traditional Chinese doctor say?

524
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,310
Is Granny Ma alright?

525
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,300
Granny Ma...

526
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,280
May have a stroke soon.

527
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,450
The doctor said

528
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:57,070
Granny Ma is showing signs of an impending stroke.

529
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,830
We need to be prepared.

530
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:00,870
A stroke?

531
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,000
That's no small matter.

532
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,470
The doctor suggested

533
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,870
we take Granny Ma to the hospital

534
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,800
for a comprehensive examination.

535
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,530
Yes.

536
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,580
We must do it.

537
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:14,860
I'll find a way to take her there for the examination.

538
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,690
Also, Mom,

539
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,920
starting tomorrow, Granny Ma can't work at her stall anymore.

540
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,790
She can't overexert herself.

541
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,750
And there has to be someone

542
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,210
watching her at all times.

543
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,390
If she really has a stroke

544
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,670
and doesn't receive immediate treatment,

545
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,190
the consequences could be severe.

546
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,650
But with her family's financial situation,

547
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:31,560
how will they make ends meet without working?

548
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,350
I'll figure out a way to handle the money issue.

549
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,080
What are you up to this time?

550
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:39,510
Mom.

551
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,660
You're not allowed to drop out of school.

552
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,590
I'm telling you again,

553
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,020
I won't allow it.

554
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,790
Your father and I

555
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,590
are still here.

556
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,350
It's not your turn to meddle in this.

557
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,670
I'm not dropping out.

558
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,340
I'll just apply for a one-year leave of absence.

559
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,310
Once I make enough money...

560
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,360
That's a hard no!

561
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,200
Granny Ma is in a dangerous situation right now.

562
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,350
If anything happens to her,

563
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,510
Siyi will have no way out.

564
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,150
I have to help her.

565
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,310
How are you going to help her?

566
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,110
I have many ways to make money.

567
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,680
As long as I have enough startup capital

568
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,540
and time.

569
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,080
One year will be enough.

570
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,550
I can not only help Siyi,

571
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,590
but I can also fill the financial holes in our family.

572
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,790
Please trust me, Mom.

573
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,310
No means no!

574
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,370
This matter is not up for discussion!

575
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,510
Why are you being so unreasonable?

576
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,300
Your father said

577
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:26,110
he'd be able to collect the outstanding debts soon.

578
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,590
Once we get the money back,

579
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,430
everything can be resolved.

580
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,350
You only need to study hard

581
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,750
and bring home your diploma.

582
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,990
After that, you can do whatever you want.

583
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,520
I won't interfere anymore.

584
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,690
What are you doing?

585
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,520
Just staying here for a bit.

586
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,990
What's there to stay for in the midnight?

587
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,780
You have school tomorrow.

588
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,790
Come on, go to bed.

589
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:08,670
Dad,

590
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,530
don't go yet.

591
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,040
Let's talk for a bit.

592
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,490
Talk about what?

593
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,980
How did you earn

594
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,660
your first bucket of gold?

595
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,350
Well, back then,

596
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,130
when I was about your age,

597
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,920
I went to Guangdong

598
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,110
with your Uncle Maotian

599
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:33,990
to buy goods.

600
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:34,870
Do you know what we bought?

601
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:35,400
What?

602
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:39,090
Gauze and silk scarves for women.

603
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,000
We bought them there

604
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,190
and sold them here.

605
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:46,450
Do you know how big the price difference was?

606
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,190
Do you remember

607
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,920
our family's first small ship?

608
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,060
It was bought

609
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,460
with that money.

610
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,120
That was our first pot of gold.

611
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,550
Not bad, Dad.

612
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:00,690
Has mom been captivated by these silk scarves?

613
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,650
She wasn't captivated,

614
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,950
she was trapped.

615
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,750
Dad,

616
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,590
I need to tell you something.

617
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,520
Don't get angry.

618
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,090
Go ahead.

619
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,530
I want to take a leave of absence from school.

620
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,390
Just for a year.

621
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,300
I told you not to get angry.

622
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,770
Take a leave of absence?

623
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,170
Why?

624
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,510
Siyi.

625
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:27,220
I've warmed up some milk for you.

626
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,430
You haven't finished your homework yet?

627
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,360
Almost done.

628
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,780
Grandma, you should go to bed first.

629
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,120
It's alright.

630
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,070
I'll

631
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,040
knit a sweater to keep you company.

632
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,410
Siyi,

633
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,200
actually,

634
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,920
I'm not against you getting a part-time job.

635
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,040
Grandma.

636
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:13,490
We didn't have enough food at home when your father was young,

637
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,910
so he went out to earn money.

638
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,790
I won't scold you.

639
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:22,590
After all, you're both doing it for the family's sake.

640
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,620
Don't worry, Grandma.

641
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,540
I won't let it affect my studies.

642
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:31,200
Are you sure it won't affect your studies?

643
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,020
I've been watching you from the doorway for a while.

644
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,810
Usually when you're doing homework,

645
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,430
you're very focused.

646
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,120
You can write for an entire evening.

647
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,630
How many times have you yawned just now?

648
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:48,620
A person's

649
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,740
energy is finite.

650
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,640
I know you're thoughtful,

651
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:56,630
and that you're trying to ease my burden.

652
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,630
But child,

653
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:04,420
everything has its priorities.

654
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,070
If your grades are poor

655
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:06,900
and you can't get into college,

656
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,530
then I would accept it.

657
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,280
But your grades are so good.

658
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:14,290
Wouldn't you be missing out on such an opportunity?

659
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,290
If you go to work part-time

660
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,150
and ruin your future,

661
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,590
I would feel like I've let your father down.

662
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,710
Your father would blame me too.

663
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:24,670
Alright,

664
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,330
get back to your homework now.

665
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:56,690
How much?

666
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,600
The medicine from before 1993

667
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,920
cost more than 8,000 yuan per pill.

668
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,070
It might not even be enough for one pill.

669
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,670
If someone really gets sick,

670
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,150
it can be a big expense

671
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,170
for hospitalization,

672
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,150
nursing staff

673
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,760
and so on.

674
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,909
Given Granny's family situation,

675
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,920
even if Siyi gets into college,

676
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:15,469
they can't afford it.

677
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:17,620
So I have to plan ahead.

678
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,110
These...these troublesome matters,

679
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,840
l-let us adults handle them.

680
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:27,850
Dad,

681
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,320
you used to make money seafaring,

682
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,090
but now?

683
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,239
The highway is open,

684
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,000
and our family business isn't very good.

685
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
What are you planning to do about it?

686
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,110
Well, any industry

687
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,350
has its ups and downs.

688
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:47,310
I believe the canal will improve.

689
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:48,810
It might get better in the future,

690
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:49,810
but I can't wait.

691
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:52,170
You...

692
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:53,980
Making money isn't that easy.

693
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,150
It's not something that just comes to you

694
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,580
whenever you want it.

695
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,670
Well, I have to try.

696
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:59,470
I have confidence.

697
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,600
I believe in myself.

698
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,310
It's not about confidence.

699
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,710
You... you need a plan.

700
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,030
I have.

701
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:07,950
I have several, actually.

702
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:10,190
I just don't know which one to use right now.

703
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,070
Look at you.

704
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,820
Several plans, huh?

705
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,110
Tell me one of them.

706
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,390
Let's see if it's feasible.

707
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,840
I'll tell you one that doesn't require seed money.

708
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,950
Creating a website.

709
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,150
What kind of website?

710
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,910
Online smart question bank.

711
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,580
It's something that can help students

712
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,310
quickly improve their grades.

713
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,750
If such a thing exists,

714
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,880
can it improve your grades first?

715
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:28,640
Of course.

716
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,390
I can not only help myself,

717
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,630
but I can help a lot of people.

718
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,030
I can also make big money.

719
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,790
How much can you earn?

720
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,480
At least I'll be the richest person in Honghuai.

721
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,340
Son,

722
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,590
you should

723
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,680
focus on getting into college.

724
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,840
Don't worry about our family matters.

725
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,880
You really don't need me to?

726
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,110
No matter how useless your father is,

727
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,250
he can still provide for the family.

728
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,290
Is that all the ambition you have?

729
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,910
Are you

730
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,900
really disappointed in your father now?

731
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,590
Yes.

732
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,660
Dad,

733
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,910
making no money isn't a big deal,

734
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,010
but you can't lose your aspiration.

735
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,940
As long as you have the spirit,

736
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,630
starting a new business won't be a problem.

737
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:28,710
Also,

738
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:29,710
I...

739
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:31,350
Oh no.

740
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:36,910
What's wrong?

741
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,250
Your mom must be awake.

742
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,180
she's probably looking for me now.

743
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:43,960
Where is she?

744
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,230
You two even have telepathy?

745
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,070
Look at you.

746
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:50,550
I'm telling you, I know what your mom's going to do.

747
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,410
even if she just turns over in bed.

748
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,620
Seems like everything's fine now.

749
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,370
Nope.

750
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,370
Maybe there's too much going on now.

751
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,150
It's not working this time.

752
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:06,270
Put it on. Don't catch a cold.

753
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,190
Son,

754
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,020
I'll be honest with you.

755
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,520
I'm unable to do anything but seafaring.

756
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,900
If you don't know, then learn.

757
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,400
My dad is so smart and capable.

758
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,750
Once you set your mind to something,

759
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,280
just keep pushing forward,

760
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:35,130
you'll definitely succeed.

761
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:37,830
Really?

762
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,430
Really.

763
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,670
♫When the moon hangs in the sky♫

764
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,340
♫And it's cooling in the yard♫

765
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,690
♫Who is still by your side?♫

766
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,850
♫As time passes♫

767
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:05,540
♫Is a lifetime really that long?♫

768
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:12,700
♫When youthful company fades, leaving only small talk and pleasantries♫

769
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:17,220
♫Spring feels short, while autumn lingers♫

770
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,490
♫A gentle breeze carries dreams away♫

771
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:26,640
♫Of sweet dreams♫

772
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:35,010
♫Life is long♫

773

♫No need to dwell♫

774
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:44,060
♫Like moonlight♫

775

Fenghua, wake up.

776
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:47,320
It's so late. Why aren't you up yet?

777
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,830
♫Don't forget♫

778
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,190
What's the matter?

779
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:49,990
Look at you, dawdling around.

780
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:50,470
You're so slow.

781
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,110
I'm resting.

782
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,190
Hurry up!

783
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,590
There are so few people on Flower Street.

784
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,430
Business is getting worse.

785
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,390
Let's not set up the stall on weekends anymore.

786
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:59,750
If you don't set up the stall, what are you going to live on?

787
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,880
You're always saying useless things.

788
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,590
I'm so tired.

789
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,590
Morning, little white girl.

790
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:18,160
That photographer you mentioned the other day,

791
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,030
is he reliable?

792
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:20,870
Of course he is.

793
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,410
Why don't we give him a call and ask?

794
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:27,910
Okay.

795
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,070
Just a moment.

796
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,670
Yes.

797
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,550
Yes, yes.

798
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:39,630
Alright.

799
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,960
Great, great, great.

800
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,350
Okay, goodbye.

801
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,050
How did it go?

802
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,700
He said we should go over there.

803
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,130
He wants to talk face to face.

804
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,630
To the city?

805
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:50,990
Well, you're asking to be a model.

806
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,350
If they don't see you in person,

807
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,480
how will they know if you're suitable?

808
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,540
That's true.

809
00:39:58,910 --> 00:39:59,990
If you're scared,

810
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,750
we can ask Shao Xiaopang to come with us.

811
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,210
That guy can keep a secret.

812
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,190
No way.

813
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,830
We can't let too many people know about this.

814
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,790
It wouldn't be good if word goes out.

815
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:10,410
What's the big deal?

816
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,030
Being a model isn't illegal.

817
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:14,350
Besides,

818
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,390
once you've taken the photos,

819
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,870
they can be seen online anyway.

820
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,350
Even if you don't say anything now,

821
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,550
everyone will find out sooner or later.

822
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:26,880
If you want to make money, don't be afraid of losing face.

823
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:31,110
If the teacher asks later, just say

824
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,070
your relatives opened a shop

825
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,400
and you're helping out.

826
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,870
What era are we living in?

827
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,110
As long as we're not breaking the law,

828
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:38,710
the more money we make, the more glorious it is.

829
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,170
Let's go.

830
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,840
Time to make some money.

831
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:55,900
Put them on.

832
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:57,700
Here.

833
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,860
Take a good look.

834
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,180
What?

835
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,270
The business plan I wrote last night.

836
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,810
Take a look now.

837
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,350
If there are any issues, just say it.

838
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,300
Don't hold back.

839
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,110
Wake up.

840
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,150
Come on, come on.

841
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,380
Hurry up, take a look.

842
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,280
Online question bank.

843
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,570
What do you think? Is it feasible?

844
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,150
There are two key points.

845
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:32,740
The quality of the questions and intelligent data processing.

846
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,270
We can get questions from major key high schools.

847
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:39,110
As for the program automation, we can only rely on you.

848
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,870
You think he's Bill Gates?

849
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,110
Studying and working at the same time.

850
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:42,590
Even if you work him to death,

851
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:43,850
he can't finish it all.

852
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:45,550
We'll start small.

853
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:48,390
We can use existing programming templates.

854
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:49,470
Once we have money,

855
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:50,620
then we can spend it

856
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,590
to hire programmers from outside.

857
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:54,590
There are virtual servers online,

858
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:57,850
but if you want to guarantee storage and internet speed,

859
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,840
you must rent a dedicated server.

860
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,870
Then let's go to Beijing.

861
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,770
I've already talked to my dad.

862
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,650
He didn't agree.

863
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:08,040
But he didn't object either.

864
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,670
What's the use of your dad agreeing?

865
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,560
You won't get your mom's approval.

866
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,290
We have to try, right?

867
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:16,590
I don't believe

868
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,310
When Bill Gates dropped out from Harvard,

869
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:19,370
his mom could agree.

870
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,250
To do great things,

871
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,840
we must all forge ahead through difficulties.

872
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,550
Anyway, I must do this.

873
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,090
If we really can make money,

874
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:36,550
how do you want to spend it?

875
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,260
First, pay off debts.

876
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,710
I haven't finished paying off

877
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:40,870
my mom's debts yet.

878
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,710
I plan to buy a phone,

879
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,020
the latest model.

880
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:46,790
Then,

881
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:49,470
I'll make calls in front of Xie Wanghe every day.

882
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,610
Hello, darling,

883
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,230
have you been missing me these days?

884
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:54,760
Which darling?

885
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:56,030
It doesn't matter.

886
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:58,470
The point is to make him see my new phone.

887
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,750
I'll make him so jealous.
