[Episode 12]

3
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:42,420
No.

4
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,990
I want to play with the dog.

5
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,280
Fenghua!

6
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,330
Look.

7
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:48,180
Here.

8
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,670
This is your little brother.

9
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,340
When you have time,

10
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,950
take him for a walk around the street.

11
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,950
It's his first time here.

12
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,750
Fenghua is busy.

13
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,840
She needs to do her homework.

14
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,950
The college entrance exam is next year.

15
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,550
She doesn't have time.

16
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,870
I have time. I have time.

17
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,340
Homework can be done anytime.

18
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,230
Let's go, little brother.

19
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,110
I'll take you out to play.

20
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,070
There's no need to be polite with your sister.

21
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:04,950
I want to go play by the river.

22
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,750
Fenghua.

23
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,960
You don't have to buy too many of those osmanthus cakes that I like!

24
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,570
Two catties would be enough!

25
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,550
I haven't heard her call me Grandma since I got here!

26
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,990
Who taught her such manners?

27
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:15,870
What do you mean she didn't?

28
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,710
She called you as soon as she came in.

29
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,770
You didn't hear it?

30
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,730
My ears are deaf. I didn't hear it!

31
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,180
Sister-in-law,

32
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,450
I didn't hear it either.

33
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,310
Then your hearing must be pretty bad.

34
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,150
Alright, Mom,

35
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:26,710
don't be angry.

36
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,510
What kind of mother is she?

37
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,270
She's just a bad person.

38
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,200
Can't even raise a child properly.

39
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,329
Like mother, like daughter.

40
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,390
She's always been like this.

41
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,720
What's your name?

42
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,390
You mean my original name or my current one?

43
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,000
How many names do you have?

44
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,770
I used to be called Xiaojun,

45
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,070
but now Grandma calls me Xiaobao.

46
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,150
Bao as in "baby."

47
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,540
Here you go, kid.

48
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,950
Are you from the same village as my grandma?

49
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,410
Then where do you live?

50
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,270
I forgot.

51
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,790
Adopted?

52
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,140
What were you thinking?

53
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,310
Calm down.

54
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,790
Aren't I here to discuss it with you?

55
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,800
What's there to discuss?

56
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,330
It's already been decided!

57
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,420
I'm going to talk to Maotian.

58
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,770
Why isn't he back yet?

59
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,430
Mom.

60
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,470
I'm in charge of this family now.

61
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,510
If there's anything going on, you should tell me.

62
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,710
What is there to tell you?

63
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,630
It's a major matter of the Xia family!

64
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,230
Outsiders should keep their mouths shut!

65
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,130
Mom, Mom, calm down.

66
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,030
Let me talk to my sister-in-law.

67
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,579
Sister-in-law.

68
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,220
I have to criticize you a bit.

69
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:37,150
Our Xia family has three branches with over a dozen people,

70
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,230
with my brother being the only male...

71
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,990
Wasn't it originally five branches?

72
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,430
Why are there only three branches now?

73
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,730
Where did the other two go?

74
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,980
Whatever, it doesn't matter.

75
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,510
Whether it's three branches or five,

76
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,020
shouldn't we all live our own separate lives?

77
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,730
When Maotian and I first came here,

78
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,980
life was so hard,

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,620
yet I didn't see any of you guys caring about us.

80
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,870
Who told you guys to leave back then?

81
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,790
If you didn't drag him away,

82
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,740
would Maotian have left home to make a living?

83
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,760
Why don't you take him back then?

84
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,310
I'm not getting involved in this.

85
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,170
Mom.

86
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,130
Honghong.

87
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,120
Son, you're back!

88
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,110
I missed you so much.

89
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,140
Gosh.

90
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,770
You've lost weight.

91
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:15,630
Look how thin you've become.

92
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,329
Look at my brother, he's all sweaty.

93
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:18,810
-He's sweating all over.
-Mom,

94
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,070
there must be a reason why you and Honghong are back, right?

95
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,310
You're finally back.

96
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,400
Listen to what your mother has to say.

97
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,110
It's good news, wonderful news!

98
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:28,950
Wonderful news!

99
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,430
You couldn't find better news even if you searched with a lantern!

100
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,290
You couldn't!

101
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,710
What good news?

102
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,159
Your mother

103
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,070
thinks Fenghua isn't good enough because she's a girl,

104
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,270
so she bought you a boy from someone else

105
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,800
to be our son.

106
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,020
Isn't it great news?

107
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,290
It's great, isn't it?

108
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,060
Now you have a son.

109
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,180
The family line will continue.

110
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,070
You're a father again!

111
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,750
I'm an aunt again!

112
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,840
I have a grandson now!

113
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,150
Look how happy my brother is.

114
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,070
What?

115
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,230
Is that true?

116
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,410
Grandma told me that

117
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,430
your family only has one daughter

118
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,240
and there is no male heir, so I'm here to be the son.

119
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,760
In the future, I'll get all the family inheritance.

120
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,750
Family inheritance?

121
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,240
Did my grandma not tell you

122
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,350
about our family's situation?

123
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,510
Your family has a big ship,

124
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,770
weighing around a thousand tons, right?

125
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,560
This kid is so mischievous.

126
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,840
Fenghua, who is he?

127
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,580
Mom!

128
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,710
What were you thinking!

129
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,970
What era are we living in?

130
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,190
How can your thinking still be so feudal?

131
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,610
I'm not being feudal!

132
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,710
It's because

133
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,670
girls

134
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,670
can't be recorded in the family genealogy!

135
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,770
If you don't have a son,

136
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,510
who will continue your family line when you get old?

137
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,720
Who will?

138
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,850
If it can't be continued, then so be it!

139
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:48,800
I don't even know what I'm doing with my life yet!

140
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Isn't that Fenghua's grandma?

141
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,930
Who can control what happens after death?

142
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,010
Son!

143
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:53,950
Then our Xia Family

144
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,820
will have no descendants!

145
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,310
Back in the Jiajing period, our Xia Family

146
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,340
was a prestigious clan!

147
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,700
The family genealogy is this thick!

148
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,110
I can't allow our bloodline to stop here

149
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,170
just because of you

150
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,650
and your good-for-nothing wife!

151
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,760
Aren't you worried that your father wouldn't be able to rest in peace?

152
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,930
Our father wouldn't be able to rest in peace!

153
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,790
My father wouldn't be that petty!

154
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,020
God! God!

155
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,450
Mom. Mom.

156
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,850
Oh, my darling!

157
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,690
Come out and see this!

158
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,330
Mom.

159
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,610
Stop crying. Stop it.

160
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:27,040
Look at your good-for-nothing son!

161
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,970
Mom.

162
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,760
Mom.

163
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,990
Get up.

164
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,750
You're just upset that we don't have a son, right?

165
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,140
It's simple. Just let your son divorce me

166
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,010
and find someone else to give birth to a son for your family!

167
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:37,690
What are you talking about?

168
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,150
Let me tell you.

169
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,090
I, Li Yan, am content with just having a daughter.

170
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,400
I absolutely won't raise someone else's child!

171
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,030
Enough, can't you just endure a little?

172
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:43,690
Haven't I endured enough?

173
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,810
You don't get to decide!

174
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,600
You don't get to decide.

175
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,950
I don't get to decide my family's affairs?

176
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,300
What, so you're to decide them?

177
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,110
Mom, look, the neighbors are all here.

178
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,090
Let's talk back inside.

179
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,750
I'm not going inside! I'm not going inside!

180
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,990
Look at her! Just look at her!

181
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,830
She's doing this on purpose!

182
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,960
It's all your fault!

183
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,870
Stop it, okay?

184
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,660
You wicked woman!

185
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,630
What do you want?

186
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,910
All of you, stop it!

187
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,500
Who are you putting on a show for?

188
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,670
Sister.

189
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,780
Don't call me that.

190
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,910
I'm not your sister.

191
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,250
My father won't let you in our family.

192
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,390
Why?

193
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,310
You're just a little kid.

194
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,850
I don't need to explain myself to you.

195
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,170
I don't eat much, and I'm easy to feed.

196
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,260
I also won't take the family inheritance away from you.

197
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,500
Then why are you here?

198
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,130
Before Grandma bought me,

199
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,520
I hadn't eaten for three days.

200
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,760
I want to live. I don't want to die.

201
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,770
What do you want to eat?

202
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,000
Let me think.

203
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:01,870
Let's go.

204
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,790
Fenghua!

205
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,570
Fenghua!

206
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,630
Do you know something happened to your family?

207
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,900
Yeah, he just told me.

208
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
So it's you.

209
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,880
Behave yourself, you hear me?

210
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,090
Pretty impressive.

211
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,870
Your grandma must be crazy.

212
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,800
How can she do something like this?

213
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,150
You once said

214
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,880
that you'd fight anyone who dared to bully me.

215
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,820
My grandma, I'll leave her to you.

216
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,020
You guys, give up already.

217
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,570
I won't give birth to or raise any more children.

218
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,230
I'm content with having one daughter in my life.

219
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,830
If you want to complain about only having one male in three branches,

220
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,360
you can raise him yourself.

221
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,200
Let him be Maotian's little brother.

222
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,430
Listen to her. Just listen.

223
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,060
Is that how a human being talks?

224
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,060
You're right.

225
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,010
I'm not a human being.

226
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,120
Ever since I married into Xia Family,

227
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,300
I've been treated like a dog.

228
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,910
I'm even worth less than a dog!

229
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,230
The year I gave birth to Fenghua,

230
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,650
during my postpartum confinement,

231
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,300
did any of you ever cook a meal for me

232
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,770
or wash a single diaper?

233
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,570
Fenghua would cry all night long,

234
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,530
and I would spend night after night

235
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,810
pacing back and forth in the room, holding her.

236
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,870
How many days did I go without a full night's sleep?

237
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,740
But did any of you guys ever help me?

238
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,940
Poor Fenghua had it even worse.

239
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,530
Other children were loved by their grandma and grandpa,

240
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,000
but not her.

241
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,560
As soon as she was born and you saw she was a girl,

242
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,750
you didn't even look at her.

243
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,910
You just left.

244
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,590
Whenever you saw her, you always belittled her with snide remarks.

245
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,640
How do you think that made she feel?

246
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,440
When she was little, she used to ask me,

247
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,840
"Why does Grandma hate me so much?"

248
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,250
"Am I really your child?"

249
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,720
"Was I picked up by the river?"

250
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,140
I wouldn't have picked her up even if I found her.

251
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,540
I wouldn't have taken her even if she were given to us for free.

252
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,220
I dare you guys to say that again!

253
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,550
What if I say it again?

254
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,190
I wouldn't have taken her even if she were given to us for free.

255
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,750
Don't you dare

256
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,940
say things like that about my daughter again!

257
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,410
If you are so capable, give birth to a son yourself!

258
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,130
What nonsense are you talking about?

259
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:48,870
You know what?

260
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,630
He is my son!

261
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,550
I can't stand you people anymore!

262
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,310
If you've got the guts, give me a boy!

263
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,630
I'm very happy with the daughter I gave birth to!

264
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,030
Why must I have a son?

265
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,170
-Enough!
-I'm not ashamed at all!

266
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,420
Will you guys ever stop?

267
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,430
I'm begging you guys.

268
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,760
Save me some face, okay?

269
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,810
We'll discuss the child matter later.

270
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,640
There's no room for discussion!

271
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,400
Let me tell you, Xia Maotian.

272
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:18,010
I, Li Yan, will only have one child in this lifetime,

273
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,950
and that's our Fenghua!

274
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,410
As for other people's children,

275
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,060
whoever wants to raise them can do so.

276
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,680
If you dare to give in,

277
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,870
I'll divorce you!

278
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,350
Brother.

279
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,620
You are the head of the household.

280
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,160
Eat slowly.

281
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,290
Here you go.

282
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:06,650
[Special price for a set: 18 yuan]

283
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,590
What are you going to do?

284
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,750
Don't worry.

285
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,540
My mom will never agree.

286
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,900
If she really gets pushed to her limit,

287
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,230
she will divorce my dad.

288
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,830
That's exactly what makes it troublesome.

289
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,790
Your dad is filial.

290
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,200
He always listens to your grandmother.

291
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,000
If they really end up divorcing,

292
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,790
you'll feel guilty, right?

293
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,160
This kind of thing would never happen in your family.

294
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,530
Things would be so much better if I were a boy.

295
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,070
I think,

296
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,270
your dad might not be able to handle this alone.

297
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,310
We need to get help from the outside.

298
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,310
What kind of help?

299
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,480
Maotian.

300
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,260
Maotian!

301
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,720
Don't be a coward this time.

302
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,680
Otherwise, your wife and daughter

303
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,920
will be bullied to death by your mother.

304
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,700
Boss Xie.

305
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,790
I'm not stupid.

306
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,820
How could I possibly agree to such a ridiculous thing?

307
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,510
What did you tell your mother just now?

308
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,310
You said you'd discuss it later!

309
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,930
That's my mother.

310
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,660
How can I disobey her?

311
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,620
Well, disobedience,

312
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:20,940
in the ancient times and

313
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,700
in the Confucian culture,

314
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:23,760
was considered unfilial.

315
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,700
If you were unfilial,

316
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,720
people might laugh at you,

317
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,050
and you might even end up in jail.

318
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,270
But what era are we living in now?

319
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,240
You need to have a broader vision

320
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,460
when tackling issues.

321
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,390
You can't just stick to the old ways.

322
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,220
No matter how society develops,

323
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,610
people still need to be filial, right?

324
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,190
Sure. Of course you should be filial,

325
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,460
but you can't be blindly filial.

326
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,550
Exactly!

327
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,750
Let me tell you,

328
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,350
at a time like this,

329
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,220
if you don't think from your wife and daughter's perspective,

330
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,440
and their hearts end up getting broken,

331
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,710
there will be no turning back.

332
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,970
It's too late already!

333
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,070
Xia Maotian, listen to me.

334
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,010
Go back and be your mom's filial son.

335
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:55,970
From now on,

336
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,470
I'll take care of Fenghua,

337
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,530
and we'll live on our own.

338
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,660
You go your way, and I'll go mine.

339
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,500
From this point on, we part ways!

340
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,700
Mom!

341
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,070
What are you doing?

342
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:05,910
You guys...

343
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:06,430
Alright, stop it.

344
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,550
We can live just fine without a man!

345
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,430
Let's go! Let's go!

346
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:08,830
Mom!

347
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,390
Dad! Talk some sense into Mom!

348
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,780
She's not just saying this out of anger!

349
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,470
You see?

350
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,590
She's always talking about getting a divorce!

351
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,660
Always threatening to divorce me!

352
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,390
I can't live like this anymore!

353
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,680
Hey, you guys...

354
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,660
Stand up!

355
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,100
Act like a man!

356
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,470
Mom, I...

357
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,770
What kind of photo is this?

358
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,760
So ugly.

359
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,740
Mom.

360
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,440
I've made up my mind.

361
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,360
Yan and I can't raise this child.

362
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,510
You must raise him!

363
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,100
Our Xia family

364
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,360
can't end with your generation.

365
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,540
If you don't raise him, I'm not leaving!

366
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,020
I'm going to live here!

367
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,080
Living here seems quite nice.

368
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,210
The bed is so soft and comfortable.

369
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,190
Brother, why didn't you buy one for Mom?

370
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,920
He doesn't care about me at all!

371
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:08,950
Brother,

372
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,670
don't get so worked up.

373
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,640
We're not asking you to raise this child for real.

374
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,880
We're going to take him back to the village with us later.

375
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,970
All you need to do

376
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,390
is transfer money to my card every month.

377
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,670
This child's name

378
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,830
will still be recorded in your family genealogy.

379
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,910
Isn't that great?

380
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,350
What era are we living in?

381
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,030
Who still cares about family genealogy?

382
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,070
I do!

383
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,350
Your children

384
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,510
and every following generation will!

385
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,070
When we're alive, we are members of the Xia family,

386
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:34,980
and even after we die,

387
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,910
we'll be buried in the Xia family's ancestral grave!

388
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,520
We... We cannot forget our ancestors!

389
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,790
We can't.

390
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,230
There are no outsiders here.

391
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,490
You don't have to keep up the act anymore.

392
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,580
What are you talking about?

393
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,940
What act am I putting on?

394
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,300
Stop acting, okay?

395
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,900
Last week,

396
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,900
the village secretary called me.

397
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,850
What's a village secretary?

398
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,620
He explained everything very clearly.

399
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,270
What did he tell you?

400
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,170
He said someone's interested in our village's land

401
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,600
and wants to invest in developing a photovoltaic base.

402
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,850
What's a photovoltaic base?

403
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:17,650
Stop talking.

404
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,760
The relocation compensation

405
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,290
isn't a small amount, is it?

406
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,950
Don't listen to

407
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,950
his nonsense!

408
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,580
Nothing has been decided yet!

409
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,210
It's not even close to being finalized,

410
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,070
yet he's already making plans for it!

411
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:31,710
Don't listen to him!

412
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,000
Don't you worry.

413
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,370
I won't take a penny of that relocation money.

414
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,930
You and Honghong can take it all.

415
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:37,520
Brother!

416
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,860
Keep your voice down!

417
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,810
Brother...

418
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,910
Brother, sit down.

419
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,110
Don't be anxious.

420
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,020
Listen.

421
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,660
I won't agree with this.

422
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:46,790
No matter what,

423
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,260
you're still a part of the Xia family,

424
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,580
and you're the only male. As long as...

425
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,640
Let me finish first.

426
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,360
We won't take the money,

427
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,120
but you have to take the child with you.

428
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,840
If you don't trust me,

429
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,190
we can go to the notary office

430
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:05,900
and sign a transferring contract for the relocation compensation.

431
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,300
But I'm begging you guys,

432
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,550
from now on,

433
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,610
don't come and upset my wife and daughter anymore.

434
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,570
Can you do that?

435
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,700
Those two... They're my life.

436
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,300
Brother. We won't do that. We won't.

437
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,230
Mom is just looking out for you,

438
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,070
you know?

439
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,550
Don't interrupt.

440
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,640
Does Yan agree to this?

441
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,080
If you take this child away,

442
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,790
we can earn the money ourselves.

443
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,150
So, this is settled then.

444
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,130
Don't come saying that I forced you into this.

445
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,110
Do you hear me?

446
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,770
I'm doing this willingly.

447
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,170
I won't go back on my word!

448
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,230
Fenghua.

449
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,860
It's okay.

450
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:45,980
You know,

451
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,340
your father actually loves you very much.

452
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,220
Don't worry.

453
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,240
He won't let anyone hurt you.

454
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,130
Why are you crying?

455
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,110
You're usually so talkative,

456
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,960
but you fall apart at crucial moments.

457
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,630
Alright, alright.

458
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,590
I'm scared...

459
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,520
Why are you scared?

460
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,960
Your parents are still alive!

461
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,260
Whoever dares to bully my daughter,

462
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,660
I'll fight them to death!

463
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,380
Fenghua.

464
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,380
Fenghua.

465
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,700
Let me say a few words.

466
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:14,270
A good dog doesn't block the way.

467
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,869
Sorry, I'll make way for you.

468
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,349
I'm not talking about you.

469
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:18,560
Fenghua.

470
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,000
Grandma was thoughtless this time.

471
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,569
I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused you two.

472
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:23,730
I was wrong.

473
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,410
From now on,

474
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,329
just

475
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,220
listen to your parents

476
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,450
and be filial to them.

477
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,670
Grandma's leaving now.

478
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,390
You talk.

479
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,520
What about the child?

480
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,560
Didn't you say you wouldn't raise this child?

481
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,330
I'll take him back, and someone will raise him.

482
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:39,080
Our family isn't the only one in the village short of male heirs.

483
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,880
If you don't want him, others will.

484
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,030
Sister!

485
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,890
Let's go, let's go.

486
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,790
We're leaving.

487
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,390
Take care.

488
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:48,790
Come on.

489
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,430
Maotian.

490
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,390
This... I just bought this!

491
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,990
Buy another one.

492
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,490
The rice is still in the cooker!

493
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,870
Mom! Mom!

494
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,000
Alright, I'm leaving now.

495
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,490
I was cooking, too.

496
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,580
Alright. Alright.

497
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,990
So they gave in?

498
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,880
Yeah, they did.

499
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,080
Hey.

500
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,630
We'll buy another one.

501
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,950
Don't give everything...

502
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:19,830
Alright, alright.

503
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,190
Go back, no need to see us off.

504
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,070
Give this to me.

505
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,790
Hurry up and go.

506
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,130
No need to see us off.

Uncle, it's that kid!

508
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:26,930
Okay.

509
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,170
Don't block the way.

510
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,720
If we're late, we'll miss the bus.

511
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,260
Don't rush, old lady.

512
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,660
Excuse me, may I ask

513
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,980
what your relationship with this child is?

514
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,790
He is...

515
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,390
He's my relative's child.

516
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,650
Do you have his ID card?

517
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:42,860
He's too young,

518
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:43,680
so we haven't had the chance to get him one yet.

519
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,600

We actually picked up this child on the street.

531
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,670
I've heard of picking up money,

532
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,930
but picking up a child?

533
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,830

No, Officer!

Stand up and talk.

547
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,840
Our family needs a male heir,

548
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,640
and the neighbors had two boys,

549
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,140
so they gave us one.

550
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,660
I even had to pay them!

This must be a misunderstanding!

557
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,870
My mom is uneducated and doesn't understand the law.

558
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,580
She's old and muddled.

559

We'll leave the child to you.

560
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,760
Please forgive my mom.

561
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,710
Whether to forgive her or not is not up to me to decide.

562
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,390
It depends on what she's done.

You can't leave now.

You need to come back to the station with me

566
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,190
and clarify the situation.

567

I can't go.

Isn't this going too far?

576
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,670
As I said before,

577
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,960
I'll fight anyone who dares to bully you.

578

Alright then.

581
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:23,450
I'll ask the court to reduce her sentence by a few years.

I'll just watch you cry yourself to death.

You wouldn't be able to bear it.

Why wouldn't I?

587
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,630
I was born to be wicked,

00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,780

The police looked into the situation

and gave your grandma a punishment and a reprimand.

597

can you make it even cheaper?

Dad.

689
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,450
Is it because Uncle Xia opened a floating supermarket

690
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:20,630
and you're not happy about it?

691

Get lost!

692
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,730
Dad, why don't you open one, too?

693
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,950
With your connections, you'd definitely make money.

694
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,730
If you have something to say, just spit it out.

695
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,390
Don't keep it bottled up and make yourself sick.

696
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,690
It's not that I can't open one,

697
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,270
but if I do,

698
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:50,000
wouldn't I be stealing your Uncle Xia's business?

699
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,800
That's called being shameless.

703
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,630
Your mom should have put it here.

00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,160
This one.

705
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,470
It should be this one.

706
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,920
I'm thinking,

707
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,350
if things really don't work out,

708
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,820

You went to learn how to drive a truck?

Why didn't you discuss this with me beforehand?

715
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,220
Driving a truck is not a job for women.

716
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,310
Take Zhang as an example. Driving a truck

717
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,110
caused him so many health problems,

718
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,110
like kidney stones

719

so many dividends to the neighbors.

The traffic industry development statistics announcement

758

released by the Ministry of Transport in 2006 shows that

759
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,950
by the end of 2006,

760
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,190
the total length of highways in China was

I apologize to all of you.

845
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,720
How about I treat everyone to a late-night snack?

846
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,830
Drilling every day is so exhausting.

847
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,490
No one will be grateful to you for this.

848
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:07,390
When the time comes

849
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:09,610
and everyone gets into college because of this drilling you proposed,

850
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,830
they still won't be grateful to you.

851
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:11,710
I will.

852
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,490
I'll thank your whole family.

853
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:18,110
Let's go. Let's go.

854
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:18,850
Fenghua.

855
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:19,670
Fenghua.

856
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,360
Go home and sleep. You've been sleeping all day.

857
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,840
Where's my test paper?

858
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,870
Already handed in.

859
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:33,900
Why didn't anyone wait for me?

860
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,210
Stop laughing.

861
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,830
I'm going to the internet cafe

862
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,630
to look up some information on ship selling.

863
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,230
Also, there's a test problem from today

864
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,130
which I think has a better solution to it.

865
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:49,360
You can't be serious.

866
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,110
Are you planning a chakra explosion or something?

867
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,110
What else can I do?

868
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,390
It's not like I have Sharingan.

869
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,230
If I don't power up soon,

870
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,100
who am I going to copy from during the official exam?

871
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:56,690
What...

872
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,150
I'm coming, too.

873
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,930
What's wrong with these guys?

874
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,330
Xie.

875
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,850
It's not that I don't want to help you.

876
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,530
But, indeed,

877
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,170
I'm willing but unable to.

878
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,210
You know that I used to have over a dozen ships.

879
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:24,480
But later,

880
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,510
I didn't make any profit, you know?

881
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:29,170
I've gradually sold six of them already.

882
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,720
I'll be honest with you,

883
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,540
I don't know

884
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,370
what to do with the rest.

885
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,510
So,

886
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,510
as for your ship,

887
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,630
I really can't take it on.

888
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,070
Well,

889
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,180
how about a discount?

890
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,130
How much of a discount?

891
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:54,990
15%.

892
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,720
How much? 15%?

893
00:36:58,870 --> 00:36:59,800
Xie.

894
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,910
Let me tell you something you might not want to hear.

895
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,380
That old ship of yours,

896
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,130
how many years has it been running?

897
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:10,130
Do you know that no one would take it even at half price?

898
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,350
When you have time,

899
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:14,190
go out and see the world more.

900
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,810
Who's still

901
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:20,010
using ships for cargo transportation these days?

902
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:22,870
Every trip by ship is guaranteed to lose money.

903
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,190
Alright.

904
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,310
I'll do you a favor and ask around in Taizhou.

905
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,330
Convert that old ship of yours

906
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,710
into a fishing boat.

907
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,390
But converting the ship costs money, too.

908
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,850
Where am I supposed to get that kind of money?

909
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,300
Look.

910
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:54,910
I'll be honest with you.

911
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:57,110
The money from my neighbors,

912
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,560
the dividends, I haven't paid them back yet.

913
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:03,400
My wife asked me whenever she saw me

914
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,190
when

915
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,820
I could bring the money home.

916
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:08,070
What kind of life is this?

917
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,070
Xie.

918
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,910
At least

919
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,480
it's a desperate solution, right?

920
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,650
G-Give it more thought.

921
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,780
Eat.

922
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:20,950
You eat.

Will it work now that we put this online?

It's better than just waiting at home, right?

927
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,430
Ships are hard to sell these days.

928
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:53,690
It might be able to sell

929
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:54,620
on the internet.

930
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:55,870
Hey.

931
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,260
If you really sell it,

932
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,720
what about your dad?

933
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,260
We'll see about that.

934
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,600
A grown man can't be defeated so easily.

935
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:09,930
I don't have any other ideas right now anyways.

936
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,430
I'll give it one last shot.

937
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,160
If I can get into college,

938
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,550
my dad will definitely be able to pull himself together.

939
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,080
I'll set an example for him.

940
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,870
Your dad is a capable man after all.

941
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,360
He doesn't need you to set an example for him.

942
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:27,420
Have you guys seen what my dad looks like on the ship?

943
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,390
Head held high,

944
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,410
full of vigor,

945
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,680
as if he dug the canal himself.

946
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,970
When the ship was sold,

947
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,340
my dad would be dispirited.

948
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:40,590
I can't bear to see him like that.

949
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,660
My mom is suffering, too.

950
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:46,250
New gray hair grows at her temples every day.

951
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,610
Can't even pluck it all.

952
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,310
When I see the gray hair,

953
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,600
my heart feels like it's being pricked by needles.

954
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,360
Right now,

955
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,870
I don't have any grand plans.

my parents don't have to work so hard.

I don't think it's that important anymore.

Why did you drink so much?

Here, water.

I

am sorry.

If only

967
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,480
I were more capable

968
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,610
and could make money,

969
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:39,510
I wouldn't...

970
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,460
I wouldn't hold you back in your studies.

But I

973
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,570
really tried my best.
