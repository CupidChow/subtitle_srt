00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,310
Why not?

177
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,550
I just know it.

178
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,720
Don't burn yourself.

179
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:37,930
Delicious.

180
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,150
Go eat inside.

181
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:42,909
Wanghe.

182
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,740
Come. Bring the dishes over.

183
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,659
Coming.

184
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,180
Okay.

185
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,550
Siyi.

186
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,690
Here, have another bun.

187
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,450
Here.

188
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,860
I'm full.

189
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:09,950
Siyi.

190
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,550
Are you feeling unwell?

191
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,680
Tell me.

192
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,030
No.

193
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,310
Then have another bun.

194
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,110
You're growing.

195
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,950
Grandma, I really can't eat anymore.

196
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,270
Enjoy your dinner.

197
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,330
I'll wash the dishes after I finish my homework.

198
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,950
Are you almost done?

199
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:39,990
One pot left.

200
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,420
Almost done?

201
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,860
It's really not easy work.

202
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,500
You get up two hours earlier than us every day.

203
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,690
Yeah.

204
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,110
Why don't you do something else?

205
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,480
What else can I do?

206
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,060
When will they come back today?

207
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,360
No idea.

208
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,630
Those men

209
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,190
forget their homes when they're at sea.

210
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,190
They wish they could never come back.

211
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:03,670
Morning.

212
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,870
Granny Ma, let me help you.

213
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,540
No need.

214
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,310
No need.

215
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,710
Go on with your work.

216
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,500
Did you use the herbal plaster I gave you yesterday?

217
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,670
Yes.

218
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,670
Granny Ma.

219
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,750
Morning.

220
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,250
Everything's set?

221
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:17,700
Be careful.

222
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:18,860
Okay.

223
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,870
Careful.

224
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,270
Let me help you.

225
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,670
I'm good.

Let me help you.

227
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,390
I got it.

228
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,030
Yan, pick that up for me.

229
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,510
Okay.

230
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,190
Be careful.

231
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,390
Take it down.

232

Come on. Eat your fill.

240
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,710
Last night, when I was sleeping,

241
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,230
I heard your dad snoring.

242
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,480
He snored even louder than Li Yuanba.

243
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,510
Hurry up.

244
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,750
Finish it and go to school.

you're cooked.

247
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,510
Mom, it's Saturday.

248
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,250
Still, eat quickly.

249
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,500
Then go do your thing.

250
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,110
Don't sit at the table for long.

251

Mom.

252
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,660
Give me five yuan.

253
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,010
Take it yourself.

254
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,960
Here.

255
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,500
Only five yuan.

256
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,030
Thank you, Mom.

257
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,710
Guys, let's go.

Your breakfast!

You haven't finished it yet!

260
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:36,110
Those kids ran off as soon as they were full.

261

He took the money and ran off.

Why are you following us?

266
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,840
Aren't you afraid of having a toothache

267
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,910
after eating it all by yourself?

268
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,910
Even if I lose all my teeth, it's none of your business.

269
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,520
Stop following me.

270
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,830
You want a bite?

271
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,190
Five yuan per bite. You can pay in installments.

272
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,190
Are you looking for a beating again?

273
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,580
Hello?

274
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,740
Mom.

275
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,830

Siyi,

279
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,090
just tell me what it is.

280
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,560
Why are you crying?

281
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,950
You're a big girl now.

282
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,150
Mom, how long do I have to stay at Grandma's?

283
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,890
When will you take me back?

284
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,270
I can look after my brother for you.

285
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,030
It won't affect my schoolwork.

286
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,910
I can also do the laundry and cook.

Don't come near her again!

326

328
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,470

330
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,790
I said she's your neighbor, not your wife!

Now, let's solve the first equation.

We can see that

it's division, right?

336
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,240
First,

337
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,300
we divide 34 by 4.

338
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,990
Next, we write down the formula.

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,150
8.

344
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,390

right?

348
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,910
4 plus 8 is

349
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,430
32.

350
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,190
32.

351
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,200
♫Listening to the river flow♫

352
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:52,850
Remainder…

353
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,870
Finish your dinner first!

354
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,030
I've finished.

355
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,730
Haikuo.

356
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,110
Come.

357
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,650
Where is Xingchi?

358
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,500
I don't know.

359
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,480
Xingchi.

360
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,200
Come.

361
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,240
What's wrong, Wanghe?

362
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,460
We have a mission?

363
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,850
What's it?

364
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,320
You want me to do your homework again?

365
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,170
No.

366
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,210
Come here.

367
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,510
It's something more important.

368
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,130
What's it?

369
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:21,830
What's it?

370
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,440
Well…

371
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,350
I don't know what to say.

372
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,630
It was just a joke, wasn't it?

373
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,170
He's serious.

374
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,140
Don't you know

375
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,250
that idiot

376
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,720
would take jokes seriously?

377
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,830
What did you say?

378
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,410
Go explain it as soon as possible.

379
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,150
Come out.

380
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,110
What?

381
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,210
Just come out.

382
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,670
Don't ask.

383
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,740
And then like this.

384
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:19,210
Okay. Try it.

385
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,440
How is it?

386
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,210
Not bad.

387
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,870
If you see it on the street,

388
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,870
will you buy it?

389
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,380
No, I think not.

390
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,430
Why not?

391
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,950
I don't like sweet things.

392
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,190
Then what do you like to eat?

393
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,980
Eel noodles

394
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,230
made by my mom.

395
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,070
My mom can make them too.

396
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,730
I'll invite you over when she makes eel noodles.

397
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,720
What is your strongest subject in school?

398
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,320
Literature.

399
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,700
How about writing?

400
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,070
Not bad.

401
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,410
Then you'll help me write essays,

402
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,590
and I'll beat boys for you.

403
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,670
Beat boys?

404
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,680
If anyone messes with you, I'll beat him up!

405
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,910
We'll go to school and go home together.

406
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,770
Then we'll do homework together.

407
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,170
It's decided then?

408
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,610
So hot.

409
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,500
Hot, hot!

410
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:34,970
Mom.

411
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,030
What?

412
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,190
My dear mom,

413
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,070
can you give me some money?

414
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,620
I gave you money just last week.

415
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,400
I spent it all.

416
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,980
Mom.

417
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:47,940
How much do you want?

418
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:49,700
How much do you have?

419
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,610
You want every penny I have?

420
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,050
So little?

421
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,430
Do you want it or not?

422
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,580
Yes, yes.

423
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,310
What are you looking at?

424
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,790
How would I give you fake money?

425
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,210
I'm afraid you were careless

426
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,610
and received fake money.

427
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,310
You brat!

428
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,110
The basin!

429
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,630
Thank you, Mom.

430
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,300
I can tell fake money.

431
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,340
I have 12 yuan and 6 jiao.

432
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,650
32 yuan and 5 jiao.

433
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,190
How much more do we need?

434
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,480
80 yuan.

435
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,950
What should we do?

436
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:00,240
Let's go.

437
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:00,710
What?

438
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,510
What?

439
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,310
Let's go make money!

440
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,590
A new one.

441
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,430
Got it!

442
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,080
You're productive today.

443
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:31,840
Let's go.

444
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,310
Let's go.

445
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,270
Be careful.

446
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,240
Make way.

447
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,030
Make way.

448
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,470
Make way!

449
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,140
Make way!

450
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,750
Make way!

451
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,120
Dad!

452
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,590
You went swimming?

453
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,670
Come out.

454
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,670
You guys collected them?

455
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,030
They're quite big.

456
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,050
They're for sale.

457
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,280
What do you mean?

458
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,950
You want to sell them to me?

459
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:15,880
Okay.

460
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:16,780
How much?

461
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,160
80 yuan.

462
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,630
Are you trying to rob me?

463
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,300
80 is the market price.

464
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,150
If they're not enough,

465
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:23,990
we can go back and get more.

466
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,190
But you need to pay us first.

467
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:25,860
Pay…

468
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,380
In cash.

469
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,270
You're really smart, aren't you?

470
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,950
Pay in advance, right?

471
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:34,640
Okay.

472
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,520
Be careful when you're in the river.

473
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,240
Wanghe.

474
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,610
What are you doing here?

475
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:39,450
Wait. It's…

476
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,670
Why are you running away?

477
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,630
Brat, put on your shoes!

478
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,970
Don't hurt your feet.

479
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,590
These…

480
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,750
They collected them?

481
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,630
Yes.

482
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:49,750
Well…

483
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,480
They sold them to me.

484
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,870
You can't spoil them like this.

485
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:52,510
It's fine.

486
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,800
It wasn't easy.

487
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:54,730
Naughty boys.

488
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,110
Alright.

489
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:56,790
Well…

490
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,640
Hurry up.

491
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,810
Let's eat them for dinner.

492
00:21:58,810 --> 00:21:59,850
For dinner.

493
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,000
Those kids

494
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,550
are quite business-minded.

495
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,390
Business-minded?

496
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,230
They can make money already.

497
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,190
They ran away

498
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:06,750
without shoes.

499
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,350
What if they hurt their feet?

500
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,430
Siyi, Siyi, Siyi.

501
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,270
Do you like your new schoolbag?

502
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,510
My new schoolbag?

503
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,570
-Yes.
-Your new schoolbag.

504
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,090
Look. We all have new schoolbags.

505
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:55,970
We all do.

506
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,830
If you don't like that schoolbag,

507
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,130
we can switch with you.

508
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,850
I like my new schoolbag.

509
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,180
Siyi, let me fill it for you.

510
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,240
Let me do it!

511
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,800
Siyi, put it on.

512
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,230
Let's go to school.

513
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,150
Let's go.

514
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,030
Let's go to school.

515
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,350
Go to school!

516
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,570
Siyi, slow down.

517
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,200
Grandpa, I'm back!

518
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:51,960
Coming.

519
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:52,910
They're coming.

520
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,730
The kids are back from school. Slow down.

521
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:55,390
Go to your grandpa.

522
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:58,740
[By the Canal]

523
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,150
Come on.

524
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:56,910
Sit down.

525
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:57,710
Slow down.

526
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:59,910
Tell the chef

527
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,190
the food for children can't be heavy.

528
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,500
Got it?

529
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,910
Kids nowadays love fried food.

530
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,160
Just do as I say.

531
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,950
Okay.

532
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:06,480
Thank you, Grandpa.

533
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,390
Thank you, Grandpa.

534
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:07,750
Okay.

535
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,970
Eat up.

536
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,720
Master Zhou.

537
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,550
Master Zhou.

538
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,950
Nice to meet you.

539
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,190
Let me introduce someone to you.

540
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,550
This is the new district chief,

541
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,150
Ms. Gu.

542
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:22,880
Hello.

543
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,080
Hello, Master Zhou.

544
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,970
He's the owner of By the Canal.

545
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,420
Zhimei.

546
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,590
Let me introduce you.

547
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,380
This is my wife.

548
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,310
This is Ms. Gu.

549
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:30,870
Ms. Gu.

550
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,110
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

551
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,110
I heard many kids come to eat here.

552
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:34,550
-Yes.
-Yeah. Yeah.

553
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,530
It's convenient for them to eat together.

554
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,350
School has started.

555
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,920
I'm too busy with work

556
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,470
to cook for him.

557
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:44,110
So I want him to eat here.

558
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,230
Is it okay with you?

559
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,270
Sure, no problem.

560
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,150
That'll be great.

561
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:47,950
Chen Rui.

562
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:48,870
Your classmates.

563
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:49,390
Chen Rui!

564
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,110
You know each other?

565
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:50,390
Chen Rui!

566
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,190
You all know each other.

567
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,950
Dad, he's my classmate, Chen Rui.

568
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:53,750
You're in the same class?

569
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,110
Yeah.

570
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,110
Come, come.

571
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,910
Sit down.

572
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:56,710
Sit here.

573
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,570
Come, sit here.

574
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,230
Sit here and eat.

575
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,030
Sit.

576
00:24:59,030 --> 00:24:59,790
Yeah.

577
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,550
Well,

578
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,610
how much should I pay you every month?

579
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,270
You don't need to pay.

580
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,130
Take the money.

581
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,110
If you don't,

582
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,270
I can't let my son eat here.

583
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:06,980
Ms. Gu!

584
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,230
You're doing me a favor.

585
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,400
Ms. Gu!

586
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,620
Mr. Shao.

587
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,230
Well, you're Mr. Shao, right?

588
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,110
Yes.

589
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,170
Ms. Gu's husband is my colleague.

590
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,890
We work in the same office.

591
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,050
What a coincidence.

592
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,540
Chen Bo told me

593
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,350
that you're writing "The Story of the Canal."

594
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,110
Yes.

595
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,190
Don't forget to highlight

596
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,950
Shuipu District and Flower Street.

597
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,560
Of course.

598
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,740
If that's the case,

599
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,430
I'll apply for a special

600
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,110
cultural grant for you.

601
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:34,960
Ms. Gu.

602
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,640
No masterpiece

603
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,420
was written for money!

604
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,610
Mr. Shao.

605
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,450
You're a man of noble character.

606
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,240
I admire you.

607
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:43,460
But

608
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,620
if you take my book

609
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,950
as a cultural project,

610
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,770
it'll be very necessary

611
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,480
to apply for a grant for it.

612
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,710
If you say so…

613
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,140
I understand.

614
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,280
I understand.

615
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,190
Grandpa,

616
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,170
tell us a story.

617
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,930
Sure. What story should I tell?

618
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,110
The story behind this monument.

619
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,270
This monument

620
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,420
is quite old.

621
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:08,750
I'll tell you what the inscription

622
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,090
means later.

623
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,750
As for who erected it,

624
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,150
you all know his name.

625
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,060
Do you know Prime Minister Liu Luoguo?

626
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:15,790
Yes.

627
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,180
Back then, Flower Street

628
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,190
was very famous along the canal.

629
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,470
Ships coming and going all had to

630
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,530
pass through the lock here and fill out official forms.

631
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,090
Liu Yong

632
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,520
erected this monument to thank the people

633
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,960
of Flower Street,

634
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,740
wishing for the Qing dynasty's

635
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,290
long-lasting prosperity.

636
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,640
But didn't the Qing dynasty end long ago?

637
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,370
Yes.

638
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,350
Do you know how the Qing dynasty ended?

639
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,970
The Eight-Nation Alliance.

640
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,130
Nonsense!

641
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,800
They only invaded Beijing.

642
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,540
Empress Dowager Cixi fled,

643
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,190
but the empire didn't fall.

644
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,730
Back then,

645
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,890
the troops of the Alliance came here.

646
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,030
There was a foreigner

647
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:58,400
from Italy

648
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,890
whose name was something

649
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,490
sounding like Little Polo.

650
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,260
According to the county annals,

651
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,480
he came to China from the South Sea

652
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:11,240
and rented a big ship in Hangzhou.

653
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,150
He hired several servants

654
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,870
and went all the way north.

655
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:15,710
Siyi.

656
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,550
Was he your ancestor?

657
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,900
No, Grandma said

658
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,770
my ancestors went south from the north.

659
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,690
That guy went north.

660
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,360
The locals

661
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,570
said he carried a soul absorber with him

662
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:28,960
and took people's souls.

663
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,520
Really?

664
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,980
It was just a camera.

665
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,470
Here, eat it.

666
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,710
Siyi, it's really sweet.

667
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,390
I don't want it.

668
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:39,990
Take a bite.

669
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:40,710
I don't want it!

670
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,710
Just a bite.

671
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:42,470
I don't eat ice cream.

672
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,190
Try it.

673
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,270
Don't touch me!

674
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,660
Liang!

675
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:46,590
Eat it.

676
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,490
What are you doing?

677
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,750
Did I hit you?

678
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,980
Liang, stop it!

679
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,710
Liang!

680
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,320
Beat you up!

681
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,230
Beat them!

682
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,190
Stop!

683
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,790
Stop fighting! Stop it!

684
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,410
Let go! Break it up!

685
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,530
What are you doing?

686
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:12,480
Break it up!

687
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,630
Get up. Let go!

688
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,050
Let go!

689
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:14,760
Let go!

690
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,850
Kids, what happened to you?

691
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,980
Did you…

692
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,390
Did you get into a fight?

693
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,230
-No!
-No!

694
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:55,970
Nothing happened.

695
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,060
Don't deny it!

696
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,100
Look at you.

697
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,030
What happened?

698
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,140
It was…

699
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,580
It was self-defense.

700
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,920
Shao Xingchi!

701
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,660
Come home with me!

702
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,170
Wanghe, let's go.

703
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,050
Mom, wait.

704
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:15,720
Mom...

705
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:16,880
Mom, it's not like that.

706
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,200
Mom, listen…

707
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,750
H-Hold on.

708
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,990
What's wrong with you?

709
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,220
Let me walk you home.

710
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,100
Come in.

711
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,630
Mom, I didn't start it!

712
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,150
They started it.

713
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:26,720
Mom.

714
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,710
Can't you stay out of trouble

715
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,910
for just one day?

716
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:29,470
Let's go take a look.

717
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,470
You taught me to be righteous!

718
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,790
Righteous?

719
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,720
Go ahead. Hit me!

720
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,570
Hit me all you want.

721
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:37,220
What? You feel aggrieved?

722
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,190
You wanna hit me again?

723
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,910
Go ahead!

724
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:42,410
Fine.

725
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,810
Fine. I won't hit you.

726
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:44,550
Tell me

727
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,310
what happened.

728
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,110
Who did you fight with?

729
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:48,510
Siyi was bullied

730
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,990
by a bunch of punks at school.

731
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,030
How could I just stand by?

732
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,560
Sorry,

733
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,370
I was wrong.

734
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,190
Alright?

735
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,910
But no matter what,

736
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:08,750
in the future,

737
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,570
don't fight again.

738
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,510
Understand?

739
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,280
Also,

740
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,520
Siyi

741
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,150
is sensitive.

742
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,450
She's not as strong as you guys.

743
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,990
Help her more.

744
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,890
Treat her like your sister.

745
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:26,900
Look out for her.

746
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:28,940
Got it?

747
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,740
Yes.

748
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,650
Siyi,

749
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,920
you're Wanghe's sister from now on.

750
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,170
Are you hurt?

751
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,470
No.

752
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,420
Grandma,

753
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,560
how long have our neighbors been living here?

754
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,720
Very, very long.

755
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,850
The Zhou family in the front yard

756
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,600
moved here right after this place was built.

757
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,620
I was there when Haikuo was born.

758
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,200
He was such a sweet baby.

759
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,130
He barely cried or threw tantrums.

760
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,390
He was also smart.

761
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,840
Before all his baby teeth came in,

762
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,840
he could already recite many poems.

Mr. Zhou, let me tell you.

819
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,830
The new ship

820
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,490
is a good bargain.

821
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,870
You know why? Because

822
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:33,430
the main engine of this ship

823
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,350
is imported.

824
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,510
A foreign engine.

825
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,270
It's fuel-efficient

826
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,680
and makes less noise.

827
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,410
Hey.

828
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:42,630
Have a seat.

829
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:43,230

830
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:43,670

831
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:44,660
We're talking about the engine,

832
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,660
the latest model.

833
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,690
We've found a buyer

834
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,230
for our old ship.

835
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:51,910
He offered a fair price.

836
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,020
Right, Lao'er?

837
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,150
As for the new ship,

838
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,060
we've contacted

839
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,440
the shipyard.

840
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,430
As long as the payment is made,

841
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,390
we can get the ship in one week.

842
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,590
So fast.

843
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:03,830
So, I've explained

844
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,190
everything to you.

845
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,870
If you think it's feasible,

846
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:08,040
chip in.

847
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,580
If you're not interested,

848
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,949
drop out.

849
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,980
We'll still be friends either way.

850
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,300
Don't feel pressured.

851
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,590
No pressure.

852
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,389
I told you.

853
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:17,870
We'll chip in, right?

854
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:19,350
Dad, I've brought the money.

855
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,870

No, no, no.

857
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,389

858
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,179
Don't do this.

859
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:25,969
You don't have much money,

860
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,219
and now you have a granddaughter to raise.

861
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:29,560
You don't have to invest,

862
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,800
but you can keep your shares.

863
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,610
Exactly.

864
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:33,750
No way.

865
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,469
I'd feel terrible.

866
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:36,550
No, no!

867
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,000
What's wrong with you?

868
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:39,790
Tiancheng, listen.

869
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,190
Don't feel pressured.

870
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:42,510
We all made money

871
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,659
from your ship in the past.

872
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,389
Whether this is profitable or not,

873
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:47,670

874

00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,550
can't make ends meet.

876
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:53,110
Yeah!

877
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:53,960
Yeah!

878
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,310
Okay.

879
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,880
We'll keep your money.

880
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,510
No need to ask us.

881
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,830
We all listen to you.

882
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,150
This is our money.

883
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,590
We're also in.

884
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,150
Look.

885
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:02,820
Yes.

886
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:03,990
Here's the money.

887
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,740
Is the money enough?

888
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:09,230
I think it's almost enough.

889
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,070
Later, Lao'er and I

890
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,750
will count…

891
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:13,350
Count the money.

892
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,830
Count the money, and then decide

893
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,980
how many shares you get based on the amount of your money.

894
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,670
We'll do it the old way.

895
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:18,990
Okay.

896
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:19,480
Are we clear?

897
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:19,990
Yeah.

898
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,830
Don't worry. After we make the payment,

899
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:22,950
we can see

900
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,070
our new ship

901
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,910
in one week!

902
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,670
Let me have a look.

903
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,030
I'm not done yet.

904
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,150
Let me take a look.

905
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,030
Give it to her.

906
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:51,950
You bad boy.

907
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,580
Can I have a try?

908
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,960
You want to have a try?

909
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,780
Okay.

910
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,710
Son, after a few years,

911
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,430
when the Grand Canal is dredged,

912
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,950
we'll sail this ship

913
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:11,060
all the way north to Beijing!

914
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:11,630
I want to go too!

915
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,580
No problem.

916
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,150
Alright.

917
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,080
Let me take over.

918
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,030
Dad.

919
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,550
I've never seen the sea.

920
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,950
When can we sail this ship

921
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,080
to the sea?

922
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,500
Sail this ship to the sea?

923
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:23,960
Yes.

924
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,700
It may look big,

925
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,580
but on the sea,

926
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,270
it's just a small ship.

927
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:30,150
To withstand the winds and waves on the sea,

928
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,570
we need a much bigger ship.

929
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,630
You know what a 10,000-ton ship is like?

930
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,430
After I grow up,

931
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,630
I'll buy you a 10,000-ton ship,

932
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,160
and we'll sail it to the sea.

933
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,270
Good boy. You've got ambition!

934
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,790
I'll wait for that day.

935
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,520
You've got ambition.

936
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,200
A 10,000-ton ship.

937
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,030
Grandma, I'm taking Siyi for a swim.

938
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,280
Grandma, can I go with them

939
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,110
for a swim?

940
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:11,910
Be careful.

941
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:12,450
Okay.

942
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:13,010
Okay.

943
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,190
Wanghe.

944
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:14,630
We're leaving!

945
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,510
Take care of your friends!

946
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,030
Fenghua, keep an eye on Siyi.

947
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:19,160
Don't swim too far into the deep water.

948
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:22,430
Fenghua, you're as slow as a turtle!

949
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:23,570
Hurry up!

950
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,140
I want to be a captain in the future.

951
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,180
I'll buy a big ship

952
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:35,270
and sail all the way south.

953
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:37,180
I'll go to Sanjiangkou, then out to the open sea,

954
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,000
and onward to the Suez Canal.

955
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:40,280
I'll go with you.

956
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,690
No women on board.

957
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:44,220
I'll buy a ship myself and be a female captain.

958
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,190
Can you even swim?

959
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,730
I swim better than you.

960
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:50,690
Stop bragging.

961
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,890
Let's find it out in the water.

962
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,180
No problem.

963
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,830
The one who gets there first wins.

964
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:58,710
Okay.

965
00:37:58,730 --> 00:37:59,800
-Come on.
-Come on.

966
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,080
Ready?

967
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,560
One, two, three, jump!

968
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,350
Slow down!

969
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:58,020
[2007]

970
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,120
Fenghua!

971
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:13,140
Jump in!

972
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:14,310
Jump in!

973
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,000
Jump in!

974
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,190
Jump in!

975
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,350
I told you my mom washed my swimsuit.

976
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,440
So what?

977
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:20,070
Just jump in.

978
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:20,780
Jump in!

979
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,600
Jump in!

980
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,230
Jump in!

981
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,870
Siyi, how can you side with them?

982
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,710
Jump in. Come on!

983
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,390
Come on.

984
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,190
Jump in!

985
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,270
-Jump in!
-Come on!

986
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:29,150
I'm warning you.

987
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:29,830
Stop splashing,

988
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,560
or you'll have to go home naked.

989
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:32,960
Jump in!

990
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:33,950
Jump in!

991
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:35,360
Don't make me come up there and push you.

992
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,550
Are you too scared to jump?

993
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,010
Why would I be scared?

994
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:39,690
You think I'm scared?

995
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,510
Don't take away our clothes!

996
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,870
Leave something for me!

997
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,670
There's nothing I don't dare do.

998
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:49,190
Go home naked!

999
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:49,900
Fenghua!

1000
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:50,390
Fenghua!

1001
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,560
Xia Fenghua!

1002
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,160
-Fenghua!
-Fenghua!

1003
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:55,630
Help!

1004
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,640
That's what you get for messing with me.

1005
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,860
Help!

1006
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,550
Someone fell into the river!

1007
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:01,160
Let's go.

1008
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,310
You can't die!

1009
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:06,840
We're in so much debt!

1010
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:09,910
How are our kid and I going to live?

1011
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,410
Watch your step!

1012
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,630
What happened?

1013
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:34,550
Mom.

1014
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:36,840
What's going on?

1015
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:38,790
Wu, the seafarer,

1016
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,720
couldn't pay his debt

1017
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,090
and took his own life.

1018
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:44,830
Didn't he just buy a new ship?

1019
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,300
How is he in debt?

1020
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,310
He gambled?

1021
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:49,520
He borrowed money to buy the ship, but it was hard to get orders.

1022
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,310
He shipped coal last month

1023
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,400
and counted on it to pay his debt.

1024
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,600
But he overloaded the ship

1025
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,150
and was fined a lot of money.

1026
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,440
There are more and more highways

1027
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,170
and fewer and fewer ships.

1028
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,490
What should we do?

1029
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,170
The tide of change

1030
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:04,720
is unstoppable

1031
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:08,180
and leaves its mark on everyone.

1032
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,760
Seven years ago,

1033
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,370
the Beijing-Shanghai Expressway, which spans the Yellow River

1034
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:15,820
and leaps over the Yangtze River, was put into operation.

1035
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,500
Since then, it has greatly promoted

1036
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:22,530
the development of areas along the route and even the national economy.

1037
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:26,450
The cars on shore are running faster and faster.

1038
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:29,090
The seafarers who make a living on the water

1039
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,760
find it harder and harder

1040
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:34,240
to feel a sense of honor and accomplishment.

1041
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,870
Business is getting smaller and smaller.

1042
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,540
Profits are dwindling.

1043
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,850
The shipping business on the canal

1044
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:45,270
seems to be moving forward

1045
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:48,100
with this fast-paced world,

1046
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:51,150
but actually, it's going in the opposite direction.

1047
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,300
However, the spirit of the canal

1048
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:57,360
is already flowing in the blood of the canal people.

1049
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,750
The new era has presented new challenges

1050
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:01,740
for the young generation

1051
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:03,700
living by the canal.
