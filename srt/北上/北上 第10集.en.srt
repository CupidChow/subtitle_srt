All right.

4
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,150
Hey,

5
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,220
you don't look bad with makeup on.

6
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,590
Here you go, for the two of you.

7
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,240
Let's eat something first.

8
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,100
Then, we'll find an internet cafe

9
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,030
and stay up until dawn.

10
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,780
We'll take the first bus tomorrow morning

11
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,310
to go back to Flower Street.

12

Here.

13
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,130
How did you know I would be in trouble?

14
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,280
When your mom asked me to look at the contract last time,

15
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,810
I felt a bit uneasy.

16
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,430
So I asked Haikuo

17
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,340
to investigate this studio.

18
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,910
They have a website. From there,

19
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,350
we found an email address from their contact.

[System Management Log-in]

21
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,650
With that, we found out

22
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,310
that this email

23
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,430
was also registered to an online photo album.

24
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,670
Zhou Haikuo hacked into this online album.

25
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,930
When we looked at it,

26
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,250
we got so furious.

27
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,320
This is definitely a gang of perverts.

28
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,520
Let's call the police.

29
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,579
The extent of this isn't illegal yet.

30
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,640
Calling the police won't help.

31
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,630
They can't file a case.

32
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,430
If Fenghua takes these kinds of photos,

33
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,090
the school will definitely expel her.

34
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,740
If she doesn't take them, they'll say she breached the contract

35
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,200
and make her pay a penalty.

36
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,510
These bastards are really despicable.

37
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,360
Then I rushed to your house,

38
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,380
but your mom said you had already gone downtown.

39
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,360
So I hurried over here in a panic.

40
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,310
Fortunately, I arrived in time,

Otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

How did you know I was in this hotel?

44
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,370
You even knew the room number.

45
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,050
Haikuo and Xingchi went to the police station

46
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,329
saying you were missing.

47
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:30,579
They gave them your ID number.

48
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:31,910

49

00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,590
Yes.

We're lucky to have him this time.

52
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,600
Otherwise, you'd have been done for.

53
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,640
Where are those two?

54
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,940
Why didn't they come?

55
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,490

I'll call them

59

and they'll alert the police.

60

They'll come over with the police.

It's a blessing nothing bad happened.

Can you stop getting involved in these things from now on?

Even if pies were falling from the sky,

I didn't ask you to come save me.

this is the last time I'm helping you.

From now on, even if you're in deep trouble,

I won't care.

It's best to do so.

109

Otherwise, they might cause trouble.

I'll report him to the police and have him arrested.

112

114

Hand it over to the police.

Those are just photos of people in underwear.

But it didn't happen, right?

120

Even if you report it, there's no evidence.

121
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,200
The key is, I'm worried if this gets blown out of proportion,

122
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,700
it could damage your reputation.

All right.

I'll come back when I succeed.

I'm acting first and reporting later.

159

They wouldn't agree to me going.

160

Then why are you bothering with this?

00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:10,670
Hello.

341
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,100
I'd like to rent a server.

342
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,390
That's such a small capacity.

343
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,860
That's not enough for anything.

344
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,900
A personal website?

345
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,580
It's for personal use at the moment.

346
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,100
I'll need to expand capacity when the scale grows.

347
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,800
Why don't you share one with others?

348
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,090
Several people can use one server together.

349
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,020
You can split the annual fee.

350
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,950
That won't work.

351
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,320
There's no guarantee for data security.

352
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,940
Do you usually live in Beijing?

353
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,080
I'm in Honghuai.

354
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,360
Honghuai...

355
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,790
Insufficient funds.

356
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,580
How about this?

357
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,610
You could get a domestic server.

358
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,070
Although...

359
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,710
the configuration is lower, the price is cheaper.

360
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,270
It's just that the maintenance and migration costs afterwards

361
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,870
might be more expensive than foreign servers.

362
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,270
The maintenance fee is calculated separately.

363
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,270
All right, it's sufficient for now.

364
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,900
Um, can I see the server room?

365
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,109
Sure.

366
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,180
ID card.

367
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:19,050
[Name: Xie Wanghe]

368
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,099
[Pass]

369
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,190
Come here.

370
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,260
The third one in the second to last group of servers.

371
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,320
Their website just shut down.

372
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,190
It's used.

373
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:52,950
About a year old.

374
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,550
But the performance is fine.

375
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,690
Hurry up, hurry up.

376
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,270
Hello, teacher.

377
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,720
What did Xie Wanghe go to Beijing for?

378
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,310
What's he up to?

379
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,360
Are you performing a choir performance?

380
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,620
You won't tell me, huh?

381
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,940
None of you will say anything, right?

382
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,630
Fine then.

383
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,620
This matter has now become serious.

384
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,540
Expulsion from school is not out of the question.

385
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,730
I'm going to the principal right now.

386
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,150
Don't, don't!

387
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,030
Mr. Xu!

388
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,910
He went to...

389
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,960
rent a server.

390
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,260
What did you say?

391
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,900
Wanghe wants to set up an online–

392
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,250
Teacher,

393
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,950
Wanghe will only be gone for a few days.

394
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,190
He'll be back soon.

395
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,070
Don't worry.

396
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,100
It's a good thing he's not doing anything bad this time.

397
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,590
If this project really succeeds,

398
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,590
not just our school,

399
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,250
the whole Honghuai area could benefit from it.

400
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,030
You're just blowing hot air.

401
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,430
Don't I know him well enough?

402
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,310
He's always got big ideas but no skills to back them up.

403
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,540
He's got plenty of ideas,

404
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,910
but what can he actually do well?

405
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,670
If he becomes the CEO

406
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,770
of that website,

407
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,900
he'd run it into the ground in less than six months.

408
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,090
You,

409
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,610
go to Xie Wanghe's house tonight.

410
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,960
Have his parents write an excuse note.

411
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:06,980
The reason

412
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,070
absolutely cannot be "starting a business."

413
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,110
Otherwise, I won't be able to cover for him.

414
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:11,670
All right,

415
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,390
we'll get it done tonight

416
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,150
and submit it first thing in the morning.

417
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,210
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

418
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,150
Thank you, teacher.

419
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,830
Okay, okay, hurry back now.

420
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,650
Quick, quick, quick.

421
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,940
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

422
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,260
Keep your mouth shut.

423
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,590
Let's think about the reason for taking leave.

424
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,830
His grandmother is critically ill.

425
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,160
He's accompanying him.

426
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,780
Didn't his grandmother already pass away?

427
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,430
The school doesn't know that.

428
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,650
This won't work.

429
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:50,270
It'll be more troublesome if someone reports him later.

430
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,350
Let's think again.

431
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,180
Think of a reason that the school can accept.

432
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,160
I've got one.

433
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,550
Let's say Xie Wanghe has a brain tumor.

434
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,660
He needs to go to Beijing for surgery.

435
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,470
You're the one with a brain tumor! Your whole family has brain tumors!

436
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,510
I was just kidding.

437
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,510
I'm warning you.

438
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,230
We're talking about serious matters here. Don't be an idiot.

439
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,510
I just don't understand. With Xie Wanghe's brain,

440
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,430
he can't even figure out basic arithmetic.

441
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,030
Who gave him the confidence to start a business?

442
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,760
Even your dad can start a business with his brain.

443
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:15,820
What did you say?

444
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,980
Say that again!

445
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,120
Ouch, ouch!

446
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,950
Fenghua, let go. Let go, let go.

447
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,780
It hurts.

448
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:28,320
[Striving unceasingly with unwavering resolve]

449
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,670
Wanghe went to take care of important business.

450
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,610
If he succeeds,

451
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,370
everyone will benefit.

452
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,810
He'll explain the details when he returns.

453
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,730
But before that,

454
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,950
if anyone dares to snitch behind our backs,

455
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,370
and I find out about it,

456
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,370
they'll face the consequences.

457
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,040
If you have issues with Wanghe,

458
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,070
confront him face to face.

459
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,590
Don't gossip behind his back.

460
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,500
It's not manly.

461
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,660
You're right.

462
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,350
I'm indeed not manly enough.

463
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,170
The manliest one must be your Wanghe.

464
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,070
[Striving unceasingly with unwavering resolve]

465
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,490
Who poured ink on my shoes?

466
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,940
My new shoes!

467
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:06,510
Was it you?

468
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,180
Fenghua!

469
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,180
I was talking about him, not you.

470
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,170
My... My dad bought me new shoes.

471
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,870
Fenghua, let me tell you,

472
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,870
this thing today, between us two...

473
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,700
It's still our Fenghua who's the best.

474
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,360
Fenghua is awesome!

475
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,690
Everyone, be quiet. It's self-study time.

476
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,940
[Striving unceasingly with unwavering resolve]

477
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,890
Even if you aren't studying, there are people who are.

478
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:30,950
What are you doing?

479
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,510
Get back to studying, come on!

480
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,720
I've thought of a reason.

481
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,280
For an exhibition?

482
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,560
What exhibition?

483
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,690
Canal culture.

484
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,600
I saw it online.

485
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,590
For the World Heritage application,

486
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,170
the province has an exhibition in Beijing

487
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,230
for these few days.

488
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,500
But he can't just skip school to go for it.

489
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,950
It doesn't make sense.

490
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,310
It's fine.

491
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,850
I'll ask Haikuo to write an essay later.

492
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,720
Then I'll have Grandpa Zhou help revise it.

493
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,520
We're all from By the Canal.

494
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,090
This school

495
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,150
is very supportive of historical

496
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,640
and cultural activities.

497
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,710
Is this appropriate?

498
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:16,110
The teacher didn't want to give him a hard time.

499
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,370
Otherwise, he could have been expelled.

500
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,480
All right then.

501
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:22,770
So for this matter,

502
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,720
keep a close eye on it, will you?

503
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,010
It's driving me crazy.

504
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,360
Just wait until he comes back.

505
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,630
I'll teach him a lesson when he returns.

506
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,350
Why do you need to punish him?

507
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,250
He skipped school.

00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,380
Is this what a student should do?

Ms. Liang.

You mustn't think that way.

Wanghe went to Beijing for something important.

We should all support him.

513

He can only fool you.

You're the only one who believes him.

515

Silly girl, you need to wise up.

516
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,220
Don't end up being sold by him

517
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,380
yet you have to count the money for him.

Good morning.

00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,350
How's your back?

Be careful.

Come this way.

I'm not that delicate.

531
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,020
But I still don't dare

532
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,280
to lift heavy things.

You

534
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,810
shouldn't do all the heavy work yourself.

535
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:51,140
Let your Xingchi do it.

536
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,480
What's the point of raising such a big son?

At least you don't have to worry about his studies.

It's only because Shao keeps a close eye on him.

if he doesn't do well in the exam,

681

It's a cerebral thrombosis.

682
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,300
But the treatment was timely.

683
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,440
The doctor said she should recover with proper care.

684
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,610
Oh, child.

685
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,730
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.

686
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,760
That's enough.

687

Moreover,

695

696

713
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,740

714
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,190
They'll have each other for company.

715
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,950
I just need to remind Fenghua.

716
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:36,010
She tends to speak without thinking.

717
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,380
I've already paid the hospital fees,

718
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,980
but I'm not sure how much it will cost this time.

719
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,390

We will

724
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,030
We can consider it as prepaid rent.

Ms. Liang and Ms. Yan are here.

You don't have to do this.

733
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,950
I'm already 17 years old.

734
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,730
Stop treating me like a child.

735
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:08,420
In ancient times, I could have been married with children by now.

736
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:10,590
That's true.

737
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,430
When I gave birth to your father,

738

You know, when you were just born,

00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:28,680
you were as small as a kitten.

743

But you know,

00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,790
I was afraid to hold you.

I was worried I might hurt you.

When I have children in the future, I'll let you hold them.

Don't be afraid.

♫The first growth♫

1019
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,120
Listen, I don't like polite refusals.

1020
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,550
Siyi is still young.

1021
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,000
♫The world♫

1022
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,140
For her,

1023
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:12,440
♫How many emotions are there?♫

1024
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:11,150
you need to take good care of yourself.

1025
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,070
♫I love you♫

1026
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:15,480
I know.

1027
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:19,510
♫In dreams or in the south♫

1028
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,280
♫Wind blows gently♫

1029
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:27,350
♫On you♫

1030
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,710
♫That's me♫

1031
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:34,080
♫Thinking of you deeply♫

1032
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:05,630
♫That's me♫

1033
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:12,030
♫Thinking of you deeply♫

1034
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,550
Administrator!

1035
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,300
Manager!

1036
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:11,590
Come here.

1037
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:12,720
The server is done.

1038
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,130
All right.

1039
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,790
Hurry up.

1040
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,150
Qiang.

1041
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:25,640
I'm saying, take it easy.

1042
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,470
The way you're doing it,

1043
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:28,600
no amount of keyboards will be enough.

1044
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,140
Why are you so talkative?

1045
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:30,750
Just change it quickly.

1046
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:31,840
When are you coming back?

1047
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,550
Still playing around? Why aren't you looking for a job?

1048
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:33,630
I want to look around a bit more.

1049
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,560
What's the rush?

1050
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,250
The financing environment is so bad right now.

1051
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,390
Take a little more time to regroup.

1052
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:38,060
Qiang,

1053
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:38,710
if you ask me,

1054
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,460
you should just give up on starting a business.

1055
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,000
You'd better come back soon.

1056
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,070
Your parents are going crazy.

1057
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,230
Just find a steady job to work.

1058
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,590
It's better than now, right?

1059
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,790
Xingchi and I, because of you,

1060
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:46,840
both got a beating.

1061
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,390
We can still take it,

1062
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:49,550
but our butts can't handle it anymore.

1063
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,340
All of them will be from the elite universities.

1064
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,150
All of them will be from the elite universities.

1065
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:51,700
Do you believe that?

1066
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,770
Okay, okay, Qiang.

1067
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:53,500
I know.

1068
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,000
That website you had before,

1069
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,190
the idea was really good.

1070
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:58,010
It's a shame it didn't work out, right?

1071
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:00,590
What's the use of creativity in the Internet?

1072
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,390
You don't know anything.

1073
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,110
Ideas are useless.

1074
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,510
Then what's useful?

1075
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:14,070
Sir,

1076
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:15,140
excuse me.

1077
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,170
I'm also in the internet business.

1078
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,920
You're a senior in the field.

1079
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:21,180
I'd like to ask for your advice.

1080
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:24,260
I've been starting businesses since 1995 until now.

1081
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,590
I've failed four times.

1082
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:28,190
Are you sure you want to hear my opinion?

1083
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,750
Failure is the mother of success.

1084
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,090
Even in the toughest times,

1085
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,970
Ma Huateng wanted to sell Tencent.

1086
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,370
But it turned out well in the end, didn't it?

1087
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,940
You just came to Beijing, right?

1088
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,360
How did you know?

1089
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:49,240
I've seen many young people like you.

1090
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:51,540
Carrying passion and dreams,

1091
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,450
struggling for a few years,

1092
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:56,360
you'll end up with a broken heart

1093
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,770
and an empty wallet, slinking away.

1094
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,620
There are those who fail,

1095
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,610
but aren't there also those who succeed?

1096
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:07,810
How will I know if I can make it if I don't try?
