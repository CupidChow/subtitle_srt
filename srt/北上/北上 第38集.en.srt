Before I left,

63

I begged the God of the Land

to ask him to bless me.

65
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,380
Otherwise, I wouldn't return the soil.

This is the rule Granny Ma taught me when I was little.

She told me and Siyi when we were young.

70
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,480
She said if we were weak,

71
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,280
we should take some soil with us.

72

When we move,

74

we should take all the soil away with us

to let the God of the Land

76

continue to bless us.

I couldn't change your mind at all.

to make me believe what you did is meaningful.

He said I didn't believe you.

110

At first, we heard that you went to Italy.

178
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,160
We thought we'd never find you again.

179
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,480
But Chen Rui

180
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,720
never gave up.

181
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,150
Now you are being shy.

182
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,240
How did you force me back then?

183
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,240
You asked me to...

184
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,040
The man of great credit.

185
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,360
Mayor Gu contacted me, saying

186
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,030
after the canal's successful application for inscription on the World Heritage List,

187
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,030
Flower Street will be renovated.

188
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,620
She asked me to come back if I was available.

189
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,550
Like you won't come back if Auntie Gu doesn't ask you.

190
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,140
Do you know how much we miss you every year?

191
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,630
Every New Year, we bet

192
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,270
Siyi would come back this year,

193
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,000
but every year...

194
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,930
You lost the bet.

195
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,550
Enough. Enough.

196
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,240
Now,

197
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,510
she's right sitting here.

198
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,910
That's good, right?

199
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,670
It's good that she's back.

200
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,570
Siyi,

201
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,380
you're not leaving

202
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,510
this time, right?

203
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,240
I haven't thought

204
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,710
about the future.

205
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,750
I've focused on what happened before

206
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,440
all these years.

207
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,140
Ever since I left Flower Street,

208
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,270
I've asked around

209
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,360
on my trip.

210
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,240
Now the truth has finally come to light.

211
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,910
My ancestors did have something to do with Little Polo.

212
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,350
They were Italians

213
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:42,910
from the Dimarks.

214
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,390
They lived in Verona, Italy,

215
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,410
a city near Venice.

216
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,670
My great-great-grandfather's name

217
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,340
is Fidel Dimark.

218
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,510
To trace Marco Polo,

219
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,240
he traveled thousands of miles to come to China

220
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,170
with a business firm engaged in the porcelain trade.

221
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,270
When he was in China,

222
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,730
he wrote many letters to his family in Italy.

223
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,150
The letter recorded

224
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,840
his life in China in detail.

225
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,960
In Beijing and Tianjin,

226
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,390
he witnessed the suffering of China back then.

227
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,750
The cruelty of war

228
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,960
made him suffer and fear.

229
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,670
He tried to return to Italy,

230
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,510
but failed to buy a ship ticket.

231
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,490
During his flight for life,

232
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,720
he didn't give up writing to his family.

233
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,840
But because of the war,

234
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,440
all the letters were mailed back.

235
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,390
At that time,

236
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,360
he had a Chinese name,

237
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,480
called Marford.

238
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,150
He also married a Chinese girl,

239
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,890
called Qin Ruyu.

240
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,360
Their children

241
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,940
is my great-grandfather.

242
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,390
The last letter mailed to home from Marford

243
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,480
caused his brother,

244
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,220
Paul Dimark, concern.

245
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,030
So they decided to go to China

246
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,550
to look for their younger brother.

247
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,630
This person is

248
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,550
Little Polo everyone has talked about.

249
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,250
Look.

250
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,390
It's the one your grandpa talked about.

251
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,510
Later, we found there were four people

252
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,330
on the ship of Little Polo:

253
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,790
Translator Xie Pingyao,

254
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,090
Porter Shao Changlai,

255
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,730
Ship Boss Xia...

256
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,480
Boss!

257
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,510
I'm the boss!

258
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,550
And his disciple,

259
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:02,530
Zhou Yiyan.

260
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,420
He's here.

261
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,210
Boss.

262
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,170
Boss, here, here, let me toast you.

263
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,980
Now, the boss has changed.

264
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,720
Really.

265
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,380
Xie Pingyao was a translator.

266
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,480
He was entrusted by his best friend

267
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:21,300
to go north with a foreigner.

268
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,869
This foreigner

269
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:25,000
was Paul Dimark.

270
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,310
He preferred people to call him Little Polo.

271
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,610
At first,

272
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,960
he only said he was a canal expert

273
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,790
who came all the way to China because of Marco Polo

274
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,400
to inspect the Grand Canal.

275
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,030
Along with him

276
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,440
were Shao Changlai,

277
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,720
the porter he hired in Hangzhou,

278
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,590
Xia, the shipman he met in Suzhou,

279
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,720
and Xia's disciple and the sailor,

280
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,920
Zhou Yiyan.

281
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,640
On their way north,

282
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,070
Little Polo saw

283
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,920
China experiencing a huge change.

284
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,070
With the soul-capturing cannon he brought,

285
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,070
now called camera,

286
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,960
he photographed various Chinese people

287
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,030
in his mind.

288
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,030
Every scenery

289
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,510
and every dock

290
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,030
were a new experience

291
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,160
to Little Polo.

292
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,350
Soon,

293
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,510
Xia's disciple Zhou Yiyan

294
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,400
was very interested in Italian.

295
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,450
He studied the foreign book Little Polo brought.

296
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,550
He thought

297
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,440
as long as he mastered English,

298
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,790
his descendants

299
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,530
can possibly become translators as well

300
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,000
and lead a carefree life

301
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,790
for generations.

302
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,790
When staying away from the shore,

303
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,350
they sailed and cooked.

304
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,950
All they talked about were daily necessities.

305
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,750
When Little Polo had nothing to do,

306
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,070
he liked to sit on the board of the ship,

307
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,160
getting to feel the breeze while drinking some tea

308
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,350
with a square table

309
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,880
and a bamboo chair,

310
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:59,270
reading the Poetry Collection in the Year of Jihai in a desultory way,

311
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,070
or teaching Zhou Yiyan Italian.

312
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,270
He wrote his diary every day.

313
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,550
They traveled together for days

314
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,350
and established sufficient trust

315
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,590
and extraordinary friendship.

316
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,240
One night,

317
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,630
the ship stopped at the shore.

318
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,120
A few bandits got on the ship in the dark.

319
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,470
They wanted to rob them of their property.

320
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,780
When one of them took Little Polo's cane,

321
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,220
Little Polo suddenly stood up resisting him

322
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,550
and tried to get it back.

323
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,720
They had a fierce fight

324
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,550
with the bandits.

325
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,280
Little Polo was injured and he was bleeding non-stop.

326
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,780
Everyone had no choice

327
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,850
but to take him and run away without taking the ship back.

328
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,260
When they turned around,

329
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,330
the huge ship that traveled with them along the way

330
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,780
had already sunk to the bottom of the river

331
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,510
amidst the raging flames.

332
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,970
Little Polo's injury gradually deteriorated.

333
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,660
He told Xie Pingyao

334
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,480
that he cherished

335
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,010
the cane he always carried

336
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,350
because the last letter

337
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,850
that his little brother wrote to him was in it.

338
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:22,300
He came to China

339
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,240
just to find his little brother,

340
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,900
Fidel Dimark,

341
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,590
also called Marford.

342
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:35,960
Soon,

343
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,180
at the last stage of his life,

344
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,830
Little Polo admitted

345
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,920
that he had fallen in love with this canal.

346
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,280
He distributed his belongings

347
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,670
to his traveling companies.

348
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,480
On August 4, 1901,

349
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:57,790
the Italian man Paul Dimark died.

350
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,550
That tomb

351
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,070
stuck with a cross

352
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:05,220
facing the vast canal

353
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,200
is just like Little Polo

354
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,590
still sitting in the mud

355
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,880
and enjoying Chinese tea,

356
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,730
while getting to feel the breeze from the canal.

357
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,030
More than 100 years later,

358
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,870
the descendants of the four families on the ship

359
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,400
and Marford's descendants

360
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,420
met in the courtyard on Flower Street.

361
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,150
Maybe, it's fate.

362
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,460
The canal led them

363
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,130
to reunite.

364
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,460
The path that stretches for thousands of miles still exists,

365
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,150
[By the Canal]

366
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,700
while people come and go over a decade.

367
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,040
Little Polo couldn't find Marford.

368
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,440
The descendants of Little Polo's friends

369
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,870
[By the Canal]

370
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,660
found Marford's descendants

371
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,470
under the mysterious arrangement of fate.

372
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:54,450
The brothers who never had a chance to meet again

373
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:57,910
[Flower Street]

374
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,550
have got reunited

375
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,330
in this way.

376
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,130
Grandpa.

377
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:03,680
Grandpa.

378
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,260
Grandpa.

379
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,860
Look who's back.

380
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,730
Grandpa Zhou.

381
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,070
Siyi, you're back.

382
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,880
Why did the school get out so late today?

383
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:25,640
You need to work harder for the college entrance exam next year.

384
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,040
But don't push yourself.

385
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,190
You're a smart girl.

386
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,050
You can be admitted

387
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,830
to any school you want.

388
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,690
Don't listen to what your grandma said.

389
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,310
Your grandma has never been educated.

♫Far away, so far away♫

391
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,040
She doesn't understand that taking a rest is as important as studying.

00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:42,890
♫The hometown I can never return to♫

393
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,760
As for studies,

394
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,440
you have to listen to me.

What's wrong?

399
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,050
Did you feel wronged in school?

400
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,070

Good girl. Don't cry.

00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:45,960
Where have you been these years?

428
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,640
My name is Fenghua.

429
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,640
What's your name?

430
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,200
Ma Siyi.

431
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,160
What?

432
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,110
Louder, I can't hear you.

433
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,830
Are you deaf? Her name is Ma Siyi.

434
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,110
Let's go to school together,

435
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,070
go home together,

436
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,930
and do homework together at home.

437
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,090
It's decided then?

438
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,970
Let's go.

439
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,440
Go to sleep.

440
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,170
Siyi,

441
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:26,750
go!

442
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,710
When will you and Wanghe hold a wedding?

443
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,320
I haven't decided yet.

444
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,070
I need to get better first.

445
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,160
You're not allowed to leave.

446
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,030
This is the most important moment in my life.

447
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,150
You must be there.

448
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,790
It's said

449
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:49,110
bridesmaids can't be prettier than the bride.

450
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,920
Who is prettier?

451
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,720
Speak honestly.

452
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,880
It has to be you.

453
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,550
Really?

454
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,400
I'm telling you,

455
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,550
don't bring your girlfriends back.

456
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:04,280
Otherwise, I'll spill your dark secrets to them.

457
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,150
What's wrong?

458
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,250
Nothing.

459
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,650
Put it on.

460
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,790
I'm fine.

461
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,120
Sit down and take a rest.

462
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,800
Don't tire yourself out.

463
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,940
You are so annoying.

464
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,510
What is depicted in a poem written by Su Shi

465
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,570
is just a perfect description of the relationship between Fenghua and Wanghe.

466
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,960
"Suddenly I heard the fierce roar of my shrewish wife,

467
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,700
and my walking stick dropped from my hand, leaving me in a state of bewilderment."

468
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,920
Come on, Siyi, don't just stand there. Come on.

469
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,400
Sit down, Siyi.

470
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,460
Let's drink. Here.

471
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,510
Come on.

472
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,440
Let's drink. Come on.

473
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,640
Not with him.

474
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,750
What do you mean? Come on.

475
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,270
Here.

476
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,630
Cheers!

477
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,400
Cheers!

478
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:41,790
Come on. Come on.

479
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,720
Although I'm toasting with a cup of water.

480
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,600
Come on.

481
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,480
Cheers. Cheers.

482
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,870
Welcome home!

483
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:46,720
Welcome home!

484
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,030
Come on.

485
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:52,960
Siyi, have some.

486
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,310
It's freshly roasted.

487
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,000
Suit yourself.

488
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,790
Siyi.

489
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,830
Try this. It's not spicy.

490
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:57,830
Okay. Okay. Okay.

491
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,480
I'll take my time.

492
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,070
Are you not used to it?

493
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:01,750
How about

494
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,840
Xingchi cooking some dishes for you?

495
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,730
Like pasta?

496
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,510
Tell me what you want to eat.

497
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,480
I can cook anything you want.

498
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,880
When you were not back,

499
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,310
I was the female lead.

500
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,610
They were all focusing on me.

501
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,300
Yet the moment you're back, I'm neglected.

502
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,700
Why don't you leave?

503
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,000
Where should I go?

504
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,640
Have you left me a room in the new courtyard?

505
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,240
Yes.

506
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,440
You're still staying in the central hall.

507
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,480
My grandpa told me

508
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,110
to keep it for Granny Ma.

509
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,480
And there must be

510
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,810
an air conditioner

511
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,340
and a new TV.

512
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,310
Even the model was picked by my grandpa.

513
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,440
Isn't the old man awesome?

514
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,480
He could even pick a model when he has such a bad memory.

515
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,810
He just remembers this.

516
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,140
Be careful.

517
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:43,930
I'm fine.

518

I've bought postcards

wherever I went.

521
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,840
I didn't have the courage to send them back.

522
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,530

I wanted to tell you back then.

is great.

536
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,760
I heard you have a lot of collections about the canal.

537
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,130
Can you show me when it's available?

538
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:23,920
Of course.

But the rehearsal time is too short.

545
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,270
If I had more time,

546
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,670
I could have sung better.

547

I've been to many places.

554

I didn't expect

00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,710
that I would be

693
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,290
I don't have any opinions.

694
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,340
What about you?

695
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,199
Me?

696
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:19,630
Why?

697
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,920
You don't want to live in the courtyard?

698
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,590
Fine.

699
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,199
If you don't, I'll stay with Siyi.

700
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,060

703
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,550
Why would Siyi

704
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,030
be willing to be with you?

705
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,230
What did you do behind our backs?

706
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,400
I'll give you a rear naked choke!

707

When was that?

715

Stop it. Stop it.

Be careful not to spill it.

717
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,590
You should

718
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,510

725
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,739
she dug some soil from the dock of Linqing

726
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,280
and sprinkled it

727
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,550
under that tree.

728
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,960
I want to take it away.

729
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:03,920
Otherwise,

730
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:05,970
Grandma will get lost.

731
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:13,970
Turn around.
