[Episode 17]

3
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,190
If you're sleepy, take a nap in the back.

4
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,400
If you're done drinking, put the lid back and place it here.

5
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,130
Don't spill water on yourself.

6
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,190
After finishing this trip

7
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,730
and deducting all the expenses,

8
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,460
we'll have about 700 yuan left.

9
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,660
While on the road,

10
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,670
I've been thinking about something.

11
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,350
Driving a truck is really tough.

12
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,990
Let's

13
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,790
work hard for a few years.

14
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,710
After we put our son through college

15
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,130
and he finds a good job,

16
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,170
we can take a breather.

17
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,310
We'll stop driving

18
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,440
and take a good rest.

19
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:41,700
Or

20
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,390
we can buy a small ship.

21
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,310
It doesn't matter how many shipping deals we can get.

22
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,750
If we can't get any deals, we'll just enjoy the scenery on the ship.

23
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,750
You like the idea?

24
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,690
Mom.

25
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:23,940
You're back.

26
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,840
Son, you're back.

27
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,750
Where's Dad?

28
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,040
Sleeping.

29
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,870
Did everything go smoothly?

30
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,520
Yeah.

31
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,850
The client wanted to dock my pay because I arrived late.

32
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,980
Your dad rolled up his sleeves and made him pay the full amount.

33
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,750
He's like your bodyguard.

34
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,820
Great.

35
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:49,990
Luckily, it didn't come to blows.

36
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,079
Otherwise,

37
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,430
the money we earned

38
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,320
couldn't even cover the medical bills.

39
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,850
Dad is experienced in this.

40
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,480
Back when he was a seafarer,

41
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
there were also people who tried to skip out on paying.

42
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,700
He just got physical.

43
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,330
What's wrong, Mom?

44
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,880
Did you two have a fight?

45
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:12,830
No.

46
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,500
I wish we had.

47
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,899
Your dad didn't give me the chance.

48
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,170
What do you mean?

49
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,420
During the trip,

50
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,510
over 2,000 kilometers in total,

51
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,750
your father kept a long face

52
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,040
the whole time.

53
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,159
And he said to me a total of maybeâ€¦

54
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,880
200 words?

55
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,370
Boss Xie.

56
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,280
Mr. Shao.

57
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,360
Are you off work?

58
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,330
I thought it was you from afar.

59
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,260
It's really you.

60
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,730
You're in charge of

61
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,130
buying groceries now?

62
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,360
Well, Haihong

63
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,390
is busy driving the truck.

64
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,510
I'll do what I can to help.

65
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,200
Yeah.

66
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,030
Well,

67
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,390
how's the publication of your book going?

68
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,430
It's in the works.

69
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,270
I don't have any publishing experience,

70
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,430
so I'm learning as I go.

71
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,170
Oh, right.

72
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,140
There's something I wanted to talk to you about.

73
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,400
Can we have a talk here?

74
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,770
Okay.

75
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,590
Come, sit here.

76
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,120
Alright.

77
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:47,420
Sit.

78
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,190
Here is the thing.

79
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,040
I have a suggestion

80
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,940
that might seem immature.

81
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,960
I'd like to share it with you

82
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,000
to see if it's feasible.

83
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,410
You're being so polite. What's it?

84
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,210
You know, every year, many people

85
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,590
drown in the canal.

86
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,980
Yesterday, another person drowned upstream near Liu Village.

87
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,110
No one is willing to retrieve the body.

88
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,830
Here's what I'm thinking.

89
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,940
Could you consider being an initiator

90
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,070
to get some volunteers

91
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,900
to form a canal rescue team

92
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,490
that helps those

93
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,390
who fall into the water?

94
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:25,990
What do you think?

95
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:27,910
Hold on, M-Mr. Shao.

96
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,040
What exactly are you getting at?

97
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,720
Here's the thing.

98
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,550
As you know, the authorities are currently applying for

99
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,610
World Heritage status for the canal.

100
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,590
The heritage is not the canal

101
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,440
but the canal culture.

102
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:43,230
Speaking of culture,

103
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,580
look at our Flower Street.

104
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,040
What culture does it have?

105
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,140
There were a few famous local female entertainers in history,

106
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,300
but we can't

107
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,650
use romantic tales to make our case.

108
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:56,510
However,

109
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,590
with good people who did good things,

110
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,350
we can say this is a town

111
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,810
with kind-hearted folks.

112
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,330
That could be a characteristic of Flower Street,

113
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:05,890
right?

114
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,270
Mr. Shao,

115
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,010
are you planning to write and publish something?

116
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,050
No.

117
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,430
Good people and good deeds

118
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,870
are highly commendable.

119
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,230
You'll do good things,

120
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,270
and I'll praise you.

121
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,480
It's a win-win.

122
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,450
Then I should get half of the writing fee, right?

123
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,550
Forget about that little bit of money.

124
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,250
What matters is the honor.

125
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,260
Alright, it's settled then.

126
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,060
The honor goes to you,

127
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,760
and the writing fee goes to me.

128
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,110
If you say so,

129
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,909
you're making me speechless.

130
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,990
I'm just joking with you.

131
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,470
No matter what,

132
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,820
this is a serious matter.

133
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,470
After I go home,

134
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,270
I need to discuss it with my wife.

135
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,090
I can only do it if she agrees.

136
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:54,700
Alright.

137
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,740
Then I'll wait for your reply.

138
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,000
If the canal gets World Heritage status,

139
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,950
it'll be able

140
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,760
to flourish again.

141
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,040
By then,

142
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,300
you can truly return to the river.

143
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:08,950
Alright.

144
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,230
I'll be going.

145
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,360
See you.

146
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,070
Bye, Boss Xie.

147
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:42,820
Boss Xie.

148
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,480
What are you doing here?

149
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,460
I came out for some fresh air.

150
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:48,900
You're drinking?

151
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,670
I'll grab a few more bottles.

152
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,540
A few more.

153
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,510
How's everything? Good?

154
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,710
Just so-so.

155
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,590
It's still cold.

156
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:11,830
How about you?

157
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,910
How's the long-haul driving going?

158
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,060
Compared to seafaring,

159
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,550
it's much more tiring.

160
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,350
Is that so?

161
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,590
With seafaring,

162
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,060
ships don't go very fast,

163
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,300
right?

164
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,460
You don't have to

165
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,830
stay focused all the time.

166
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,170
Driving is different.

167
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,590
When driving, you always have to keep your eyes on the road.

168
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,240
After a whole day,

169
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,920
you're sore all over,

170
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,000
and your head buzzes.

171
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,230
It's not so unbearable

172
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,280
as long as you can make money.

173
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:46,460
Right?

174
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,270
Is your supermarket going well?

00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,870
Impressive!

351
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,470
Alright, enough with the praise.

352
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,350
I'm getting embarrassed.

353
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,630
I-I didn't hear

354
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,750
Xia's name in the article.

355
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,110
I-I am mentioned.

356
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,150
I-I'm part of the rescue team.

357
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,350
Praising the rescue team is praising me,

358
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,100
right, Boss Xie?

359
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,000
Yes.

360
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,440
He's in the photo!

361
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,500
Yes, look at the photo.

362
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,350
He's right there in the photo!

363
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,210
Here he is, see?

364
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,240
Your parents haven't argued lately, have they?

365
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,830
Cut it out and paste it on the wall.

366
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,110
Your dad is amazing.

367
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,370
He's in the newspaper.

368
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,470
You have no idea.

369
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,630
Men are all proud.

370
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,630
Are you crazy?

371
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,090
What are you talking about?

372
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:40,690
Fenghua!

373
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,310
Here, Siyi.

374
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,970
Try this. It's freshly fried.

375
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,470
Okay.

376
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,150
Be gentle!

377
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,250
Careful. It's hot.

378
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,150
Siyi.

379
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,750
Are you really going to apply to Honghuai Normal University?

380
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,280
Fenghua.

381
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,510
We're all applying to universities in Beijing.

382
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,510
Why don't you apply to a university in Beijing too?

383
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,310
You can bring Grandma there too.

384
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:53,910
No.

385
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,350
Why not?

386
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,540
The same reason as your dad's.

387
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,180
Not everyone likes Beijing.

388
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,950
Some people are just not suited for that place.

389
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,630
Wait. You've never been there.

390
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,590
How do you know you're not suited for it?

391
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,570
I went to Beijing.

392
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,670
I gave it a try.

393
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,920
So I know

394
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,890
I'm just an ignorant fool.

395
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,310
But when I'm ready, I'll go there again.

396
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,210
This time, I'll start from scratch

397
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,670
and make a name for myself.

398
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,150
Not everyone wants to make a name for themselves.

399
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,310
Exactly. I don't want to.

400
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,090
Then you can just stay at home.

401
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,810
But you're different.

402
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,280
You still have a chance.

403
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,490
Xie Wanghe,

404
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,080
you always talk about success.

405
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:35,650
That's not wrong.

406
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,210
But everyone's definition of success

407
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,450
is different.

408
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,590
Making a lot of money is just one type of success.

409
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,910
For me,

410
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,130
success is

411
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,280
living the life I want. That's enough.

412
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,550
So what kind of life do you want?

413
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,120
Just the life now.

414
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,360
Every day I wake up, I can see Grandma and my brother,

415
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,390
and I spend most of the day

416
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,960
doing things I enjoy.

417
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,870
Like memorizing vocabulary,

418
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,030
doing schoolwork,

419
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,050
and chatting and fooling around with Fenghua.

420
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,050
I'm very satisfied with my current life.

421
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,010
And I'm content.

422
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,670
People with big dreams like you

423
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:08,470
can never understand the goals of someone like me.

424
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,150
Well said!

425
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:09,940
Shut up.

426
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,270
Ma Siyi.

427
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,550
You should try to see the bigger world,

428
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,590
understand?

429
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,210
You're not just someone.

430
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,270
What on earth did you two talk about?

431
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,610
What's wrong with the two of them?

432
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,260
Guys,

433
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:02,540
[Final battle in June. Let's meet at Tsinghua and Peking.]

434
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,470
this is your final semester

435
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,500
in high school

436
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,980
and the last stretch before the college entrance exam.

437
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,240
The school has decided

438
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:10,550
to implement full closed-off management for senior students

439
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,200
from Monday to Friday.

440
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,360
Morning reading will start at 6:30 AM,

441
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,030
and you will stay at school overnight.

442
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,270
No one

443
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,150
is allowed to leave the school unless necessary.

444
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,950
Please summon all your strength

445
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,260
[Final battle in June. Let's meet at Tsinghua and Peking.]

446
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,150
and be 100% focused.

447
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,590
Concentrate your time and energy

448
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,430
on the final battle of the college entrance exam.

449
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,920
Do you have confidence?

450
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,310
[Final battle in June. Let's meet at Tsinghua and Peking.]

451
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,910
Yes!

452
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,030
Day student?

453
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:35,990
No way.

454
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,100
It's against the school's rules.

455
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,070
But my brother is very young.

456
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,270
He needs someone to take care of him.

457
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,710
And my grandma isn't in good health.

458
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,510
I have to look after them at home.

459
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,310
Siyi,

460
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,870
your school performance is quite good,

461
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:53,270
but your family

462
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,230
has been such a burden on you.

463
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,150
I'm worried that if this continues,

464
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,910
it'll affect your performance in the college entrance exam.

465
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:02,310
It won't. My ranking didn't drop this time.

466
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,870
I promise to study hard at home.

467
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,960
Alright, I'll apply to the school

468
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:11,910
to make an exception for you,

469
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,160
allowing you to be a day student.

470
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,670
But you must remember,

471
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:15,710
don't waste a minute.

472
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,710
Make the most of the last semester.

473
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,550
Thank you, madam.

474
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:27,630
Siyi.

475
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,550
Do you have a moment?

476
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,390
Let's talk.

477
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,590
You'd better not be a day student.

478
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,150
This semester is crucial.

479
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:53,460
You know how things are with my family.

480
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,320
Are there no other options?

481
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,860
What options do I have?

482
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,500
My brother needs to go to school.

483
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,830
Grandma might be hospitalized at any time.

484
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,200
If I don't go back to keep an eye on things,

485
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,400
something could go wrong at any moment.

486
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,550
What about hiring a caregiver?

487
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,870
Do you think I can afford a caregiver?

488
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,000
I can lend you money.

489
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:12,640
Don't worry.

490
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,600
I won't ask my parents for it.

491
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,950
I'll lend you the pocket money I've saved up.

492
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,080
It should be enough.

493
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,440
Chen Rui.

494
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,080
You've always been very nice to me.

495
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,310
I'm grateful.

496
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,410
I already felt indebted to you

497
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,700
when I went to your house for free classes.

498
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,230
I shouldn't take advantage of your kindness.

499
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,760
Thank you.

500
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,190
I don't know how it happened.

501
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,070
It just suddenly popped up, you know?

502
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,590
Look, she's wearing a floral bra.

503
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,060
She even has boobs.

504
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,510
Yeah.

505
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,030
Fenghua isn't like this.

506
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,400
What are you looking at?

507
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,360
Show me.

508
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,070
Show me!

509
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:08,870
Fenghua, did someone take your picture without you knowing?

510
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,510
What's it?

511
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:15,870
Give it to me!

512
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,230
Fenghua!

513
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,160
What's on the phone?

514
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:40,610
[Select] [Return]

515
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,140
Are you sure you didn't take these photos?

516
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,420
You think I'm crazy?

517
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,800
Dressing like that for photos.

518
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,670
They're obviously photoshopped.

693
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,140
We've already

694
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,800
collected signatures from 124 households

695
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,840
on Flower Street.

696
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,150
The neighborhood committee

697
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,410
and their school will also step in.

698
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:55,440
What's the school's attitude?

699
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,110
The school already knows the whole story.

700
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,060
The principal thinks

701
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,680
what Wanghe did is understandable,

702
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,370
but he doesn't encourage

703
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,350
or support his behavior.

704
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,150
Gosh,

705
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,020
that doesn't mean anything.

706
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,670
Officer Shen just called.

707
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,930
The police station is planning

708
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:10,390
to arrange a mediation tomorrow.

709
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,250
They want to know our conditions.

710
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,950
Conditions?

711
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,200
I went to the hospital to see that guy.

712
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,470
He's a tough nut to crack.

713
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,980
He won't settle this with us peacefully.

714
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,600
That bastard started it!

715
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,700
Shut up!

716
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,500
It's true.

717
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,220
Xingchi.

718
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,420
It is true.

719
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,490
That guy

720
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,950
photoshopped Fenghua's underwear photos

721
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,110
and posted them online.

722
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,930
What?

723
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,150
Wait a minute.

724
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,900
Fenghua's

725
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,240
underwear photos

726
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,070
are online?

727
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:35,880
Calm down.

728
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:36,430
Wait.

729
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,070
Make it clear.

730
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,000
Here's what happened.

731
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,720
Well,

732
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,660
he put Fenghua's face

733
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,060
on someone else's body

734
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,160
and then posted the photos online.

735
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,150
And he posted the link

736
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,230
in our school's online forum.

737
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,270
Wanghe was mad after finding it out.

738
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,630
So he beat that guy up.

739
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,390
Zhou Haikuo, why didn't youâ€¦

740
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,640
Why didn't you tell us this earlier?

741
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:51,740
Who do you think you are?

742
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,810
You think you can handle this by yourselves?

743
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,030
What should we do?

744
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,270
I'm completely at a loss.

745
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,670
Don't panic, don't panic.

746
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,900
What's the situation now?

747
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,640
Where are the photos?

748
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,310
We discovered it early

749
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:01,990
and found the source.

750
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:02,570
They've already been deleted.

751
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,750
The school has intervened.

752
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,500
Are you sure they're deleted?

753
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,350
Yes, yes.

754
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,560
So Wanghe did this for Fenghua!

755
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:09,820
You guys,

756
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,949
why didn't you stop him in the first place?

757
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:12,949
Wanghe went on his own.

758
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:13,790
He didn't tell us.

759
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,600
We both only found out afterward.

760
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,340
How did you know it was that guy?

761
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,630
Yeah.

762
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:19,909
Is there any evidence?

763
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:22,030
No.

764
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,429
I checked the IP address.

765
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,989
He used a proxy server,

766
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:26,190
so it's hard to trace.

767
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,230
But I think

768
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,830
he's the one who took the original photos.

769
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:33,850
That's a clue.

770
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,520
But we need to file a police report first.

771
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,179
Report it to the police!

772
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:37,800
We must report it to the police!

773
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,900
He should be arrested!

774
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,070
Will that help?

775
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,300
This isn't evidence.

776
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,120
Can you prove he broke the law?

777
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:45,219
He was just trying to give us trouble.

778
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:47,330
Wait.

779
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,120
Isn't the boy still detained?

780
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:52,219
Let's get him out

781
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,120
before discussing other matters, okay?

782
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,040
Yes, yes.

783
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:55,969
Let's get him out first.

784
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,200
He's the most important now.

785
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:57,690
Right.

786
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,040
What did the police say?

787
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,440
The police said

788
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,110
we should pay for the damage

789
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:07,710
and try to meet all his conditions.

790
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:10,110
This way, Wanghe might be able to come out

791
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,870
and not miss the college entrance exam.

792
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,470
He's a rotten rogue!

793
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:15,200
We're to pay him?

794
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,420
How's that possible?

795
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,940
S-Stop.

796
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,610
We'll pay him.

797
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,780

798
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,870
Then what do you want to do?

799
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,230
Do you want to make things worse

800
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,890
and let your son stay in the police station?

801
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:28,090
That's not what I mean!

802

803

You'll only make things worse and keep our son detained!

804

813

815

Everything will be fine.

816
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,470
Wanghe was able to go to college.

817
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,810
But because of meâ€¦

818

No matter how indebted you are to him,

you can pay it back bit by bit.

820
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,520
I'm afraid I can't pay it back.

You can if you want to.

This is the Tangbei Police Station in Qingtang District, Honghuai City.

864
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:00,030
[Meditation Room 2]

865
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,230
Both parties involved are here.

866
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:05,030
Today, we're having this mediation meeting

867
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,990
to clarify the legal responsibilities of both parties,

868
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,170
not to simply sweep things under the rug.

869
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,530
You've all watched

870
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:19,160
[Mediator]

871
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:11,830
the security footage.

872
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,670
Xie Wanghe rushed in and smashed things,

873
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,130
but he didn't hurt anyone.

874
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,310
Pang Dahai was the first to get physical.

875
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:22,110
Xie Wanghe only retaliated after being attacked.

876
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,560
What else could I do?

877
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,160
I was supposed to just watch him smash things?

878
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,780
That light alone was very expensive.

879
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,670
If I hadn't stopped him,

880
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,470
I'd have gone bankrupt from the damage.

881
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,300
Regardless of the cause,

882
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:36,270
the offender committed the crime of picking quarrels and making trouble.

883
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,270
Today, we're here to see

884
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:39,670
if you can reach an understanding

885
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,480
to minimize the legal consequences of this case.

886
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,200
Alright.

887
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,160
If both parties disagree,

888
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,830
we'll proceed as we should,

889
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:02,190
with detention or sentence as necessary.

890
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,700
Think it through.

891
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:14,510
Can I speak to him privately for a moment?

892
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,810
Thank you.

893
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,960
This time,

894
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,510
it was indeed my son's fault.

895
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,220
I apologize to you.

896
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,890
Apologizing now

897
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,730
is a bit late, isn't it?

898
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,900
The reason

899
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,240
why he beat you,

900
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,540
you know better than anyone, don't you?

901
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,110
What do you mean?

902
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,860
Fenghua

903
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,310
is still in school.

904
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,240
How could you do such a thing to a young girl?

905
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,540
Don't you think

906
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:15,660
it's despicable?

907
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,750
W-What did I do?

908
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,200
Playing dumb, huh?

909
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,030
You're a man.

910
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,240
Just own up to what you did.

911
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:29,670
What did I do?

912
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,050
What should I own up to?

913
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:32,660
Let me tell you.

914
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,940
Don't talk nonsense here.

915
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,150
This is the police station.

916
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,750
I'll sue you for defamation.

917
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:45,920
Anyway,

918
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,810
he's my only son.

919
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,800
You've met me

920
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,730
and my husband.

921
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,520
Both of us are very ordinary.

922
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,500
In this life,

923
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:03,140
we only hope our son can

924
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:05,440
make something of himself.

925
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:09,710
If you crush our only hope,

926
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,860
don't blame us

927
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:14,500
for dragging you down.

928
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,570
Are you threatening me?

929
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:18,970
I'm not threatening you.

930
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,070
I'm negotiating with you.

931
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,990
I'm not asking you to put yourself in our shoes.

932
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:25,180
I'm just asking you

933
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,930
not to ruin the futures

934
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,460
of both our families.

935
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,390
I'm begging you.

936
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,660
Let's do the math.

937
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,460
[Mediator]

938
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,660
Well,

939
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,710
medical treatment

940
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,300
has cost about 30,000 yuan.

941
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,870
Recovering from these injuries

942
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,910
will cost quite a bit too, right?

943
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:08,070
And the smashed cameras and computers,

944
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:10,630
all these odds and ends,

945
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,760
if you add them upâ€¦

946
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,300
100,000 yuan.

947
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,270
That should settle this matter.

948
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:16,980
100,000?

949
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:19,960
Why don't you just rob a bank?

950
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,130
100,000 it is.

951
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,040
Let's sign the agreement now.

952
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,600
Are you sure?

953
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:28,670
Wait.

954
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,580
Listen.

955
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:31,400
It must be paid in full at once.

956
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,290
Paid in full at once?

957
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:34,270
You're really pushing it, aren't you?

958
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:35,320
No problem.

959
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,510
If you hadn't done that despicable thingâ€¦

960
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:37,070
No problem.

961
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,770
could my son have beaten you up?

962
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:39,370
Alright, stop.

963
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:40,640
This is the police station.

964
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,670
This is the police station!

965
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:43,990
Stop yelling.

966
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:45,910
It's already settled. Stop arguing.

967
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:46,990
Do you know where you are?

968
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,030
Alright. Don't listen to him.

969
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,390
I can make the decision on this matter.

970
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:50,270
You can't!

971
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:51,150
Don't get yourself arrested!

972
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,030
It's 100,000 yuan!

973
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,790
Shut up!

974
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:58,630
I'll sign.
