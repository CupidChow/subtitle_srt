Still angry?

5
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:01,920
I wouldn't dare.

6

You can go ask around.

00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,790
In all of Zhongguancun,

8
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,100
which employee dares to get angry with their boss?

9
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,030
You must be hungry.

10
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,710
I'll make you some wagyu fried rice.

11
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,110
Okay.

12

He's not deserving.

13
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,950
Fine.

14
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,950
I don't deserve it.

We'll use Mr. Xie's wagyu, okay?

Use as much as you want. There's plenty.

There's just one piece.

Look at your antics.

You must have learned this from Xiaohui.

So coquettish.

has been really tough to deal with.

43
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,700
And I suspect that they have their informants

within our organization,

45
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,450
keeping an eye on our every move.

46
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,950
Otherwise, there’s no way they’d strike back this quickly

47
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,050
and this accurately.

48
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,360
What should we do then?

Besides knowing the routes,

00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,410
Darling, I'm sorry.

513
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,630
Let's go home and keep it down.

514
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,770
This is so embarrassing.

515
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,810
What do you want to eat?

516
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,160
Eel noodles.

517
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,510
It's late.

518
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,970
Where am I supposed to find eel noodles at this hour?

519
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,970
There's a good crayfish place nearby.

520
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,880
I used to go there often with Xingchi and Haikuo.

521
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,080
Why didn't you invite me?

522
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,860
Back then, I was just starting out as a courier.

523
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,340
I barely had time to even sleep.

524
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,750
Well, you could have at least

525
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,120
brought me some takeout.

526
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,720
It's not too late to treat you now.

527
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,470
Sit down.

528
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:48,360
Waiter!

529
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,190
Bring us 30 chilled crayfish,

530
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:51,900
the biggest ones you have,

531
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,310
and two bottles of soda too.

532
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,170
Alright!

533
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,070
Back then,

534
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,320
Haikuo had a fight with his mom.

535
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,400
Xingchi's karaoke studio got shut down.

536
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,190
And me?

537
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,430
My startup had failed.

538
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,310
The three of us would come here every day to drink.

539
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,310
When we got drunk, we'd hug each other and cry our hearts out.

540
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,170
No wonder you wouldn't invite me.

541
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,940
Afraid I would see you embarrass yourself?

542
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,680
With that mouth of yours,

543
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,180
if you had seen that scene,

544
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,690
you'd nag about it for the rest of your life.

545
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,690
Am I really that immature in your eyes?

546
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,080
It's not that.

547
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,170
You're carefree and easygoing.

548
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,650
A lot of things don't bother you.

549
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,240
Here it comes.

550
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:33,670
Give it to me.

551
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,760
Thank you.

552
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,470
Okay, thanks.

553
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:39,860
Eat up.

554
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,760
Didn't you always say that

555
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,280
you've always seen me as a brother?

556
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,220
So why is it that when something happens,

557
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,740
you see me as a woman?

558
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,270
You're nitpicking now?

559
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,260
I just want to know

560
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,580

561
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,360
and when you see me as a woman?

562
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:05,730
Well...

563
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,590
For example, right now,

564
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,370
do you see me as a brother or a woman?

565
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,850
You're a child.

566
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,640
Look at the mess you're making from eating crayfish as an adult.

567
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,000
Unbelievable.

568
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,360

843
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,450
or are you going to mooch off her place?

844
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,460
That works too.

845
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,730
She has a canteen.

846
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,480
You'll even save on food expenses.

847
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:34,750
Congratulations.

887
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:21,700
Tell me in detail.

888
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,020
Let's talk about Yuntu first.

889
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,230
Their biggest problem now

890
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,280
is the chaotic assignment of orders.

891
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,390
As soon as delivery riders

892
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,150
log into the application,

893
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,730
it starts to assign order frantically.

894
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,560
Such a model seems efficient,

895
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:35,540
but it actually ignores the riders' feelings.

896
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,960
Riders will feel like they're being frantically exploited,

897
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,260
as if they're being whipped to keep moving.

898
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,690
Having an active or passive choice

899
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,740
makes a big difference for individuals.

900
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,690
Yuntu is slow in adjusting order prices.

901
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,470
And that does not match the pace of delivery.

902
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,800
For example,

903
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,480
for orders in more remote areas,

904
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:52,910
riders are reluctant to accept them.

905
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,490
In this case, the price should be continuously increased

906
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,800
until someone accepts the order.

907
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:58,910
But Yuntu's response is much slower.

908
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,500
This way, even when the customer receives their meal,

909
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,320
the customer experience is still poor

910
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,630
due to the long delay.

911
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,180
Customers often ask,

912
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,900
'Why hasn't any rider accepted my order?'

913
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:11,330
If no rider accepts the order for a long time,

914
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,790
customers will cancel the order.

915
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:14,100
The restaurant doesn't make money

916
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,660
and even has to bear with the losses.

917
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:17,290
If this continues,

918
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,100
we'll lose many merchants.

919
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:28,950
Hello?

920
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:29,390
Hello?

921
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,110
Where are you?

922
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,670
I'm in a meeting. Let's talk later.

923
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,440
Hurry and watch the CCTV News channel now.

924
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,020
The Grand Canal's application for World Heritage status has been successful.

925
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:36,670
Really?

926
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:37,580
Recently,

927
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,560
at the 38th World Heritage Committee meeting

928
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:42,630
held in Doha, Qatar,

929
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,870
The Grand Canal, a cultural heritage project

930
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:47,560
independently proposed by our country,

931
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:51,260
has been successfully added to the World Heritage List.

932
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,050
[38th session of the World Heritage Committee, Doha, Qatar. Successful bids for the Grand Canal and Silk Road]

933
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:51,630
Great!

934
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,720
World Heritage Site, huh?

935
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,900
It's the world!

936
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:00,090
Our Grand Canal, along with the Great Wall,

937
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,330
the Forbidden City,

938
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,600
the Summer Palace, Potala Palace,

939
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,690
and Longmen Grottoes,

940
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,400
will all be on the same level now.

941
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,180
Right?

942
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,280
What does this mean?

943
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,420
It means that when tourists come to Flower Street in the future,

944
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,940
they'll have to buy tickets.

945
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,710
It means that we'll have to raise the prices

946
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:16,070
of our family's tofu pudding.

947
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,900
Now that the application is successful,

948
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,470
it means our Grand Canal

949
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,280
will soon see a revival.

950
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,380
The economy along both sides of the canal

951
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,440
will develop rapidly.

952
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:28,160
Good times are ahead.

953
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:29,130
Yanlin!

954
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,420
Come, come.

955
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,640
Find some time to tidy up our restaurant.

956
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,740
It’s time for some repairs and fixes.

957
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,720
Don't let it look all run-down, you know?

958
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:37,830
It'll bring shame to Flower Street.

959
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:39,350
Don't worry, I've already arranged it.

960
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,590
Mr. Zhou.

961
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:43,060
If Flower Street becomes more popular in the future,

962
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:45,410
business will surely be better than before, right?

963
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:46,240
Of course.

964
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,790
Not just on both banks, but on the river too.

965
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:49,010
Business on the water

966
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,450
will gradually improve as well.

967
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:52,560
So you're saying that we can

968
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,780
make money by seafaring again, right?

969
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:55,230
What do you mean, Boss Xie?

970
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,070
You have an itch to scratch, don't you?

971
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,100
An itch?

972
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,880
No, we should still wait and see.

973
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:02,030
Let's see how it goes.

974
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,030
But to be honest,

975
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,910
Mr. Shao really contributed a lot

976
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,700
to the success of this World Heritage application.

977
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:08,520
That's right.

978
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,570
I wouldn't say I contributed much.

979
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,450
I just helped a little bit.

980
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,750
Before this,

981
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,860
together with Mr. Zhou, Chen Bo,

982
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:19,850
and Chen Rui,

983
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:23,250
we've been studying that sunken ship in the canal.

984
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:26,740
We could strongly prove that

985
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,720
more than a hundred years ago,

986
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:30,090
this Grand Canal was

987
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,970
part of the Silk Road.

988
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,580
And we concluded that

989
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:35,430
our Grand Canal

990
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,120
played a role in history that was

991
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:39,720
much greater than the Suez Canal.

992
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:40,930
Don't you think that's impressive?

993
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,190
Impressive.

994
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,650
Don't listen to his nonsense.

995
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:45,510
Well, I...

996
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,110
We only proved that there was a ship

997
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,410
that had an Italian on board.

998
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,340
Then this ship sailed north,

999
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,770
and later, near our area,

1000
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:55,640
they encountered some pirates

1001
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,930
and finally sank.

1002
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,650
As for the conclusions,

1003
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:00,140
most of them are speculation.

1004
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,910
We don't have enough historical evidence to prove it.

1005
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,710
It doesn't have academic value.

1006
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,500
You're not writing a thesis.

1007
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:07,720
Why do you need academic value?

1008
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,850
We submitted the materials as part of our application,

1009
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:10,330
didn't we?

1010
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:11,550
And they've given us an acknowledgement.

1011
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,640
What does this mean?

1012
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,930
It means they've seriously looked at it.

1013
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:16,430
Whether or not it's valuable,

1014
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:18,670
it's not for us to determine, right?

1015
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,500
Alright. I won't argue with you anymore.

1016
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:22,670
You're the biggest hero for this successful World Heritage appliation.

1017
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,990
Yes, that's right.

1018
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:25,990
As for us,

1019
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,260
we've only proven that

1020
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:29,880
there was indeed an Italian on this ship.

1021
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,700
But who was he?

1022
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:34,410
Where did he come from and where was he going?

1023
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:35,880
What was he doing in China?

1024
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,570
We have to keep investigating.

1025
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:40,400
Even if we end up finding nothing,

1026
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,260
the process itself

1027
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,570
can help us uncover more about

1028
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:44,710
the history of Flower Street.

1029
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,440
That would be a great achievement for us too.

1030
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,110
That's right.

1031
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:47,470
Isn't it?

1032
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:47,990
Yes, yes.

1033
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:48,510
Right?

1034
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:49,000
It certainly is.

1035
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,100
I want to visit the Suez Canal.

1036
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:53,130
You look just like the Suez Canal to me.

1037
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:57,270
The celebration is starting, hurry up!

1038
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:57,990
It's starting, it's starting!

1039
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:58,750
Come on, come on!

1040
00:42:58,750 --> 00:42:59,910
Let's go, let's go!

1041
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:01,750
The flags, the flags!

1042
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,510
We got them!
