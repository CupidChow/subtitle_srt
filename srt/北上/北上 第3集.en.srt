I won't comment on other dishes.

But this eel noodles...

You've mastered the essence from Haikuo's father.

8
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,440
Let's work together

9
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,960
and set up a stall at the night market.

10
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,510
We'll split the profit evenly.

If Xingchi's the one cooking, what's your role then?

Siyi, here.

Come here and let me hit you!

18

I noticed you have been quiet

19
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,220
this whole afternoon.

20
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,270
Are you in shock?

21

Tell me.

23
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,650
Did that man who jumped into the river not think about his wife and kids?

24
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,690

If this happened to my dad,

he wouldn't be like him.

Blah!

32

My grandpa said that

33
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,290
as a man,

34
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,510
we might not have to be rich.

35
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,100
But, we must be responsible.

36
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,310
Even if the sky falls, you have to hold it up.

37
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,600
All the men in our yard are like this.

No problem.

The next time you ask me to wash your swimming trunks after you are done,

45

I'll charge you 10 yuan each time.

Suit yourselves.

49

Why do you just ask for 500 yuan?

50

If you sell 800 bowls every day,

you'll be rich in a month.

You can then hire me to be your bodyguard.

Then...

182
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,900
if (a, n)

183
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:44,090
is more than (a, n) plus one,

184
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,970
what happens to this sequence?

185
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,210
It decreases.

186
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,940
Yes, it decreases.

187
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,300
If (a, n) is bigger and equals to

188

00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,960
what does this mean?

190
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,590
It increases.

00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,260
Have you ever thought

205
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,750
about what will you do if you

206
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,810

Bill Gates, the richest man in the world,

211
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,630
didn't complete his degree either.

212
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,140
Okay.

213
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,030
Let's talk about Bill Gates then.

214
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,880
As you all know,

215
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,150
Bill Gates got into Harvard

216
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,440
before he dropped out.

217
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,250
As compared to not making it,

218
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,850
it's totally different when

219
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,830
he chooses to drop out.

Great!

Let's not talk about Bill Gates then.

223
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,870
Let's talk about how

224
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,460
many outstanding local entrepreneurs

225
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,180
had no education

226
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,040
or background,

227
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,960
but that didn't stop them from being successful.

228
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,470
That was in the past.

If you're wrong,

236

240
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,960
Of course.

You must keep your promise.

Yes, I'll.

243
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,800

Come down.

245
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,170
I think...

246
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,450
you're right.

247
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,690
Knowledge can change one's fate,

248
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,700
but it definitely isn't

249
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,030
knowledge memorized from the textbook.

250
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,570
Does it mean that everyone who studied hard

251
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,590
will definitely succeed?

252
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,920
Then why is it that

253
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,450
the successful ones are still the minority?

254
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:04,230
Guys,

255
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,470
this is not about getting the wrong reference.

256
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,910
This is called switching concepts.

257
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,660
No.

258
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,690
Mr. Xu.

259
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,540
What I want to say is that

260
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,030
compared to

261
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,560
knowledge memorized from textbooks,

262
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,130
what's more important is

263
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,150
our way of thinking,

264
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:21,860

and future plans.

267
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,010
We can understand the laws of a trade

268
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,320
through observation and analysis.

269
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,200
And with this understanding,

270
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,630
we can get the final victory.

271
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,030
Well said!

272
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,530
So, tell me.

273
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,690
How do you plan to get the final victory?

274
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,990
Let's take an example.

275
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,750
For example, in the teaching profession.

276
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,100
Have you ever thought about

277
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,150
how you can

278
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,230
earn more money

279
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,030
without compromising your job?

280
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,580
Have you thought about it?

281
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,470
Yes, I did.

282
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,080
But,

283
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,350
it's definitely not one-on-one tutoring.

284
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,230
That's too inefficient,

285
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,560
and it's not effective.

286
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,710
If you don't reap profits,

287
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,110
its easy to hold a grudge.

288

Mr. Xu.

289
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,990
I think if you want to make money,

290
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,190
there is only one way.

291
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,810
And that is, to open test prep centers.

292
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,960
What center?

293
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,170
Test prep centers.

294
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,710
Mr. Xu, please move aside.

[Test prep centers]

296
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,560
Test prep centers.

297
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,330
Don't you understand?

298
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,090
It means to do test papers together.

299
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,600
Actually,

300
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,510
if you want to improve your grades,

301
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,250
it's very simple.

302
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,850
You just have to do test papers non-stop.

303
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,360
But when you do it yourself at home,

304
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,380
if you encounter any problems,

305
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,460
you will never get it

306
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,510
no matter how hard you try.

307
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,910
But if someone could guide you,

308
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,700
it's different.

309
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,290
If you can get help whenever you encounter a problem,

310
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,070
your grades will definitely improve.

311
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:53,880
Of course,

312
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,910
you can't charge for tutoring

313
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,220
as it's against the school rules.

314
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,760
But you can collect fees for things such as

315
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,480
food, nutrition, printing and so on.

316
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,580
Teachers can earn money legitimately

317
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,030
while students can improve their grades.

318
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,260
Let me ask you.

319
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,710
Assuming there is such a place

320
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,250
that runs every weekend for two days,

321
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,410
where Mr. Xu teaches,

322
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,070
and it's inclusive of meals

323
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,060
with no attendance taken.

324
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,180
We'll let Mr. Xu

325
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,750
make this hard-earned 50 yuan.

326
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,080
Would you be interested?

327
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,680
50 yuan is too expensive.

328
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,020
How about 48 yuan?

329
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,200
48 yuan is also expensive.

330
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,110
How about 44 yuan?

331
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,900
That number is unlucky.

332
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,080
If it's 44 yuan, I'll sign up.

333
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,130
I'll attend too!

334
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,680
We must support Mr. Xu.

335

Inclusive of me,

340
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,230
there are 40 people in this class.

341
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:36,990
Enough.

342
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,430
That's not a lot of money either.

343
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,950
My time is very precious too.

344
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,950
Mr. Xu, don't fret.

345
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,470
Let me calculate for you.

346
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,990
There are 52 weekends a year.

347
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:50,120
52 times 44, times 40.

348
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,070
How much is that?

349
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,140
91,520 yuan.

350
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,940
91,520 yuan.

351
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,750
This is just the fees from one class.

352
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,590
If you think it's not enough,

353
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,950
we can recruit more.

354
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,160
You can calculate how much you will get with a 2 percent expansion

355
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,800
via geometric progression.

356
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,710
You can calculate first.

357
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,570
I'll go back and drink some water.

358
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,750
Class.

359
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,050
Class!

360
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,260
Don't get carried away.

361
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,870
Let's calculate

362
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,630
this question by Mr. Xie.

363
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,060
Okay.

364
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,850
Assuming

365
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,560
the number of graduating seniors of Honghuai is

366
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,900
5,850 students.

367
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,510
Of which, 80 percent are science students.

368
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,110
Mr. Xu,

369
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,590
please don't calculate anymore.

370
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,870
If this continues,

371
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,070
in the near future,

372
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,900
you'll be billionaire!

373
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,690
A billionaire?

374
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:45,360
Mr. Xu,

375
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,070
you're doing this alone.

376
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,690
When you resign

377
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,270
and focus on this,

378
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,830
we can hire

379
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,230
all of the retired senior teachers

380
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,110
over here.

381
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,350
By then,

382
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,240
we can move out of Honghuai

383
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,470
and set up test prep centers across the country.

384
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,990
Once you have scaled up sufficientlyï¼Œ

385
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,190
you can apply for land

386
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,710
to establish

387
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,360
a national test prep center.

388
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,250
By then,

389
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,430
we can advertise,

390
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,830
get financing and go public.

391
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,460
As long as policies remain unchanged,

392
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,750
before you turn 50,

393
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,210
you'll achieve financial freedom.

394
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,710
Mr. Xu!

395
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,980
You will be the richest man in Honghuai!

396
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,830
Mr. Xu!

397
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,750
The richest man!

398
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,790
Mr. Xu!

399
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,060
The richest man!

400
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,940
Mr. Xu!

401
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,190
The richest man!

402
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,070
Mr. Xu!

403
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,000
The richest man!

404
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,750
Mr. Xu, Mr. Xu!

405
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,160
Don't forget us when you are rich!

406
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,080
Mr. Xu!

407
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,470
Don't forget us!

408
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,350
Mr. Xu!

409
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,510
Don't forget us!

410
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,390
Mr. Xu!

411
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,590
Don't forget us!

412
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,470
You've explained so much to them.

413
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,590
Did they even understand?

414
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,110
The swallows and sparrows will never understand the ambition of a swan.

415
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,510
It's a waste of effort if you tell those who don't understand.

416
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,730
I could have knocked into you.

417
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,070
What do you want now?

418
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,710
Tell Xia Fenghua

419
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:58,650
she owes me money.

420
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,990
What money?

421
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:02,560
These are Air Force 1's.

422
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,840
I just bought it from Shanghai.

423
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,540
Look at how she stepped on them. How am I supposed to wear them?

424
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,420
How much is it?

425
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,470
Don't ask.

426
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,840
You won't be able to afford it anyway.

427
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,380
So what do you want?

428
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,790
Not much.

429
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,690
It's just a pair of shoes, it's no big deal.

430
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,070
I can get a new pair every day if I want to.

431
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,350
Would you die if you don't show off?

432
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,050
Of course I should show off when I have the money.

433
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,330
Unlike someone,

434
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,200
who thinks about money but his pockets are empty.

435
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,050
All you do is brag.

436
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,070
Liang.

437
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,430
You're so annoying all the time.

438
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,030
Are you trying to get beaten up to scam for medical fees?

439
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,030
Do you really think I can't beat you?

440
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,350
Tell Fenghua I'll wear new shoes every day.

441
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,010
If she has the guts, tell her to find me every day.

442
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:44,970
One word.

443
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,780
Despicable.

444
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,420
If only I had brains like Wanghe.

445
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,690
I would make a lot of money

446
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,930
and take you to Chris' concert by plane.

447
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,480
The concert is not that expensive.

448
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,360
Yeah.

449
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,550
We just have to save some pocket money.

450
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,570
I want to buy first-row seats.

451
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,280
When Chris is in the middle of a song,

452
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,359
I'll rush up and give her a hug.

453
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,130
I won't budge even if eight guards come for me.

454
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,250
Chris will be so annoyed at you.

455
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,589
That's fine.

456
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:11,140
As long as she remembers me.

457
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:13,280
I want to leave the most lasting mark

458
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,440
in Chris' performing career.

459
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,339
One word.

460
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,400
Despicable.

461
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,579
Hurry up.

462
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:20,609
Coming.

463
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:23,240
Let's go.

464
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,069
â™«The second hand turns, tick-tockâ™«

465
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,570
â™«Tiny time difference, ticking awayâ™«

466
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,720
â™«As I sip my morning tea, moonlight spills on your hairâ™«

467
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,380
Ladies and gentlemen,

468
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,040
welcome to my concert.

469
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,070
â™«A parallel painting, tick-tockâ™«

470
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,750
Dear audience, how are you?

471
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,580
â™«When will our time cross?â™«

472
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,350
Let me see your waving hands!

473
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,670
â™«Let's meet at the next intersectionâ™«

474
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,750
Let me hear you call my name!

475
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,710
What? I can't hear you!

476
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,550
No, I disagree!

477
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,630
We agreed to lend it this time.

478
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,700
It's just six months.

479
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,630
My sister wants to open a cyber cafe.

480
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,340
She'll pay us back when she makes money.

481
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,510
She still owe us money from when she opened the noodle house previously.

482
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,830
And all the previous times, she hasn't paid back yet.

483
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,000
Hasn't she return the money that one time?

484
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,440
Your mom!

485
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,650
What are you talking about?

486
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,350
The money was given to your mom.

487
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,080
Will we ever get the money back?

488
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:15,330
How many times has your mom visited in the past two years?

489
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,530
So what? My mom can't come?

490
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,950
It's not that she can't come.

491
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,350
Every time she comes, she brings with her the whole family.

492
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,630
They just eat and take things from us.

493
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,070
I've finally saved some money, but all of that went to your sister.

494
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,240
Do I owe her?

495
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,180
Alright. I owe them, okay?

496
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,310
My sister is taking care of our mother for me

497
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,780
and fulfiling filial duties on my behalf.

498
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,830
So what if she takes a bit of advantage?

499
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,870
She can't?

500
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,470
If you've already decided, what else is there to discuss with me?

501
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,870
The bankbook is in the drawer.

502
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,660
I quit.

503
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,510
I'm leaving.

504
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,640
Where are you going?

505
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,710
-Itâ€™s dark.
-Leave me alone.

506
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,230
Just tell me if you want to lend or not.

507
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,510
No, I don't want to.

508
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,430
Why should I?

509
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,550
When our business was doing well,

510
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:56,740
did I say anything?

511
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,750
I tolerated all the injustice.

512
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,570
But don't you know

513
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,320
the situation at the canal?

514
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,550
Seafaring?

515
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,990
How much you used to earn in a day?

516
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,320
How much do you earn now?

517
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,230
If you aren't keeping tabs,

518
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,550
I am.

519
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,230
How are we going to live?

520
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,700
Have you decided

521
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,510
on your university choices?

522
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,550
Which universities?

523
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,900
Tsinghua or Peking University.

524
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,150
Even the worst-ranked

525
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,750
has to be Renmin University.

526
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:32,950
Be serious.

527
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:33,870
Where else?

528
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,270
What do you want me to say?

529
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,990
Can I get into any university with these grades?

530
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:39,710
Why not?

531
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,840
My son is not stupid.

532
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,430
We still have a year.

533
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,740
Let's work hard.

534
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,990
At the very least,

535
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,240
you can go to a vocational college.

536
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,870
Don't be like your dad and become a seafarer for the rest of your life.

537
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,150
What are you talking about?

538
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,080
You're looking down on seafaring?

539
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,910
-How dare you look down on seafaring!
-Dad.

540
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:57,450
Did you drink?

541
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,610
Who did you drink with again?

542
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,710
Mr. Sun.

543
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,920
He's a big boss now.

544
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,570
He has three big construction sites

545
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,320
and his own water factory.

546
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,710
He's something.

547
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,870
Which Mr. Sun?

548
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,180
My classmate.

549
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,230
Liang's father.

550
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,730
Just a shabby foreman.

551
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,630
Mr. Sun.

552
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,570
Crippled Sun?

553
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,480
Did he say when he will he pay us?

554
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,290
He said he has

555
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,390
too many projects now.

556
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,640
Once he has the capacity,

557
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,320
he'll pay us first.

558
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,230
You've helped him haul a dozen boats of cement,

559
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,310
yet he's not paying you even a penny.

560
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,390
That's just bullying.

561
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,430
Mind your own business.

562
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,710
Well then, can I say?

563
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:37,950
That Crippled Sun

564
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,140
is simply a liar.

565
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,400
He just bought a Mercedes last month,

566
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,150
did you know?

567
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:41,720
Yes.

568
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:45,990
He bought a... a second-hand car.

569
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,470
A second-hand car.

570
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,200
He didn't say he won't pay us.

571
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,990
Don't bother me about this.

572
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,150
Wait.

573
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,650
It's cold. I'll heat it up for you.

574
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,990
Ask him to write a guarantee.

575
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,390
Make it clear when he'd pay us back.

576
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,230
If he doesn't do so by the deadline,

577
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,270
he has to pay a late fee.

578
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,230
Are you crazy?

579
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,620
Our business

580
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,670
were all from him.

581
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,270
If we offend him,

582
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,430
we are left with nothing.

583
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:15,950
You are the crazy one instead.

584
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,750
You are working for him for free.

585
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,550
What are you getting out of it?

586
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,000
-Youâ€™re the crazy one instead!
-Okay, okay.

587
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,430
Stay out of men's business.

588
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,230
How can I not care?

589
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,150
Let me tell you.

590
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,790
In the past when we did seafaring,

591
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,950
yes, we could accept late payments.

592
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,680
We could still hold things up.

593
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,790
But not anymore.

594
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,550
If he doesn't pay us now,

595
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,370
how are we going to get by?

596
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,240
What are you talking about?

597
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,550
H-Have I ever mistreated you two?

598
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:57,900
Where are you going?

599
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,640
What's your family arguing about?

600
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,530
Money.

601
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,760
What else could it be?

602
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,460
If I get married,

603
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,230
it doesn't matter if he has money or not.

604
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,800
He must not be too filial.

605
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:35,920
Why?

606
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,670
The money he worked hard for

607
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,190
will all end up with his mother.

608
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,710
What's left for the family?

609
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,910
Find someone rich.

610
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,350
He can then satisfy both sides.

611
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,470
What?

612
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,640
If you become rich in the future...

613
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,560
If I become rich,

614
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,150
I'll buy my dad's boat

615
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,800
and force him to retire.

616
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:01,950
Then,

617
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,230
I'll buy them a big house in the city,

618
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,490
the kind with a garden.

619
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,460
They can then

620
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,020
watch birds,

621
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,090
do some gardening,

622
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,150
and sunbathe all at home

623
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,080
with no worries.

624
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,670
That's boring.

625
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,230
They will be bored to death.

626
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,980
You...

627
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,140
don't know how lucky you are.

628
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,690
You're oblivious to your parents' hard work.

629
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,010
The canal is hopeless.

630
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,110
You can't make a living with seafaring anymore.

631
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,620
I think those on Flower Street

632
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,620
won't last that much longer either.

633
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,910
If you move the tree, it dies.

634
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,240
If people move, we live.

635
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,430
From now on,

636
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,830
we'll go wherever there's good prospects.

637
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,240
As long as we work hard,

638
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,640
we won't starve to death.

639
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,280
Where do you want to go the most?

640
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,780
I don't know still.

641
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:53,750
What about you?

642
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,630
Beijing.

643
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,030
Zhongguancun.

644
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,600
I'll go when I grow up.

645
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,710
How old is old enough?

646
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:09,450
At least after we graduate from high school.

647
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:10,710
Regardless,

648
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,870
I am not going to

649
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,800
sit here and wait for death.

[Rejected]

651
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,760
According to "Stories to Awaken the World",

652
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,670
Du Shiniang and Li Jia

653
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:27,630
boarded the ship from Chongwen Gate of Beijing.

654
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,480
There's no Yangtze River in Beijing.

655
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,230
It's clearly just a canal.

656
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,630
After they came to Guazhou,

657
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:37,390
they were met with a blizzard.

658
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:40,070
They haven't had the chance to transfer to Yangtze River.

659
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,030
How could this treasure box

660
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,480
then sink in the Yangtze River?

661
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,310
It's because Feng Menglong

662
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:50,870
used the word "river" to replace the canal.

663
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,030
So,

664
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,230
the treasure box

665
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,710
should have sunken in the canal.

But previously when the manuscript was rejected...

672
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,370
Lift up your leg.

673
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,990
At least they would write

674
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,990
why they rejected the manuscript.

675
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,990
They would make clear of the reason.

676
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,300
But now,

677
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,070
they can't even be bothered to write a single word.

00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,000
What grounds do they have?

684
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,790
Enough.

685
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,230
Why are you yelling at him?

686
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,630
He's not from the publisher.

687
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,350
I can't stand it!

688
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,610
If you can't,

689
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,390
just treat it like a fart.

690
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,870
What are you talking about?

691
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:49,900
How can you say that?

692
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,440
Dad.

693
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,200
Calm down.

694
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,620
I-I read the manuscript just now.

695
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,910
I-I think...

696
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,000
it's not that you were rejected

697
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,500
because you are not skilled enough.

698
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,830
Let me ask you.

699
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,870
So, why did they reject my manuscript?

700
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,820
I-I think it's the theme.

701
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,500
Theme?

702
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,570
What do you mean?

703
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,870
That Du Shiniang

704
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:29,410
are all outdated stories of the past.

705
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,170
Nowadays, readers are not interested in that.

706
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,780
It's not easy to read or sell.

707
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,190
So what are they interested in?

708
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,320
This year,

709
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,990
the best-selling novel is called "Ghost Blows Out the Light".

710
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,270
It's centered around tomb raiding.

711
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,710
With your skills, I am sure

712
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,750
you can write better stories with your eyes closed.

713
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,310
What are you talking about?

714
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,370
What are you doing?

715
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,950
How could you hit him?

716
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:52,430
Are you okay?

717
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,060
How could he say that?

718
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,210
He asked me to write about tomb raiders.

719
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:58,440
Why don't he ask me to write about murder and arson?

720
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,430
That works too.

721
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,150
A story on a psychopathic killer who does serial killings would also sell.

722
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:01,710
Get out!

723
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,900
How inappropriate!

724
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,730
I'm a scholar!

725
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,910
How can I write about crap like that?

726
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,940
I have my integrity

727
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,690
and morals, you know?

728
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:15,710
Calm down.

729
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,030
How does he take after me?

730
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,190
All right.

731
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:27,530
When those literary artists write, they go...

732
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,150
No, Grandpa, why don't you actually write something?

733
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:32,760
I want to see.

734
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,310
I...

735
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,230
I don't write well either.

736
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,190
I told you to practice hard.

737
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,920
Practice hard until you are like a calligrapher.

738
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,980
You have to know how to leave even spaces.

739
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,310
You mean to leave room for error, right?

740
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:43,950
Yes.

741
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,910
You just want me to stay at home

742
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,390
and be a housewife, don't you?

743
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,470
That's not what I mean.

744
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,730
That's what you meant.

745
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,210
All these years,

746
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,530
I've been

747
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,630
supporting this household

748
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,310
and contributing to our family.

749
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,710
I don't ask for your understanding

750
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,260
nor for you to be grateful.

751
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,750
But now,

752
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,430
I just want to get back what I've lost

753
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,970
bit by bit.

754
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,450
What did you lose?

755
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,110
My old name

756
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,920
was Luo Zhimei.

757
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,160
But now?

758
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,150
Who knows my name now?

759
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,040
Everyone calls me Haikuo's mother.

760
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,600
As the days go by,

761
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,470
I've lost my name.

762
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,150
Zhimei.

763
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,070
They call you Haikuo's mom because

764
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,730
that's how they've been addressing each other.

765
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,150
Of course your name is Luo Zhimei.

766
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:29,150
You are always Luo Zhimei in my heart.

767
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,090
Besides,

768
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,630
can you get your name back

769
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,870
by just acting in a small role?

770
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,190
At least in the ending credits,

771
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,230
the words "Luo Zhimei" will appear on the screen.

772
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,630
There are only ads at the end of the film.

773
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,390
There are no ending credits.

774
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,750
Stop being unreasonable.

775
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,570
I'm telling you, Zhou Yanlin.

776
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:42,870
This time,

777
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:43,550
I'm definitely leaving.

778
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,020
Don't try to stop me.

779
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,740
It's not like I won't let you go.

780
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,470
Right now, it's inappropriate whether or not

781
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,470
I say something or say nothing.

782
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,000
I'll just get scolded anyway.

783
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,880
What can I do?

784
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,470
Your dad treats you well.

785
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,310
Not at all.

786
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,550
â™«When the moon hangs in the skyâ™«

787
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,850
You're all here.

788
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,470
So, what's your family arguing about?

789
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,550
â™«And it's cooling in the yardâ™«

790
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,860
â™«Who is still by your side?â™«

791
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,710
My mom wants to go to Hengdian.

792
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,110
My dad doesn't agree.

793
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:28,260
â™«As time passesâ™«

794
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,090
Why not?

795
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:30,470
Maybe he's worried.

796
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:32,950
â™«Is a lifetime really that long?â™«

797
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,570
He's afraid my mom won't come back after becoming a star.

798
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:36,710
Your mom becoming a star? Your dad thinks too much.

799
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:39,930
â™«When youthful company fades, leaving only small talk and pleasantriesâ™«

800
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,740
If it weren't for me,

801
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,020
â™«Spring feels short, while autumn lingersâ™«

802
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,870
my mom would have succeeded by now.

803
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,110
I guess my mom resented me.

804
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:49,670
â™«A gentle breeze carries dreams awayâ™«

805
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:51,140
My mom also resented me.

806
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,050
â™«Of sweet dreamsâ™«

807
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:52,560
Why?

808
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,240
Both my dad and my grandma wanted to have a boy.

809
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:59,150
But they had a daughter instead.

810
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:02,160
â™«Life is longâ™«

811
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:03,010
That's why my mum can't hold her head up for the rest of her life.

812
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,800
â™«No need to dwellâ™«

813
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,090
That's all in the past.

814
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,030
Why are they still arguing today?

815
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:11,470
â™«Like moonlightâ™«

816
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,950
When they made good money a few years ago,

817
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,780
we didn't feel like life was tough.

818
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:16,380
â™«Don't forgetâ™«

819
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,950
Now that they're short of money,

820
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,340
they couldn't control their temper anymore.

821
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,460
â™«Life is longâ™«

822
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,920
â™«No need to dwellâ™«

823
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:30,280
â™«Like moonlightâ™«

824
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,700
So

825
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:35,450
â™«The old timesâ™«

826
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,880
we all have to push forward.

827
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,790
Now that our families are not doing well,

828
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,930
they are going to rely on us.

829
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,610
With money,

830
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,430
my mom won't be mad at my dad

831
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,940
for not getting the payments.

832
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,810
Haikuo's mom wouldn't be in a hurry

833
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,030
to go out and act.

834
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,090
Fenghua's family?

835
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,640
If they really wanted a son,

836
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,280
they could just have one.

837
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,830
So in the end, it's all because of money.

838
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,010
I agree.

839
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,580
Once I graduate,

840
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,980
I will go to Lanzhou.

841
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:59,840
â™«Life is longâ™«

842
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,600
Lanzhou? You want to learn how to make noodles?

843
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:04,290
â™«No need to dwellâ™«

844
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,930
We see the people of the canal every day when we open our eyes,

845
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,990
â™«Like moonlightâ™«

846
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:09,240
whose fates are also intertwined with the canal.

847
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,620
Our parents and ancestors,

848
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,040
â™«Don't forgetâ™«

849
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,640

00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,350
I said, how much more do you need?

1023
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,070
You don't have to worry about

1024
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,260
money matters.

1025
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:52,450
Your job is to study hard.

1026
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,830
Do you think

1027
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,030
you're extra kind, noble,

1028
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:00,090
and overflowing with maternal love?

1029
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:01,070
You're worried I would get hurt,

1030
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:01,790
so you simply left me

1031
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,150
at Grandma's with no care or concern.

1032
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,310
You left me to fend for myself.

1033
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,550
I was only 10 years old.

1034
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,910
Have you ever thought about what'll happen to me?

1035
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,190
I'm 17 now.

1036
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,710
I still have insomnia every day.

1037
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,610
It started back then.

1038
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:14,870
You may think it's for my own good,

1039
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,850
but I'm not going to accept that.

1040
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,670
And that brother.

1041
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,990
You said you couldn't afford to send him to school.

1042
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,820
It's nine years of compulsory education.

1043
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,850
You don't even have money for that?

1044
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,310
And the damned pyramid scheme.

1045
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,910
Haven't you fooled yourself enough?

1046
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:30,770
You still want to cheat your relatives and friends?

1047
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,910
I really don't have much money for tuition,

1048
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:37,810
but Ge owes a lot of money for assaulting others.

1049
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:39,320
I have to pay it back.

1050
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,510
Otherwise,

1051
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:41,760
they will find your brother at his school,

1052
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,690
and harass him for money every day.

1053
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,120
Tell me a figure.

1054
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,510
I'll pay you even if I have to sell my blood.

1055
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,310
Siyi.

1056
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:05,050
Siyi.

1057
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,260
What are you doing?

1058
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,030
A game plug-in.

1059
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,550
It digs for gold coins automatically.

1060
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:35,950
Is this illegal?

1061
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,630
As long as I don't do it at scale,

1062
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,400
it shouldn't be a big problem.

1063
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,030
If the officials finds out,

1064
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,090
my account will be suspended at most.

1065
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,700
No need.

1066
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:47,630
If the hacking is reported,

1067
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,350
it may affect your college entrance exam.

1068
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:50,530
Don't you know?

1069
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,100
Siyi is in need of money.

1070
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,450
We have to find a way.

1071
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,340
Tell me.

1072
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:00,150
What does her mother's misfortune have to do with her?

1073
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,010
She doesn't contact her usually.

1074
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:04,030
Siyi is upset though.

1075
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,320
If she's anxious,

1076
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,260
she might really sell her blood.

1077
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,410
With her physique,

1078
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,610
she will die in the blood transfusion van.

1079
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,300
I'll borrow some money from my dad.

1080
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,550
Are you for real?

1081
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,390
Your dad's money didn't come from nowhere.

1082
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:24,510
You could try to just get by,

1083
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:27,010
but you can't take it all on yourself.

1084
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:33,550
There's no one on Flower Street now.

1085
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,340
Our tea eggs are not selling.

1086
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:38,500
There used to be some fish and shrimps in the river.

1087
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,070
Now there's a steel factory in the upstream,

1088
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,930
and the fish and shrimps are gone.

1089
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,550
There's an abandoned boat at the west gate.

1090
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,140
How about...

1091
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,340
No.

1092
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:58,590
Why not?

1093
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,750
No one wants the boat.

1094
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,410
It has been parked for months.

1095
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,350
The diesel

1096
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:03,990
leaks into the river,

1097
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:04,870
causing the fishes to die,

1098
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,200
and ruining the fields.

1099
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:07,480
Let's

1100
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,420
clean up the diesel.

1101
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:13,980
It's also one way that we could help protect the environment.

1102
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,210
Yes.

1103
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,290
Haikuo.

1104
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,400
Come on.

1105
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:47,920
Haikuo.

1106
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:52,650
Yes, grab the pipe too.

1107
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,340
Be gentle.

1108
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,930
Where are you all going?

1109
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,250
None of your business.

1110
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,930
Why are you everywhere?

1111
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:05,740
Go somewhere cooling to relax.

1112
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,030
I'm asking you.

1113
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,390
What are you going to do?

1114
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,630
There's an abandoned boat at the west gate.

1115
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,110
It leaks oil.

1116
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,320
We are going to pick up scraps.

1117
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,330
Don't go.

1118
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,240
Or I'll tell your mom.

1119
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,260
Take the hammer.

1120
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:17,750
Fenghua.

1121
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,790
Do you think I dare not touch you?

1122
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:21,340
You? Touch me?

1123
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:24,870
Stop it.

1124
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:26,410
Siyi is in urgent need of money.

1125
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,170
Let go.

1126
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,890
Fine. I'm going too.

1127
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,100
What are you going for?

1128
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,830
I'm going to keep watch for you.

1129
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:35,670
If you don't take me along today,

1130
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,600
none of you are getting out of here.

1131
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:40,690
Okay, let's go.

1132
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,460
Take that pail.

1133
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:43,620
Let's go.

1134
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,100
Just kill me instead.

1135
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,120
How are you transporting it later?

1136
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,630
What do you mean?

1137
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:56,790
Let's go to Flower Street and borrow a cart.

1138
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:59,270
You're quite thoughtful.

1139
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,330
She's definitely a habitual offender.
