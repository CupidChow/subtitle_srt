Where's Mom?

175
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,510
She's not back yet?

176
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,630
Your mom is on her way.

177
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,630
She'll definitely make it back tonight.

178
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,510
You have the exam tomorrow.

179
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,310
She'll definitely rush back.

180
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,780
Stop dawdling.

181
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,590
Hurry and eat.

182
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,110
What are you doing?

183
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,390
They...

184
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,630
They are all over the wall.

185
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,670
It's really annoying to look at.

186
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,070
Besides,

187
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,310
these things are all in the past.

188
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,070
Look.

189
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:49,690
[Motor Vehicle Driving License of the People's Republic of China]

190
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,710
You got your license so quickly?

191
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,310
[Motor Vehicle Driving License of the People's Republic of China]

192
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,910
It was not that hard.

193
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,190
[Motor Vehicle Driving License of the People's Republic of China]

194
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,070
From now on,

195
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,790
your mom and I

196
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:01,810
will take turns

197
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:02,910
driving the cab.

198
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,150
Hand me that rod.

199
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,490
Your mom and I will take shifts

200
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,240
to drive the cab.

201
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,430
As for the affairs at home,

202
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,670
don't worry about them.

203
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,870
Just focus on your studies.

204
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,910
Dad.

205
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,990
I'm sorry.

206
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,930
What trouble have you gotten into now, you brat?

207
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,270
Dad,

208
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,870
I've grown up.

209
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,350
When I get into college

210
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,730
and start earning money,

211
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,260
I'll buy you a big ship.

212
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,510
Alright, I'll be waiting for you.

213
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,990
I want the biggest ship.

214
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,820
How about a 10,000-ton ship?

215
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,290
Cut the crap.

216
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,740
Can a 10,000-ton ship even run on that river?

217
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,490
You're making empty promises again, aren't you?

218
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,650
You little brat!

219
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,190
Come here!

220
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,960
Put the knife down!

221
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,840
Put the knife down!

222
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,470
How dare you!

223
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,110
Xingchi, what are you doing?

224
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,110
He hit my mom!

225
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,740
You...

226
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,180
Why did you drink during the day?

227
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,790
Indeed.

228
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,050
Your kid is taking the college entrance exam tomorrow.

229
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,040
What are you doing?

230
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,650
If you want to kill me, just do it!

231
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,660
I've long since stopped living like a human anyway!

232
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,030
What are you talking about?

233
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,750
What... what's going on here?

234
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,960
Don't pull me!

235
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,270
Mr. Zhou,

236
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,510
do you know that I'm writing

237
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,630
"The Story of Flower Street"?

238
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,030
Yes, I do. I've been looking forward to it.

239
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,380
I was halfway through writing this book

240
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,990
when I went to apply for a cultural project,

241
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,220
but it got rejected.

242
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,810
Today, I found out

243
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,680
that the only spot at the cultural museum

244
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,280
went to Chen Bo.

245
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,420
Guess what he said about me?

246
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,970
He said I was jealous of him.

247
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,060
What does he have that I should be jealous of?

248
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,240
Why would I be jealous of a guy

249
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,510
who lives off his wife?

250
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,830
Alright. Why did you mention this?

251
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:02,440
Mr. Shao, Mr. Shao.

252
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,610
Hurry up and go back to studying!

253
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,960
I rely on my own abilities to make a living,

254
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,900
yet my son keeps making sarcastic comments by my side.

255
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:09,960
Who wouldn't feel bad...

256
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,180
Xingchi, Xingchi!

257
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,620
You were the one being sarcastic first!

258
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,990
You were the one being sarcastic first!

259
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,380
If you're so capable, get into a good university first,

260
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,750
then come and mock me!

261
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,610
To hell with good universities!

262
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,040
You're from a good university, aren't you?

263
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,170
But you have to pay to publish your own books!

264
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:22,910
How proud you must be!

265
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,160
You bastard!

266
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,230
Stop it!

267
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,550
Both of you, stop it!

268
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,350
Mr. Shao, what's more important now?

269
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,610
Why are you saying this now?

270
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,710
Don't take frustration you feel at work out

271
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,390
on your wife and kid.

272
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,110
Exactly.

273
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,590
Listen to me.

274
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:38,390
Apologize to your child.

275
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,030
Go on. Go, go, go.

276
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,870
You just need to apologize to him.

277
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,390
Apologize.

278
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,510
Apologize to him.

279
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,800
I apologize to him?

280
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,500
A father apologizing to his son?

281
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,640
Is there any justice in this world?

282
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,390
I raised him for eighteen years for nothing?

283
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,520
Shao Bingyi!

284
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,450
Remember this!

285
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,710
From now on, I won't need you to support me anymore!

286
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,310
You're selfish and self-centered!

287
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,260
All you have is a degree,

288
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,330
but you're useless at work!

289
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,150
Every time you drink, you end up hitting my mom!

290
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,630
You want me to succeed, right?

291
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,100
I'm not taking the college entrance exam!

292
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,030
Don't move!

293
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,510
Kid!

294
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,240
Xingchi!

295
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,670
How did this...

296
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,990
Yuling, this...

297
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:17,500
What should we do?

298
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:17,870
Let's go, let's go.

299
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,340
What should we do?

300
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,830
Quickly, carry her into the room!

301
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,910
Get her inside the room, hurry!

302
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,510
Hurry!

303
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,110
Gosh.

304
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,230
Hurry up.

305
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,230
Hurry up.

306
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:07,980
Mom,

307
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:10,950
I'm not going to college.

308
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:11,990
Let me take you away.

309
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:18,960
Where to?

310
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,160
As long as it's away from here and away from him,

311
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,230
we can go anywhere.

312
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,280
Your dad just has a bad temper

313
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,970
and speaks harshly,

314
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,860
but he did a lot for us!

315
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,880
No matter how much he has done for us, he has worn down our gratitude.

316
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,600
Mom, trust me.

317
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,540
I have hands and feet.

318
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,900
If we leave him, we'll live better.

319
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,040
I won't let you suffer.

320
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,830
Are you trying to give your mother a heart attack?

321
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,750
You think you've got it all figured out, huh?

322
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,250
College is right around the corner,

323
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,440
and you said you wouldn't go!

324
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,140
You even tore up your admission ticket!

325
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,640
You're unbelievable.

326
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,440
You're so childish.

327
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,960
What am I supposed to do with you?

328
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,520
Going to college or not isn't that important, Mom.

329
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,010
As long as we leave that drunkard,

330
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,660
life will definitely be better than it is now.

331
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,340
Mom, I know.

332
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,790
I know you're afraid I'll suffer

333
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,630
or be mistreated.

334
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:38,940
I was a kid before

335
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,190
and couldn't take care of myself.

336
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:41,990
But I'm different now.

337
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,800
I've grown up.

338
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,830
I've grown up.

339
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,950
From now on,

340
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,360
you have to learn to live for yourself.

341
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,070
Here.

342
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,520
Take a break.

343
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,360
Have the soup before you go back to studying.

344
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,230
I'm not hungry.

345
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,320
You didn't have dinner.

346
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,430
Do you think you're immortal?

347
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,340
Drink it up.

348
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,310
What university do you want to go to?

349
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,470
Honghuai Normal University.

350
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:13,470
With your grades,

351
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,880
you could get into a top university.

352
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,420
I'm going to a normal university because it's close to home.

353
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,490
You want to stay with your grandma, right?

354
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,330
Well...

355

you don't have to.

357

You can choose a university that suits you.

358
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,020
Normal universities suit me just fine.

How much money can you make as a teacher?

Listen to me.

361
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,970
Choose finance,

362
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,070
or accounting.

363
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,390
Go to a university in a big city.

364
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,520
After graduation, work hard

365
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,530
and get a household registration in a first-tier city.

366
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,420
Then you can bring your brother there too.

367
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:00,150
And I'll...

368
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,540
You don't need to take care of me.

369

Really.

370
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,470
But your brother is your blood after all.

371

You should take care of him.

372

Come on.

373
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,870
How do you want me to take care of him?

374
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,440
Take him everywhere I go?

375
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,320
Spend all the money I earn in the future on him?

376
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,550
When he gets married, should I

377
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,600
buy him a house?

378
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,840
You left me to my grandma because you didn't want the trouble.

379
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,450
Now you want to leave Siwei to me.

380
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,250
If you don't want to be a mom, why did you have us?

381
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,150
This kid. We were just having a normal conversation.

382
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,570
Why are you getting worked up again?

383
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,950
We're family.

384
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,190
I'm doing this for your good.

385
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,260
Have you eaten gunpowder or something?

386
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,990
Why do you throw tantrums at me from time to time?

387
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,810
Who spoiled you like this?

388
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,950
I gave birth to such a heartless child.

389

Don't compromise your principles for a mediocre salary.

515
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:22,830
What about for a slightly higher salary?

516
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:23,650
Well, I'll say thanks.

517
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,250
Your turn.

518
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,170
Don't regret it.

519
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,770
Be nicer to your mom.

520
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,520
So you know that.

521

come.

Come out.

00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,510
Tell us, which school are you applying to?

532

Chen Rui!

Which university are you applying to?

534
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:21,910
Honghuai Normal University.

535
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,150
Wait.

536
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,580
Why?

537
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,600
Because of Ma Siyi.

538
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,200
Are you sure she can get in?

539
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,020
I'm sure.

540
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,130
When I went to pick up your report card at school,

541
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,820
I heard about her situation from the teacher.

542
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,460
She handed in blank papers for every subject.

543
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,120
That's impossible.

544
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,060
Her total score is zero.

545
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,230
Liking someone

546
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,030

Why didn't you take the exam seriously?

558

Why did you hand in blank papers?

559

571

Why are you selling it?

579

Flower Street has no future.

580
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,820
And the canal is in decline.

581

582

I've already inquired about it.

This house is worth at least a hundred thousand now.

Why are you arguing?

592
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,030
I'm not insisting on doing this.

593
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,180
Why are you getting so worked up?

594
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,010
I have no intention of discussing this with you.

595

This house is absolutely not for sale.

596

597

use your own money!

Have you gone crazy from being poor?

599
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,920
This house was left to Siyi by Granny.

600
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,820
What right do you have to sell it?

601
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,010
Siyi, don't worry.

602
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:01,880
We're all here for you.

603

She can't take this house away.

604
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,070
We won't let her take it!

605
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,010
I never said I was going to take it.

606
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,090
I'm just trying to discuss this with her reasonably.

607
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,460
Come on, you guys.

608
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,400
Besides,

609
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,290
this house belongs to my mother-in-law.

610
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,390
Technically, I have a right to use it.

611
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,910
You've remarried.

612
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,560
Legally,

613
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,430
Granny Ma is no longer your mother-in-law!

614
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,010
That's right!

615
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,040
Exactly!

616
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,830
Siyi is my own daughter.

617
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,590
Everything I do is for her own good.

618
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,800
If you really want what's best for her,

619
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,790
just keep the house.

620
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,420
Let's not talk about the financial aspect for now.

621
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,780
Emotionally,

622
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,600
this child surely can't bear to let it go.

623
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,230
Yes. Keeping this house

624
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,050
will at least leave this child something to hold on to.

625
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,910
No matter where she goes in the future,

626
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:38,830
if she gets tired or feels weary,

627
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,030
she'll have a place to return to.

628
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:40,530
Exactly.

629
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,310
Although the rent from this house doesn't bring in much,

630
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,670
it's still Siyi's home.

631
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,670
You, as her mother...

632
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,830
A home is where family is, okay?

633
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,590
They are my real family!

634
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,350
You abandoned me

635
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,570
when I needed you the most!

636
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,830
How can you expect me to treat you as my mother?

637
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,150
Blood is thicker than water.

638
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,550
No matter what,

639
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,910
I'm still your biological mother.

640
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,580
Grandma is gone,

641
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,470
but I'm still here.

642
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:07,640
No matter what happens,

643
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,190
I won't

644
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,630
leave you all alone, uncared for.

645
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,390
You?

646
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,270
How are you going to take care of me?

647
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,510
By selling the house, swindling all the money,

648
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,920
and disappearing again?

649
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,390
In the past, you always went to Grandma when you were in trouble.

650
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:17,680
Now it's me.

651
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,930
You have to squeeze every last bit out of me

652
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,030
before you're satisfied, don't you?

653
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,860
How could you say that?

654
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,010
Every family has its own difficulties.

655
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,240
Then don't be my family!

656
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,290
Who asked you to?

657
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:34,670
From now on,

658
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,070
you are you and I am me!

659
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,220
We'll live our separate lives.

660
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:38,710
No matter how difficult or tough it gets for me,

661
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,020
I will never ask you for help!

662
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,130
Siyi,

663
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,600
you didn't even get into university.

664
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,310
I'm not well-off either.

665
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,830
Who's going to support you in the future?

666
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,910
I will!

667
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,670
From now on,

668
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:56,750
you don't need to worry about Siyi.

669
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,760
She has me,

670
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,810
brothers and sisters,

671
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,790
and the neighbors.

672
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,910
As long as we're here,

673
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,250
we won't let Siyi suffer!

674
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,600
The kid is right!

675
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:04,120
Yes.

676
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:04,820
Exactly.

677
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,160
We're all here for her.

678
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,060
You're all family.

679
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,450
You're all family.

680
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:12,650
Is that enough?

681
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,580
I'm her only enemy here.

682
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:19,410
You heartless kid.

683
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,280
Fine. I'll get lost.

684
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,870
Siwei!

685
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,650
Your sister finds you annoying!

686
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,060
Let's get lost!

687
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,720
Come on, pack your things!

688
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,170
Pack your things!

689
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,150
Siyi,

690
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,000
don't make me leave!

691
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,280
I'll be good!

692
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,780
I'm not trying to make you leave.

693
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:37,910
When I get back on my feet,

694
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,180
I'll come to pick you up, okay?

695
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,230
No!

696
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,270
I don't want to go with her,

697
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,220
Siyi.

698
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,030
I'm not capable enough right now.

699
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,630
But when I am,

700
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,320
I'll come to get you, okay, Siwei?

701
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,870
No!

702
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,870
Pinky swear, pinky swear.

703
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,250
I'll definitely come.

704
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:57,290
Cross my heart, hope to die. Stick a needle in my eye.

705
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,270
Take good care of yourself, okay?

706
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:02,020
I gave birth to her, and now I'm the bad guy.

707
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,270
Isn't it just because I'm poor?

708
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,370
I'll get lost. Is that enough?

709
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,340
Stop crying!

710
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,250
Take this!

711
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,570
Siyi!

712
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,110
Let's go!

713
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,310
Take good care of yourself, okay?

714
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,750
Siyi!

715
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,350
I'll just pretend I never gave birth to her!

716
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,730
Siyi!

717
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,570
Let's go!

718
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:25,870
Siyi!

719
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,210
Siyi!

720
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,300
Be careful not to step on his face.

721
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,100
Both of us are going to Beijing.

722
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:43,960
What about you?

723
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,300
I'm going to Beijing too.

724
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,950
To work and make money.

725
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:52,210
You're really not going to repeat the year?

726
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,300
Let's talk about the future when it comes.

727
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,300
Anyway, I can't stand staying in Flower Street for even one more day.

728
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,760
Because of your dad?

729
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,230
Now, whenever I see his face,

730
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,760
I get so angry I can't hold it in.

731
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,770
I'm really afraid that one day I...

732
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,020
Actually, your dad is pretty good to you.

733
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,210
He's just a bit naggy,

734
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:20,910
but he's not a bad person.

735
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:21,790
I know.

736
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,620
But every time he's drunk, he hits my mom.

737
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,500
I really can't stand it.

738
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,480
I tried to persuade my mom to leave,

739
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,700
but she refuses to.

740
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:31,960
Why?

741
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,830
Maybe she just can't let go.

742
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,550
I don't know either.

743
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,590
I'll go to Beijing first.

744
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,680
When I make some money and buy a house,

745
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:44,130
I'll bring my mom over.

746
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,070
They call that capable?

747
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,340
Slow down!

748
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,030
The whole of Flower Street is picking on just me?

749
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,560
Hurry up!

750
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,920
If you don't move fast, your sister will kick you out!

751
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,350
Have you no shame?

752
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,810
Are you bullying me because I don't have a husband?

753
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,360
Siwei.

754
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:06,570
Siwei.

755
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,800
You're picking on me alone!

756
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,080
Brother-in-law!

757
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,530
What Brother-in-law?

758
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:12,530
Let's go!

759
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,949
Brother-in-law!

760
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:15,290
What's wrong?

761
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,550
I want Brother-in-law!

762
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,400
You little shameless brat!

763
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,310
You're so young and already calling someone Brother-in-law!

764
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:19,440
What's wrong with her mom now?

765
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,110
Brother-in-law!

766
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:22,110
When I make it big one day,

767
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,040
you won't be able to kiss my ass!

768
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,190
What's going on?

769
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,429
What brother-in-law?

770
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:27,790
Where is she taking Siwei?

771
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,780
You ungrateful little brat,

772
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,300
let's go!

773
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,510
Your sister likes you, huh?

774
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,139
Then go and live with her!

775
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:39,889
Get lost!

776
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,590
Get lost!

777
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,310
You said it yourself.

778
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:46,340
Brother-in-law!

779
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:48,320
Brother-in-law!

780
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,150
Come back!

781
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:50,300
Ge Siwei!

782
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,630
Come back here!

783
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:53,429
Little brat!

784
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:54,429
Come back here!

785
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:55,730
Come back!

786
00:34:56,489 --> 00:34:57,520
Ge Siwei!

787
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,570
Come back!

788
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,480
Don't climb over!

789
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,990
Get down!

790
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:05,230
-Siwei, it's dangerous!
-Stop!

791
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,950
-Siwei!
-Get down! It's dangerous!

792
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:07,660
-Siwei!
-It's dangerous!

793
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,310
Get down!

794
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:09,830
There's a ship!

795
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:10,590
Don't jump!

796
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:21,450
Siwei!

797
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,270
Siwei!

798
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,790
Siwei!

799
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,300
Siwei!

800
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,410
Siyi!

801
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,100
Siyi!

802
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,670
Your brother...

803
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:24,010
What happened to my brother?

804
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,310
Your brother, he...

805
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,260
What happened to him?

806
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,630
Why did you call him?

807
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,740
Auntie!

808
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,270
Give me back my son!

809
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:41,190
Auntie!

810
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,230
Auntie, calm down!

811
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:44,630
If you hadn't called him, he wouldn't have jumped!

812
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,350
Calm down, calm down!

813
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,910
What do you want?

814
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,390
Give me back my son!

815
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,140
Where's Siwei?

816
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,750
They're still conducting the search and recovery.

817
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,840
So far, only some of his remains have been found.

818
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:56,610
My condolences.

819
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,700
Your brother's fate...

820
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:01,620
was so tragic.

821
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,690
They killed him!

822
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,070
They killed him!

823
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,910
Nonsense!

824
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,680
He died because you were chasing him!

825
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,350
He jumped off the bridge to get away from you!

826
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,650
No!

827
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,810
Siyi,

828
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,140
it was not like that.

829
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,070
They killed him!

830
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,740
You bastard!

831
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,470
It was all your fault!

832
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,600
Bastard!

833
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:32,350
Bastard! Bastard!

834
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:32,950
Auntie.

835
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,510
Why did you call him?

836
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,660
Calm down, calm down.

837
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:38,230
If you hadn't called him, he wouldn't have died!

838
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,220
Give me back my son's life!

839
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,460
Give me back my son's life!

840
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,060
Siyi!

841
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,280
Siyi!

842
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:58,820
It was not your fault.

843
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,890
If anyone's to blame, it's his mother.

844
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,900
She actually had the nerve to turn things around and blame us.

845
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,470
I shouldn't have called him.

846
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,030
If he had just walked straight over,

847
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,620
maybe he wouldn't have jumped.

848
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,670
I've told you

849
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,350
several times

850
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:15,790
that it wasn't your fault.

851
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:16,630
Are you out of your mind?

852
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:17,910
Are you a nagging widow?

853
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,270
If his mom hadn't chased after him,

854
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,610
would Siwei have jumped?

855
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,800
The root cause is his mother.

856
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,270
Stop it.

857
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:34,880
Siyi,

858
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,240
my mom made wontons

859
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:38,670
with shepherd's purse filling.

860
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,350
Have some.

861
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,420
At least eat a little.

862
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,130
Otherwise, you won't be able to hold up.

863
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,340
I'll have to go to the hospital to take care of you.

864
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,220
Be good. Just eat ten of them.

865
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,100
I'm just worried she won't be able to handle it.

866
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,070
Why don't we...

867
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,680
go down and talk to Siyi for a bit?

868
00:39:58,450 --> 00:39:59,770
What should we say when we see her?

869
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,030
Then what should we do?

870
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,350
Fenghua is with her.

871
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,210
Siyi won't do anything drastic.

872
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,480
Mom, hurry up.

873
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,610
Get me two more.

874
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,500
Siyi,

875
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,000
open the door.

876
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,340
Siyi?

877
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:50,360
Siyi.

878
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,250
Have some wontons.

879
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,430
I'll leave them here for you.

880
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,990
My mom said,

881
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:39,930
if you want to cry, just cry out loud.

882
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,030
Don't hold it in.

883
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,200
It's bad for your health.

884
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,120
I've already cried.

885
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:48,490
How come I didn't hear you cry?

886
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,790
If you don't know what to say, then say nothing.

887
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,840
Let's sleep together tonight.

888
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:56,900
You can hide under the blanket and cry.

889
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:57,780
And I'll be with you.

890
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:02,010
No need. I'm really fine.

891
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:05,410
Stop it. You've always been like this since you were a kid.

892
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,800
When you're hurt,

893
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,010
you always keep it inside and never tell anyone.

894
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,430
My mom said it can cause breast cancer.

895
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:12,780
Can I ask you a favor?

896
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:15,130
Go ahead.

897
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:16,420
Go out with me for a walk.

898
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,240
Before the college entrance exam,

899
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:32,590
Siwei dreamed of Grandma.

900
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,010
He dreamt of her

901
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,210
riding a bike with Grandpa.

902
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,260
I was so angry.

903
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,940
Why were you angry?

904
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:44,020
Grandma appeared in his dream

905
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:45,430
but ignored me.

906
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,670
She didn't want you to be sad.

907
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:50,510
She couldn't bear to see that.

908
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,120
Look ahead.

909
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,180
Granny's gone,

910
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,650
but we're still here.
