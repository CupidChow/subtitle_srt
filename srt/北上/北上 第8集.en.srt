There's no need to discuss it.

My parents don't understand this industry anyway.

190

It's pointless to ask them.

191
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,440
There's a penalty clause,

192

five times the signing bonus.

193

It's like this.

If you don't deliberately break the contract,

198
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,570
you won't have to worry about penalties.

If it doesn't, Party B reserves the right to refuse.

207

This clause is enough then.

Her blood pressure and cholesterol levels are a bit high,

342
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,750
while other indicators are normal though.

343
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,080
The doctor said

344
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,360
that she can't overexert herself,

345
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,470
has to avoid getting angry,

346
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,740
and has to stay away from high-fat,

347
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,780
high-calorie, and greasy foods.

348
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,110
Just the usual advice.

349
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,320
What did they say about the stroke risk?

350
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,620
They didn't mention that specifically.

351
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,820
But to be honest,

352
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,060
I don't think she's in very good health.

353
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,290
Think about it.

354
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,860
Before, she could be on her feet all day,

355
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,400
full of energy,

356
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,960
and still walk briskly too.

357
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,230
But today,

358
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,940
the check-up only took half a day.

359
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,940
How much walking could we have done?

360
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,350
Yet she was worn out.

361
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,520
See? She lay down as soon as she got home.

362
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,090
She is not that energetic anymore.

363
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,010
So,

364
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,290
just in case,

365
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,790
we still need to do a drill in advance.

366
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,950
A drill?

367
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,590
If she has an episode at home,

368
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,730
from our compound to where we can get a car,

369
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,520
it's at least 300 meters, right?

370
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,040
Yes.

371
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,140
Plus, we'll have to cross the bridge.

372
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,040
After crossing the bridge, we need to have a car prepared in advance.

373
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,520
Once at the hospital, she'll need emergency treatment.

374
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,720
With this illness...

375
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,840
it's all about time.

376
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,390
Start.

377
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,050
Hurry.

378
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,920
One, two, go.

379
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,260
Easy now. Watch your step.

380
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,410
Watch the road.

381
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,390
An uphill.

382
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,630
Mr. Zhou!

383
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,120
What happened?

384
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,870
Make way, make way!

385
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,190
It's nothing, just a drill.

386
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,110
Don't worry.

387
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,310
We'll explain later.

388
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:47,960
Slowly.

389
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,000
A drill?

390
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,440
Are you tired?

391
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,510
How about... I carry you instead for a while?

392
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,510
You... stop talking.

393
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,370
Save your energy.

394
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,070
Actually, I'm fine.

395
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:57,990
Let me tell you,

396
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,590
before, I could carry a sofa on my head

397
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,350
from the South Gate Market all the way back,

398
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,870
easy peasy.

399
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,390
Really?

400
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,650
There are steps ahead.

401
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,630
Mom!

402
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,550
Careful now.

403
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,600
What happened?

404
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,150
Mom?

405
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:09,870
Get out of the way.

406
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,300
What's wrong with you?

407
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,070
What's wrong with you?

408
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,110
Hurry up, go, go.

409
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,290
Don't waste our time.

410
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,720
What's wrong with my mom?

411
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,230
What's really wrong with you?

412
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:17,720
Mom!

413
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,470
The three of us were playing cards.

414
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,350
Your Aunt Liang lost.

415
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,410
This is her punishment.

416
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,230
Are you crazy?

417
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,110
Who are you trying to scare this late at night?

418
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:24,870
Cut the crap.

419
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,800
Just go away now.

420
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,070
Everything is fine. Everything is fine.

421
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,000
It's fine. Hurry up and go home now.

422
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,970
-Here, here.
-Okay.

423
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,960
My goodness.

424
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,920
Is your waist okay?

425
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,780
It takes at least three minutes to get here.

426
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,680
Then, adding the time to find a car and drive there,

427
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,940
it'll take another ten minutes or so to get to the hospital.

428
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,470
The key is the car. We have to have it ready at all times.

429
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,230
If we only start looking for one when we get here, it'll be too late.

430
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,990
We can have a tricycle ready at all times,

431
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,450
but where can we find a car to keep on standby?

432
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,060
Granny Ma... almost weighs as much as the two of you, right?

433
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,230
That's true, true.

434
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:07,770
That won't do.

435
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,619
We need to get a stretcher.

436
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:11,750
Right.

437
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:12,410
I'll make one.

438
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,210
I'll help you.

439
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,349
Just in case.

440
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:16,950
We need to have one prepared.

441
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,040
Okay.

442
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,190
It's settled then.

443
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,220
Drill's over!

444
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,180
Let's go home.

445
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,849
Let's go.

446
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:24,859
Hold her, hold her.

447
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:25,960
I'm holding her.

448
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,940
Fenghua, dinner's ready!

449
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,730
You startled me.

450
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,740
What's going on with you?

451
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,200
Mom, sit down first.

452
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,290
What's going on?

453
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,880
What's all this about?

454
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,620
Open it and take a look.

455
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,490
Where did you get it?

456
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,560
I earned it.

457
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,850
How did you earn it?

458
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,300
Guess.

459
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,150
Stop teasing and just tell me.

460
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,160
Wasn't there a photographer at the stall the other day?

461
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,640
I signed a contract with him

462
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,140
to be an advertising model.

463
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,600

Don't worry.

467

I've gone through it carefully.

468

Everything's legitimate.

is there something fishy with this contract?

See? I knew

478
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,470
there had to be something fishy with this contract.

479
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,520
They signed Fenghua as their model

480
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,110
and gave her a 10,000 yuan signing bonus?

481

At face value, there doesn't seem to be any problem with this contract.

492
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,870
The contract states that the work arranged by Party A must be legal.

493

With this clause,

494

Fenghua won't be at too much risk.

Is that so?

However...

498
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,130
there's a...

50,000 RMB penalty clause for breach of contract.

500

If we ever breach the contract,

501
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,920
then we'll have to pay the penalty.

Where am I supposed to find 50,000 yuan for her?

Auntie,

507
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,320
as long as she doesn't actively terminate the contract with them,

508

she won't need to pay any penalties.

If Fenghua can really make money from this,

then she should go ahead and do it.

00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:26,590
800 yuan per ad.

512
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,050
With Fenghua's qualifications,

513
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,250
where else could she earn that much money?

514
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,310
What if they're scammers?

515
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,330
We need to look into that.

516
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,140
When Fenghua goes there next time,

517
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,270
I'll go with her.

518
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,830
Let's see how it goes and then decide.

519
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,960
That's great.

520
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,720
I'm so glad you'll be with her.

521
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:45,750
You don't need to worry.

522
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,510
I'm going to do my homework now.

523
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,390
Okay, okay.

524
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,710
See?

525
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,310
Wanghe never gives us anything to worry about.

526
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,020
What's wrong?

527
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,320
Are you scared by this?

528
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,830
Leave me alone. I'm annoyed.

529
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:11,960
Alright, then.

530
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,190
Then, I'll spend...

531
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,290
this money myself.

532
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:15,890
In your dreams.

533
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,660
What?

534
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,870
Can't I spend the money I earned myself?

535
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,320
What do you want to buy?

536
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:25,700
A phone.

537
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,030
The latest model.

538
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,280
Is that really necessary?

539
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,390
For my dad.

540
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,950
Your dad already has a phone.

541
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,230
He's been using

542
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,510
that old Nokia for years.

543
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,640
It's embarrassing.

544
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:38,630
Get him a new one

545
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,920
so that he'll have face wherever he goes.

546
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,180
And I'll get you a new watch too.

547
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,710
Your old one keeps breaking down and needing repairs.

548
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,240
And the case is all worn out.

549
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,710
What about yourself?

550
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,710
I want a lipstick,

551
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,550
150 yuan.

552
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,410
Anything else?

553
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:02,870
That's all.

554
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,390
The watch and phone already cost several thousand yuan.

555
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,990
There's not much money left.

556
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,830
We're not buying anything.

557
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,070
I'll save all the money for you as your dowry.

558
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,510
No way!

559
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,950
I finally have a chance to prove myself for once.

560
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,870
Can you just let me have my moment?

561
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,370
Later, when you're out on the street

562
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,570
and someone asks you,

563
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,290
"You got a new watch?"

564
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,580
"My daughter bought it for me."

565
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,840
How wonderful is that?

566
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:29,870
Okay.

567
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,350
I'll get a new watch then.

568
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,340
But we don't need to buy a new phone for your dad.

569
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,180
He doesn't have much business to do.

570
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,270
He doesn't need it.

571
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,950
No, we must get him a new one.

572
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,710
Later, when my dad gets a new phone

573
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,770
and shows it off in front of Uncle Xie.

574
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,150
"Look, look."

575
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,490
"My daughter bought this for me."

576
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,300
"Let your son buy you a new cell phone someday, huh?"

577
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,640
Then Wanghe will get another beating.

578
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,480
You bad girl.

579
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:54,960
Remember.

580
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,120
In the future, for any matter,

581
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,450
always discuss it with your family first.

582
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,800
I'm afraid you'll be taken advantage of.

583
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,600
Did you hear me?

584
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,440
I'm being serious here.

585
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:11,200
Your dad is here to support the family.

586
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,730
We don't need you to do that.

587
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,220
I know, I know.

588
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,030
Boss.

589
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:28,860
Come on.

590
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,140
Are you out of your mind?

591
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,070
Your liver doesn't hurt anymore?

592
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,510
Not afraid of your wife scolding you anymore?

593
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,050
Let her scold me if she wants.

594
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,660
Well, let's drink first.

595
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,630
Come on, come on.

596
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,970
The heck with it. I'm already like this.

597
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,470
Have you lost your spirit?

598
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,440
It's just the beginning.

599
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:01,770
All of these setbacks...

600
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:04,270
are all temporary.

601
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,500
It's okay if we just can't

602
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,200
get the money back.

603
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,070
We can always earn more, right?

604
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,430
These days, I keep feeling that... the...

605
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,200
the Grand Canal...

606
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:26,660
is finished.

607
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,190
Have you noticed?

608
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,150
These days,

609
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,950
there are fewer and fewer ships on the river,

610
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,630
while the cars on the highway

611
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,390
are increasing day by day.

612
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,950
I'm getting...

613
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,260
really anxious.

614
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,350
I'm in a complete panic.

615
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,460
Let me tell you.

616
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:57,080
This is all... all temporary.

617
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,600
It will pass.

618
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,670
Right?

619
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,650
Mr. Zhou said

620
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,070
that this Grand Canal

621
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:07,490
was dug since the Spring and Autumn period.

622
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,790
It took over two thousand years to complete it.

623
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,110
It's witnessed so many dynasties

624
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,070
and supported so many people.

625
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,690
As long as we don't give up on it,

626
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,720
I firmly believe

627
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,090
that this canal will also not give up on us.

628
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,510
I hope it's like that too.

629
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,810
Right?

630
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:29,520
You know, I've been following you since we were kids.

631
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:33,880
Well, whatever we do, you've always called the shots.

632
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,070
You make all the big decisions and major ideas,

633
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,600
and I just follow your lead.

634
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,770
I'll do whatever you say.

635
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,120
But...

636
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:46,570
but now I'm really starting to feel...

637
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,290
feel like I can't hold on much longer.

638
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,990
Just think about how many days we've fallen behind

639
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,520
on paying the dividends we owe to each family.

640
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,510
We all live in the same compound,

641
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,750
seeing each other every day.

642
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:11,620
My family's living expenses are about to run out.

643
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:18,530
Next year, Fenghua will be taking the college entrance exam.

644
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,610
If she doesn't get in, that's fine.

645
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,290
But what if she does?

646
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:27,070
Where will I get the money for her tuition, Tiancheng?

647
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,550
You also want to sell the ship?

648
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,130
But...

649
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:43,030
we bought this ship to make money, right?

650
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,580
Not for sentimental reasons, right?

651
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,320
But if we don't do seafaring,

652
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,610
what are we going to do?

653
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,840
Tiancheng,

654
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,700
look...

655
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,080
your destiny is tied to the water.

656
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,820
Can't we find a place by the river...

657
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,450
and do some fish farming or something?

658
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,440
My brother-in-law knows an expert from Shanghai.

659
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,400
He said

660
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,830
that raising eels or turtles can make money.

661
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,410
At the very least,

662
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,940
we could set up a fish pond

663
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,820
and start a farmstay.

664
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,180
That's still better than this

665
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,240
half-dead state we're in now, right?

666
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,440
Mom.

667
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,540
Your waist hasn't recovered yet. Why are you running?

668
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,000
See? You're in pain again.

669
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,510
You need to wear this back brace even when you sleep at night.

670
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,730
Won't that give me a rash around my waist?

671
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,070
That's still better than a sore back, isn't it?

672
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,240
The doctor said...

673
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,260
that if you don't rest,

674
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,660
your waist will be easily affected by the cold.

675
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,630
Stop worrying about me.

676
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,140
If you have this much spare time,

677
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,900
go hit the books.

678
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,290
Are you feeling better?

679
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,740
Much better.

680
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,590
It's just that I can't do

681
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,320
any heavy work for a while.

682
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,190
I'll need to rest for a while.

683
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,300
Come and eat.

684
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,300
Alright.

685
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,590
Then you should rest.

686
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,050
Take it as a break.

687
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,750
There's not much business on the streets lately anyway.

688
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,750
You drink first.

689
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,410
There are more dishes coming.

690
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,390
How much money do we have left at home?

691
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,060
Not much.

692
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,360
Why do you ask?

693
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,990
Didn't Chen Bo publish a book?

694
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,280
So, I'm planning to self-publish one.

695
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,570
Self-publish?

696
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,220
I was just thinking...

697
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,890
you see...

698
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:21,090
our son will be going to college next year, right?

699
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:23,150
Shouldn't we save more money for him?

700
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,710
Forget it.

701
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,750
I'll go chase Boss Xie for our dividend.

702
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,010
No, no, no.

703
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,180
If he hasn't given it, it means he's in a tough spot.

704
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,150
If he is earning money,

705
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,470
hasn't he already given us?

706
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:47,790
Don't go.

707
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,190
No, but he can't always be in a tight spot.

708
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,520
How long has he owed us now?

709
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,810
If he really had no business, I wouldn't say anything.

710
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,910
But Boss Xie,

711
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,750
he's shipping trip by trip.

712
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,150
If he's not making money,

713
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,330
why is he bothering with all of this?

714
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,100
He might as well sell the ship.

715
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,160
Listen to me.

716
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,600
I've thought it through.

717
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,430
I'll learn embroidery.

718
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,940
Once I get the hang of it, I can earn money.

719
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,490
How long will that take?

720
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,570
I've asked around.

721
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,090
There's a big demand in the market.

722
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,150
As long as the quality is good,

723
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,030
we won't have to worry about selling.

724
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,910
I need cash now!

725
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,390
Besides, it's Xie who owes us!

726
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,790
Since when did the debtors get to call the shots?

727
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,120
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

728
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,640
You...

729
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,110
Come...

730
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,510
Mom.

731
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,020
You've strained your back again?

732
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,240
Go sit down, quick.

733
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,310
Easy, easy.

734
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,590
Pay attention. What's on your mind?

735
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,390
You're spilling it everywhere.

736
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,930
What are you thinking about?

737
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,020
About Fenghua's contract,

738
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,190
the more I think about it, the more it doesn't feel right.

739
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,680
Why does it not feel right?

740
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,800
If Siyi signed a contract to be a model, I'd believe it.

741
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,020
Fenghua...

742
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,580
What about her?

743
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,060
Are you saying Fenghua isn't beautiful?

744
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:03,950
She's frumpy.

745
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,870
As if you're so fashionable.

746
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,690
Then why didn't they sign you?

747
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,580
I don't make a living off my looks.

748
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,780
Then what do you make a living off?

749
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,740
Your ability?

750
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,020
Haihong.

751
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,320
Uncle Shao.

752
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,090
Wanghe,

753
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,380
is your dad home?

754
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,110
He's not.

755
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,020
Do you need to see him for something?

756
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,260
No, no, no.

757
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,130
Mr. Shao.

758
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:33,080
I'll have our Xie find you when he gets back.

759
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,900
Okay.

760
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,110
I'll be off then.

761
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,680
What's the matter?

762
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,070
He came for his dividends.

763
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:00,050
We can't really blame him.

764
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,070
This time...

765
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:04,680
it's really been dragged out for far too long.

766
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,960
If I were your father,

767
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:08,390
I'd be too embarrassed to come home.

768
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,160
Don't always be at odds with Yan.

769
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,250
Alright, alright.

770
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:21,950
Right?

771
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:22,430
Yes, yes.

772
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,200
Boss.

773
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,170
Mr. Shao.

774
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,350
My dad is back.

775
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,200
Well...

776
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,750
Light-headed.

777
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:30,860
Boss?

778
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:36,740
Well...

779
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,760
Lao'er?

780
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,470
You go back first.

781
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,270
We... we'll chat for a bit.

782
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,800
Please... please go ahead.

783
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,150
It's...

784
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,110
about the dividends.

785
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,670
I'm a bit tight on cash recently,

786
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,150
and I urgently need it.

787
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,720
Otherwise, I wouldn't have brought this up with you.

788
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,630
I understand.

789
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,790
I understand. I understand.

790
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,320
Give me one more week.

791
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,770
I'll definitely... resolve this issue.

792
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:19,950
One week?

793
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,110
You...

794
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:25,510
you're... in such a hurry... for money?

795
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,110
It's not that.

796
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:30,490
I heard

797
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,060
that Crippled Sun even sold his own car

798
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,740
and then ran off.

799
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,490
I'm afraid you'll get scammed.

800
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,030
Then, can you still get back the money

801
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,520
he owes you?

802
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:55,350
I...

803
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,200
Be careful, be careful.

804
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,960
I... I...

805
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,840
I'll do my best to get it back.

806
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,270
If not,

807
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,630
I still have a backup plan.

808
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,870
You've finally decided to sell the ship?

809
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,159
I've said this before.

810
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,989
The canal business is finished.

811
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,610
If we don't cut our losses now,

812
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,810
we may really end up losing everything.

813
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,870
Are you all...

814
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,719
just waiting for me to sell the ship?

815
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,020
It's just a suggestion.

816
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:29,989
Whether you take it or not

817
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:30,960
is up to you.

818
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,489
But I think,

819
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,389
now that we're in a market economy, after all,

820
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:40,350
doing business still needs to follow market principles.

821
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:42,199
We can't do things recklessly.

822
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,280
What do you think?

823
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,550
Right.

824
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,190
What you say... makes sense.

825
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:52,770
Makes sense.

826
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:01,310
Wanghe has reviewed the contract.

827
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,370
He said there's no problem with it.

828
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,610
Does shooting commercials

829
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,810
really pay that much?

830
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:13,740
Still, not just anyone can make money from it.

831
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,140
It means our daughter has good conditions.

832
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,940
They came to us.

833
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:21,440
If it were someone else, they wouldn't even come to them.

834
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:32,630
If she can make money from it, let her do it first.

835
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,630
Let her earn the tuition fees first.

836
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,830
With her brain,

837
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:39,670
though, I'm not sure she'll even get into college.

838
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,550
However,

839
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,230
I think modeling is just a career

840
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,810
that expires with youth.

841
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:45,520
While she's still young,

842
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,390
she can earn as much as possible.

843
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,990
Once she has enough saved up,

844
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,390
we can open a restaurant.

845
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,670
What restaurant?

846
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,610
With the current economic situation,

847
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,360
anything you open will end up losing money.

848
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,760
But we can't just sit around and do nothing.
