Then I won't say anything.

00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,980
I'll just fart!

Sorry, sir.

What are you doing? You're in a ward!

181
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,650
We're leaving. We'll visit you later.

182

Chen Rui does exercises too?

How are his grades?

188
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,270
Why do you want to know?

Just asking.

190
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,220
Last semester, he was one of the top 10 students in our grade.

191
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,520
His performance is unstable.

192
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,780
How so?

193
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,840
His grades drop when he spends too much time with you.

194
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,830
If you stay away from him,

195
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,170
he can be admitted to Harvard University.

More like Harbin Buddhist Academy.

Would his mother be willing to let him

198
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,270
become a monk at such a young age?

199

-Auntie.
-Hello, Auntie.

00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,030
I wouldn't be willing.

202
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,190
Your parents wouldn't be willing either, right?

I should thank you.

You just said in the ward that you'd copy notes for Chen Rui.

I'm truly touched.

It's the least I can do. He's always been good to me.

can you come to live in our house?

After school, you'll come to the hospital

to deliver the notes to Chen Rui and explain them to him.

230

Then I'll drive you home.

You're so smart,

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,380
but you've constantly wasted your time and talent

343
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,960
and made your parents worried.

344
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,160
It's really not okay.

345
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,850
You're talking about me?

346
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,860
You haven't made your parents worried?

347
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,840
Anyway,

348
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,350
we all hope you can be more reliable

349
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,970
and put your brain to good use.

350
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,040
As for the definition of good use,

351
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,440
it's for you to decide.

352
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,680
When my dad drinks too much,

353
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,850
he would complain sometimes,

354
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,410
regretting he didn't study hard when he was young.

355
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,680
That's why he can only do seafaring all these years.

356
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,880
He's never made any great achievement.

357
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,110
I sincerely hope

358
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,230
when you're at my dad's age,

359
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,510
you won't complain,

360
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,710
regret,

361
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,140
or make those who love you worried

362
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,920
when you drink too much.

363

Mom,

364
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,630
do you think I can be successful in the future?

365
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,510
Of course you can.

Then how about

373
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,040
me starting a business?

374
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,730
What kind of business?

375
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,210
I have a few ideas.

If any of my ideas works,

377

I can make a lot of money.

378

I need your support.

What kind of support?

381
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,770
You're trying to cheat me out of money again?

382

No, no, no.

387

Say that again! I dare you!

I won't drop out!

I won't drop out, okay?

390
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,470
I was just saying.

391
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,590
Don't ever say that again!

392

But my dad didn't finish school, right?

That's why he's ended up like this!

Apart from seafaring,

402

he has no other skills.

His business is getting worse day by day,

but there is nothing he can do!

405
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,790
Look how much he's aged

00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,310
Don't move!

517
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,240
Don't move!

518
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,780
You should pay back the money you owe me.

519
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,070
If you don't give me the money today,

520
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,670
I'll crack your head with this!

521
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,330
Believe it or not!

522
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,030
What?

523
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:05,470
Go away!

524
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:05,940
Don't move!

525
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,990
Nobody moves!

526
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,740
Xie,

527
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,140
I dare you.

528
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,970
You were a bachelor.

529
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,090
You had nothing to worry about.

530
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,800
But now it's different.

531
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,430
You have a son and a wife.

532
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,440
Aren't you worried something might happen to them?

533
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,680
I dare you!

534
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,280
Your son, Xie Wanghe,

535
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,690
is in Class 3, Grade 3 of Honghuai No. 7 High School.

536
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:27,390
On weekends,

537
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,250
he often goes to the internet cafe on the side street.

538
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,110
How many Achilles tendons does he have for me to cut?

539
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,470
Stop!

540
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,830
Watch out!

541
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:58,560
Zhen!

542
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,230
Zhen!

543
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,140
Cut! Apply the blood!

544
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,580
Cut! Pass!

545
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,670
Clap the slate!

546
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,430
It's noon. It's time for lunch.

547
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,230
Then have lunch.

548
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,110
Time for lunch!

549
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,990
All departments, hurry up and have your lunch!

550
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,230
I lost my balance just now.

551
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,510
Can we do it again?

552
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,350
Director.

553
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,150
Director.

554
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:16,830
Director.

555
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,050
What's wrong with you?

556
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:26,910
You...

557
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,550
The payment has been delayed for a week.

558
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,910
What's wrong with you?

559
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,770
The money must be paid within the next few days.

560
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,260
I'm telling you. Bye.

561
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:36,730
Great Heroine,

562
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,970
you're about to wrap, right?

563
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,470
There are still two scenes tomorrow.

564
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,520
I booked a ticket to go back the day after tomorrow.

565
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,280
Why are you in such a hurry to go back?

566
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,000
A new drama is about to start filming in Beijing.

567
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,810
The second female lead

568
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,160
has over 300 scenes.

569
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,200
You should go audition for the role.

570
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,240
Forget it.

571
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,230
My son is about to take the college entrance exam.

572
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,950
They can't manage without me at home.

573
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,580
I've only been away for a few days.

574
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,310
My husband is about to go crazy.

575
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,130
Listen,

576
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,290
the male and female leads are both A-list stars.

577
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,620
The script is excellent.

578
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,940
The director is from Beijing Film Academy.

579
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,020
He's very talented.

580
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,020
You should seize this opportunity.

581
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,660
What drama did he direct before?

582
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,580
A lot.

583
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,890
I'll send you the information later.

584
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:14,790
How about this?

585
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,390
Call your husband and ask him about it first.

586
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,270
If he's okay with it,

587
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,510
I'll call them.

588
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,480
Then you go to Beijing for an audition as soon as possible.

589
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,230
Okay?

590
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,600
I need to take this call.

591
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,590
Hurry up and call your husband to ask him.

592
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,230
Go ahead.

593
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,010
What's wrong with you? You still want to delay it?

594
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,550
If you do that,

595
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,130
I'll tear up the contract.

596
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,380
Master, you have an incoming call.

597
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:43,970
From whom?

598
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:44,890
Madam.

599
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,050
Come on. You do it.

600
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,990
Make it thin.

601
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:49,830
Don't break it.

602
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,520
Got it.

603
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,190
Okay.

604
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,730
I'm wrapping up filming tomorrow.

605
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,250
So soon?

606
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,970
I just came to help Ai Linlin.

607
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,210
It's not a big role.

608
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,000
How's everything at home?

609
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,530
Everything's fine at home.

610
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,310
So you'll be back tomorrow then?

611
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:11,910
Right?

612
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,030
I need to go to Beijing.

613
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,540
What are you going to Beijing for?

614
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,760
I'm going for an audition.

615
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,590
The lead actor and actress in this show

616
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,890
are both A-list celebrities.

617
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,550
The script is pretty good too.

618
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,110
Hello?

619
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:31,650
Go on.

620
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,180
I'm just going to audition for a role.

621
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:34,710
The second female lead.

622
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,610
If I don't get it,

623
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,500
I'll come back as soon as possible.

624
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,970
What if you do get it?

625
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,780
If I get it, I'll play it, of course!

626
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,870
It has an all-star cast and is set to air on satellite TV channels.

627
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:43,950
It's bound to be a hit.

628
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:44,830
Luo Zhimei.

629
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,110
Time to climb the tree.

630
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,110
I have to go.

631
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,280
Okay, okay.

632
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,350
Go ahead, go ahead.

633
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,350
Give it a good try.

634
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:56,450
Luo Zhimei.

635
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:56,870
Hurry up.

636
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:57,890
Time to climb the tree. Hurry up.

637
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:58,650
Coming.

638
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,150
Hurry up.

639
00:22:59,150 --> 00:22:59,550
What are you doing?

640
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,680
Stop dawdling.

641
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,390
Director,

642
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,490
Luo Zhimei is here.

643
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,850
[Supo Town Cultural Museum]

644
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,810
Have you seen Curator?

645
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,610
He's setting up the exhibition.

646
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:14,470
Lower it.

647
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:14,870
Down. Down.

648
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:15,750
Gently, gently.

649
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,310
Easy.

650
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,150
Down.

651
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,430
A bit to the left.

652
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,640
Okay. No, too much!

653
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,770
Come back a little.

654
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,110
Good, good.

655
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,270
That's okay now.

656
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:23,910
Curator.

657
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,310
What is it?

658
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,180
Look,

659
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,310
I wasn't eliminated after the initial selection,

660
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,910
so why is my name

661
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,770
not on the final list?

662
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,970
This was all decided by the organization.

663
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,290
Don't overthink it.

664
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,100
Let me tell you,

665
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,180
our cultural museum

666
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,980
submitted two topics this time.

667
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,430
During the final review,

668
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,690
the judges felt that the value orientation of your topic

669
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:51,900
had some issues.

670
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,050
So, your topic didn't receive

671
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,200
a majority vote.

672
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,430
Value orientation?

673
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,510
What's wrong with the value orientation?

674
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,230
Just listen to your topic. It's ridiculous.

675
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,770
What's that about Su Xiaomei's shoe size?

676
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:03,990
Couldn't you research something else?

677
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,070
Why would you research Su Xiaomei's shoes?

678
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,930
Don't you find that distasteful?

679
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:11,110
Some people are even allowed to study the famous courtesans of Qinhuai,

680
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,630
but I can't study Su Xiaomei?

681
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,820
Let me tell you,

682
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,590
what Chen Bo studied was the history of Chinese folk music.

683
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,870
Su Xiaomei is just a starting point.

684
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,720
I'm actually studying the history of ancient customs.

685
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,980
To know what shoe size Su Xiaomei wore,

686
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:29,420
we need to study whether she had bound feet.

687
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,750
Regarding the issue of foot binding,

688
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,180
there are currently many theories.

689
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,830
The relatively authoritative one is that

690
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,150
it began in the Northern Song Dynasty, flourished in the Southern Song Dynasty,

691
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,650
and reached its peak during the Ming and Qing Dynasties.

692
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,930
About foot binding,

693
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,190
Su Shi held the correct attitude.

694
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,490
He wrote a poem saying,

695
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:49,840
"The delicate beauty is hard to describe; it must be seen in the palm."

696
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,220
But Su Xiaomei

697
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,360
had an outgoing and bold personality,

698
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,240
and a large frame.

699
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,830
Wait...

700
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,780
A large frame?

701
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,330
How did you know about that?

702
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,980
Su Shi once teased her,

703
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,210
"Before she steps out of the courtyard,

704
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,130
her forehead has already reached the main hall."

705
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,940
You see, if a girl like this

706
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,310
didn't want to bind her feet,

707
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,310
even Su Shi couldn't do anything about it.

708
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,110
Su Xiaomei

709
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,190
didn't bind her feet,

710
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,390
so her feet were

711
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,790
larger than those of ordinary women.

712
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,300
Therefore, I conclude that

713
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,030
she wore size 38 shoes,

714
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,220
or at least size 35.

715
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,520
These are all unofficial histories.

716
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,630
Whether Su Xiaomei even existed in history

717
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,050
is impossible to verify.

718
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,470
Sima Guang

719
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,790
recorded in the epitaph for Su Xun's wife,

720
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,320
"Her young daughter had her demeanor,

721
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,410
could compose essays, and at nineteen years old,

722
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,340
got married and then passed away."

723
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:42,060
That was about Shiniang, who married into the Cheng family.

724
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,230
It has nothing to do with Su Xiaomei.

725
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,610
Look, Mr. Shao,

726
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,750
as scholars,

727
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,950
we should make bold guesses but seek careful verification.

728
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:49,790
In my opinion,

729
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:51,610
you're only left with boldness.

730
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:55,500
Well, if you don't like me, so be it.

731
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,510
Can you tell me

732
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,830
who got the special grant this time?

733
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,470
Chen Bo.

734
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,220
Just as I expected.

735
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,890
It's exactly as I thought!

736
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:09,970
Let me tell you,

737
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,400
Chen Bo's research topic

738
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,610
is about the dialect changes in the Honghuai region,

739
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:15,010
and through these dialect changes,

740
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,120
examining the role of the Grand Canal

741
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,700
in our country's economic and cultural exchanges.

742
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,820
Well, his topic doesn't seem anything new, either.

743
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,370
It sounds so boring.

744
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,950
Well, why don't you come up with an interesting one

745
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,890
so that a publishing house would reach out to you?

746
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,020
A publishing house?

747
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:27,790
No, no, no.

748
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,520
Curator, wait a minute.

749
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,150
What do you mean by "a publishing house"?

750
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,310
A publishing house

751
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,030
was interested in Chen Bo's research topic.

752
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,550
They said his materials are substantial,

753
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,710
and the visual materials are also abundant.

754
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,870
They planned to publish his book.

755
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,370
Which publishing house is it?

756
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,320
It's from another province.

757
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,950
The contract is almost signed.

758
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,480
They say the first print run

759
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,640
will be 8,000 copies.

760
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,690
8,000?

761
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,770
[No smoking]

762
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:46,980
Him?

763
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,880
Is the publishing house crazy?

764
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,060
If you're so dissatisfied,

765
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,030
why don't you submit your work to a publishing house too?

766
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,350
Look, Mr. Shao,

767
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,330
we're both in the writing business.

768
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,430
Whether you're truly capable or not,

769
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,960
you've got to take the test.

770
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,830
You're back.

771
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,740
How was the meeting?

772
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,630
Not so good.

773
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,120
Congratulations.

774
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,810
Congratulations.

775
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,300
Are you talking to me?

776
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,320
What are you congratulating me for?

777
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,250
Aren't you going to publish a book?

778
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,630
It's just an intention.

779
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,090
It's far from certain.

780
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,970
How did the publishing house

781
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,220
reach out to you?

782
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,350
A schoolfellow of mine

783
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,700
works as an editor at the publishing house.

784
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,830
One day, he asked me,

785
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,990
"What are you up to these days?"

786
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,480
So, I sent him

787
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,360
my manuscript.

788
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,360
Unexpectedly,

789
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,160
they liked it at first sight.

790
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,350
For this kind of subject matter,

791
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,590
they'd do an initial print run of 8,000 copies?

792
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,310
Yeah.

793
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:00,570
I was worried.

794
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,810
The topic is too niche.

795
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,890
Not many people are interested in it.

796
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:06,910
Don't worry.

797
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,570
Isn't your wife there to help?

798
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,360
What does this have to do with my wife?

799
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,880
It's a book about canals.

800
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,690
The government can buy some as gifts.

801
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,710
It can sell no matter how many copies are printed.

802
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,940
Eight thousand is even too few.

803
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,290
It's not like they're spending their own money anyway.

804
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,270
Let me tell you,

805
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,150
my wife doesn't interfere with my affairs at all.

806
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,290
She can't be bothered.

807
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:35,020
She doesn't need to interfere with it.

808
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,630
As long as her subordinates have some sense,

809
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,820
they'll take care of it themselves.

810
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,060
The district chief,

811
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,910
although not a high-ranking official,

812
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:43,110
can still be useful at crucial moments.

813
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,360
Take

814
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,990
the special grant this time for example. Right?

815
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,130
Shao,

816
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,920
make it clear.

817
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:57,250
What does the project grant have to do with my wife?

818
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,690
Whether there's a connection or not,

819
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,460
don't you know in your heart?

820
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:04,750
No, no, no.

821
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,670
I don't know.

822
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,550
This needs to be clarified.

823
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,030
Help!

824
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:07,870
With my wife...

825
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:08,870
Help!

826
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:09,800
-Why are you yelling for help?
-He's hitting me!

827
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,870
Explain clearly!

828
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:11,950
Can you explain clearly or not?

829
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:12,910
What's going on here?

830
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:13,910
What's happening?

831
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,030
Is that how you talk to people?

832
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,050
Let go!

833
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:16,880
You tell him

834
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,200
about the project grant,

835
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,460
did my wife interfere or not?

836
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,620
You know well whether she interfered or not.

837
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,200
Let me tell you,

838
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,950
stop acting all upright every day.

839
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,020
Be careful, or I'll report you and that wife of yours

840
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,250
for abusing your power for personal gain

841
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,780
and suppressing your colleagues.

842
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,720
Curator, he's…

843
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,290
Stop right there!

844
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,410
I said stop!

845
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:31,900
Stop!

846
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,560
Come back here!

847
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,290
Did you hear how he was talking?

848
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,050
You're an educated person,

849
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,060
but you were fighting here.

850
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:37,510
Aren't you ashamed?

851
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,810
He threatened to report me. Did you hear that?

852
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,190
What's he reporting you for?

853
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,110
Sit down.

854
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,350
Calm down, calm down.

855
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:43,880
Come on.

856
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,350
Don't bother with people like that.

857
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,310
Just calm down.

858

Drink less.

861
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,350
Drinking too much is bad for your liver.

862
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,450
Drinking harms the liver,

863
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,470
but if I don't drink, my heart hurts.

864
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,520
Isn't it just a project grant?

865
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:10,760
Is it really worth getting so upset over a few thousand yuan?

866
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,430
It's not about the money at all.

867
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,950
This is about dignity!

868
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:18,130
You wouldn't understand even if I explained it to you.

869
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,120
We're both writers.

870

Why does he get the project grant?

871
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,300
Isn't it just because he has a well-connected wife?

The head of a district.

She dares to abuse power for personal gain

875
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,800
and seek benefits for her family members.

876
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,930
Doesn't she fear divine retribution?

877
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,230
You shouldn't say such things carelessly.

878
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,780
Mind your words to accumulate virtue.

879
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,790
They don't even accumulate virtue.

880
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,790
Why should I be the one to watch my words?

881
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,070
Do you know how much effort

882
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,750
I've poured into the topic of Su Xiaomei?

883

Do you know how many trips I made to the library?

884
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,860
To put it bluntly,

885
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,230
even if I don't deserve credit,

886
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,950
I should at least get credit for my hard work, right?

887
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,060
Yes.

888
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,840
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

889
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,660
If it hurts, then stop talking so much.

890
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,460
It's not such a big deal.

891
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:02,960
It's not a big deal?

892
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,720
Isn't this a big deal?

893
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,680
What would you call a big deal then?

894
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:07,830
Abusing power for personal gain.

895
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,960
Swindling and plundering.

Adults are talking. Why are you butting in, kid?

Shut up!

902

Why are you yelling at him?

904

He didn't say anything wrong.

And you're a graduate of a prestigious school.

You're as petty as…

907

I'm petty?

908
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,720
I'm petty?

909
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,200
I can't even criticize him now. Is that it?

910
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,570
Alright, alright.

911

00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,260
My mom's back is injured.

1028
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,460
It's all bruised now.

1029
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,860
I don't know if she can even walk tomorrow.

1030
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,090
Sometimes I really want to...

1031
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,570
Don't do anything rash.

1032
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,220
No matter what, he's still your father.

1033
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,650
You know what?

1034
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,930
In this regard,

1035
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,550
my dad is a model example.

1036
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,370
Listen.

1037
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:44,110
No matter how badly he's beaten,

1038
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,520
he never fights back.

1039
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,170
When will this kind of life end?

1040
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:56,140
If today is unbearable,

1041
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,970
just think about tomorrow.

1042
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,290
In a few years,

1043
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,880
when we've all made it,

1044
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,540
earning millions a year,

1045
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:04,750
by then,

1046
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,450
every family will have bought a new house.

1047
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:07,890
At that time, when our parents gather every day,

1048
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:10,000
they'll just play mahjong and chat about their kids.

1049
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,800
Our biggest worry then

1050
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,100
won't be making money,

1051
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,990
but our parents being extremely bored

1052
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,220
and hence

1053
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,360
pressuring us to get married.

1054
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,580
Just imagine that life.

1055
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,190
I'm telling you,

1056
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,430
Siyi definitely won't be pressured to marry.

1057
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:27,230
She'll definitely marry early.

1058
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:27,940
Why?

1059
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:29,840
She's beautiful and smart,

1060
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:30,810
and sensible too.

1061
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:31,990
By then, she'll get into a good university.

1062
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:33,160
I bet she'll be

1063
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,670
snatched up before she even graduates.

1064
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,260
That's how it was with my parents.

1065
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:36,900
My mom

1066
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,120
graduated from the Opera Academy,

1067
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,850
specializing in qingyi roles.

1068
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,320
The first time she performed on stage,

1069
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,600
my dad spotted her.

1070
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,760
At first, she really looked down on my dad.

1071
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,760
But you know what?

1072
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,140
On their first date,

1073
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,380
my dad cooked a meal for my mom.

1074
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,100
He won her over just like that.

1075
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,030
Hello?

1076
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:24,930
Linlin,

1077
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,720
I watched that TV series.

1078
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,250
It was so well made.

1079
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,240
It was okay, right?

1080
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,410
Not just okay.

1081
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,690
It was excellent!

1082
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,750
It didn't feel like a TV series,

1083
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:33,950
but more like a movie.

1084
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,840
That play you mentioned before—

1085
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,370
can I still audition for it?

1086
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,530
Of course you can.

1087
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,870
Then please help me get in touch with them quickly.

1088
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:41,900
As soon as I finish shooting tomorrow,

1089
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,050
I'll head to Beijing right away.

1090
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,370
Wait, has your husband agreed?

1091
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:45,840
For such a great director,

1092
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,330
I have to give it a shot no matter what.

1093
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,310
Don't you think so?

1094
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,660
Alright, I'll ask about it.

1095
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,760
Okay, okay.

1096
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,470
I'll wait for your news then.

1097
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,260
And about the Liu family…

1098
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,710
Dad, you're back.

1099
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,160
Dad.

1100
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,510
Have you been drinking?

1101
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,420
I just had a little.

1102
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:01,210
With whom?

1103
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,540
Just by myself.

1104
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:05,700
Well...

1105
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,280
I'm going to my room.

1106
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,510
It's not like Zhimei isn't coming back.

1107
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:14,680
Dad,

1108
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,270
she

1109
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,420
only comes home a few days a year.

1110
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:22,210
What's the difference between that and not coming back at all?

1111
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,140
She's contributing to the family.

1112
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,830
You call that a contribution?

1113
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,470
Her contribution should be

1114
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:30,880
taking care of this home for me.

1115
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,040
She should be looking after Haikuo.

1116
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:36,140
He's already in his final year of high school.

1117
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,960
What are you waiting for?

1118
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,270
Go study now.

1119
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,040
Go take a shower quickly.

1120
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,300
I really didn't lie to you.

1121
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,040
I really went to collect the debt

1122
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,910
from Crippled Sun.

1123
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,880
That thick-skinned brute refused to pay me.

1124
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,500
He tried to pawn things off to settle the debt,

1125
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,110
stuffing anything he grabbed into my pockets.

1126
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:09,840
I gave back everything to him,

1127
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:13,530
but I didn't notice it because it was too small.

1128
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,590
Don't be mad anymore, okay?

1129
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,590
Alright?

1130
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,230
That money—

1131
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,950
we won't get it back forever, right?

1132
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:23,720
Well,

1133
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:24,950
that's not possible.

1134
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,520
I must get it back from him.

1135
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,570
What can you do?

1136
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,670
If he doesn't pay me back by the end of the month,

1137
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,200
I'll fight him to the death.

1138
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,080
Don't do anything reckless, you hear me?

1139
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,800
Money is not important.

1140
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,030
You can't get into trouble.

1141
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:40,810
If something happens to you,

1142
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:41,890
what will our son and I do?

1143
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:42,870
Do you understand?

1144
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:43,600
Don't worry.

1145
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,500
Rest assured.

1146
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:47,870
I won't do anything illegal, I promise.

1147
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,390
Just now,

1148
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,270
did I hurt you?

1149
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,420
What do you think?

1150
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,170
Have you practiced the Nine Yin White Bone Claw?

1151
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,230
You scratched, pinched, and clawed.

1152
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,590
I was just feeling anxious.

1153
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,290
We haven't had any income for months.

1154
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:15,190
We still owe several families their dividends.

1155
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,410
I'm too embarrassed to face them.

1156
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,360
You know,

1157
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,980
if it were just our own business,

1158
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,920
even if we lose money,

1159
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,980
I could accept that.

1160
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,180
At worst, we'll just

1161
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,250
spend less.

1162
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,790
We'd get through it somehow.

1163
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:30,320
But I'm afraid of letting down our neighbors.

1164
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:33,930
The other families are fine,

1165
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,380
but considering Granny Ma's situation...

1166
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,990
I feel guilty.

1167
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:44,090
I'm really sorry.

1168
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,480
We should blame that Crippled Sun.

1169
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,940
He drives a Mercedes to the nightclub,

1170
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,770
blowing thousands in one night,

1171
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,560
but he doesn't pay back the money he owes.

1172
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,370
What kind of person is that?

1173
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,590
You're smart enough.

1174
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:43,920
Why are you here?

1175
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:46,840
I saw you leaving home earlier, and you seemed upset.

1176
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,190
I was worried something might happen to you,

1177
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,710
so I followed you all the way here.

1178
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,570
What could possibly happen to me?

1179
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:55,690
Let's go.

1180
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,630
What are you hissing at? Come with me!
