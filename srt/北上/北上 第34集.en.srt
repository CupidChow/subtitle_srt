[Episode 34]

3
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,560
Mr. Xie.

4
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,150
Well,

5
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,590
w-we saw what happened next

6
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,930
on the news.

7
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,960
The accident was not all your fault.

8
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,750
Tianming is gone,

9
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,680
leaving us orphaned and widowed.

10
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,600
I really had no choice.

11
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,160
but to contact the media.

12
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,829
I never thought it would make you lose your job

13
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,960
and get a barrage of criticism.

14
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,740
Forget about it.

15
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,800
Take care of yourselves from now on.

16
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,360
If you run into any difficulties, feel free to come to me.

17
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,820
I'll do my best to help you.

18
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,790
Well...

19
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,070
Bee has sent someone to meet us,

20
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,829
saying they'd help us pay off the mortgage.

21
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,800
So please take this card back.

22
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,430
No... That's what they should do.

23
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,050
I wanted to make amends.

24
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,720
Just keep it.

25
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,820
You'll need it for the children's future education.

26
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,400
Who committed the crime should pay the price.

27
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,690
I can't bear to take your card.

28
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,260
Fenghua has left.

29
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,180
We have to move too.

30
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,310
Do you know why she left?

31
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,410
Wasn't she just doing well?

32
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,640
You'll have to ask her about that.

33
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,760
She handed over her work

34
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,560
and satisfied everyone.

35
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,470
But she didn't

36
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,320
say a word about her feelings.

37
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,010
Honestly, we all felt quite frustrated.

38
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,510
After the meeting,

39
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,870
she left right away even before we

40
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,200
said goodbye properly.

41
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,930
We're still

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,360
reeling from it now.

43
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,460
There's one more thing.

44
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,890
P-Please don't get mad at me

45
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,970
after you hear it.

46
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,470
Go ahead.

47
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,829
Fenghua probably sold the parcel delivery station

48
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,910
because of me.

49
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,470
Why?

50
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,640
Someone once came to meet me.

51
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,440
They wanted me to mess with Bee

52
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,190
and ruin their reputation.

53
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,170
They also gave me 300,000 yuan.

54
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,600
After Fenghua found it out,

55
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,900
she asked me to return it, but I refused.

56
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,660
Then she gave me 300,000 yuan herself

57
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,089
and told me to keep it secret from everyone.

58
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,780
Not until she sold the parcel delivery station

59
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,260
did I realize that she was running out of money.

60
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,720
I'm sorry, Mr. Xie.

61
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,360
Tumor?

62
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,659
I guess

63
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,409
she's been sick for quite a while

64
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,020
and arranging the affairs before death.

65
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,159
She even transferred her parcel delivery station.

66
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,070
I knew she was feeling under the weather.

67
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,690
She told me it was anemia, and I believed her.

68
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,150
How could I be so dumb?

69
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Well...

70
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,830
Should we go back too?

71
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,310
I need to

72
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,380
finish He's funeral arrangements first.

73
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,330
I gotta ensure they receive the compensation.

74
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,340
Otherwise,

75
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,920
Fenghua would also be worried.

76
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,920
Then I'll go back first.

77
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,590
Anyway, I also feel pretty exhausted lately,

78
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,060
not in the mood for job hunting.

79
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,570
You wanted to go back

80
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,570
a long time ago, didn't you?

81
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,320
All of you

82
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,840
are deserters,

83
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,190
leaving me here alone.

84
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,460
Aren't you tired?

85
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,130
Yes, I am.

86
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,110
I'm dead tired.

87
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,640
But I don't want to lose.

88
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,220
We should get back up

89
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,910
from wherever we fell.

90
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,760
Fine.

91
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,810
Take your time getting back up.

92
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,410
I'm out of this.

93
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,990
Let's not tell anyone

94
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,010
about Fenghua's situation for now.

95
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,570
Go back and check on her condition.

96
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,920
If it's not good,

97
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,409
I'll head back immediately.

98
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:38,870
I'll force her to come to Beijing for treatment no matter what.

99
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,960
Have you decided what to do?

100
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:10,250
Not yet.

101
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,060
You plan to keep idling about, right?

102
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,490
Please don't worry,

103
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,680
I can't stay at home for long.

104
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,740
Or I'll suffocate.

105
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,470
Why don't you learn a trade?

106
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,190
Learn what?

107
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,100
Carpentry

108
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,740
or tailoring, anything will do.

109
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,200
Just have a skill to rely on

110
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,010
and live off, at least.

111
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,710
It's better than just messing around in society, right?

112
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,039
I can go work as a construction laborer.

113
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,230
You don't have the strength for that.

114
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,230
You could learn to be a mason.

115
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,510
It's said skilled ones can earn quite a bit in a day.

116
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,200
Or you could ask Wanghe's father

117
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,460
to teach you how to drive. That works too.

118
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,010
I'm full.

119
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
Enjoy your meal.

120
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,270
You're full too?

121
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,320
Take care.

122
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,490
Goodbye, Mr. Zhou.

123
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,470
Your dishes taste so good.

124
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,460
Xingchi.

125
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:38,400
[By the Canal]

126
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,470
Mr. Zhou.

127
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,550
Have you eaten yet?

128
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,120
Yep.

129
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,320
Want some plain noodles.

130
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,240
Come on.

131
00:09:58,890 --> 00:09:59,620
Here you are.

132
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,320
Be careful, it's hot.

133
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,520
It's okay. I got this.

134
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,760
No hurry.

135
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,760
It's hot.

136
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,240
I often cooked for myself in Beijing too.

137
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:22,180
But the noodles I made were nowhere near as good as yours.

138
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,600
I always felt

139
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,070
there was a difference.

140
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,030
Of course there was a difference!

141
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,550
Listen.

142
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,330
These noodles may look plain,

143
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,450
but it's all about the details, you know?

144
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,880
How to make the lard,

145
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,180
how to cook the broth,

146
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,550
how to fry the shrimp roe,

147
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,420
and also what brand and what type of soy sauce to use,

148
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,910
there are knacks for them.

149
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:42,980
What knacks?

150
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,100
Do you think I can tell you?

151
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,340
It's a secret, a secret recipe. Understand?

152
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,490
I haven't even told Haikuo.

153
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,550
Haikuo doesn't even like plain noodles.

154
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,960
There were several times in Beijing

155
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,490
when we said we wanted to eat Huaiyang cuisine.

156
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,750
Haikuo refused, saying he was so over it.

157
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,440
Actually, we all felt

158
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,650
homesick

159
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,730
in Beijing,

160
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,030
but Haikuo didn't seem to feel the same

161
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,330
except for that one time.

162
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,180
At that time,

163
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,470
Haikuo was mistreated at work.

164
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,700
He drank all night...

165
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,990
I want to go home!

166
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,670
Be careful...

167
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,350
Don't fall.

168
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,670
I want to go home!

169
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,320
Go home... We're just going home now.

170
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,790
I'm gonna swim back to the Flower Street!

171
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,200
It's dangerous!

172
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,080
Are you crazy?

173
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,200
Come down...

174
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,270
It's a deep river!

175
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,550
Don't mess around!

176
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,440
Are you nuts?

177
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,200
In Beijing,

178
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,100
I'm just like grass.

179
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,070
Go home!

180
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,810
I'm going back to my father.

181
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,910
Even if I fail, he still treats me like a treasure.

182
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,170
Who compared you to grass?

183
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,520
I'll go fight him.

184
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,560
I'm hungry.

185
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,400
I want to eat the plain noodles my dad makes.

186
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,800
I'm useless.

187
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,670
I couldn't hold out in Beijing anymore,

188
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,000
so I ran back home first.

189
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:07,140
But I think Haikuo will also come back one day.

190
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:09,570
Why?

191
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,900
Wanghe is like a shark.

192
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,150
He thrives in big cities.

193
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,620
Haikuo and I are like freshwater fish.

194
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,420
Only on the Flower Street, by the canal,

195
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,910
do we feel like ourselves.

196
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,010
Enjoy the noodles.

197
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,260
I think

198
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,630
you should feel lucky.

199
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:38,850
Lucky about what?

200
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,610
For such a materialistic girl,

201
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:45,000
breaking up early is much better than getting married and then divorcing.

202
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,150
The last time she came to meet me,

203
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,860
I just didn't like her.

204
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:55,010
But you were still in a relationship,

205
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,810
so I didn't feel it was my place to say it.

206
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,170
You're my mother.

207
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,860
My real mother.

208
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:05,100
You didn't even tell me when you thought I had chosen the wrong girlfriend.

209
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:09,110
Whether two people are suitable for each other can only be told by themselves.

210
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,840
Other people's opinions don't matter that much.

211
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,480
So,

212
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,060
when you find someone suitable again,

213
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,570
you won't ask for my opinion either, right?

214
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,800
What do you mean?

215
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,230
After all these years,

216
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,920
h-haven't you found someone suitable?

217
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,380
Dad has never dated anyone.

218
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,550
When others tried to set him up,

219
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,120
he refused to meet anyone.

220
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,790
So what?

221
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,670
Your dad is more devoted than me.

222
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,870
Should I give him an award or something?

223
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,690
I know you're feeling down because of your breakup.

224
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:54,450
I understand, but don't take it out on me.

225
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,340
That's not what adults should do.

226
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,490
Though Xiaohui said it was because of the house

227
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,420
that she broke up with me,

228
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,900
I feel like

229
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,570
it's not just about the house.

230
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,720
Are you trying to say

231
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,480
that because of your dad and me,

232
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,670
you have been traumatized

233
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,470
and therefore

234
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,040
can't start an intimate relationship?

235
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,560
Is that it?

236
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,580
What do you think?

237
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,440
I admit

238
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,590
that you're feeling unhappy now

239
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,650
partly because of your dad and me.

240
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,320
But who says

241
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,780
people must live in perfect harmony?

242
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,640
Can't there be other choices?

243
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,060
And who says

244
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,510
women can only stay at home to support their husbands, raise children,

245
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,630
and stick to old clichés

246
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,660
for their whole lives?

247
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,800
I feel bad for you,

248
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,250
and I understand what you've been through.

249
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,980
However,

250
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,030
I'm so sorry.

251
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,080
Because I have never

252
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,790
regretted my choices.

253
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,940
In fact, I'm even proud of myself.

254
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,690
I sincerely hope you can be like me,

255
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,500
not caring about anyone's opinions

256
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,360
and living for yourself bravely.

257
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:21,230
One day when you understand what I just said,

258
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,960
I believe you'll applaud yourself.

259
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:28,740
Mom,

260
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,430
I'm not as mature as you think.

261
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,950
All these years, you've been chasing your dreams,

262
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,120
and we could only support you.

263
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,130
But have you ever considered our feelings?

264
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,750
Actually, I'm quite envious of others.

265
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,010
In our neighborhood,

266
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,380
other families all live in harmony,

267
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,150
But our family

268
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,370
has always been missing one member.

269
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,830
I don't even dare to mention you to Wanghe and others

270
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,200
because I'm afraid

271
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,740
it'll occur to them

272
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,450
that I have a mom.

273
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:17,540
You've never told me any of this before.

274
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,200
Why didn't you tell me?

275
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,200
You're my mom.

276
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,210
I should

277
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,660
do my best to fulfill my duty as a son,

278
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,460
trying not to cause you any trouble or stress you out.

279
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:34,740
But Mom,

280
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,730
I also hope

281
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,020
you can fulfill your duty as a mother,

282
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,570
and, like other moms,

283
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,320
remember that you have a son now and then.

284
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:58,510
But it seems like

285
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,140
you barely remember the existence

286
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,800
of the person named Zhou Haikuo.

287
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,440
It's just that I'm too busy.

288
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,589
All these years on set,

289
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:10,339
I've been too swamped even without time to sleep properly.

290
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:11,470
Y-You know that.

291
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,430
How long does it take you to reply to a WeChat message?

292
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,550
I know you're busy,

293
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,369
too busy to say thank you after receiving the flowers

294
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,010
I sent you on Mother's Day.

295
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,420
My dad,

296
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,370
he's a man of few words

297
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,400
who barely says anything nice.

298
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,990
But when he knew I had a fever in Beijing,

299
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,600
he came here overnight without hesitation

300
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,680
and didn't leave until my fever broke.

301
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:47,530
Mom,

302
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,790
I came to meet you

303
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,130
after breaking up with my girlfriend

304
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,790
not for some lecture.

305
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,510
Even if you don't say a word,

306
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,090
a hug from you

307
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,510
would be enough.

308
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,530
You know what?

309
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,370
All I need now

310
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,300
is just a mom.

311
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:04,940
[By the Canal]

312
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,640
Mr. Shao.

313
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,550
What's with that face?

314
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,980
Haven't you seen a beautiful woman before?

315
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,450
Where are the two of them?

316
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:18,970
In Beijing.

317
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,310
I came back alone this time.

318
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,640
So, you will...

319
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,900
I will not leave again.

320
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,250
Really?

321
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,380
Can't I also be a deserter

322
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,270
like you?

323
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,870
Yes, you can!

324
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,620
Welcome home!

325
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,360
Let me help you with that.

326
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,210
It's so good to be back.

327
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,700
I can smell the familiar aroma of food every day again.

328
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,530
Did you tell Wanghe about your return?

329
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,770
Nope.

330
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,400
If I told him, he definitely wouldn't let me return.

331
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,840
I snuck back myself.

332
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,430
That incident of his is over now, right?

333
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,830
He did lose his job.

334
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,070
But he can rest for a while.

335
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,320
Given his amazing capabilities,

336
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,580
as long as he keeps his spirits up,

337
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,450
he can make a comeback anytime.

338
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,000
The company made him a scapegoat in public.

339
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,530
I'm just worried about his mental state.

340
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:42,950
He'll be fine.

341
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,720
That guy is really tough.

342
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,740
I believe

343
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,810
no setback in this world can take him down.

344
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,940
He's been faking it.

345
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,000
If I get into trouble like this, I'll surely break down.

346
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,000
He can't sit idle.

347
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,420
What about you? Have you decided what to do?

348
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,320
Not yet.

349
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,190
Why not come work with me?

350
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,090
That would be a shame! No way.

351
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,800
What do you mean? Are you discriminating against women?

352
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,520
How am I any worse than Wanghe?

353
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,120
I'm just reluctant to work for you.

354
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:20,880
It would turn our relationship into a boss-employee one.

355
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,670
I'm hungry.

356
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,990
Make me something to eat.

357
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,190
What would you like to eat?

358
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,060
Eel noodles, braised shredded tofu,

359
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,910
lion's head meatballs, sweet and sour spare ribs.

360
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:40,760
Okay.

361
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:45,150
I'll make you all these dishes. But I'll hit you if you can't finish them.

362
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,490
How about

363
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,420
we go to Beijing?

364
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,370
Why?

365
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,860
Our son's in such big trouble.

366
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,560
I'm afraid he can't pull through.

367
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,560
Well,

368
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,310
if he really did that,

369
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,840
he deserves to be sacked.

370
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,690
If he's been wrongly accused,

371
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,700
it's good to leave that kind of company anyway.

372
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,490
I'm just worried about our son's feelings.

373
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,160
Everyone will suffer

374
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,770
more or less in life.

375
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:52,560
Taking a fall like this at his age is actually a blessing.

376
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,680
He's still got the strength to get back up.

377
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,420
Anyway, I have confidence in our son.

378
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,180
Alright...

379
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,050
Stop overthinking it. It's time to sleep.

380
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,400
Look at this Xie's face.

381
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,040
You can tell he's not a good guy at first glance.

382
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,480
I dug into Xie's info.

383
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,480
Seems like he's been in jail before.

384
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,070
He's obviously been made a scapegoat.

385
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,070
You don't believe this?

386
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,400
Bee Group paid a high price

387
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,200
to get Xie to take the blame.

388
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,490
How could someone like this become an executive at Bee Group?

389
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,880
He'll end up back in jail sooner or later.

390
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,280
People like him will do anything for money.

391
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,010
As a delivery rider, seeing this kind of news,

392
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,590
I can't help but feel scared.

393
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,640
Yet here I am,

394
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,170
still on the way to deliver.

395
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,910
The victim is gone.

396
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:59,680
To prevent such tragedies from happening again,

397
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,190
I, on behalf of myself,

398
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,890
hereby make the following proposals

399
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,780
to online food delivery platforms

400
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:07,030
represented by Bee for their future planning

401
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,470
and development.

402
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,420
First, optimize the system

403
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,610
to allow for flexible time.

404
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,160
In cases of bad weather,

405
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,350
accidents, or other special circumstances,

406
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,040
delivery riders can get special treatment

407
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,900
with their ratings and incomes not being affected.

408
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,530
Second, ensure safety.

409
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,490
For office buildings, hospitals, and other places with difficult access

410
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:27,960
and navigation issues,

411
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,460
try to set up smart food pickup lockers.

412
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,530
Third, provide humanitarian care.

413
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:35,170
Offer insurance and medical assistance to delivery riders,

414
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,480
and when necessary, provide educational support

415
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,890
for their family members.

416
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,610
Last but not least, I hope

417
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
Bee and all food delivery companies

418
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,300
can take this incident

419
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,050
as a serious lesson

420
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,920

Mr. Meng.

451
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:33,110
Your PR approach this time is worth learning from.

452
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,870
The more open you are to criticism,

453
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,670
the more you can win people over.

454
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:39,620
I hope

455
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:43,660
such incidents won't happen again in the future.

456
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,020
No way.

457
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,200
Traffic accidents are unavoidable.

458
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,110
No one knows when an accident will occur.

459
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,800
Then we must stay on our toes.

460
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,790
Before the next accident happens,

461
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,380
we need to consider all possibilities

462
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,710
and prepare relevant contingency plans.

463
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,450
Well written.

464
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,530
In the past few days, our legal department and law firm

465
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,850
have also been working on a set of plans,

466
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:21,450
regulating official compensation

467
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,740
and pension payments,

468
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,170
Moreover,

469
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,540
there will be a training program.

470
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,680
All delivery riders, before they officially hit the road,

471
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,920
must pass a traffic safety test.

472
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,360
Otherwise, they won't be assigned orders.

473
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,130
Setting rules alone is not enough.

474
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,990
You also need your people

475
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,610
to implement them strictly.

476
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,180
Let me do it.

477
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,380
No, thanks.

478
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,330
Are you sure these items

479
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,290
are all your personal belongings?

480
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:10,890
You're leaving the company.

481
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,090

As a veteran of the company,

494
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,110
it was my job and duty

495
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,700
to clean up the company

496
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:04,050

497

in person.

498

00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:12,450
take care.

500
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,880

What are you looking at?

502
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,930
Didn't we get through this?

503
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,550
Bro,

504
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,100
are you really

505
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,750

506
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,790

00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,880
you'll surely suffer from it later.

509
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,140
If he continues to work in this industry,

510
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,820
I'll never

511
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,160
feel at ease.

512
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,930
Do you know where his weak spot is?

513
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,340
Hello, Mr. Xie.

514
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,280
I'm Jiang Ping from Yuntu.

515
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:15,830
Hello.

516
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,540
Hello.

517
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,110
Please have a sit.

518
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:17,640
Thanks.

519
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,840
This is my business card.

520
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:30,720
Sorry,

521
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,360
I know you haven't been in a good mood lately.

522
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,270
I once planned

523
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,850
to reach out after a while,

524
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,620
yet I was worried that other companies

525
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,220
might approach you and give you an offer first.

526
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,540
Given what happened to me,

527
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,740
who would be so crazy to give me an offer?

528
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,880
Others may not know,

529
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,830
but we've been keeping a close eye

530
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,290
on your every move at Bee.

531
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:52,810
In Haidian,

532
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,470
in such a short time

533
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,280
and under such adverse conditions,

534
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,740
you've been crushing our Yuntu in business.

535
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:01,750
It's literally a business miracle.

536
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:03,750
Let's skip the flattery

537
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:04,990
and just get to the point.

538
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,320
What do you want from me?

539
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,070
Well, I'm here

540
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:10,810
with you

541
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,770
to sincerely invite you to join us.

542
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:15,780
Actually,

543
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,130
given your personality,

544
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:19,110
you fit in way better with our Yuntu.

545
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:19,720
Why?

546
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,170
A wolf travels a thousand miles for meat;

547
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,600
a dog does the same for shit.

548
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,640
You're a wolf.

549
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:28,520
There's no need for you to lead a flock of dogs to eat leftovers, right?

550
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,110
You're overpraising me.

551
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,320
I'm just a defeated man.

552
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,680
Honestly,

553
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,150
everyone in this industry knows

554
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,270
that this time,

555
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,850
you're taking the fall for the company.

556
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:42,840
But we didn't expect

557
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,790
Meng to go this far,

558
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,820
not even leaving you a way out.

559
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:48,400
This kind of thing

560
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,450
would never happen

561
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,070
in our Yuntu.

562
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,300
We value talent

563
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,060
way more than

564
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,140
you could imagine.

565
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,290
Here are

566
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,430
[Employment Contract]

567
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,780
the terms we're offering you.

568
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,840
Please take a look.

569
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,280
[Payment] [Party B's annual salary is set at 1,500,000 yuan.]

570
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,170
These terms are too tempting.

571
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,200
I'm kind of in shock.

572
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,270
You're worth it.

573
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,180
See if you have any other questions.

574
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,860
I just want to know

575
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,410
who's the mole in Bee.

576
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,770
Mole?

577
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,520
What do you mean?

578
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,450
Over the past six months,

579
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,020
every time we launched a campaign,

580
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,160
Yuntu always managed to find a way to fight it.

581
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,090
There were several times

582
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,320
when you launched

583
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,920
countermeasures even before we made a move.

584
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,410
Once or twice, fine.

585
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:03,180
But every single time?

586
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,830
That's unusual, right?

587
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,110
Perhaps,

588
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,440
great minds think alike.

589
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,080
Fine.

590
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,930
Hope I'm just being paranoid.

591
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:19,580
But before I get to the bottom of this case,

592
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,340
I won't join Yuntu.

593
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,830
Otherwise, I'd become the mole,

594
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:26,550
and it would be impossible to explain it.

595
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,120
It's not that serious.

596
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,570
There aren't so many moles!

597
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,260
You've just watched too many Hong Kong movies, I guess.

598
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,350
Mr. Jiang,

599
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,520
I even suspect

600
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,340
that my misfortune this time

601
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:48,790
was just orchestrated by this mole.

602
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,200
Take your time.

603
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,050
I gotta go to attend to something.

604
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,250
Take care, Mr. Jiang.

605
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,540
Check, please.

606
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,800
Come in.

607
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,360
Mr. Meng, Mr. Song is here.

608
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,230
Welcome.

609
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,100
Have a seat.

610
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,710
We've finally managed to get through this.

611
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,920
Next time,

612
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,670
don't let those youngsters mess around again.

613
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,920
We all know what was going on with Wanghe.

614
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:48,920
To be honest,

615
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,510
it also brought me great pain

616
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,449
to sacrifice him this time.

617
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,260
Fortunately, he didn't make a fuss about it.

618
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,490
Before leaving,

619
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,610
[Business Strategy Plan]

620
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,190
he wrote me a report.

621
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,920
It includes

622
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,300
strategic plans and marketing ideas for the next few years.

623
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,160
Everything is clearly organized.

624
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,520

625
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,750
we strictly follow this plan,

626
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,280
defeating Yuntu

627
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,630
is just a matter of time.

628
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:16,720
Have someone make copies of it.

629
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,520
You gotta get the hang of it soon.

630
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,320
Okay.

631
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,620
Song,

632
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,250
keep this a secret.

633
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,160
Don't worry.

634
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:48,990
[Chairman's Office]

00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,150

636
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,670
Mr. Jiang.

00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,450
Mr. Jiang!

It's fine.

I'm Qiu Lin.

Mr. Jiang,

643
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:14,820
I've heard a lot about you.

00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,570
Hello.

00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,510

00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,970
Please take the main seat.

Let me help you.

Okay.

653
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:29,980
And don't contact me again.

00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,100
Why?

655
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,880
Today,

656
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,140
I met Xie Wanghe.

657
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,420
He said Meng Wei

658
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,160
has already resorted

659
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,660
to an economic investigation of the mole.

660
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,880
Is that true?

661
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,280
No way.

662
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,420
If this were true,

663
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,680
Meng would've told me about it.

664
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,680
If he's not telling you,

665
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,480
it means he's already starting to suspect you.

666
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,810
You need to do a quick check yourself.

667
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:58,830
Clear out

668
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,440
all those clues

669
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,190
as soon as possible.

670
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,590
Don't worry.

671
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,120
I'll nail it.

672
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,740
Besides,

673
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,360
we only emailed each other.

674
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,290
Oh, right.

675
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,420
Have you deleted all the emails

676
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,710
I sent you before?

677
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,030
Of course.

678
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,710
If there's any urgent matter,

679
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:16,800
let's talk face to face.

680
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,990
Remember,

681
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:19,810
any electronic message

682
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,520
will leave a trace.

683
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,140
Understood.

684
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,780
Then is the paper file okay?

685
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,980
[Business Strategy Plan]

686
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,150
This is Bee's

687
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,570
future strategic plan.

688
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,280
Meng attaches great importance to it.

689
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:52,120
Mr. Jiang, please take a look in person.

690
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,150
Mr. Jiang!

691
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,400
Wish us

692
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,900
successful cooperation!

693
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:08,370
Come on.

694
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,000
Come on.

695
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,760
Mr. Jiang.

696
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,100
What are you doing?

697
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:14,850
Who are you?

698
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:15,630
What are you doing?

699
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:16,660
Stop shooting!

700
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:17,400
What are you doing?

701
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,110
Stop shooting! Get out!

702
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:18,760
Stop it!

703
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,800
Meng?

704
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,060
Don't move!

705
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,670
Hey!

706
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,220
Sit tight! Don't move.

707
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,250
Stop shooting!

708
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,310
Don't move!

709
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:29,800
Stand straight.

710
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,440
Well...

711
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:32,730
What's this all about, Meng?

712
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,310
What do you mean?

713
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,060
In view of your seniority, I tolerated your past greed

714
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,060
and didn't take action against you.

715
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,790
But given what you've done today...

716
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,060
Spit it out.

717
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:45,150
How can I explain this to the board?

718
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,820
I said, stop shooting!

719
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,200
Don't you understand?

720
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,520
Stop it!

721
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,660
Have you watched too many Hong Kong movies?

722
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,690
You were right.

723
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,860
As soon as Song heard about the strategic plan,

724
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,650
he would take action.

725
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,590
But I'm curious.

726
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,010
How did you know

727
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:16,780
Song would meet Jiang Ping there?

728
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,710
To catch the mole,

729
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:21,730
I bought a membership card at that restaurant.

730
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:24,320
Directors and above only need to say their names.

731
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,460
Song loves to take all the small advantages.

732
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,460
He deserves this.

733
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,010
Is this necessary?

734
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,190
Executives' meals can be invoiced and reimbursed.

735
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:36,380
Why do we have to stick to one specific restaurant?

736
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,600
They offer a discount

737
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,440
of 40% for bulk purchases.

738
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,820
We can also bring our own drinks.

739
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,690
More importantly, it's close to the company.

740
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:43,940
We can sign the bills right after eating.

741
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,140
It saves us the reimbursement process.

742
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,460
What's the point?

743
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,590
We need to simplify processes.

744
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,570
Use our manpower only where it matters most.

745
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:51,150
From now on,

746
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,250
for small matters like this,

747
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,470
you can decide on your own.

748
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,800
No need to consult me.

749
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,650
When you reported it back then,

750
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,720
I thought

751
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,800
you just wanted to get some benefits.

752
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,360
If convicted,

753
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,600
how long will Song be sentenced?

754
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:17,670
Leaking trade secrets is a pretty sensitive issue.

755
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,230
Once exposed,

756
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,640
it's likely to result in lawsuits.

757
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:25,170
The market value of both Bee and Yuntu will be affected.

758
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,110
Before IPO,

759
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,490
it's better to avoid unnecessary troubles.

760
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:33,190
But we can't just let go of them, can we?

761
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,190
Of course not.

762
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,510
I've already had someone investigate it.

763
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:38,310
Before you even came to Haidian,

764
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,030
Song and Qiu Lin had taken advantage of their positions

765
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,830
to embezzle company subsidies.

766
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:45,110
They used proxy companies for the transactions.

767
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,710
The lawyers have already collected evidence.

768
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,320
Soon,

769
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,830
they will be charged with embezzlement

770
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,670
and tax evasion.

771
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,480
This time, Song and Qiu Lin

772
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,680
will end up behind bars for life.

773
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,340
With the moles cleared out

774
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,170
and this matter resolved,

775
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,610
you should return to your post.

776
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,900
Now in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai,

777
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,650
we need a regional director.

778
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:08,860
Hurry up.

779
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,220
Go back and pack up.

780
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,910
Go make your mark there.

781
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,710
I want to take some time off.

782
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,970
There's an urgent matter at home.

783
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,760
How long do you need?

784
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,100
I don't know.

785
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,210
Not now.

786
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,710
Our company is about to go public.

787
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:35,500
You

788
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:36,930
can't be distracted now.

789
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,800
Otherwise, even if I save a position for you,

790
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,330
others won't be convinced.

791
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,210
If you leave now,

792
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,440
all your previous efforts will be in vain.

793
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,800
Without you,

794
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,750
Bee wouldn't have made it this far.

795
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,440
Just enjoy the fruits of victory.

796
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,760
Haikuo.
