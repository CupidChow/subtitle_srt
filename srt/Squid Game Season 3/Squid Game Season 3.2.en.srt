2
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,647
Good, he's awake.

3
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,316
What are you doing?

4
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,027
You promised.

5
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,321
You promised to let me live--

6
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,635
I'm trying to save your life.

SQUID GAME 3

00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:20,163
EPISODE 2
THE STARRY NIGHT

9
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:26,669
Damn.

10
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,312
<i> Ready or not,</i>

11
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,064
<i>here I come!</i>

12
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,288
What are you doing?

13
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:08,711
Mmm.

14
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,880
It's…

15
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:15,552
just a little something to boost
my confidence and strength.

16
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,638
Thanos, that fucking asshole.

17
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,349
After all those free drinks
I got him at the club,

18
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:24,144
that bastard treated me
like a fucking idiot.

19
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,729
He kept calling me "Nam-su,"
for fuck's sake.

20
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,565
"Hey, Nam-su." "It's Nam-gyu."

21
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,066
"Nam-su." "I said it's Nam-gyu."

22
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,986
"Nam-gyu."

23
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:36,489
I told that motherfucker so many times,
his ears must have bled.

24
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,199
Fucking asshole.

25
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:42,662
The Amazing Myung-gi.

26
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,915
You want one?

27
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,041
No.

28
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,460
I'm being generous
because you bumped off Thanos.

29
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,545
I said no.

30
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,549
Don't beg me for one later.

31
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,968
Follow me.

32
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,304
Let's go kill
half of humanity.

33
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,983
Are you sure you can find the way out?

34
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,067
Shush!

35
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,904
I don't rely on my eyes to see the way.

36
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:46,869
I follow the voices
of the souls who died in here.

37
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,707
Either follow me quietly,

38
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,169
or get lost if you lack faith in me!

39
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,506
No, I believe in you!
I'll follow you, no matter what!

40
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,049
- Me too.
- Me too!

41
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,759
Me… Me too.

42
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,300
You scared me!

43
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,804
Why are you just standing there?

44
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,014
My key doesn't fit.

45
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,390
It doesn't?

46
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:51,976
Move.

47
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,331
Let's go.

48
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,139
May I take a look?

49
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,976
This is the one. Can I borrow it?

50
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,496
Let me take a look.

51
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,625
What is it?

52
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,837
Each door has a keyhole
in a different shape.

53
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,506
I think there are three.
Circle, triangle, and square.

54
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,759
We each have one of those shapes.

55
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:08,845
Mine is a circle,

56
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,139
Jun-hee's is a triangle,
and yours is a square.

57
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:14,642
Don't we make a great team!

58
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,060
Absolutely.

59
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:21,774
I knew us three made a great team
since we went to the bathroom together.

60
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:22,984
- Right?
- Yes.

61
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:28,406
In that case,
you should hold on to our keys, Hyun-ju.

62
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:31,868
That way,
we'll be able to move more efficiently.

63
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,035
Would that be okay?

64
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,091
Please don't kill me.

65
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,889

Calm down!

68
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:32,822
I'm a tagger too.

69
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,675
This way.

70
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,113
Damn!

71
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,200
Go that way.

72
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,455
Goddamnit.

73
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,675
Fucking come at me!

74
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,981
You fucking bastard.

75
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,654
What the fuck are you doing?

76
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,864
Help me. Stab him!

77
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,866
I said stab him!

78
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,499
Come here, fucker!

79
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,008
Please spare me.

80
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,637
I have a wife and a kid. I beg you.

81
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,263
I hear you.

82
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,391
Hang on.

83
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,101
What?

84
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,438
If you kill him, you'll pass and I won't.

85
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,773
We'll kill another one.

86
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,651
How can I be sure
you'll help me with the next one?

87
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,653
You'll be done already.

88
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,406
What do we do then?

89
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,283
We'll do it at the same time.

90
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,453
Stab him at the same time?

91
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,420
Wow, what a sensible shit you are.

92
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,008

Why you…

96
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:31,083
Myung-gi, did you see
the look in his eyes as he died?

97
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,921
Slowly losing that gleam.

98
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:41,385
Turning into doll eyes.
It was the same with that bitch Se-mi.

99
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,471
Fucking fascinating, isn't it?

100
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,640
What are you doing?

101
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,269
We can open the doors with this.

102
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,067
Get up.

103
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,278
We've only killed half a person each.

104
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,284

105
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,747

112
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,080

113

I just need to kill that damn bitch.

117
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,951
Or give me the old hag.

118
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,316
Fuck!

119
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:06,947
No.

120
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,045
It's a triangle.

121
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,255

00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,393
- Wait a second.
- Shit.

125
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,395
No, hey! Wait!

175

They didn't say
we couldn't kill more than one.

176

So if we kill more of those assholes,

177
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,707
there won't be enough left
for all the red ones to kill.

178
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:31,003
That means, for every blue one we kill,
we're eliminating a red one too.

186
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,390
Hang in there just a bit longer.

187
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,352
This way.

188
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,691
Sit down for a minute.

189
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:00,902
Let me take a look.

190
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,908
Is it sprained?

191
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,369
Her ankle might be fractured.

192
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:12,831
What do we do?

193
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,333
She shouldn't walk on it.

194
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,920
For now, let's hide here
and see how things go.

195
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,882
Don't do that just for me.

196
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,678
I'll hide in here alone.

197
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,556
You should go find the exit.

198
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:31,391
I'll…

199
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,851
stay here with her.

200
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,270
- What?
- You should go, Hyun-ju.

201
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:40,692
We've already been
a big enough burden on you.

202
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,498
- Oh, my goodness.
- What's wrong?

203
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:55,874
Good heavens.

204
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,417
Her water broke.

205
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,503
What… What do we do?

206
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,201
Huh?

207
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,835
Please don't kill me.

208
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,134
Sir, don't you remember me?

209
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,719
When we played Mingle,

210
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:53,390
we went into that room together
as a three.

211
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,059
You're here with your mother, right?

212
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,812
I also have a sick mother outside.

213
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:02,274
She has cancer.
She's in the hospital right now.

214
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:10,198

215
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,473

00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,336
Oh, dear. Shush.

221
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:07,380
- One, two, three. Push.
- Hey! Stop!

222
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,634
That's it.
Yes, just a little more.

223
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,261

224
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,180

00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,807
Okay.

226
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,144
Ready?
All right, I need you to push again.

227

228
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,413

Can you really hear those voices?

230

242
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,483

00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,985

249

250
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,339

leaving a trail of blood.

251
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,218

00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:07,287
Please help me find her.
I have to find her.

367
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,665
I have to find her.

368
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:11,583
Help me.

369
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:16,547
You should've become a ghost
a long time ago.

370
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,591
But you survived

371
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,428
by leeching off others.

372
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,805
You shameless…

373
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,473
Fucking loser.

374
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,478
You just hid and watched?

375
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,109
That bitch liked you.

376
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:41,405
How dare you?

377
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,950
Who do you think I am?

378
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,995
Get lost!

379
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,752
How dare you?

380
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:59,298
Who do you think I am…

381
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,601
Min-su.

382
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,364
- Se-mi.
<i>- </i><i>Player 380, eliminated.</i>

383
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:29,244
- No.
<i>- </i><i>Player 380, eliminated.</i>

384
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:32,498
- Se-mi, no!
<i>- </i><i>Player 380, eliminated.</i>

385
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:34,958
- No!
<i>- </i><i>Player 380, eliminated.</i>

386
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,923
Hold her for a second.

387
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,112
Ms. Jang…

388
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,453
It's my fault? My fault?

389
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,540
What about you?

390
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,583
How come you were the only one
to come back alive?

391
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,218
It was you.

392
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,263
It was all your doing, wasn't it?

393
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:32,641
You tricked us all
so you could win the game.

394
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:40,023
You killed them.
You killed all of them, you bastard!

395
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,722
Yong-sik.

396
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,069
No.

397
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,154
Move.

398
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,157
Yong-sik, no. You can't do this.

399
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,285
Move. I couldn't do it.

400
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:35,537
I couldn't kill anyone.

401
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:37,914
So I'm going to die.

402
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:39,916
Mom, I'm going to die.

403
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:42,169
I'm going to die.

404
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,505
I'm going to die.
I couldn't kill anyone, Mom.

405
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:46,715
Nobody.

406
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,509
Then stab me.

407
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:52,804
I've lived long enough.

408
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,433
Yong-sik,

409
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,728
just stab me with the knife.

410
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:04,191
Then you, Jun-hee and her baby
will all survive.

411
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,798
Don't come any closer.

412
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:43,230
Die!

413
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,639
It's your fault.

414
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,394
It's your…

415
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,597
How can I…

416
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:03,268
How can I do that to you, Mom?

417
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:06,354
Yong-sik, listen to me.

418
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:08,106
It's okay.

419
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:10,442
So please…

420
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:11,943
Please just kill me.

421
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,487
Jun-hee, get out of here!

422
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:14,529
Quick!

423
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:16,740
- Yong-sik, just do it.
- <i>One minute left.</i>

424
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:18,492
Let her through and stab me.

425
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,340
I'm sorry.

426
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:53,109
Mom.

427
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:19,803
<i>The game has ended.</i>

428
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,317
It's my fault.

429
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:02,429
Mom, I…

430
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:08,810
I…

431
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:26,453
I'm sorry.

432
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,331
I'm sorry.

433
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,220
No!

434
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:46,473
Please spare my son!

435
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,224
I did that to him!

436
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,560
No!

437
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:56,608
<i>Player 007, eliminated.</i>
