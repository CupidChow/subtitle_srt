1
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:42,834
<i>All staff,</i>
<i>please clear away the eliminated players.</i>

2
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:45,420
<i>Let me repeat.</i>

3
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,466
<i>All staff, please clear away…</i>

4
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,481
Mamma mia.

5
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,110
Damn, that was close.

6
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,030
Good thing I like to go hunting.

7
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,657
I owe you one.

8
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,826
Oh, no worries. That was a blast.

9
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,745
Come on.

10
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,921
You two look like
you had some fun.

11
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,172
Bit of a scrape.

12
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,340
How about you two?

13
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,425
Oh, we're just getting started.

14
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,219
I heard there's more of them upstairs.

15
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,553
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,846
Let's go.

17
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:03,373
SQUID GAME 3

18
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:10,588
EPISODE 3
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT

19
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,153
Hey.

20
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,864
Have you seen my necklace?

21
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,367
The cross with the pills inside.

22
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,411
- No.
- Are you sure?

23
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,623
I haven't seen it.

24
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,252
Where did I lose it?

25
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,922
Damn…

26
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,265
I left something in the arena.
I have to find it.

27
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:06,311
I… I'd like to look for it real quick.

28
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,023
No,
you can't go back in there.

29
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,068
Come on! Just…

30
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,738
Please, okay?

31
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,073
I can't do anything without it.

32
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,995
Fuck! I have to go find it!

33
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,561
Suck it up.
We don't have time.

34
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,522
But…

35
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,650
why are you helping me?

36
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,320
Just do as I say
if you want to live.

37
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,167
Oh, sweet pea. I know, dear.

38
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,171
She's just hungry.

39
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:01,551
Do you want to try?

40
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:43,384
Congratulations to all of
you for making it through the fourth game.

41
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:48,014
Here are the results of the fourth game.

42
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:59,734
In the fourth game,
35 players were eliminated.

43
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:03,154
We now have 25 players remaining.

44
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:06,949
The prize money accumulated
up to this point is 43.1 billion won,

45
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,620
and each person's share
is 1.724 billion won.

46
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:17,043
You will now take a vote to decide
whether to continue the games or not.

47
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,976
I always enjoyed
watching it from the outside,

48
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,355
but it was a completely new experience
putting on the uniform and taking part.

49
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,857
What can I even compare it to?

50
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:45,279
It was like I was a Maasai tribesman
stalking the African wilderness.

51
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,325
I've done plenty of hunting
in Africa,

52
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,410
but this… was on another level.

53
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,745
Fuck, I…

54
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,289
I was the only one who didn't go?

55
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,626
That fucking chopper was late, man!

56
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:02,004
I spent so much money
on that piece of junk.

57
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,507
Oh, you sure your chopper was the problem?

58
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,218
Or were you too drunk to wake up on time?

59
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,095
You know something?

60
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:13,432
When you don't open your mouth,
you're kind of attractive.

61
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:17,061
I see why Chairman Oh passed
the reins to you.

62
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,480
The work you've done here is top-notch.

63
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,108
Not only giving us the pleasure
of watching the game,

64
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,277
but also letting us participate.

65
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,821
I'm just upholding
Chairman Oh's wishes

66
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,614
to better entertain my guests.

67
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:32,243
Shall we raise a glass to the
memory of the legendary Chairman Oh?

68
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,413
- To Chairman Oh!
- Chairman Oh!

69
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,417
<i>Officer. This is Manager 004.</i>

70
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,594
Go ahead.

71
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,680
<i>We've lost contact</i>
<i>with the operating room.</i>

72
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,183
Go down
and check for yourself.

73
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,885
MR. CHOI

74
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:35,681
Hello?

75
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,142
<i>Hwang, it's just as I thought.</i>

76
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:41,562
I did some digging, and there's
something fishy about Captain Park.

77
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:45,274
For one thing,
nobody around here knows much about him.

78
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,194
I've been asking
the market vendors and fishermen,

79
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,905
trying to find out where he's from,
whether he has any family,

80
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,198
which school he went to.

81
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,950
But no one seems to know.

82
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,161
<i>Also, his resident registration</i>
<i>has the name Park Yeong-gil,</i>

83
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,247
<i>but no one even recognizes that name.</i>

84
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,376
<i>They kept asking if that's really</i>
<i>his name. How's that for suspicious?</i>

85
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:06,587
We still can't conclude
that he killed the drone operator.

86
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:10,800
I know, but there's definitely
something fishy about him.

87
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,678
<i>That's not all.</i>
<i>Remember Captain Ko from the other boat?</i>

88
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:17,181
Park introduced him
as a local here in Moojin.

89
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,934
But no one seems to know
anything about him either!

90
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,271
My friend from the area
hasn't even heard of him.

91
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,856
<i>He's practically a ghost around here.</i>

92
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,108
Come on!

93
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,443
We've got a visual on the island.

94
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,029
I have to go. I'll call you back.

95
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,115
<i>Okay,</i>
<i>I'll look into it further.</i>

96
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,200
<i>Just keep an eye on Captain Park.</i>

97
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,204
Let's go.

98
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,134
Bring the drone a little lower.

99
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,888
Oh, it's time for the voting.

100
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,724
Seems like it.

101
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,561
I'm telling you,
watching the voting this year?

102
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,229
So fun.

103
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,732
Oh, it was more exciting
than the actual games.

104
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,735
1.7 billion won is over a million dollars.

105
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,820
That's a lot of money
for people like them.

106
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,447
Suppose they want to stop here.

107
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,533
The players down there
have made it this far

108
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,327
by killing each other.

109
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,371
Most of them are thinking now,

110
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:26,292
"If more people die,
how much more money can I get?"

111
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:32,715
Among the 25 left,
16 are already wearing a circle patch.

112
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,842
After that riot in the dark,

113
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:38,346
people will be nervous
about voting against the majority.

114
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,516
<i>The player</i>
<i>with the lowest number will vote first.</i>

115
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,769
Player 039, please cast your vote.

116
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,781
If you wish to continue the games,
press the O button.

117
00:10:56,864 --> 00:11:00,493
If you wish to end them,
press the X button.

118
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,296
Player 084.

119
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,846
Player 096.

120
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,354
Player 100.

121
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,403
Player 124.

122
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,876
Player 125.

123
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,622
Player 149.

124
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,846
Player 163.

125
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,455
Player 192.

126
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,506
Sir.

127
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,676
Can we please stop here?

128
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,639
Have some pity on this old woman.
I beg you.

129
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,605
Everyone, please.

130
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,943
I'm begging you to put a stop to this now.

131
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,407
If the money still isn't enough for you,

132
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,910
I'll give you all my share.

133
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:52,081
You can take all my money.

134
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,135
Look,

135
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,389
I've lived long enough.

136
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:14,812
It wouldn't matter if I died here.

137
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:24,905
But we can't let that baby
and its mom die, can we?

138
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,618
Everyone, please.

139
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,204
I'm begging you.

140
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,833
Player 192,
please cast your vote.

141
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,168
Sir, please!

142
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,380
Please save Jun-hee and the baby.

143
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:44,091
Please have mercy on this old woman!
I beg you!

144
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:47,970
Please let the baby and its mom out!

145
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,055
Please let them out…

146
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,124
Identify them.

147
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,777
The identities of the dead?

148
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,988
- This is Number 007.
- This is Number 025.

149
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,538
Follow those soldiers.

150
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,585
There's a camera in the room too.
Be careful.

151
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,151
It is the final voter's turn.

152
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,823
Player 456, please cast your vote.

153
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,919
Player 456 has forfeited his vote.

154
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,338
Of the 25 voters,

155
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:51,051
16 votes for O, 8 votes for X,
and one abstention.

156
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:56,890
In accordance with your democratic vote,
the next game will take place tomorrow.

157
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:00,561
I hope you have a pleasant night.

158
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,104
Good work.

159
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,559
Well,
our host was exactly right.

160
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:44,354
There was a bigger gap in the votes
than I thought.

161
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,149
I almost cried
when I heard that old lady's speech.

162
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,152
It was touching.

163
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,739
Do you think she meant it
when she said she'd give up all her money?

164
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,616
She's probably senile.

165
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:59,453
This is the nutjob that kills her own son

166
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,750
just to save some baby and a woman
she just met.

167
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,668
I think I understand her.

168
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,172
After all, there's many times
I've wanted to bury my son alive.

169
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,772
What's the situation?

170
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:30,234
<i>Numbers 005, 007 and 025 are dead.</i>

171
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,361
Who did that?

172
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,947
There was a gunfight.

173
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,865
It looks like Number 016 did it.

174
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,534
Number 016?

175
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,536
The doctor who removes the organs?

176
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,870
<i>Yes.</i>

177
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,832
<i>He's the only one whose body is missing</i>
<i>from the operating room.</i>

178
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,359
Check on the soldiers' quarters.

179
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:17,030
Numbers 005, 007, 011,

180
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,659
and 025 haven't returned yet.

181
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:21,994
Where's 016?

182
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,746
Back in the room.

183
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,593
It's low tide now.

184
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,596
Let's go before
the currents get any stronger.

185
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,308
Bring the drone back in.

186
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,643
Yes, sir.

187
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,604
Hold on.

188
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,273
Fly the drone back to shore.

189
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,779
Why? Do you see something?

190
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,824
I feel like
I've been here before.

191
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:05,120
Captain Park, get us
as close to the shore as possible.

192
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,706
The reefs make it too dangerous.

193
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,083
Please. I need to check something.

194
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,690
You should eat.

195
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,616
I know it's hard,
but you still need to eat.

196
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,370
Mom has to live for the baby to live.

197
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,637
Drink water so you don't choke.

198
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,056
I'm sorry.

199
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,436
It's all because of me.

200
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,272
Don't ever think that.

201
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,484
From now on,

202
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,029
this baby is your only concern.

203
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:27,953
Don't think of anything
except you and your baby.

204
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,462
Okay?

205
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,652
After lights-out,

206
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,738
bring Number 016 to me.

207
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:07,159
And track down Number 011.
Report location.

208
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,910
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

209
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,414
Number 011 is here.

210
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,266
Was the operating room your doing?

211
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:34,770
Why?

212
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:39,733
We're taking a few organs
from trash that's going to die anyway.

213
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,401
Why are you risking your life?

214
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:44,738
You're the one taking that risk.

215
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,532
What do you want?

216
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,994
Tomorrow, assign me and Number 016
to outer perimeter patrol.

217
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,871
You mean the doctor?

218
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,625
Do you know each other?

219
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,044
And get us a boat.

220
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,172
You can't escape this place that easily.

221
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,716
You know that.

222
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,764
I heard that the VIPs have arrived.

223
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:16,645
It'd be better for you
if we disappeared quietly.

224
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,106
Isn't that right?

225
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:19,374
<i>Jun-ho.</i>

226
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,585
<i>Come with me.</i>

227
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,614
This is where I was shot.

228
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,449
Are you sure?

229
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,409
<i>Yes, I'm sure.</i>

230
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,663
The island must be somewhere nearby.

231
00:24:58,747 --> 00:24:59,706
<i>Very well.</i>

232
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,875
It'll be dark soon,
so come back to the boat for now.

233
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,585
We'll start searching at dawn tomorrow.

234
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:07,464
<i>We can definitely</i>
<i>find the island now.</i>

235
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,424
- Check the area.
- Yes, sir.

236
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:45,919
Are you blaming yourself
for everything that has happened?

237
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,648
No matter how you look at it,

238
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,695
life just is unfair.

239
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:17,200
Bad people do bad things,

240
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:20,453
but they blame others
and go on to live in peace.

241
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:25,750
Good people, on the other hand,

242
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:30,213
beat themselves up
about the smallest things.

243
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,135
My Yong-sik was just like that.

244
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:38,513
He was a soft kid. Foolishly so.

245
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,392
He blamed himself
when his employer went bankrupt,

246
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:46,104
when his creditors beat him up,

247
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,858
and when he was conned
at the gambling den.

248
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:53,361
He even blamed himself

249
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,822
when a friend he trusted
ran off with his money.

250
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:59,159
He drank himself stupid that night.

251
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:04,539
One day,
I got sick of him being so pathetic.

252
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:07,709
I couldn't take it anymore,
so I yelled at him.

253
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:12,130
"I regret all the pain I went through
to bring you into this world."

254
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:15,759
"I'll just pretend
I never had a son like you."

255
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:19,220
"So get out of my sight now,
you useless idiot!"

256
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,435
Later that night…

257
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,438
he overdosed.

258
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:33,526
He had left a suicide note saying
he was sorry for being such a failure.

259
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:40,283
As I rushed him
to the hospital in my cart,

260
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,577
I prayed to God.

261
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,539
I promised that I'd do anything
if my boy was spared.

262
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:50,043
Even jump into a pit of fire,
if that's what it took.

263
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,343
But guess what?

264
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:05,850
In the end…

265
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,940
I killed him.

266
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,408
With my own hands, I…

267
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,871
I killed my own child.

268
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:47,809
Sir.

269
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:52,313
Please will you help…

270
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,068
Jun-hee and her baby?

271
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:06,786
I still believe that
you came here to save us all.

272
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,584
I'm sorry.

273
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,130
I…

274
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,677
I'm not that kind of person.

275
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,307
I don't know
if I ended up here at this age

276
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,187
because I've lived my life wrong,

277
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:38,818
or because of the awful people
you said were upstairs.

278
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:43,281
But that baby hasn't done anything wrong.

279
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,744
It's not her fault
she was born in this hellhole.

280
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,830
Sir, please.

281
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:55,877
Please help Jun-hee and her baby survive.

282
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,506
Instead of me and my son,

283
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:05,011
please save Jun-hee and her baby.

284
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,138
Please, sir.

285
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,850
I beg you.

286
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,852
Please, sir.

287
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,279
- Hey, stop the van here.
- Okay.

288
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,037
I think
it's that house over there.

289
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,998
- But, brother.
- Yeah?

290
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,125
What are you looking for exactly?

291
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:41,172
Some proof that Captain Park
is up to no good.

292
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,675
- But, brother.
- Yeah.

293
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,385
Do you have to go this far?

294
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,971
You're breaking into someone's house.

295
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,848
It feels kinda wrong.

296
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:53,601
I'm not asking you to come with me.
Just keep watch.

297
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:56,688
Brother.

298
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,523
Is that a real gun?

299
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,692
Yes, it belonged to the bastard

300
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:02,986
who killed the boss.

301
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,363
Stay on the lookout.

302
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,591
"Park Yeong-gil." This is it.

303
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,056
Damn it.

304
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,184
What is he thinking?

305
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,460
Damn it!

306
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:25,401
Huh?

307
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:39,749
<i>It's time to start the day.</i>

308
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:43,920
<i>We will do a roll call in ten minutes.</i>

309
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:48,257
<i>Please get out of bed</i>
<i>and prepare for the day.</i>

310
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,134
<i>Let me repeat.</i>

311
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:55,014
<i>We will do a roll call in ten minutes.</i>

312
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:59,352
<i>Please get out of bed</i>
<i>and prepare for the day.</i>

313
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:12,198
<i>- </i><i>Officer,</i>

314
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:14,033
<i>the boat key has been delivered.</i>

315
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,705
Go back down to the operating room.

316
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,666
<i>Is there a problem, sir?</i>

317
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,418
Something doesn't feel right.

318
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,753
It doesn't make sense.

319
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,424
Check again to see if you missed anything.

320
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:26,981
Ms. Jang…

321
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:36,008
<i>Player 149, eliminated.</i>

322
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,840
Officer,
this is the operating room.

323
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,258
Number 016 is dead.

324
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,260
The doctor is dead?

325
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,053
<i>All soldiers…</i>

326
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,681
<i>I just scanned</i>
<i>his chip and confirmed it.</i>

327
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,100
<i>I believe Number 011 was behind this.</i>

328
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:31,022
<i>She dressed 016 in the tracksuit</i>
<i>to make him look like a player.</i>

329
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,573
Then who's the one
from Number 016's room?

330
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,620
It's Player 246.

331
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:07,433
<i>Here are</i>
<i>your duties for today.</i>

332
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:11,562
<i>Numbers 001 to 010,</i>
<i>monitor the game arena.</i>

333
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:15,816
<i>Numbers 011 to 020,</i>
<i>guard the outer perimeter.</i>

334
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,780
<i>Numbers 021 to 035,</i>
<i>guard the interior facilities.</i>

335
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,294
Damn it.

336
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,593
Huh?

337
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:52,770
Huh?

338
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,320
<i>Rock, paper, scissors.</i>
<i>Minus One.</i>

339
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:03,781
Disqualified.

340
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,326
That son of a bitch.

341
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,831
Huh?

342
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:52,330
<i>Attention, please.</i>

343
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:56,500
<i>The fifth game will begin momentarily.</i>

344
00:38:56,584 --> 00:39:01,130
<i>Please follow</i>
<i>the instructions from our staff.</i>

345
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,925
<i>Let me repeat.</i>

346
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:10,389
<i>The fifth game will begin momentarily.</i>

347
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:15,895
<i>Please follow</i>
<i>the instructions from our staff.</i>

348
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,759
Damn it.

349
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:35,391
Huh?

350
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:40,938
Huh?

351
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,311
Police!

352
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,191
Don't move.

353
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,153
Stand up slowly.

354
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,499
Jun-hee.

355
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,263
Give me the baby.

356
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:41,809
It's okay.

357
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,316
The baby could get hurt.

358
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,227
Isn't 222
at too much of a disadvantage?

359
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,354
She's got an injured leg,
and now even a baby.

360
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,440
That's too many handicaps.

361
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,609
Did anyone bet on her for the next game?

362
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:35,362
Who in their right mind would do that?

363
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,447
I did.

364
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,950
Can I ask why?

365
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:43,996
I got drunk, and uh,
pressed the wrong number.

366
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,248
Of course he did.

367
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,627
Oh, but I'm not giving up yet.

368
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:53,005
There's a saying that God created mothers

369
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:56,675
because he couldn't be everywhere at once.

370
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:59,762
Perhaps there's something
that 222 could do.

371
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,680
That depends on what the next game is.

372
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:06,352
Please, tell us about it.
We're all so curious.

373
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,228
Then I'll show you.

374
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,999
What on earth is that?

375
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,927
I was afraid
I'd end up on my own again

376
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,430
if I didn't keep the baby.

377
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,853
I thought the baby
was going to be my family,

378
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,940
someone who'd be with me forever.

379
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,820
No matter how hard it might be,

380
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:03,575
I thought having my own baby
would make me happier.

381
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,460
But because of me…

382
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,757
both Hyun-ju and Ms. Jang…

383
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,052
Because of me…

384
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:32,688
It's not your fault.

385
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,275
We made a choice.

386
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:40,446
Ms. Jang, Hyun-ju,

387
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:42,573
and you.

388
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:45,284
We made our own choices.

389
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,332
I had a daughter too.

390
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,255
I was never a good father.

391
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:06,597
But watching her grow up
after she was born…

392
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:14,021
was the happiest time of my life.

393
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:18,400
Protect your baby, no matter what.

394
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,445
I'll help you.

395
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,794
Fuck!
This is horseshit!

396
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,380
222's ankle's all fucked up! What the…

397
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,257
What the hell
is she supposed to do up there?

398
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,717
Seems like you're screwed.

399
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,802
May I make a proposal then?

400
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,596
Yeah. What proposal?

401
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:51,391
Why don't we have the baby
join its mother in the game?

402
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,936
Oh, you wanna put the baby
in the game too?

403
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,522
Okay, uh, how the fuck does that help me?

404
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,024
Kinda seems like more of a disadvantage.

405
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:03,278
Well, like you said, a mother
will do anything to save her child.

406
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:05,572
Who knows?

407
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:09,576
This might turn 222
into some kind of Marvel superhero.

408
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,286
Like Wonder Woman?

409
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:14,289
That's actually a DC superhero.
But anyways…

410
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:17,417
It seems reasonable to me.
Shall we give it a try?

411
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:19,378
I like that.

412
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:20,671
That sounds fun.

413
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,382
- You should do it!
- Ah…

414
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,468
Yeah, fuck it, fuck it. Let's do it.

415
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:28,470
I mean, I'm screwed either way, right? So,

416
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,515
I'll make this sacrifice for the, uh,

417
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:33,976
for the sake of your entertainment.

418
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:36,061
- Here they come!
- Come on!

419
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,104
What the hell is this?

420
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:23,066
I think we're supposed
to get to the other side.

421
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:29,698
<i>Welcome to the fifth game.</i>

422
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:35,287
<i>The game you will be playing is Jump Rope.</i>

423
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:41,335
<i>You must cross the bridge</i>
<i>as you jump over the rotating rope</i>

424
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:45,589
<i>and get to the other side</i>

425
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:52,095
<i>You may decide on the order</i>
<i>amongst yourselves.</i>

426
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:55,432
Sit down for a second.

427
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:14,242

I'll help you.

438
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:26,273
What about my baby?

439
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,191
The game will be over
in 20 minutes.

440
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:32,946
You can leave the baby here until then
and pick it up afterwards.

441
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:37,159
All players must make it
across the bridge within the time limit.

442
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:43,498
Any player who fails to cross the bridge
within the time limit will be eliminated.

443
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,669
My baby is not a player.

444
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:50,714
Everyone here is a player.

445
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,424
Don't be ridiculous.

446
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:54,676
The baby has nothing to do with this game!

447
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:01,391
Any player

448
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:04,478
who fails to cross the bridge
within the time limit will be eliminated.

449
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:15,405
This is getting exciting!

450
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:17,699
You can do it!

451
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,576
You be strong, 222!

452
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:21,912
I thought you'd given up.

453
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:25,624
Well, as Yogi Berra once said,

454
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,210
"It ain't over 'til it's over."

455
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:38,303
We can't just keep
wasting time like this!

456
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:41,223
Somebody has to step up and go first!

457
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:42,808
All right.

458
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,269
You go first then.

459
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:52,484
You can't do it, you're all talk.

460
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:56,029
But we can't just stand here
and do nothing.

461
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:58,114
Somebody has to go.

462
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,991
- You go ahead.
- We have time.

463
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,201
Mr. Seong.

464
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,994
Let's think for a second.

465
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,417
Take my baby with you.

466
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:18,051
Please.

467
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:23,014
Nam-gyu.

468
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:25,475
Are you feeling okay?

469
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:31,815
Hey.

470
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,068
Piss off.

471
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:37,779
Piss off, you fucking loser.

472
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:47,539
Hey, is it because of this?

473
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:54,713
Fuck! Give it to me.

474
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:56,673
Fuck off! Piss me off and I'll throw it!

475
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,891
Look, Min-su.

476
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,809
Min-su.

477
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:15,025
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry. For everything.

478
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:18,653
I'm sorry.
I really can't do this without it.

479
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:21,489
Please, please.

480
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:25,076
I sincerely apologize. I really need it.

481
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,202
Fuck!

482
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,082
If you want it, go get it.

483
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:37,422
What's the fucking matter? You scared?

484
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:40,675
You fucking loser.

485
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:12,666
Yes!

486
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,459
Finally,
there's one on the bridge!

487
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,461
Let's go, baby!

488
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,671
<i>Player 124, eliminated.</i>

489
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:01,339
What a great start!

490
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,505
I'll get the baby to
the other side and come back.

491
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:45,175
It's okay. I can do it by myself.

492
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:46,926
You can't with that leg.

493
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,013
I promise I'll come back.

494
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:58,646
Excuse me.

495
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,954
Wait.
Why's he doing this?

496
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,956
I just can't understand that guy.

497
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,168
He's crazy to rejoin this game
after winning it.

498
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:21,669
But even so,

499
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:24,214
I'll root for him if he's helping 222.

500
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,050
You go, 456!

501
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:24,649
Why isn't he going?

502
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:27,652
What's he doing?

503
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:29,904
There must be a gap in the bridge.

504
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,410
You can do it, 456!

505
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:37,245
Jump! Jump!

506
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:39,706

00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:50,008
