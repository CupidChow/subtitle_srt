1
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,262
What's holding you back?

2
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:25,311
Tomorrow they will come after you
and kill you.

3
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,608
Kill the trash.

4
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,486
That is

5
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,489
the best choice you can make right now.

6
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,743
Mister.

7
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,669
Don't do it.

8
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,048
You…

9
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,051
are not that kind of person.

10
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:27,201
SQUID GAME 3

11
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,827
Do you see anything?

12
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,415
I can't see a thing through this fog!

13
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,170
Check your two o'clock.

14
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,172
There should be some islands that way.

15
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,804
<i>- </i><i>Detective Hwang Jun-ho.</i>

16
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,390
<i>Do you read me?</i>

17
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:38,898
Yes.

18
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,025
<i>You should give up now.</i>

19
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,115
Why didn't you just leave me
to die back then?

20
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,410
If you dig any deeper into this game,

21
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,371
you will die.

22
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,414
Then you'll have to kill me.

23
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,416
<i>Attention, please.</i>

24
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:42,753
<i>The final game will begin momentarily.</i>

25
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:48,259
<i>Please follow</i>
<i>the instructions from our staff.</i>

26
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,471
<i>Let me repeat…</i>

27
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,087
You came back alone?

28
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,634
I told you to bring him with you.

29
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,719
I apologize.

30
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,726
I thought I knew you better than anyone.

31
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,230
If you did, you'd have known
I wouldn't follow that order.

32
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,735
What do you want?

33
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:34,073
I want every record of
Player 246 deleted.

34
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,203
246 PARK GYEONG-SEOK

35
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:43,666
DO YOU WANT
TO PERMANENTLY DELETE THIS FILE?

36
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,752
Was that everything?

37
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,130
Yes.

38
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,216
Including the records on the main server.

39
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:55,678
I'm afraid that…

40
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,599
I will have to delete the ones
in your brain as well.

41
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,684
Ah.

42
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,478
There's one more.

43
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,148
A hard copy.

44
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,277
You'll have to destroy that too
to completely erase Player 246.

45
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:14,572
Where is it?

46
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,494
In the captain's archive on the top floor.

47
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,998
As you know, not everyone has access.

48
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,126
Apart from the captain, I'm the only one.

49
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,187
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

50
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,147
<i>Please select your floor.</i>

51
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:32,483
Slowly.

52
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,338
<i>All players,</i>

53
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:58,342
<i>please proceed to the elevator</i>
<i>in front of you.</i>

54
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,990
SAFETY FIRST

55
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:14,043
<i>A warm welcome to all of you</i>
<i>for joining the final game.</i>

56
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,837
<i>The final game is</i>

57
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,340
<i>Sky Squid Game.</i>

58
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,658
Why the hell are you doing this?

59
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,746
I saw the records.

60
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,835
You and Player 246
used to work at the same place.

61
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,965
Do you have feelings for him?

62
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,760
If Player 246 dies…

63
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:10,975
the child dies too.

64
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,685
His daughter?

65
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,274
So you're doing all this
to save someone else's kid?

66
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:23,112
Does that make you feel less guilty
about abandoning your own?

67
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,698
Please spare him and his daughter.

68
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,741
Okay.

69
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,871
I understand you to some extent.

70
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,165
But

71
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,917
you've crossed the line.

72
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:38,961
By a lot.

73
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,575
The reason I thought you were special

74
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,704
wasn't just because
you're from the North as well.

75
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,881
I thought you'd understand me
better than anyone else here.

76
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,308
Just like you,

77
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,603
I lost the person
who meant the most to me.

78
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,023
All because I couldn't get a damn kidney.

79
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,237
When they're so readily available here.

80
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:56,413
<i>Officer,</i>
<i>this is the control room.</i>

81
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,672
<i>Officer, do you copy?</i>
<i>This is the control room.</i>

82
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,892
Go ahead.

83
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,521
<i>We're all set to start</i>
<i>the game. Everyone is standing by.</i>

84
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,899
Proceed.

85
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,818
I'll be there shortly.

86
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,249
I was wrong about you.

87
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,170
I should've put you in the game.
Like them.

88
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:52,094
I thought you were different
since you left your child behind.

89
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,232
Stop worrying about someone else's kid

90
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,568
and go be with your own in the sky.

91
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,863
I'll give you a painless send-off.

92
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,583
Running away again?

93
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:25,836
Where to?

94
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,593
You already know.

95
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,430
That elevator won't get you anywhere.

96
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,725
Not without my mask.

97
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:58,535
<i>Here are the rules</i>
<i>of the game.</i>

98
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:05,542
<i>Players will play on the square,</i>
<i>triangle, and circle towers.</i>

99
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:11,340
<i>You will play a pushing game</i>
<i>on these three pillars.</i>

100
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:15,469
<i>The first round will be played</i>
<i>on the square tower you are currently on.</i>

101
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:20,349
<i>If you push one or more players</i>
<i>off the tower while they are still alive,</i>

102
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:25,521
<i>all remaining players will move on</i>
<i>to the triangle tower for the next round.</i>

103
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,857
<i>Likewise,</i>
<i>if you eliminate one or more players</i>

104
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,402
<i>on the triangle tower in the second round,</i>

105
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,781
<i>you will move on to the circle tower.</i>

106
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,617
<i>The same applies to the final round</i>
<i>on the circle tower.</i>

107
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,786
<i>- If you push one or more players off,</i>
<i>- </i>

108
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:45,207
<i>everyone remaining on the tower</i>
<i>will be the final winners.</i>

109
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,876
<i>- </i>

110
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,003
<i>Please keep in mind</i>

111
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,422
<i>- that if you do not eliminate anyone</i>

112
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,092
<i>within the time limit,</i>

113
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:58,345
<i>everyone on the tower will be eliminated.</i>

114
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,480
Well, we know
which three are going to get eliminated.

115
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,275
Guess we'll have to see
in what order.

116
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,708
Min-su.

117
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,089
Min-su.

118
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,425
Min-su.

119
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:40,971
Min-su.

120
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,684
My brother, I missed you.

121
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,688
Please help me. Min-su.

122
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,233
Do you need more pills?

123
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,028
I'll give you some.

124
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,113
Please!

125
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,456
I got you, you fucking loser.

126
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,124
Goddamn son of a bitch!

127
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,668
Hey, give me back my pills.

128
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,965
Give me back my fucking pills!

129
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,592
My boy, Min-su.

130
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,677
You won't be able to handle it.

131
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,096
Give me back my pills, you motherfucker!

132
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,432
You're a fucking coward, man!

133
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,226
My pills, fucking asshole!

134
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,488
What the hell is
wrong with him?

135
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,449
Rather than 456,
we should consider…

136
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,869
<i>Please press the button</i>
<i>on the ground</i>

137
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,830
<i>to start the first round.</i>

138
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,515
<i>- The game has started.</i>

139
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:10,477
<i>You have 15 minutes.</i>

140
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,937
All right, listen.

141
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,065
Let's all discuss this rationally.

142
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,610
If we start shoving each other around
and things get messy,

143
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,530
we might all end up dead. Agreed?

144
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,698
Yes.

145
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:28,203
It's an unfortunate situation,
but taking out one person in each round

146
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,540
seems like our best option
for keeping losses to a minimum.

147
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,624
What do you think?

148
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,168
- Sounds good.
- You're right.

149
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:40,716
Now, how do we decide
who that one person is going to be?

150
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,803
That's the problem, isn't it?

151
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,013
Let's put it to a vote.

152
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:50,267
That's how we've decided
whether to keep the games going or not.

153
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:55,314
So let's vote on who should be eliminated
and keep it democratic.

154
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,484
All right, voting sounds good.

155
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,902
I'm on board.

156
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,988
Let's keep it democratic.

157
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:07,701
Then let's nominate
the ones we think should be eliminated,

158
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,703
discuss, and vote on it.

159
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,788
I believe that's the most democratic way.

160
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,665
That makes sense.

161
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:17,169
He said he was a teacher on the outside.

162
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,712
He certainly sounds educated!

163
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,255
All right.

164
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,757
Since we still have some time,

165
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,427
let's start by nominating the ones
we think should be eliminated.

166
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:41,610
I think the right choice
would be to eliminate Player 222.

167
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:45,155
Would you care to tell us why?

168
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:48,408
Frankly, Player 222
was already eliminated once,

169
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:52,079
but her kid took her place in the game.

170
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,955
That's absurd.

171
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,291
I don't think it's fair.

172
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,043
I agree.

173
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:01,963
It was unfair that Player 222 was
put back in the game in the first place.

174
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,882
And on top of that,

175
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:06,843
the baby can't play by itself
or make decisions in voting.

176
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,887
I believe that by eliminating Player 222,

177
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:14,059
the game and the voting process
will be fairer for everyone.

178
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,812
I don't know
about that complicated shit.

179
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:24,361
But, let's say that little lump
makes it out of here alive.

180
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,031
What's it gonna do after that?

181
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,701
The mother's dead.

182
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,248
And it doesn't look like there's a father.

183
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,334
Who's going to take care
of that little baby?

184
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,546
Unfortunately,

185
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,465
there's no hope of making it.

186
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,178
Don't you think?

187
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,649
All right.

188
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:08,613
If there are no objections, let's go ahead
and vote on Player 222's elimination.

189
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,698
Hang on.

190
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,742
I have an objection.

191
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:15,704
What's your problem?

192
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,206
This game is played in three rounds.

193
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,209
We need to bear that in mind
and make levelheaded decisions.

194
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,253
What's more levelheaded than this?

195
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:28,216
I'm guessing Player 456 will do
whatever he can to protect the baby.

196
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,803
He might be doing that now,

197
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:37,309
but if we all threaten to push him off,
he'll turn his back on the kid.

198
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,060
His life is at risk.

199
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:42,522
Come to think of it,
this guy has a point.

200
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,274
You all saw it.

201
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:48,528
He carried the baby across the bridge
during Jump Rope.

202
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,865
I don't know why,
but he won't give the baby up easily.

203
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,493
Could that nutjob be

204
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,370
the kid's father?

205
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,582
Fuck this.

206
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,835
Let's just push them both off together.

207
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,378
We can't do that.

208
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,380
It can't be more than one person per round

209
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,382
if we want all six of us to survive.

210
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,426
Don't you get it?

211
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:16,014
How are we going to
separate those two?

212
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,767
We need to separate them
if we want to push them off one by one.

213
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,478
We have to
figure something out.

214
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:26,233
In this round,
we can just pick the easier target.

215
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:55,178
As you know,
Player 125 is a drug addict.

216
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,639
It seems he's going through withdrawal.

217
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,432
We don't know what he might do.

218
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,728
I say we take Player 125 out first.

219
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:08,316
Then we find a way to separate
Player 456 from the baby.

220
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,654
All right, we don't have much time.

221
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,197
Let's go ahead and vote.

222
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:18,868
Those in favor of eliminating Player 125,
please raise your hand.

223
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,248
Six votes. Approved!

224
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,762
Whoa, whoa, wait a second!

225
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,432
It looks like
they're switching up the order.

226
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,146
Wait. I'm sorry.

227
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:48,648
Wait, I… I'm sorry.

228
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,191
I'm sorry.

229
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,359
I hear you.

230
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:55,613
I know you're sorry,
so just let it all go and jump.

231
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,657
Please forgive me.

232
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,117
I was just scared.

233
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:02,787
I was just so scared that I might die.

234
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,539
- I didn't mean for it to happen.
- Listen.

235
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:07,250
We've discussed this
and made a democratic decision.

236
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,294
- Please forgive me this once.
- I'm sorry.

237
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,338
But we're going to need you to die.

238
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,301
Fuck you!

239
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,388
What did I do to deserve this?

240
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,182
What the hell did I do?

241
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:27,187
I was just trying to do the best I could.

242
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,939
I didn't know, okay?

243
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,692
I didn't know
things would turn out this way!

244
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:33,860
Damn it.

245
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,987
It's pointless talking to him!

246
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,989
Just push him off!

247
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:41,701
Who's going to do it?

248
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,122
Push him off yourself.

249
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,087
Me?

250
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,428
Wait.

251
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:02,889
If I do,

252
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,017
what if he grabs on to me?

253
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,398
You shitheads…

254
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,528
Well, then who's going to push him?

255
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,407
It won't be easy
to eliminate Player 125

256
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,825
if he keeps resisting.

257
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,828
It's like <i>Belling the Cat.</i>

258
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,541
We're running out of time.

259
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:32,752
If we don't push him off in time,
we're all going to die!

260
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,504
Damn it.

261
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,641
Move.

262
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,274
What did I do to deserve this?

263
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:56,109
What did I do that was so wrong?

264
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,279
Why is it always me? What did I do?

265
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:04,909
I'm sorry.

266
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,078
I didn't want to do this.

267
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,584
Min-su.

268
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:31,936
Se-mi.

269
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,275
I'm sorry.

270
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,446
I'm sorry, Se-mi.

271
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,031
Come with me.

272
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,211
<i>Player 125, eliminated.</i>

273
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:46,261
So that's what that pole was for.

274
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:49,639
The young lad has a good head
on his shoulders.

275
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,729
<i>The first round has ended.</i>

276
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,193
Steer two o'clock.

277
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:37,622
<i>All players,</i>
<i>please proceed to the next round.</i>

278
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:55,807
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for 222 and 456

279
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,183
to be eliminated.

280
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,435
They'll have to separate
the two of them first.

281
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,564
Well, that won't be easy,
since 456 is a total loony.

282
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:20,915
<i>Please press</i>
<i>the button to start the second round.</i>

283
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:33,886
Wait.

284
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:39,183
We can press it
after we separate him from the baby.

285
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:44,981
All right then.

286
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:48,526
Let's nominate the ones
we think should be eliminated

287
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:49,986
and vote on it right away.

288
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:52,113
I nominate Player 222.

289
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,448
- Any objections?
- No objections.

290
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,365
No objections.

291
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,993
It's settled.
Player 222 will be eliminated.

292
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,753
I agree.

293
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:11,883
Since 6 out of 8 have voted in favor
of Player 222's elimination,

294
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:17,472
Player 222's elimination has been decided
by democratic vote.

295
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,769
I understand how you feel.

296
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:25,188
I know you don't want to do that
to the baby.

297
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,981
I have two kids at home.

298
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,733
That's right.

299
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:33,279
We're humans too.
It's not like we want to do this.

300
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,865
The baby has lost its mother.

301
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,451
Ending its life here without any suffering

302
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:41,287
might actually be better.

303
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,705
Don't you think?

304
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,792
We won't ask you
to kill it, sir.

305
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:49,253
Just hang the baby on the pole, please.

306
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:52,173
We'll send it to a better place.

307
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:56,677
You can just look the other way.

308
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:03,434
If you don't hand over the baby,
I might just push both of you off.

309
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,982
If you kill us both, then what?

310
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,403
Who are you going to kill
in the next round?

311
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:19,367
What are you going to do, draw lots?

312
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,743
Or…

313
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,705
will you pick the easiest target?

314
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,835
<i>The game has started.</i>

315
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:32,255
<i>You have 15 minutes.</i>

316
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,259
What did you do?
We were still talking to him!

317
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:39,053
I don't give a fuck anymore.

318
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,890
If he doesn't give up the kid,
just push them both off.

319
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,403
Do it if you can.

320
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,280
But remember,

321
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,741
it could be your turn next.

322
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,537
It looks like they're scheming
behind your back as we speak.

323
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,789
So? What should we do?

324
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,214
What are you waiting for?
Just push them off!

325
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,601
What are you doing?

326
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,145
Let's think this over.

327
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,855
Think what over?

328
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,941
Give me that. I'll do it if you can't.

329
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,694
How many times do I have to tell you?

330
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,571
If we take them both out,

331
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:42,074
it's going to be one of us
in the next round.

332
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,702
Stop acting like an idiot
and think about it!

333
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:47,914
Did you just call me an idiot?
You son of a bitch, I'll kill you first.

334
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,957
Knock it off!

335
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,627
We shouldn't be fighting each other!

336
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,878
Calm down, okay?

337
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:56,505
We promised we'd stick together
as a team until the end.

338
00:36:56,589 --> 00:37:00,801
Yeah. There's still time,
so let's talk about it.

339
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,013
Enough with the talking!

340
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:07,016
That bastard is bluffing.

341
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,310
If we actually try to push him off,

342
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,730
he's bound to give up the kid!

343
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,565
How can you be so sure?

344
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,861
I have an idea.

345
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:41,676
LIST OF PLAYERS, 2024

346
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,904
PARK GYEONG-SEOK

347
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,200
LEE EUN-SEONG, WIFE
PARK NA-YEON, DAUGHTER

348
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,244
AFTER WIFE'S DEATH, RAISED DAUGHTER ALONE

349
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:11,080
DAUGHTER TREATED FOR BLOOD CANCER
AT SEOHYEON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

350
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,072
Shoot the engine!

351
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,368
Go around to the side of the boat.

352
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,116
Rock, paper, scissors.

353
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,538
Rock, paper, scissors.

354
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,543
Rock, paper, scissors.

355
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,256
Rock, paper, scissors.

356
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,176
Yes!

357
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,396
Rock, paper, scissors.

358
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,532
All right, jackets off.

359
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,283
Here, put them all together.

360
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:25,631
Player 246,

361
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:27,800
eliminated.

362
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,950
Listen, all of you.

363
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,287
You'd better not let go.

364
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,538
Do you hear me?

365
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,039
Don't worry.

366
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,709
Just do your part.

367
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,588
If you can't get the baby off him,
pull them both back.

368
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:08,799
It's safer to get the baby off him
here in the center.

369
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:13,304
Once we separate them,
I'll push 456 off right away.

370
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,598
I love this plan.

371
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:18,184
The young lad really does
have a good head.

372
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,769
Nobody mess this up.

373
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,732
Let's do this. Go, team.

374
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,890
Oh, this?

375
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,433
Don't misunderstand.

376
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:04,063
It's just a safety measure, nothing else.

377
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,693
We've been talking,
and we've come up with a plan.

378
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:13,030
I think you'll like it too.

379
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,492
What's the plan?

380
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:18,452
We've decided to draw lots.

381
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:20,579
All eight of us will draw lots

382
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:26,710
to decide who gets eliminated
in this round and the next.

383
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,964
Here,
we've got the lots ready.

384
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:33,676
The one who draws the shortest strip
will be eliminated.

385
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,427
Yeah.

386
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:39,723
If you're suspicious,
you can decide the drawing order.

387
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,226
Yes, you can.

388
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:43,477
I'm okay with that.

389
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:44,979
Hear that?

390
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:46,730
What do you say?

391
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:50,234
What about the baby?

392
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:53,737
You can draw
one for the baby.

393
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,614
Then there's no problem.

394
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,621
All right, good.

395
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,665
Then please come this way

396
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,794
so we can draw lots.

397
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,546
No.

398
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,591
Bring them to me.

399
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,803
Why? Don't you trust us?

400
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,346
No, I don't.

401
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,391
Bring the lots. I'll do it here.

402
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:30,274
Give me the lots, please.

403
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,945
Yeah, okay.

404
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:39,700
Hang on.
Let me just count them one more time.

405
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,264
Please don't kill me.

406
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,309
They made me do it.

407
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,728
They threatened to kill me if I said no.

408
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:51,897
Please don't kill me.

409
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,983
I have a wife and kid on the outside.

410
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:57,069
I just wanted to survive somehow.

411
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,072
I'm sorry.

412
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,369
I beg you. Please spare me.

413
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:06,995
- Push him!
- Do it!

414
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:07,913
Move!

415
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:19,007
<i>Player 336, eliminated.</i>

416
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:22,970
I'm on your side.

417
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:34,773
Whoa,
their pact did not last long.

418
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,484
Promises and pacts never do.

419
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:45,826
All right!
Everyone, calm down now.

420
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:48,871
One person has been eliminated,
so we can all move on.

421
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:50,789
There's no need to fight each other.

422
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,792
Now we can decide during the next round.

423
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:57,921
There's just one round left.

424
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,259
Don't be an idiot,
waving that knife around.

425
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,428
Let's think about it, okay?

426
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:08,098
It will be the final round,

427
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:11,977
so I think we really should
draw lots this time.

428
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,228
What do you guys think?

429
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,063
I… I agree.

430
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,859
Look, we've got the lots ready.

431
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:23,197
Those in favor of
drawing lots,

432
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,615
raise your hand.

433
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:29,995
Okay, 4 out of 7 are in favor.

434
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:33,999
Based on the majority vote,
we will be drawing lots.

435
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,627
Fair and square.

436
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,463
Isn't this what we wanted?

437
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:41,673
No.

438
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:46,053
There are four of them and two of us.

439
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,930
They might betray us at any moment.

440
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:49,723
Betray you?

441
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:51,225
You're one to talk.

442
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,143
You're the one who betrayed us!

443
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:56,104
You suggested tying us together
and taking the baby!

444
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:59,024
All of this was his idea.

445
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:02,778
You should never trust
money-crazed kids these days!

446
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:06,240
I was trying to save the baby.

447
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,160
The baby…

448
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:14,623
It's mine.

449
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,711
Wow!

450
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:22,214
I mean, who saw that coming?

451
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:24,675
333 is the baby's father?

452
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:27,678
That means you have
the father, the mother,

453
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:30,222
and the baby all in the same game.

454
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:33,684
I mean…

455
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:36,937
And we also had the granny
and her son from the last round.

456
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,566
It's like we're watching one of
those family reality shows.

457
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:43,485
Yeah, I must say,

458
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:46,530
I'm quite impressed
with the player pool this time.

459
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:52,244
Mmm. I still think bringing 456 back to
join the game is the best idea of all.

460
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:58,542
You're the father to that baby?

461
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,461
No… No way.

462
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:06,550
But you're the one
who wanted to kill the baby first.

463
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:10,929
Sir. You don't actually
believe him, do you?

464
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:15,767
Why do you think I pushed
the other guy off instead of you?

465
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,770
Why are you doing this now?

466
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:22,024
I wanted to get out of here with Jun-hee.

467
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:26,486
But she didn't trust me.

468
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,249
We have weapons.

469
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,419
If we team up now,

470
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:45,088
they won't be able to mess with us.

471
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,634
In fact, we'll be able to choose
who to eliminate.

472
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:57,309
Please believe me.

473
00:48:57,392 --> 00:49:00,354
I really want to protect the baby.

474
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,946
Yeah, it's okay.
Come over here.

475
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,449
- What? What is it?
- Keep him still.

476
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:14,493
- Hold him tight.
- What are you doing?

477
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:28,215
All right, look!

478
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:31,009
I've found the solution to this game.

479
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:32,969
We'll pack a lunch box!

480
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:37,349
We will beat this guy to a pulp,

481
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:40,227
drag him over to the circle tower,

482
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:43,105
hit the start button and throw him off.

483
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:44,523
Then it will be game over!

484
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:46,400
The five of us…

485
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:49,069
I mean, six, including the baby.

486
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:53,240
The six of us will divide up
the prize money and get out of here.

487
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:54,950
It's 7.6 billion each!

488
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,284
How does that sound?

489
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:59,204
How's that for a solution?

490
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,419
Lunch box?

491
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,546
What a genius idea!

492
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:14,803
Please…

493
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,807
Please… Please help me.

494
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:23,812
Man, he's persistent.

495
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:25,188
Grab one of his legs.

496
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:29,443
All right, good. Hold on real tight!

497
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,953
There.

498
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,456
The lunch box!

499
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,166
All prepped and ready.

500
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,879
All we need to do now
is carry it over there.

501
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:54,760
Back off.

502
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:00,390
Is there a problem, sir?

503
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,565
This isn't the solution.

504
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:11,526
What the hell do you want to do then?

505
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:16,323
We'll draw lots.

506
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:19,367
Fair

507
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:21,578
and square.

508
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:25,916
We'll leave the baby out of it.

509
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:28,668
For fuck's sake.

510
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:30,712
You can't be serious.

511
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,631
We could just end the game this way.

512
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:35,425
Why are you doing this?

513
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:37,260
Player 333!

514
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,429
Do you agree with this nutcase?

515
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,432
Does this make any sense at all?

516
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,297
You! Die!

517
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,021
Let go, you bastard!

518
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:47,330
Wait!

519
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:48,874
Please spare me!

520
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:42,636
Well done, guys!

521
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,429
You did the right thing!

522
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:49,935
That trash should have died
a long time ago!

523
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:54,022
All right.
There are only five of us left now.

524
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:56,942
So, let's see.

525
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,652
Yes, the lunch box!

526
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:02,238
If we drag him over there
and throw him off in the next round,

527
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:04,866
the three of us…

528
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,619
I mean, the four of us,
including the baby.

529
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:08,745
Let's see.

530
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:10,246
We get…

531
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,165
11.4 billion each!

532
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:17,629
With that kind of money,
it's a happy ending for everyone, right?

533
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,386
Is 11.4 billion not enough for you?

534
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:28,556
I only need ten billion,

535
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,893
so what the hell!

536
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,603
I'll give you guys 1.4 billion!

537
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:37,065
You can all share… share it.

538
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,235
You can share it. You can…

539
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:44,656
We'll get 15.2 billion each.

540
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,076
With you gone.

541
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,005
<i>Player 100, eliminated.</i>

542
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:11,266
<i>The second round has ended.</i>

543
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:36,958
I'm sorry,

544
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,961
but I don't want to be your lunch box.

545
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,882
Wait! Calm down.

546
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,804
That's not what we're thinking. Right?

547
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:55,602
So just stay where you are.

548
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:57,854
Let's talk.

549
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:00,899
You can talk to each other.

550
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,986
I'm out.

551
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:07,447
No!

552
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:16,039
<i>Player 039, eliminated.</i>
