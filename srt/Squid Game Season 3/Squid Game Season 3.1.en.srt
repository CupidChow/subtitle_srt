1
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,108
Please don't kill--

2
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,327
Please don't kill me.

3
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:39,873
My daughter is very sick.

4
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,093
Close your eyes.

5
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,263
If you want to live, do as I say.

6
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,069
<i>Player 246, eliminated.</i>

7
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:21,372
SQUID GAME 3

8
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:28,338
EPISODE 1
KEYS AND KNIVES

9
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,979
Take it away.

10
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,243
Finally decide to be a good girl, did we?

11
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,494
This is new.

12
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,955
I gave it some thought.

13
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,581
Since they're going to die anyway,

14
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,876
using their organs to save others
isn't such a bad idea.

15
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,753


16
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,380
Good thinking.

17
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,966
I'm glad you finally came around.

18
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,636
Show me around.

19
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,430
Where?

20
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,765
The workroom.

21
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,393
What for?

22
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:30,608
You and I are
in the same boat now, aren't we?

23
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,528
We don't want any secrets between us.

24
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,032


25
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,953


26
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:17,739


27
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,377


28
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,795
Is he dead?

29
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,590
He's alive.

30
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,009
Help me get him on the bed.

31
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,510
- Quickly.
Okay.

32
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,889
Here. To the bed.

33
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,437
He's nowhere around the boat.

34
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,357
How much did he drink last night?

35
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,443
Not enough to be wasted.

36
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:58,446
I counted the empty bottles inside.
There were quite a few.

37
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:05,703
He could have come outside to puke
and fallen in.

38
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,622
The boat was rocking a lot last night.

39
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:10,917
Maybe that's what I heard
in the middle of the night?

40
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,627
What did you hear?

41
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,589
I heard someone outside, some thrashing.

42
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,341
What time was it?

43
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,635
It was around 3 a.m., wasn't it?

44
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,178
Yeah, around then.

45
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,306
So I went outside,
and Captain Park was already there.

46
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,268
We should've woken everyone up
and gone looking for him.

47
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,936
Let's search the area first.

48
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,604
But Detective Hwang.

49
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:35,608
The currents are strong here.
He probably drifted pretty far overnight.

50
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,278
If he got drunk and fell overboard,
there's no chance he's alive.

51
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,947
Are you going to waste time
looking for a corpse?

52
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,866
You said you have to find the island
in three or four days.

53
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,830
Let's go to the nearest port
and get another drone operator.

54
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:51,791
Let's get going.

55
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,481
<i>Let's attack them first.</i>

56
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,650
<i>That doesn't mean</i>
<i>we should kill each other.</i>

57
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,610
<i>That's exactly what they want us to do.</i>

58
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,571
<i>A small sacrifice</i>
<i>for the greater good?</i>

59
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:25,325
<i>Even if it takes a sacrifice,</i>
<i>we must put an end to this game now.</i>

60
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,452
<i>Fight with us</i>
<i>so we can go home together.</i>

61
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,871
<i>Anyone who wishes to join us,</i>
<i>please step forward.</i>

62
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,998
<i>Why did you bring me</i>
<i>instead of Young-il?</i>

63
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,500
<i>Because you're my friend.</i>

64
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,087
Sir?

65
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,426
Oh, gosh, sir?

66
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,136
You're alive.

67
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,888
Thank God you're alive.

68
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,723
Are you all right?

69
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,966
What about the others?

70
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,019
And Jung-bae?

71
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,656
<i>Look closely</i>

72
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,575
<i>at the consequences</i>
<i>of your little hero game.</i>

73
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,743
<i>Gi-hun.</i>

74
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:22,233
A total of 35 players
were eliminated last night,

75
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,777
and 60 players remain in the game.

76
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:28,489
The prize money accumulated
up to this point is 39.6 billion won,

77
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,576
and each person's share
is 660 million won.

78
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:38,499
You will now take a vote to decide
whether to continue the games or not.

79
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,755
Why did you keep me alive?

80
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,841
Why didn't you kill me?

81
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,135
Answer me! Tell me why!

82
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,679
Why did you let me live? Why?

83
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,558
Shoot me, you bastards!

84
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,769
Yes, shoot me! Kill me too!

85
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,357
Why did you let me live?

86
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,445
What do you want from me?

87
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,492
Why didn't you kill me?

88
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,287
You won!

89
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:20,416
So go ahead and kill me!

90
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,629
<i>You won!</i>

91
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,801
<i>- I'm begging you, just kill me!</i>

92
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,564
We're back at the port for now.

93
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,943
The plan is to find another drone operator
and head back out.

94
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:51,614
Don't let them find the island
until the games are over.

95
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,782
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

96
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:57,870
<i>Detective Hwang!</i>
<i>Give me a call when you're ready to go.</i>

97
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,915
- Okay.
- Watch your step.

98
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,714
What should I do if things go south?

99
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,430
Kill them all.

100
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,933
Including the detective.

101
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,023
You will now vote again to decide

102
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,317
whether to continue the games or not.

103
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,114
The vote will again be held
in reverse order of your player numbers.

104
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,700
Player 456, please cast your vote.

105
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,086
If you don't show an intent to vote
by the count of three,

106
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,297
your vote will be considered
an abstention.

107
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:54,885
One, two, three.

108
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:03,102
Player 456 forfeited his vote,
so it will be counted as an abstention.

109
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:06,355
Next, Player 448. Please cast your vote.

110
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,752
We're not going to hurt you,
so vote freely.

111
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,463
Yeah, do whatever you want.

112
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:33,966
Don't mind us,
feel free to vote however you want.

113
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,409
The casualties have been identified,

114
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,371
eight managers and 27 soldiers.

115
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,957
Replace the dead soldiers
with workers

116
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,336
and repair the damaged facility
as soon as possible.

117
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,672
The VIPs will be arriving soon.

118
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:13,798
Yes, sir.

119
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,715
Where did you learn to shoot?

120
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,800
Ah.

121
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,136
I heard women serve in the military
in North Korea.

122
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,303
Did you learn there?

123
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,180
Yes.

124
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,975
What made you cross the border?

125
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,144
Were you starving up there?

126
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,604
Or perhaps,

127
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,315
you got into serious trouble?

128
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,572
You said we were in the same boat now.

129
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,241
Shouldn't we get to know
each other better?

130
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:25,286
Once this is over,
let's meet up, just you and me.

131
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,787
I'll tell you then.

132
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,874
I don't want to wait that long.

133
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,835
There's a nice spot for a date here.

134
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,128
Do you want to stop by?

135
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,588
It's a long story.

136
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,840
Let me see the workroom first.

137
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,008
All right.

138
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,886
I know a little spot downstairs.

139
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,179
You'll like it too.

140
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:52,188
In accordance
with your free and democratic vote,

141
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,274
we will proceed
with the next game tomorrow.

142
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,026
Thank you.

143
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,545
Hey, 456.

144
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,509
Tell me.
Was this all just part of your plan?

145
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,388
You staged a rebellion to lure people out

146
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,641
and had them all
killed at once, didn't you?

147
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,727
But he was all like,

148
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,146
"Kill me!"

149
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,732
Was that just for show?

150
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,276
Man, he creeps me out.

151
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:40,819
That's right.

152
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:44,615
Instead of killing him like the others,
they brought him back here.

153
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,450
There's definitely something going on.

154
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:51,205
Anyway, thanks to you taking out the reds
and getting them all killed,

155
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,624
the money went up,

156
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:56,794
and we won the vote by a landslide.

157
00:13:56,877 --> 00:14:00,339
Everyone, let's thank him
with a big round of applause.

158
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,592
Thank you very much!

159
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,262
I see you were
one of us all along.

160
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,392
You fool.

161
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,519
What did I tell you?

162
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,230
You're not here of your own free will.

163
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,442
Those vengeful souls hovering
over your head brought you here.

164
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,120
Do you hear them?

165
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:35,040
Your friends screaming right in your ears.

166
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:41,255
You can cover them all you want,
but it won't help.

167
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,383
Those screams will only get louder.

168
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:50,014
You will be hearing their screams
until the moment you die.

169
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,360
- Let go of her!
- Let her go!

170
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,619
Are you all right, ma'am?

171
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,649
How does it look?

172
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,859
We'll be able to get
some good bits.

173
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,532
Slowly.

174
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,535
One, two, three!

175
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,626
Relax. Don't worry.

176
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,088
Number 011 is one of us now.

177
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,925
We brought you a good one, didn't we?

178
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,012
That's her gift to us.

179
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,431
Why did you bring her here?

180
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,395
We're in the same boat now.

181
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,355
Isn't it nice to get to know each other?

182
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:27,236
The ones who were here before us
ended up in deep shit

183
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,155
because they didn't trust each other
and kept secrets.

184
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,367
But we trust each other,
so there shouldn't be any secrets.

185
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,453
That's why we agreed
to keep our masks off in here.

186
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,040
Isn't that right?

187
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,683
So you're Number 011?

188
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,478
Do you realize how much fucking money
we've lost because of you?

189
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,439
There's no time for that.

190
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,691
We have to move fast to make it on time.
Get to work.

191
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,737
Come here.

192
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,240
I'll show you how it's done
from the start.

193
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,829
That's your gift right there.

194
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,457
He's still alive, right?

195
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,292
Yeah, just unconscious.

196
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:29,715
All right. Let's open up
Number 011's gift now, shall we?

197
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,722
- What is it?
- Stop.

198
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,057
What… What the…

199
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,224
Put the knife down.

200
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,893
- Okay.
- Hey, what the hell?

201
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,394
Step back.

202
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,979
Aren't you one of us now?

203
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,064
You psycho bitch!

204
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,673
You wanna know why
I came down from the North?

205
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,512
My commander was a lot like you,

206
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,765
and I put a bullet in his head.

207
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,283
Don't kill me. I'm not with these guys.

208
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,578
I just came here for the money.

209
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,498
Save this man.

210
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,876
If he dies, you do too.

211
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:42,890
Jun-hee.

212
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,021
You like sweet potatoes.

213
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,096
Sir.

214
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,851
You should eat,
even if it's just a little.

215
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,526
Look, I know.

216
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:42,282
I know that
you were trying to save us all.

217
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:46,870
You were trying to punish the bad guys
and put an end to all this.

218
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,290
I'm sorry.

219
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,671
I should've found a way

220
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,341
to bring back the magazines.

221
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,804
You have nothing
to apologize for, Hyun-ju.

222
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,348
It's all Dae-ho's fault.

223
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:11,520
I saw it, my mom saw it,
and everyone else saw it.

224
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:15,774
Dae-ho came to pick up the magazines,
but when he was about to leave,

225
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,278
he just sank to the floor.

226
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:24,533
When Hyun-ju came to get them,
the masked men barged in.

227
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,827
If my mom hadn't stopped her,

228
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,122
she would've died too.

229
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,665
Isn't that right, Hyun-ju?

230
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,711
This won't bring anyone back.

231
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,506
Those of us who are still alive
have to keep going, don't you think?

232
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:45,053
Make sure you eat, okay?

233
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,723
Don't choke. Drink some water with it too.

234
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,272
Gosh, he's completely out of it.

235
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,175
NOVEMBER 4 - DAY 4 OF THE SEARCH

236
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,394
Hwang, are you asleep?

237
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,396
No, not yet.

238
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:42,069
Hey, since you're still up,

239
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,280
can we talk for a bit over a drink?

240
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:47,949
Sure, come in.

241
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,497
No, I'm good.

242
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,875
Oh, all right.

243
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,717
So, what did you want to talk about?

244
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,637
Right.

245
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:11,389
Well,

246
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,975
it's about Captain Park.

247
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,271
You said he saved you
when you almost drowned, right?

248
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:22,234
Yeah, I got shot on an island
and fell into the sea.

249
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,528
He rescued me and took me to the hospital.

250
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:28,198
Anything else you remember?

251
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:32,536
I just woke up at the hospital,
and my mom told me about Captain Park.

252
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,038
Why?

253
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,126
Well, the thing is,

254
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:43,797
I told you I heard some noises last night
and went outside, right?

255
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,966
Yes, Captain Park also heard some noises.

256
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:49,261
I didn't think much of it at the time,

257
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:54,516
but it looked like
he was holding something in his hand.

258
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,351
What was it?

259
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:57,853
A screwdriver.

260
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,020
<i>Who's there?</i>

261
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,398
Choi, is that you?

262
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,151
It's me, Captain Park.

263
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,695
A screwdriver?

264
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,572
Yeah.

265
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:12,826
It was dark, but I definitely saw him
holding a screwdriver.

266
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,953
Think about it. Isn't that strange?

267
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,372
Why was he holding that?

268
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:19,040
Maybe he'd been doing some work.

269
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,628
But I think he said
he was trying to sleep when he came out.

270
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:27,215
Or maybe he grabbed a weapon
just to be safe.

271
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,552
You think so?

272
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,345
- But still, it's--
- Look.

273
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,726
Do you think he has something to do
with the drone operator's disappearance?

274
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,857
I have good instincts
for this kind of thing,

275
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,651
and there's something fishy
about Captain Park--

276
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,445
He saved my life,

277
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,948
and he's been helping me
search for the island for years.

278
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,742
He still is, even now.

279
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,327
I know that.

280
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,331
I'm not saying
he did something to the drone operator.

281
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,498
I just have a bad--

282
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:04,294
You had a drink with the drone operator
last night as well, didn't you?

283
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:09,549
Well, yeah.
But not much, just a few drinks.

284
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,221
We're setting out early in the morning.

285
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,889
You should go get some sleep.

286
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,143
Right, okay.

287
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,521
And starting tomorrow,

288
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,857
no more drinking on the boat.

289
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,112
All right.

290
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,675
<i>The fourth game</i>

291
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,760
<i>will begin momentarily.</i>

292
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:41,016
<i>Please follow</i>
<i>the instructions from our staff.</i>

293
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:43,768
Captain.

294
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,147
The VIPs have arrived.

295
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:13,048
<i>You are witnessing the fate</i>

296
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:18,053
<i>of those who refused</i>
<i>the democratic process of voting</i>

297
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:23,767
<i>and instead attempted to stop the game</i>
<i>using violent means.</i>

298
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:29,272
<i>We will not tolerate</i>
<i>any irrational behavior</i>

299
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,941
<i>- which attempts to destroy</i>

300
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,611
<i>the fair rules of this game,</i>

301
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,989
<i>and such actions will be punished</i>
<i>in accordance with our strict standards.</i>

302
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:42,994
<i>We thank you again for your cooperation.</i>

303
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,835
<i>Welcome to your fourth game.</i>

304
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:55,548
<i>This game will be played in two teams.</i>

305
00:27:56,424 --> 00:28:01,262
<i>Before we start the game,</i>
<i>you will divide into teams.</i>

306
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:08,103
<i>Please take turns drawing a ball</i>
<i>from the gumball machine in front of you.</i>

307
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,822
The bullet didn't hit
any major organs or blood vessels.

308
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,032
I stitched up his wound, but…

309
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,451
But?

310
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,245
He's lost too much blood.

311
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:27,163
He needs a transfusion,
but there's no blood.

312
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,168
Use mine.

313
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:33,795
What's your blood type?

314
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,004
Type O.

315
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,465
That should work just fine.

316
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,720
It's okay. We don't even know
what game it is yet.

317
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,058
Any funny business, and you're dead.

318
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:23,006
The game
you will be playing is Hide-and-seek.

319
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,340
Hide-and-seek?

320
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,510
The Blue Team
must either find the exit

321
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,387
and escape within 30 minutes

322
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:33,641
or stay hidden from the Red Team
until the time is up.

323
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,101
What about the taggers?

324
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,853
Just like when we played this as kids,

325
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,982
all we need to do is find the ones hiding?

326
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,192
The Red Team, the taggers,

327
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:46,070
must find members of the Blue Team

328
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,656
and kill them within 30 minutes.

329
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,579
Kill them?

330
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:55,997
That is correct.

331
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,626
The Red Team must find
the Blue Team and kill them.

332
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,503
If you fail to kill any opposing players,
you will be eliminated.

333
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,256
Those people are going to kill us?

334
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,215
That is correct.

335
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,239
What is this?

336
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,371
You have been given keys
to doors in the arena.

337
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:40,750
You can use that key
to go through the doors,

338
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:44,587
but once a door is unlocked,
it cannot be relocked.

339
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:49,050
So they can hide somewhere
and use their keys to escape.

340
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,635
They have it so much easier!

341
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,095
- That's right!
- So much easier.

342
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:55,348
On top of that,
we have to kill those people.

343
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,725
And with our bare hands.

344
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,937
That's right. This isn't fair.

345
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,482
It's not like they will just roll over
and ask us to kill them.

346
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,777
How do you expect us
to kill someone with our bare hands?

347
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:12,490

We understand your concerns.

348
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:17,704
That's why we've prepared
a small gift for the Red Team as well.

349
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:20,999
Please open the box and check.

350
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,131
Thank you.

351
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,100
Oh, wow.

352
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:54,157
The Red Team can use
knives to attack the Blue Team.

353
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,369
However, members of the Red Team
are not allowed to attack each other.

354
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,789
Shouldn't you give us
a shield or something?

355
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:06,377
You give them knives
and expect us to just run around unarmed?

356
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,754
He's right.

357
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,547
You've got to give us something too.

358
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:14,260
Yes, all we have is a key.
That's not fair!

359
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:18,347
But you can use the key
to open a door and escape.

360
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:19,474
That's right.

361
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:22,852
Just hide somewhere.
It should be a piece of cake!

362
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,896
That's right. You have it easier.

363
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:26,773
Brother.

364
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,485
That's what you're good at.

365
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,446
Hiding like a rat.

366
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,573
Before we start the game,

367
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:39,410
we will give you one last chance
to change your fate.

368
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:44,373
If any of you
are not happy with your role,

369
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:47,543
you may switch roles
with someone on the opposing team

370
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,462
before the game starts.

371
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,173
What? We can switch roles?

372
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,257
That is correct.

373
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:59,555
You can swap your items and vests
upon mutual agreement.

374
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,850
But once the game starts,

375
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:08,314
removing or trading your vests
will be strictly prohibited.

376
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,901
Please make your choice carefully.

377
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,844
Everyone, this is the new drone operator.

378
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,345
Nice to meet you all.

379
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,597
It was hard to get him here,
so treat him well.

380
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,682
Yes, sir.

381
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,227
Thank you.

382
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,563
All right,

383
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,439
put on a life jacket first.

384
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,358
We don't want any more accidents.

385
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,360
- I guess you heard?
- Oh, yes.

386
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,738
Where are you?
Hurry, we're about to leave.

387
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,366
<i>Hwang, go ahead.</i>
<i>I'm not coming with you.</i>

388
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,243
What are you talking about?

389
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,037
<i>There's something</i>
<i>I have to look into.</i>

390
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,416
Are you still going on about this?

391
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:12,295
My gut feeling is usually right.

392
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:16,299
I'll call you if I find anything.
Be careful around that prick Captain Park.

393
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,258
<i>Mr. Choi…</i>

394
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,554
All right, let's get going now.

395
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,140
- Let's go.
- All right.

396
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,243
What on earth possessed you
to show up here out of the blue

397
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:47,455
and get me out so early in the morning?

398
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,916
I've been swamped with work,
and I'm exhausted.

399
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,462
The boss is dead.

400
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:56,964
What?

401
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,342
He's dead? What happened?

402
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,510
It's a long story.

403
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:07,808
Wait, then why didn't you call me?

404
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,519
Just because
I'm on the straight and narrow now--

405
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,313
It's not like that. He was…

406
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,110
You know
Rock, Paper, Scissors, Minus One, right?

407
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:22,031
- Yeah.
- He and I played it, and…

408
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,911
Yeah. He just needed to minus the other…

409
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,707
Never mind.

410
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,710
Let's just go have some hangover soup.

411
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,380
Finish your story. So what happened?

412
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:40,174
Start the car. I'll tell you on the way.

413
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,886
I don't get you at all.

414
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:47,390
How does someone die
by playing Rock, Paper, Scissors?

415
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:51,352
None of you can get out of here alive.

416
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,937
Then, what should I…

417
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,649
Only I, shaman of the sea,

418
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,901
can guide you to the path of life.

419
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:03,489
- We believe in you, ma'am.
- Dear gods of heaven and earth…

420
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:08,452
I can see all the paths
in that place from here.

421
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,206
It is not with my eyes I see!

422
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,084
The gods of heaven and earth

423
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,921
are leading me by the hand!

424
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:23,551
Those who follow me
shall continue to live.

425
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:24,844
Min-su.

426
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:29,932
- Get in my way and you'll die!
- Have you ever killed anyone?

427
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:34,979
Hey, there's no time.
If you can't do it, switch teams.

428
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,315
You're damn good at hiding.

429
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,319
Min-su.
I looked everywhere for you last night,

430
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,195
but I couldn't find you.

431
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,823
Where were you hiding?

432
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,408
Hm?

433
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,660
Were you that scared of me?

434
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,541
It's good that you hid yourself.
Well done.

435
00:38:56,917 --> 00:39:00,004
That fucking bitch thought
she was Wonder Woman or something.

436
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:04,133
That goddamn bitch treated me
like a fucking idiot, and she…

437
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:12,975
Did you see it?

438
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,104
Damn. You saw it, didn't you?

439
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,316
But you stayed hidden like a fucking rat
and just watched?

440
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:23,903
You should've helped her.
That fucking bitch liked you.

441
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:26,864
Aw.

442
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,657
Min-su.

443
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,869
I like that look in your eyes right now.

444
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:36,874
Keep that look when you go in there,
and just go for it.

445
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:43,381
Thanos, that fucking bastard, is dead.

446
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:46,759
So is everyone else in our group.
It's just you and me now.

447
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:49,261
I'll be really lonely if you die too.

448
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,476
So be a man this time, Min-su. Okay?

449
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:00,272
You can do it, my bro, Min-su.

450
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,816
Min-su.

451
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:06,529
See you again, Min-su.

452
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,739
Jun-hee.
Switch with me.

453
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,366
You take the key.

454
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,368
That's how we'll both survive.

455
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,287
Mind your own business.

456
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,705
I'll take care of myself.

457
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,042
How do I do that?

458
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,461
I know you won't be able
to do anything with the knife.

459
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,296
Don't act like you know
everything about me.

460
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,340
Maybe I don't, but I do know one thing.

461
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,010
You can't kill anyone.

462
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,308
Give me the knife.

463
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:42,189
I'll take someone out as quickly as I can,
and then come find you.

464
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:47,027
I will protect you and the baby, Jun-hee.

465
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,907
Is it easy for you to kill someone?

466
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,036
I would

467
00:40:57,413 --> 00:41:00,708
kill everyone here if it meant
leaving here with you and the money.

468
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,043
To protect my baby,
I'd do anything too.

469
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,298
Then…

470
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,430
you kill me.

471
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:19,226
I'll come find you once the game begins.

472
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,854
Stab me with that knife and get out.

473
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,278
Then you and the baby can live.

474
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:37,870
Give me the knife.

475
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:44,877
I'll switch teams
with someone else instead.

476
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,505
We can stay together and--

477
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,048
Mom,

478
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:50,925
you have bad knees.

479
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,803
Once we go in there,

480
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:59,391
those people will come at us
with their knives.

481
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:02,520
If we go around hand in hand,

482
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:04,897
we'll both die.

483
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,568
No, you won't be able to do it.

484
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,572
How could you kill a person with this?

485
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:19,578
Even as a kid, you always let other kids

486
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:23,332
beat you up like a fool
whenever you got into a fight.

487
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:27,336
You've never hurt anyone, not even once.

488
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:28,629
What about you?

489
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,966
Can you go and kill someone with that?

490
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:35,302
Dad beat you all the time,
but you couldn't even fight back.

491
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:43,852
I'll do it.

492
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,190
I'll… try.

493
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:00,327
Thank you.

494
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,954
Nice.

495
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:11,964
Thanks a bunch.

496
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:17,303
Excuse me, would you like to switch with…

497
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:30,357
Listen to me.

498
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,817
If you switch teams with me,

499
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,321
I'll stay with you
and protect you until the end, okay?

500
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,533
But you'd have to kill someone too.

501
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,951
Will you just…

502
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:45,331
Just leave that to me.

503
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,958
I can still stay with you.

504
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,670
Please trust me. I'll keep my promise.

505
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:53,714
Okay?

506
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,758
Okay?

507
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:25,454
Fuck.

508
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,042
What? What's your problem with me?

509
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,670
Why do you keep looking at me like that?

510
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:38,175
Want to blame me for everything?

511
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,635
What did I do so wrong?

512
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,055
We wouldn't have won.

513
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,808
We wouldn't have won anyway.

514
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:49,770
Fuck,

515
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,313
stop looking at me like that!

516
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,773
It's not my fault!

517
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:58,320
If we had fought
the other damn side instead,

518
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,738
we could have won.

519
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,741
We could have won the fight
and then the vote!

520
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:04,868
It's your fault.

521
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:08,580
They all died
because of your ridiculous plan!

522
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:11,667
It's you!
You're the one who fucking killed them!

523
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:25,472
<i>The game</i>
<i>will begin momentarily.</i>

524
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:32,729
<i>Blue Team,</i>
<i>please get ready to enter the arena.</i>

525
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,107
<i>Let me repeat.</i>

526
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:38,694
<i>The game will begin momentarily.</i>

527
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,035
What happened to Choi?
He didn't show.

528
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:50,873
I talked to him on the phone earlier.

529
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:52,583
An urgent family matter came up.

530
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:54,418
All of a sudden?

531
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:57,379
I know.

532
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,839
Maybe he chickened out.

533
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:03,051
People who act all tough and loud like him

534
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:04,928
are actually the biggest wimps.

535
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:08,182
It's for the best.

536
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:11,435
He's just a booze-chugging freeloader.

537
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,925
Mom, stay well hidden.

538
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:46,220
I'll get it over with
and then come find you.

539
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:49,014
I'll find you and protect you.

540
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,433
Yong-sik.

541
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:56,313
Whenever your dad got drunk,
he always threatened to kill me.

542
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:58,899
But who kicked the bucket first?

543
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,109
Dad.

544
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,446
So do you really think
I'm gonna die in here?

545
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:11,036
Besides, I also have a weapon
for emergencies.

546
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,748
So don't worry about me.

547
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,292
Focus on yourself.

548
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:25,050
Do whatever it takes to survive,
and we'll get out of here together, okay?

549
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:26,760
Yes.

550
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,775
Keep your word.

551
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:57,791
I promise I'll find you.

552
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:10,345
Shit…

555

Listen up, people.

556
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:44,588
Instead of hiding,
let's spread out and find the exit.

557
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:49,509
Whoever finds the exit first
will shout and let everyone know!

558
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:53,597
Good idea! Let's help each other
and get out of here alive!

You think the blue vests
will just let you kill them?

567
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:25,253
Of course not.

568
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:27,297
They'll really fucking resist.

569
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:31,134
It'll be much easier
if we attack them together.
