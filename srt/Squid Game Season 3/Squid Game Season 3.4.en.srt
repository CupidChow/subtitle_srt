149
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:59,375
Well, putting the baby
in the game was genius.

150
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,460
Made it twice as fun and dramatic.

151
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,087
Glad you enjoyed it.

152
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,422
I had no idea
the game would turn out like that.

153
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,343
Yes, but what do we do with this baby now?

154
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,929
Well, now that the mother's eliminated,
maybe…

155
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,723
we should just eliminate it too.

156
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,601
Eliminate it?

157
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,353
Wait, one way or another,

158
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:23,732
we all saw that baby
cross the finish line. Right?

159
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,234
That's true.

160
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,612
It's not fair to eliminate
someone who crossed the finish line.

161
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,738
You know,

162
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,907
that's the first time

163
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,243
you looked attractive with
your mouth open.

164
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,828
Look,

165
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,455
the baby is not
an independent participant.

166
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,874
It's dependent on 222.

167
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,379
And if 222 is eliminated,
the baby must be eliminated.

168
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,296
If that's the case,

169
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,133
we should've made the baby move
with its mother in the previous game.

170
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:52,219
If the baby crossed the finish line
separately from its mother,

171
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:55,222
then it should be considered
an independent participant.

172
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,598
Okay.

173
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,476
If we all can't agree,
why don't we just ask the host?

174
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:07,818
How about having the baby play
as Player 222 in the next game?

175
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,695
Isn't that the mother's number?

176
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:10,904
Yes.

177
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,197
And what's your reasoning?

178
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,951
Soon, the players will vote
whether to continue the game.

179
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,954
So what changes if the baby participates?

180
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,708
If that baby competes
in place of her mother,

181
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,836
both the voting and the game
will be more interesting.

182
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,337
I promise you.

183
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,634
If our host is so sure of himself,
let's do that.

184
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,803
Okay. Agreed.

185
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:36,430
Same here.

186
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:40,392
Player 222 is back from the dead,
thanks to her baby.

187
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,061


188
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:45,189
This is a bigger twist than
the resurrection of Jesus.

189
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,107
Awesome!

190
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,777
222 is invincible!

191
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,779
And I knew it!

192
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,531
I knew you could do it!
I knew it! I knew it!

193
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,113
Listen.

194
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:38,075
Are you good with numbers?

195
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,998
There are only eight of us left now.

196
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,709
Then the prize?

197
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,880
That's 44.8 billion divided by 8 people,

198
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,049
which makes 5.6 billion.

199
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,259
5.6 billion?

200
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,970
5.6 billion.

201
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,934
I think that's good enough for me.

202
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,146
How about you?

203
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,273
Good enough for me too.

204
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,778
Apart from that guy, who owes ten billion,

205
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,074
I bet it's more than enough
for everyone to settle their debts.

206
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,370
In that case, at the next vote, we should…

207
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:39,761
Congratulations to all of
you for making it through the fifth game.

208
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:44,850
Here are the results of the fifth game.

209
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,607
In the fifth game,

210
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,358
16 players were eliminated.

211
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,904
We now have nine players remaining.

212
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:00,282
The prize money accumulated
to this point is 44.7 billion won,

213
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,785
and each person's share
is 4.96 billion won.

214
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,580
Why are there nine players left?

215
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,707
It's eight.

216
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,418
He's right.
There are definitely eight of us.

217
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:17,758
Players 039, 100, 125, 203,

218
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,761
222, 333,

219
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:24,056
336, 353,

220
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,849
and 456.

221
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,936
Nine players have survived.

222
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:29,853
Hold on.

223
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,231
Player 222?

224
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,566
That girl?

225
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,485
She died earlier!

226
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,487
You all saw it, didn't you?

227
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,573
Player 222 jumped off the bridge!

228
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,659
Player 222

229
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,913
is right over there.

230
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,260
What?

231
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:05,305
Are you saying that baby is Player 222?

232
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,807
That is correct.

233
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:08,809
Wait.

234
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,186
That doesn't make sense.

235
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,689
That newborn baby is a player
all of a sudden?

236
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:17,776
That is correct.
The baby is Player 222.

237
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,530
So that baby

238
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:26,285
inherits its dead mother's number
and her money?

239
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,869
It's 4.9 billion!

240
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,998
- That is correct.
- Screw you!

241
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:33,500
What kind of bullshit is this?

242
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,585
That bitch is dead.

243
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,130
If she's dead, the money should be ours!

244
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,925
That damn baby's
done nothing to deserve it!

245
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,593
That's right!

246
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,263
We've earned that money
by risking our lives in the games.

247
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,057
That damn baby shows up out of nowhere,
becomes a player,

248
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,643
and gets to share the prize money with us?

249
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,186
Are you kidding me?

250
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,272
This is outrageous!

251
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:58,275
So if I die here,

252
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:02,821
are you going to give my prize money
to my damn kids?

253
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,490
My prize money is down by 700 million
because of that baby?

254
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,491
You can't be serious!

255
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,411
It's unacceptable!

256
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,704
That's right!

257
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,706
Since the mother is dead,

258
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,208
the baby should also be eliminated!
Am I right?

259
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,626
Yes, the baby must be eliminated.

260
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,045
Damn right!

261
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,714
The kid must be eliminated too.

262
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,299
We have to kill it!

263
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,968
Right.
I can't let this happen!

264
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,512
The baby must die too!
It's got to be eliminated!

265
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,850
- Yes, it must be eliminated!
- The baby must die!

266
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,935
- No! That's nonsense!
- No way in hell!

267
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,937
- The baby is not qualified.
- Eliminate it!

268
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,939
- It can't even take the money.
- Take the baby!

269
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,317
- Hand it over!
- This is bullshit!

270
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,277
456, hand over the kid.

271
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,488
Give me that damn kid.

272
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,824
Hand it over or I'll kill you too!

273
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:58,168
Physical violence
between players will no longer be allowed.

274
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:04,091
It is our intention
to give every player a fair chance.

275
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,010
Please cooperate.

276
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:18,271
To congratulate you
for reaching the final game,

277
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:21,274
we have prepared a special gift.

278
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:26,905
Name?

279
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:30,325
Kim Mu-dong.

280
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,327
"Kim Mu-dong"?

281
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,085
Resident registration number?

282
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,462
Mr. Choi Woo-seok.

283
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,547
Yes?

284
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:48,552
Stop looking at him
and answer my questions.

285
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,557
Do you really know the house owner?

286
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,601
How many times do I have to tell you?
I know him well.

287
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,729
Captain Park is a member of a crime group!

288
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,731
You have the evidence right here.

289
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:05,026
These are the uniforms
and masks they wear!

290
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,322
Hey.

291
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:14,411
I've been dealing with gangsters
and drug cartels for 20 years now.

292
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,789
What kind of crime group
wears a pink uniform like this

293
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:21,001
and puts stupid toy masks
over their faces?

294
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,752
I'm telling you the truth!

295
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:26,756
Those bastards wear these masks,
take people to an island,

296
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,217
make them play kids' games, and kill them!

297
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,470
Have you seen this happen?

298
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:34,723
Well…

299
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:37,309
I didn't see it myself.

300
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,312
We've been looking for that island.

301
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,939
Once my team finds it, they'll call me.

302
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,901
What about the money then?

303
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:50,405
The money he buried!
That's clearly dirty money!

304
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:55,368
A lot of people in this area,
especially the elderly,

305
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,454
prefer not to keep their money
in the bank.

306
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:00,540
They hide it in a jar
or under the floorboards.

307
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,584
There's nothing suspicious about it.

308
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,296
- What the…
- No, wait.

309
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,091
Look at this, okay?

310
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:14,471
This is Captain Park,
and the guy next to him is one of them.

311
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:18,850
He'd play <i>ddakji </i>at subway stations
to lure victims.

312
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:22,145
He may look like a normal guy,
but he's cruel.

313
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:23,730
This bastard…

314
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,235
made me play
Rock, Paper, Scissors, Minus One

315
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:31,905
and shot the man
who was like a brother to me.

316
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:40,997
So, who is this guy?

317
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:45,252
I just told you.
He'd play <i>ddakji </i>at subway stations…

318
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,295
No!

319
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,255
Not that.

320
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:53,051
His name, age, address, job.
Stuff like that.

321
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,430
What are you asking me for?

322
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:02,435
Isn't that your job as a police officer
who gets paid with our tax money?

323
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,106
Sure.

324
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,693
That's why I did
a background check on you,

325
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,736
to make sure your tax money's working.

326
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:15,407
Man, you've got quite a rap sheet.

327
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:20,578
Kidnapping, false imprisonment,
assault, threats, extortion.

328
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,831
Nine criminal convictions in total.

329
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,377
Now with the burglary
and the animal protection law violation,

330
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,006
you've hit double digits.

331
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:34,175
No, it's not me you should dig into.

332
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,136
Look up Captain Park.

333
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:40,515
That guy is fishy as hell.
Did you run his ID?

334
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:42,392
Captain Park Yeong-gil

335
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:46,229
was fined once for illegal gambling
ten years ago, and that's it.

336
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:50,775
Since then, he's been completely clean,
without so much as a parking ticket.

337
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,914
This is the island
where I was shot.

338
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,835
I used up an entire tank of air
getting there from the site of the games

339
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,254
through an underwater cave.

340
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:14,632
An air tank lasts about 40 minutes.

341
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,678
Even taking into account
the propulsion device you used,

342
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:22,140
I'm sure the island
is within a 13-mile radius…

343
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,810
somewhere on this map.

344
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,855
It's been five days
since they took Mr. Seong Gi-hun.

345
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:32,275
We only have one day left
before the games end.

346
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:36,946
It's impossible to search
all these islands in one day.

347
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:39,532
Let's start with the most likely options.

348
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,202
What do you think, Captain?

349
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,541
If you ask me…

350
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,379
it's not in this area.

351
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,755
The currents are strong here,

352
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:57,842
and the coast guard often patrols the area
for Chinese fishing boats.

353
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,679
They wouldn't have picked
somewhere like that for the games.

354
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:10,021
Let's search
these islands as soon as it gets light.

355
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:15,693
We'll cover the south
and have Boat Two take the north.

356
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:16,778
Okay.

357
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,239
All right.

358
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,116
Let's do it.

359
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,951
- <i>Hey, Detective Song.</i>
- Yes, sir?

360
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,036
Do we have
Park Yeong-gil's location?

361
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,580
It looks like he's out at sea, working.

362
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:31,167
You'll have to call him.
His property has been damaged.

363
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,504
It's late, so I was going to call
in the morning.

364
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,881
Fishermen don't sleep at night.

365
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,758
His dog just died.

366
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,593
You should call him and let him know.

367
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,719
Yes, sir.

368
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:45,306
Detective, I need to make a call as well.

369
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,599
Who do you need to call?

370
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,144
My lawyer.

371
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,273
Here.

372
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:56,025
No, not this. Give me my phone, please.

373
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:59,487
Your phone has been seized
as criminal evidence.

374
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:01,364
If you need to call someone,

375
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,575
use this.

376
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:06,828
My friend is a lawyer,
and his number is in my phone.

377
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,538
Give me my phone.

378
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:09,831
I said no.

379
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,584
Hello?
Is this Captain Park Yeong-gil?

380
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,210
<i>Yes.</i>

381
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,671
Hi, I'm calling
from Moojin Police Station.

382
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,175
<i>I'm calling to inform you that</i>
<i>there's been a burglary at your residence.</i>

383
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,510
Someone broke into my house?

384
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,683
<i>We got a call</i>
<i>from your neighbor,</i>

385
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,393
<i>and we caught the intruder at the scene.</i>

386
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,562
Oh, I see. Thank you.

387
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:36,733
So what did they try to steal?

388
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:39,068
He tried to steal
the cash and clothes

389
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,237
you buried in your front yard.

390
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,322
Ah…

391
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:47,535
Could you tell me the burglar's name?

392
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,246
<i>Yes,</i>
<i>his name is Choi Woo-seok.</i>

393
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,957
A man in his forties.

394
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,834
Do you know him, by any chance?

395
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,254
No, I've never heard of him.

396
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,256
I see.

397
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:03,134
The thing is,

398
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:06,054
this guy has been saying
some crazy things.

399
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:08,890
Crazy things?

400
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:13,228
He says you're a member of a crime group
that takes people to some island

401
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,647
and makes them play murderous games.

402
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,859
He also says the cash you buried
in the yard is dirty money,

403
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,486
and the pink clothes--

404
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:24,781
Give me my phone right now!

405
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:27,200
<i>My lawyer's number is in my phone!</i>

406
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:30,787
You're violating my rights
by not letting me have it!

407
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:36,292
Is this how you small-town cops work?
Screw the rules and do whatever you want?

408
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:39,128
Fine! I want to talk to your chief then!

409
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:42,131
One of my closest friends
is a big deal here in Moojin!

410
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,717
I can get you all fired!

411
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,136
All right, fine.

412
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,680
Calm down, okay?

413
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,599
I'll let you use your phone.

414
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,477
Okay. Come on, quickly!

415
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,105
Hi,

416
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,399
sorry about that.
It's a bit noisy over here.

417
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,651
Listen, Captain Park.

418
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,278
As soon as you get back to port,

419
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:07,115
we'll need you to come to the station
to see if there's any other damage.

420
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,950
<i>- Also,</i>

421
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,661
<i>I'm really sorry to tell you this,</i>

422
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:14,914
<i>but your dog has died.</i>

423
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,375
<i>It looks like Mr. Choi Woo-seok killed it.</i>

424
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,128
Right, thank you.

425
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,305
Who called you this late?

426
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:34,517
Oh, just someone I used to work with.

427
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,396
He had a bad dream
and warned me to be careful.

428
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:41,900
What was his dream about?

429
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,866
His dog died.

430
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:53,912
In his dream.

431
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:57,749
What's your passcode?

432
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,542
I can't tell you that.

433
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,837
I can unlock it with face recognition.
Hold it up for me.

434
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,965
Here. Put your face up to it.

435
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:13,389
- Hey! Get him!
- Hey!

436
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,726
Siri, call Hwang!

437
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:19,020
Hey! You little…

438
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,605
Go back inside.

439
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:25,276
I'll radio Captain Ko on Boat Two
and come back.

440
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,402
All right.

441
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,788
MR. CHOI

442
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,126
Hi, Mr. Choi.

443
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,216
This is Boat One.

444
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,550
Boat Two, do you read me?

445
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,595
This is Boat Two. Go ahead.

446
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,555
<i>We've been exposed.</i>

447
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,933
Kill everyone on the boat now.

448
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:58,935
<i>Copy that.</i>

449
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,729
Hwang! Captain Park is one of them!

450
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,897
What?

451
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,191
<i>He's one of the masked men!</i>

452
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:07,986
<i>I found his uniform and mask at his house!</i>

453
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,873
I also found a picture of him
with the <i>ddakji </i>guy! Shit!

454
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:24,544
Be careful, okay?
He knows I broke into his house!

455
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,754
Hwang, be careful!

456
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,214
<i>Hwang!</i>

457
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:42,020
Captain, would you like some <i>ramyeon</i>?

458
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,481
Get another one ready for him.

459
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,571
Where's Hwang?

460
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,285
Behind you.

461
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,969
Who are you?

462
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,554
What are you after?

463
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,811
Why did you save my life before?

464
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,437
I was…

465
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,481
just following orders.

466
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,441
Who gave you that order?

467
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:16,197
He told me to do whatever it took
to keep you alive.

468
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,332
You know where that island is, don't you?

469
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:32,839
Even if you get there now,
what do you actually think you can do?

470
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,633
Look around you.

471
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,095
There's no one to help you now.

472
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:41,848
Where is the island?

473
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:49,814
I was supposed to die
a long time ago anyway.

474
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,902
But the captain gave me a second chance.

475
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,237
Where is it? Answer me!

476
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:01,868
Thanks.

477
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:05,204
It's been fun.

478
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,893
Everyone, please take your seats.

479
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:04,055
We have prepared
as much food and drink as you need.

480
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:08,267
If you need more,
please don't hesitate to ask.

481
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,602
I'm a little worried.

482
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,104
About what?

483
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,025
Well, the baby may have lowered
each player's share of the cash,

484
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:42,153
but won't the majority still want to stop
the game for that much prize money?

485
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:45,781
No need to worry.
The final game will definitely take place.

486
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,159
How can you be so sure?

487
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:50,953
They have no reason to vote no

488
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,914
if they know for sure they'll survive.

489
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,499
Sounds like you have a plan.

490
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,336
Our host always has a plan.

491
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,258
You will now
take a vote to decide

492
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,385
whether to continue the games or not.

493
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,554
But before we begin,

494
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:12,350
you will be given a hint
about the final game.

495
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,020
In the final game,

496
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:20,191
you will each get to choose
which players to eliminate.

497
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:22,860
What?

498
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:26,030
We get to decide who will be eliminated?

499
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,366
That is correct.

500
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:32,703
If you can all agree on
which three players should be eliminated,

501
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:36,457
everyone else
will make it through the game.

502
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,461
So we just need to
eliminate three people,

503
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,588
and we get to decide who?

504
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,006
That is correct.

505
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:48,135
In the final game, you only need
to eliminate a minimum of three players.

506
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,471
You said,
"A minimum of three players."

507
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:54,600
Doesn't that mean
more than three can be eliminated?

508
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,977
That is correct.

509
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:01,232
However, the choice will be yours.

510
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:04,527
So we can also decide
how many will be eliminated?

511
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:07,530
- That is correct.
- Damn it.

512
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:11,075
Explain it better.
What the hell are you saying?

513
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:12,993
Let me get this straight.

514
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:16,789
All we need to do is
eliminate at least three people,

515
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:22,378
and we get to decide who they will be?

516
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:26,090
That is correct.
It's entirely up to you to decide

517
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:29,009
who will be eliminated in the final game.

518
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:32,263
If you eliminate three players,

519
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:35,099
the rest will be able to leave this place

520
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:37,726
as the final winners.

521
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:41,480
Now, let's begin the vote.

522
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,442
The vote will be held
in reverse order of your player numbers.

523
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,445
Player 456, please cast your vote.

524
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,305
Player 353, please cast your vote.

525
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,910
Player 336.

526
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,927
Player 333.

527
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,681
Player 222.

528
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,814
Player 222 will be considered
to have abstained

529
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,149
due to their inability to make decisions.

530
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,402
Does anyone have any objections?

531
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:52,570
I have…

532
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,489
no objections.

533
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,289
Can I have some more rice?

534
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:06,458
Do we all agree then?

535
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:07,876
- Yes.
- I agree.

536
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,171
Let's finish the vote quickly
and enjoy the food.

537
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,431
Player 125.

538
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,565
Hey!

539
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,401
Go cast your vote.

540
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,367
Player 100.

541
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:40,427
Lastly, Player 039.

542
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,305
Can we just call it now?

543
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,893
We've already got 5 out of 9 votes,
so that's a majority.

544
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:51,021
Do you need to cast your vote?

545
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:53,774
No, I'm good.

546
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:57,319
I was going to vote O anyway.

547
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:06,078
A majority of 5 out of 9
have voted in favor,

548
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:09,540
so we will proceed to the final game.

549
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:10,749
Thank you.

550
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:19,591
Since we have made it this far,

551
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:24,805
let's toast to giving it our best shot
until the end.

552
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,140
Everyone, raise your glasses!

553
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,434
Cheers!

554
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:30,310
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

555
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:38,610
Now, let us feast!

556
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:39,862
Enjoy, everyone.

557
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:43,157
<i>Hey,</i>
<i>bring me more </i>galbi <i>and </i>japchae!

558
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,243
<i>Booze. I want more booze.</i>

559
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:48,078
And our host was right again.

560
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,998
Mmm. I wonder
how they'll decide who to eliminate.

561
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:54,126
I suppose it all depends on
what the next game is.

562
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,127
Sorry,

563
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:59,381
but we will have to keep it a secret
until tomorrow for your entertainment.

564
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,633
I can't wait for tomorrow.

565
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,386
We'll just have to stay up
all night and drink, then.

566
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:08,182
And then the sun will come up,
and the games will start.

567
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,143
Where are you off to?

568
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:13,562
- I'm gonna call it a night.
- Already?

569
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,191
Come on. Have a drink with me.

570
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,613
Ooh.

571
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,490
That sounds sexy.
What does that mean?

572
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,952
I'd rather drink
with my footstool than with you.

573
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:48,263
I think they got Team 2 too.

574
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:55,938
The bleeding has stopped.

575
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:59,858
It's a perforating wound,
so you should be okay for now.

576
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:03,195
- Once we find that island--
- We should give up now.

577
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:05,072
We've still got time.

578
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:09,201
I'm sure
there are still some people alive.

579
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:12,037
Is that really the reason
you want to find it?

580
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,339
My brother is on that island.

581
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,551
If I don't find it now,

582
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,929
I may never get another chance.

583
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,682
Please help me.

584
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:41,441
We can't search the entire area
by ourselves without the other boat.

585
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,132
It's not in this area.

586
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:06,967
The currents are strong here,

587
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:11,722
and the coast guard often patrols the area
for Chinese fishing boats.

588
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,976
They wouldn't have picked
somewhere like that for the games.

589
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:21,898
The island must be here.

590
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:58,185
<i>This is Boat Two.</i>
<i>They've been dealt with.</i>

591
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,269
And Boat One?

592
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:02,314
It looks like they got Captain Park.

593
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:11,031
<i>- </i><i>Number 011, answer me.</i>

594
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,494
I have nothing to say.

595
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:18,413
How far do you think you can get
in that tiny boat?

596
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,416
It's not too late.

597
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,502
Bring him back.

598
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:27,547
<i>If you turn him over without a fight,</i>
<i>I'll let you off the hook.</i>

599
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,425
From now on, stop looking for us.

600
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,553
<i>It's better for you too.</i>

601
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:38,100
Player 246, Park Gyeong-seok.

602
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,019
I don't know how you know him.

603
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,899
But I think I might know
where he's headed.

604
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:51,321
Seohyeon University Hospital,
pediatric cancer ward, Room 4104.

605
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,073
How about it?

606
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,284
Do you want to come back now?

607
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,526
If it's three people,
the solution is simple.

608
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:30,944
It's a no-brainer.

609
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,573
Player 456 over there.

610
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:37,242
222, that damn kid.

611
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:41,747
And 125, the junkie.

612
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,416
We can eliminate those three.

613
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:51,047
Once we eliminate those three,
the six of us will play nice,

614
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:54,593
divide up the money and get the hell out.

615
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:57,596
Then how much would each of us get?

616
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:58,930
Huh?

617
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,223
It's 7.6 billion.

618
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:06,855
So let's make a pact here.

619
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:10,275
The six of us will stick together,

620
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:13,320
only take out those three,

621
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:17,282
and then go our separate ways
with 7.6 billion each.

622
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:20,368
But we still don't know
exactly what the game will be.

623
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,997
They also said more than three
could be eliminated.

624
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,165
That's true,

625
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,667
but they said
we'd get to choose who to eliminate.

626
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:31,880
So whatever it is, we'll definitely
have the upper hand as a team.

627
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:34,674
All right, that's enough talking.

628
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:38,720
If you want to do this as a team,
put your hands together.

629
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:45,685
Come on, man. Are you in or out?

630
00:51:53,527 --> 00:52:00,367
I guess having the baby in the game
was a good thing for us after all.

631
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,599
Why are you going back?

632
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,310
Drive north at full speed.

633
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,980
As soon as you reach land,
call the police.

634
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,273
Your daughter is in danger.

635
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:36,945
You know my daughter, Na-yeon?

636
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:41,074
You should go now.

637
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:43,702
Get as far away as you can
before the fog lifts.

638
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,805
Officer,
he boat is getting away again.

639
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:10,395
Kill them both.

640
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:42,385
Player 456.

641
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:46,264
He wants to see you.

642
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,436
Take a seat.
This could take a while.

643
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,828
I have a proposition for you.

644
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,710
It's about your future. And the baby's.

645
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:40,003
Did we ever…

646
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:44,132
have a future to begin with?

647
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:46,092
As you have probably guessed,

648
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:52,640
the others will target you and the baby
in the next game.

649
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:55,977
Isn't that what you
and the people above you want?

650
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:01,107
That's why
you put a newborn baby in the game.

651
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:09,532
You want to see those money-crazed men
kill the baby with your own eyes.

652
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:14,329
I'm trying to help
you and the baby here.

653
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,377
You're trying to help us?

654
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,600
Take this knife
back to your quarters

655
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:41,231
and kill the trash
who wants to kill you and the baby.

656
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:47,529
They're fast asleep
after all the food and drink.

657
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:52,242
Slit their throats one by one,
no one will notice.

658
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:01,126
Why are you suggesting this?

659
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:23,648
Mr. Seong Gi-hun.

660
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:27,902
I'm sorry about Jung-bae.

661
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,704
Do you want to kill me?

662
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:40,999
Then go ahead.

663
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,376
It's just you and me here.

664
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:47,922
There's no one here to stop you.

665
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:52,469
But killing me won't change anything.

666
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:56,973
Someone else will take my place,

667
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:59,100
and tomorrow's game will still go ahead.

668
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,437
And in that game,

669
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,732
you'll have to fight the trash
trying to kill you and the baby.

670
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:29,964
Once you kill all of them,

671
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:33,343
you and the baby will be
the only players left.

672
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:37,597
The next game can't be played
with only two people.

673
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,809
Then, according to the rules,

674
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:44,479
the game

675
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:46,648
will end there.

676
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:52,779
You and the baby

677
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,823
will get out of here alive.

678
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:58,826
You have my word.

679
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:09,837
They will try to kill you
and the baby tomorrow.

680
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:14,008
Kill them first.

681
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:16,719
That is

682
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,681
the best choice you can make right now.

683
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:39,075
Player 456.

684
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:46,874
Do you still have faith in people?

685
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:36,878
