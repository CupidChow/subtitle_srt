1
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:28,987
Wait.

2
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,740
I'm not one of them.

3
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:37,120
I was trying to get away from them.

4
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:46,671
I need to check something.
Don't move.

5
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,600
Were you a participant in the games?

6
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:01,770
Yes.

7
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,481
I escaped.

8
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:08,109
Where is the island?

9
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,826
There.

10
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:35,845
SQUID GAME 3

11
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:43,019
EPISODE 6
HUMANS ARE…

12
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:55,824
Is the baby okay?

13
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:10,421
<i>All players,</i>
<i>please proceed to the next round.</i>

14
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,470
Hand over the baby.

15
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,516
You stay there.

16
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,687
What the hell is he doing?

17
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,691
Do you realize…

18
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,945
what that means?

19
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,574
If I do that,

20
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:24,787
you'll either have to eliminate yourself
or the baby in the next round.

21
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,082
I'm aware of that.

22
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,794
Don't tell me…

23
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,010
you're planning to kill this baby…

24
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,723
and get out of here alone with the money.

25
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,685
Give me the baby.

26
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,775
<i>The bridge will break</i>
<i>in five minutes.</i>

27
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:58,404
<i>All players, please proceed to</i>
<i>the next round in the next five minutes.</i>

28
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:07,080
Looks like 333 has found the
safest and surest way to win this game.

29
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:10,375
- This is a hard choice for 456.
- Protect that baby and my money!

30
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,335
We have a situation.

31
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,559

PARK GYEONG-SEOK

32
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,661
<i>You have four minutes left.</i>

33
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,915
I said, give me the baby!

34
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,516
If we don't make it across…

35
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,812
you will die too.

36
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,692
Then let's all die here together.

37
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,535
Location?

38
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,080
Around 0.6 mile north of here.

39
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,249
Radar shows it's approaching slowly.

40
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,640
I called the coast guard.

41
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,518
I gave them our location,
so they'll be here in two hours or so.

42
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,311
Thank you.

43
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,491
Will you be okay by yourself?

44
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,328
When the coast guards arrive,
tell them everything.

45
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,124
I'll take full responsibility
when it's all over.

46
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:59,127
Don't worry about that.
Just do what you came here for.

47
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,636
Give me the baby now!

48
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,143
I will…

49
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,731
be the eliminated player.

50
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,659
Fuck you!

51
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,786
Do you think I'm an idiot?

52
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,581
You're just trying to get over here

53
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,167
so you can shove me off
and take all the money for yourself.

54
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,713
You said you won the last games.

55
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,132
You're really something.

56
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,968
I almost fell for your little act.

57
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,761
Trust me.

58
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,931
Fuck you!

59
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,185
Do you know how I ended up
in this goddamn place?

60
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,981
I got screwed over by bastards like you!

61
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:06,402
You have to trust me
to save yourself and the baby.

62
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,488
Why? Who do you think you are?

63
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,697
I made a promise.

64
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,242
I promised…

65
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,579
to protect this baby.

66
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,788
You promised?

67
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,000
Promised who? Jun-hee?

68
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,255
What's your deal with her?

69
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,008
Did you know her before you came here?

70
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,764
Did something happen between you two?

71
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,018
Damn.

72
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:43,022
No wonder she was always
hovering around you.

73
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,775
I knew it was weird from the start. Fuck!

74
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,193
Snap out of it and listen to me!

75
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,237
There's no time.

76
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,907
So stop with the bullshit
and put the baby on the bridge!

77
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,462

Get back.

81
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,770
Further!

82
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,111

90
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,815
You said
you'd sacrifice yourself.

91
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,526
Have you already changed your mind?

92
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,111
You don't deserve it.

93
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,045
<i>Please press the button</i>

94
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,442
Don't come any closer!

95
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,325
If you take another step…

96
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,539
I swear I'll drop the baby!

97
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,708
No.

98
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,462
Don't do that.

99
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,297
You think I can't do it?

100
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,766
I'll do it!

101
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,149
I'll do it!

102
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,530
Throw the knife over.

103
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,618
Get back.

104
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,790
Back further!

105
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,493
<i>Player 333, eliminated.</i>

106

Oh, <i>putain</i>!
Someone's coming back up!

107
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:33,724
That's 456.

108
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,774
No one's ever won it twice before, right?

109
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,825
It's the coast guard.

<i>The final game has started.</i>

What are you waiting for, 456?

113
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,700
Just end it already.

114
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:21,994
I get it.

115
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,746
Some goodbyes take time.

116
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,654
We are not horses.

117
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,536
We are humans.

Begin evacuation.

Can I ask you something?

148
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,207
Do you live in Bongcheon-dong?

149
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,710
No.

150
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:22,255
Then have I drawn
your portrait here before?

151
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,215
No.

152
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:26,092
Why do you ask?

153
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,552
Ah…

154
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:31,180
I feel like we've met before.

155
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,645
Oh, gosh.

156
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,648
I was just asking.
I didn't mean it that way.

157
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,401
I used to work here.

158
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,737
I knew it!

159
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:49,115
That's why you looked so familiar.

160
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,118
Dad!

161
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:54,871
Hi, honey.

162
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,248
I just took my picture with the bunny.

163
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:01,044
Let me see.
What a great photo!

164
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:04,923
Hi, Na-yeon.

165
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,676
Hello.

166
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,472
Do you know my daughter?

167
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,435
I heard about her condition
when I was working here.

168
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,979
Oh, I see.

169
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,317
She looks healthy now.

170
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,443
Yes.

171
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:29,322
She's doing much better now,
thanks to everyone's help.

172
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,624

Okay.

175
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,763
Wait,

176
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,431
your portrait isn't finished yet.

177
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,101
I'll come back another time.

178
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,358

179
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,361
Can you open this for me?

180
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:09,487
Of course, honey.

181
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,614
Here.

182
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,244
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

183
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,462
- Hello?
- <i>It's me.</i>

184
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,215
<i>Why did you change your number?</i>

185

<i>It was so hard tracking you down.</i>

Who's this?

187
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,849
<i>You've forgotten</i>

188
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,601
<i>That's sad to hear.</i>

189
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:45,064
<i>It's me, Park Man-cheol</i>
<i>from South Men, North Women.</i>

190
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,275
<i>We were looking for your daughter.</i>

191
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,239
<i>Don't freak out,</i>

192
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:56,826
<i>but someone says</i>
<i>they might have seen her in China.</i>

193
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,204
<i>It's not confirmed yet,</i>

194
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:03,291
<i>but a lot of the details line up.</i>

195
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,793
<i>Is her name Han Song-i?</i>

196
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,759
<i>Are you still there? No-eul?</i>

197
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,889
MOOJIN PENITENTIARY

198
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,855
- Father!
- Over here.

199
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,823
Gyeong-taek!

200
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,160
- Take care.
- All right, keep in touch.

201
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,789
Mr. Choi.

202
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:45,166
Oh, Hwang!

203
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:53,841
Mmm.

204
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,177
This is good. Where did you get it?

205
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:01,432
I got it for you from a famous tofu place
run by a sweet old lady.

206
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:05,645
Hey, do you think
this will make up for what you did?

207
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,648
All you had to do was keep watch,
and you fall asleep?

208
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:09,607
I'm sorry.

209
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,068
Man, the world is so unfair.

210
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,570
You did something wrong,
but I ended up in jail.

211
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,198
Look. I really am sorry,

212
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,991
but let's get this straight.

213
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,701
You went to prison for what you did.

214
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,744
You little shit.

215
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,204
Come on, Mr. Choi.

216
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,664
Thanks for everything.

217
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,126
You actually look pretty good.

218
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,129
Yeah?

219
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:34,173
It was just six months.
Practically taking a little break.

220
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,425
Prison has changed a lot over the years.

221
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,928
It's nicer than most motels these days.

222
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,805
The food's not even that bad.

223
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,015
So what's your plan now?

224
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,018
I'm not sure.

225
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,272
I spent years looking for that <i>ddakji </i>guy<i>.</i>

226
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,773
Now that it's all over,

227
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,900
I feel kind of lost.

228
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,485
I don't know what to do next.

229
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:59,407
What about you, Hwang?
Going back into the force?

230
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,868
The police?

231
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,286
After all that?

232
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,122
Maybe not.

233
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,083
Wanna work with me then?

234
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,670
Moneylending isn't that bad
if you think about it.

235
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:16,757
You're actually making money
by helping people in need.

236
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,551
That's not exactly true.

237
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,428
You're not really helping people.

238
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,888
You goddamn little…

239
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,640
Do you even have enough money to loan out?

240
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,893
Man.

241
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,520
If only we still had that money…

242
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,026
Is all the cash in the motel really gone?

243
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:39,113
Yeah, the room was empty when I got there.

244
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,076
Who could it be?
No one knew about it except us two.

245
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,330
Wait.

246
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,250
Could Mr. Seong…

247
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,006
I hope so.

00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:20,649
Over here!

257
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:27,531
Welcome, Sae-byeok's mom.
You must've been through a lot.

258
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,542
What are you doing, Cheol?

259
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,252
Say hello.

260
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:50,429
Cheol.

261
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,183
Look how much you've grown.

262
00:39:58,604 --> 00:39:59,647
I'm sorry.

263
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,358
It…

264
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,362
took me too long to get here.

265
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,301
Thank you for everything.

266
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,678
Likewise.

267
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:32,805
Here are the papers.

268
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:46,819
Thank you.

269
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,242
Hello.

270
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:57,079
You're flying to Yanji, China,
on T'way Air, Flight 215

271
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,165
departing at 2:30 p.m., right?

272
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,249
Yes.

273
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,627
It's boarding gate 25,

274
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,796
and boarding starts
30 minutes before departure.

275
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,224
Hello?

276
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,852
<i>It's me, Park Man-cheol</i>
<i>from South Men, North Women.</i>

277
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:22,021
<i>Were you flying out today, No-eul?</i>

278
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:24,607
Yes. I'm at the airport now.

279
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,859
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

280
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,068
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

281
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,905
<i>I wanted to be there,</i>
<i>but I got caught up with work.</i>

282
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:35,034
<i>When you get there, someone will be</i>
<i>waiting for you at the airport,</i>

283
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:37,244
so don't worry about anything.

284
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,329
<i>Okay.</i>

285
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,247
Safe travels.

286
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:44,502
And call me if you need anything.

287
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:45,628
<i>I will.</i>

288
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:49,673
Make sure you come back with your kid.

289
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:51,967
Thank you.

290
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:58,390
<i>This is a</i>
<i>boarding announcement for T'way Air…</i>

291
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,108
What do you think? Pretty cool, right?

292
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,986
PINK MOTEL

293
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,655
Let's fix this place up

294
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:15,449
and make it look like
one of those Las Vegas hotels.

295
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:16,992
I'm telling you.

296
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,453
With all the bars
and karaoke places around here,

297
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,080
it'll do good business.

298
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:22,081
Come on.

299
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:24,833
But it's going to cost a ton
to renovate.

300
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,711
It'll be a lot cheaper
if we just do it ourselves.

301
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,171
You can paint, right?

302
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,840
I'm a pro. I can put up wallpaper too.

303
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,300
That's great.

304
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,053
I learned all sorts of stuff
to make a living back home.

305
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:38,347
Then you can fix this place up
and run it for me.

306
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,516
I'll make you the general manager.

307
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:41,850
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

308
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:43,561
How many people are you going to hire?

309
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,773
None. I'm the owner,
and you're the manager. That's it.

310
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:48,941
What?

311
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:52,444
Come on, get in here.
This is the room.

312
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,738
It was this room?

313
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,365
That's right.

314
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,702
The piles of money were right here?

315
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:00,786
Exactly.

316
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:04,206
Whoever it was took every last bill
and wiped all the CCTV footage.

317
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,416
Goddamnit.

318
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:08,586
Perhaps, it was that detective?

319
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:11,088
Maybe he swiped it without telling anyone.

320
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,923
- Detective Hwang?
- Yeah.

321
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:18,220
No way. I can tell just by looking at him.

322
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,931
He wouldn't have the nerve
to steal that kind of money.

323
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:25,936
But you said you two were the only ones
who knew about the money,

324
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,187
besides Mr. Seong.

325
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,231
I know.

326
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,734
Who the hell took it?

327
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:39,950
LOS ANGELES, UNITED STATES

328
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,595
Must be the pizza!
I'll get it.

329
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:09,855
Is this the residence
of Ms. Seong Ga-yeong?

330
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,276
That's me.

331
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,237
Who are you?

332
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,324
I'm someone who knows Mr. Seong Gi-hun.

333
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,788
I'm here to deliver something to you.

334
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,755
Come on, Jenny! It's your turn!

335
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:37,007
In a minute! I'll be there!

336
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,642
Is it from my dad?

337
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:53,732
Did he ask you to give me this
and see how I was doing?

338
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,653
You can go tell him

339
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,698
that I don't care anymore
if he contacts me or not.

340
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:06,495
I'll pretend he doesn't exist,
so he shouldn't bother getting in touch.

341
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,833
These are
Mr. Seong Gi-hun's belongings.

342
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,340
Mr. Seong has passed away.

343
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:27,141
He left these to you, Ga-yeong.

344
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,205
Shit!

345
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:15,207
Come on!

346
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:32,558
Fuck!

347
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:35,644
Damn!

348
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:49,157
All right. Let's go again.

349
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:51,493
As you wish.

350
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,501
Motherfucker!

351
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:21,481
Fuck.
