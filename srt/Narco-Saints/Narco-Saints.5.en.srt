1
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:08,341
THIS SERIES IS INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY

2
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:11,803
BUT CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
HAVE BEEN REIMAGINED FOR DRAMATIC PURPOSES

3
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,479
What is he plotting?

4
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,231
Damn it.

5
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:15,862
Oh, this barbaric prick...

6
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,456
According to Chen Zhen,

7
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,292
if we use the Chinatown route
he uses to sell his meth,

8
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,878
we can sell one and a half tons of coke
in three weeks.

9
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,047
One and a half tons in three weeks?

10
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,633
What do you think, Byun? Is it doable?

11
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:40,720
As you know,
the Chinatowns in Europe are huge.

12
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,055
I think it's possible.

13
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,946
You know,

14
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:03,952
I'm worried I might end up helping
Chen Zhen's career grow by doing this.

15
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,538
Once we sell this batch,

16
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,791
we can keep working with him or stop.

17
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,008
Okay, then David thinks

18
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,970
we should work with the Chinese guys.

19
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,014
What do you two think?

20
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:29,936
Will you be able to trust the heathens
that worship other gods?

21
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,939
Especially when we have
the option of Puerto Rico.

22
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,443
If I'm being honest,

23
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,029
Chen Zhen and I aren't on good terms,

24
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,198
so I'd want to avoid working with him.

25
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,992
But since we're talking about money,

26
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,828
it would be petty
to let our issues get in the way.

27
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:50,957
Whatever best serves you,
I'll just say "amen" and follow you.

28
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,463
I need to speak with David in private.

29
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,301
Will you please excuse us,
Preacher and Deacon?

30
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,556
Yes, Pastor.

31
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:16,941
Pastor.

32
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,987
If we succeed in selling this batch,

33
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,698
your cocaine kingdom

34
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,616
will finally be complete.

35
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,997
After that, you'll be able to tear anyone
that bothers you into shreds.

36
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,424
I came here for Chen Zhen,
but he isn't here.

37
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:45,011
What is up with this bastard?
Not picking up my calls.

38
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,013
By the way,

39
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,016
if Jeon and Chen Zhen team up,

40
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,977
{\an8}<i>doesn't that mean our operation
will go down the drain?</i>

41
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,146
If it doesn't work out,

42
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,274
I suggest you head to the US Embassy.

43
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,651
But if I disappear in this situation,

44
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,988
Jeon will find out I'm the rat.
Do you think he'll just leave me alone?

45
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:08,409
I'm sure he'll send someone
to Korea to harm my family.

46
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,372
And more importantly...

47
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,254
More importantly,

48
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:23,007
if I go back to Korea like this,
the anger will keep me up at night.

49
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,885
Then do this one last thing for me.

50
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,804
Please convince Jeon.

51
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:32,809
I'm sure he's hesitant to work with Chen.
They're enemies, after all.

52
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,853
Are you sure about that?

53
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,273
Yes, please trust me one last time.

54
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,528
All right, fine.
I'll try and trust you on this.

55
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:47,448
But what if I try to convince him,
and it doesn't work?

56
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:52,829
Then I'll completely trust
your judgment as a field agent.

57
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:58,126
Okay, I'll do as you ask
since you say this will be the last time.

58
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,043
Okay.

59
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,344
Such a nice night
with the moonlight and the cool breeze.

60
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:17,181
Mr. Kang, come in
and get your blood circulating.

61
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:22,061
I bet getting our hands on some money
will help our circulation better,

62
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,896
considering the structure of our DNA.

63
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,734
That is the best, you're right.

64
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,404
Then, why don't you choose
the Puerto Rico route?

65
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,948
I heard there's a deadline.

66
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:46,544
Mr. Kang,

67
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:50,840
have you ever heard
of Pablo Escobar, by any chance?

68
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,509
Pablo?

69
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:55,553
Guess not.

70
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,848
He was the world's most powerful
drug lord 30 years ago.

71
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:02,143
At one point, his yearly income topped
that of General Motors,

72
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,978
a company that makes cars.

73
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:08,608
He even had Colombian politicians
in the palm of his hand.

74
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,776
He was basically a king.

75
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:17,158
But do you know how he ended up?

76
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,910
He was hunted down by the DEA

77
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:24,498
and got shot while being chased
on the street, wearing slippers.

78
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,292
Mr. Kang.

79
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,338
That's America.

80
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:35,217
And that's why I promised the president

81
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:39,263
I would never get involved with the US.

82
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,599
We won't be selling to the US.

83
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,518
We will only be passing by.

84
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:48,230
And you heard that Puerto Rico
isn't even part of the US.

85
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,982
Yes, I know.

86
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,361
But the Cali Cartel might get touchy

87
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:57,281
and blame us
for potentially invading their turf.

88
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,950
All of North America is their territory.

89
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,665
I'm considering all possibilities,
so let's just be patient.

90
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,710
Well, I talked to Goo earlier and...

91
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,177
He said

92
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,389
there's no other way into Korea
other than Puerto Rico.

93
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,352
I mean, do we really
need to be in this situation?

94
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:30,606
Just because someone
is being cowardly and anxious?

95
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,947
Do you have to touch the fire
to know it's hot?

96
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,535
Don't make me say it twice.

97
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,548
If you keep rejecting this,
I'll have to make a tough choice.

98
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:58,592
I mean, I can't keep doing this here...

99
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,474
I thought you were smarter than this.

100
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:09,019
Why do you keep saying the same thing?
Why is that?

101
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:13,315
Because you're too scared
to get what I'm saying, damn it!

102
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,111
What the fuck did you say?!

103
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:21,449
A demon's possessed you!
You've got a demon inside you!

104
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,831
You son of a bitch.

105
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,300
The demon should be killed.
Don't you think so?

106
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,803
I know you don't have any money.

107
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:47,433
If you kill me now, you'll be broke.
Are you ballsy enough for that?

108
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,477
Kill me!

109
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,940
You and I both would rather die here
than live like beggars. Am I wrong?

110
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,277
So kill me now and starve to death.

111
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,945
Let's fucking die together!

112
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,622
You've been possessed by a wicked demon.

113
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:15,127
That happens when one's spirit grows weak.

114
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:25,971
Go get some rest.

115
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,557
Your body must recover

116
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,644
for your spirit to recover.

117
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,837
You're fucking unbelievable!

118
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,798
I really hope you find happiness

119
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:04,051
that's tiny as a skate's dick,
you chicken!

120
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:40,337
SANGMAN, TALKING TO THE PASTOR
IS LIKE PULLING TEETH

121
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,423
I'LL DO THINGS MY WAY

122
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:27,676
SANGMAN

123
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:29,720
DECLINE

124
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,118
My God.

125
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,501
Boss.

126
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,257
I got a call from David.

127
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,884
They are handing over Byun.

128
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:13,689
That went too well
for Chen Zhen, that dirty bastard.

129
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,941
Something's off.

130
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,535
Make sure there's nothing

131
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,996
that'll put us in danger.

132
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:49,891
Excuse me, sir.

133
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:55,772
If you ask him about Chen Zhen now,
he'll find out we've been wiretapping him.

134
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,357
You know that, right?

135
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,740
Are you confessing to wiretapping me?

136
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,617
What am I plotting with Chen Zhen?

137
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:11,580
I bet you can find out yourself
with wiretapping, tailing, or whatever.

138
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,875
If you continue to act like this,
we cannot proceed with the operation.

139
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,252
Do you think I'm doing this
for the operation?

140
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,713
No, I'm doing it
because my neck is on the line.

141
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:22,716
If the operation goes haywire
and Jeon and Chen Zhen team up,

142
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,384
I <i>will</i> die!

143
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,220
Can't you just help me?

144
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,973
You promised to trust
my judgment as a field agent.

145
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,563
Well, what do you need me to do?

146
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,776
You can track Jeon's movements
and whereabouts, right?

147
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,918
<i>Jeon is on the move right now.</i>

148
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:03,340
As I told you before, the operation
won't go according to how you want.

149
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:06,093
Staying alive
is my top priority right now.

150
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,303
Whatever you end up doing,

151
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,722
I hope you succeed.

152
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,734
For now, focus on tracking Jeon's location

153
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,654
and ask the US Embassy
for cooperation, just in case.

154
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,874
{\an8}UNITED STATES EMBASSY, PARAMARIBO

155
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,520
Quickly, get in!

156
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,842
Three green vans have just left Chinatown
through the main entrance.

157
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:30,719
No unusual sightings.

158
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,471
Good work.

159
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,598
Stay focused and keep watch.

160
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,896
Call Chen Zhen.
Tell him to get ready to finish this.

161
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,642
We'll move the goods up first.

162
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,252
CHEN ZHEN

163
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,550
SENDING

164
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,111
Go, get out of the car!

165
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,154
Move! Hurry up!

166
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:55,614
Those fucking bastards!

167
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:58,867
Shit!

168
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,456
Out of the way!

169
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,374
Hurry!

170
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:11,713
Go!

171
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,953
Those fucking pricks!

172
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:06,536
Fuck!

173
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,247
Get up!

174
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,374
Fuck!

175
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,882
Chase him! Quickly!

176
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,288
Damn it. Where did they all go?

177
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,553
Ah fuck!

178
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,072
CHEN ZHEN

179
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,871
Fuck! You fucking idiot!

180
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:22,857
Don't worry about them.

181
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:23,942
Hurry up.

182
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,861
I heard there was
a mass killing in Paramaribo.

183
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,656
Is this what you planned, Mr. Kang?

184
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,574
Things didn't go as I planned.

185
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,618
Jeon survived.

186
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,541
Head to the US Embassy immediately.

187
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,295
We can't continue
with this operation anymore.

188
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:47,465
I'll take care of the incident
and make sure

189
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,342
<i>your family stays safe.</i>

190
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,103
Hold on.

191
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:05,149
No. Jeon and Chen Zhen
can never be on good terms after this.

192
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,653
Jeon's only option now is Puerto Rico.

193
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,072
I think I should stay here.

194
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,744
There's no way I can help you.
It's just too dangerous.

195
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,663
Tell me something I don't know.

196
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:22,333
I'll go meet with that bastard Jeon again.

197
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,677
I'll call you again, Sangman.
Make sure you eat well.

198
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,012
Yeah?

199
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,973
Mr. Kang, the pastor has called you.

200
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,558
What an honor.

201
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,861
On the way here,
I heard that all hell broke loose today.

202
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,655
Then you probably know

203
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:55,324
the Chinese punks got to the warehouse.

204
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,785
Yeah, I heard they took everything.

205
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:01,956
So we gathered everyone
who knew of the location of the warehouse.

206
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,124
Great.

207
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,877
But I don't know it.

208
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,504
Come on.

209
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:11,257
You've been there before.

210
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,636
Hey, you guys covered my eyes.
How would I have known where it is?

211
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,930
It's not like I have X-ray vision.

212
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,356
Why did you leave without telling me?

213
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,696
I'm flustered to hear you ask me that
since it was your fault.

214
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,824
Is this the army? Do I need
your permission to go to the hospital?

215
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:38,701
Pastor.

216
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:41,120
Dealing with him peacefully
is never going to work.

217
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:44,415
If you let me, I'll beat a confession
out of this son of a bitch.

218
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,501
You psycho fuck. Have you lost it?

219
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:50,338
Hey, it's not my fault
you got beaten up like a freaking idiot.

220
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,090
The warehouse? Huh?

221
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:55,635
You put a bag on my head,
affecting my high blood pressure.

222
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,888
Only you guys know the exact location!

223
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:02,225
So you can go around tormenting
and killing each other, for all I care!

224
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,645
Both business-wise and character-wise,

225
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,313
I'm disappointed on all fronts.

226
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,943
Let's not ever meet again.
Well, we don't have a reason to.

227
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,280
You should witness God's will
before you go.

228
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,741
Why are you in such a rush?

229
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:26,124
Pastor, didn't I tell you
that there was someone I suspected?

230
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,960
Who planned the route
when the Brazil incident happened?

231
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:32,255
You didn't let the same person
plan the route this time, did you?

232
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,555
Then we have the answer.

233
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:43,975
We know who the rat is,
so why are you dragging this on?

234
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,226
Shit!

235
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,230
You're asking the wrong question.

236
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,148
Now,

237
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:55,403
who benefits the most
if our deal with Chen Zhen falls through?

238
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,200
Unbelievable.

239
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:06,539
The only person who wants Puerto Rico
to be the only option for the pastor...

240
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,957
Who is it?

241
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,506
Squeak.

242
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:20,261
How dare you raise your voice,
you fucking rat?

243
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:29,562
I had Sangjun do something for me
when I left the mansion today.

244
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:34,483
I'm sorry to say that I had him
go through the cars and the rooms...

245
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,070
of everyone that's here.

246
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:42,783
Of course...

247
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,876
that includes you, Mr. Kang, okay?

248
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:01,969
So,

249
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,305
who is this rat?

250
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,183
Do away with him, once and for all.

251
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:37,565
Mr. Kang, what do you think of God's will?

252
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,066
Do you like it?

253
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,454
This classless prick

254
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,374
had conspired with Chen Zhen to kill me.

255
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,340
This was hidden inside
a secret compartment in David's trunk.

256
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,675
A phone that was never surrendered to us.

257
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,722
We looked up the call history
to find the most frequently dialed number.

258
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,351
Fuck.

259
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,145
It was from Chinatown.

260
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,028
Well, David was the most suspicious one.

261
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,822
But the thing is,

262
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,910
no matter how much I think about it,
it's strange.

263
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:35,539
The David I know
is a spineless piece of shit,

264
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:39,043
and he would never do something
like this on his own.

265
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:47,301
He probably just did as Chen Zhen said.

266
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:57,728
But Chen Zhen has shit for brains too.

267
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:06,028
There's got to be one more person
who is controlling everything.

268
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:16,163
Whether there are one or two more people,
sort it out for yourself.

269
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:20,835
Can we please start wrapping up
our business now?

270
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,587
How do we do that?

271
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,298
Puerto Rico?

272
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,216
Yeah.

273
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,302
If we had just gone with Puerto Rico
from the beginning...

274
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:33,389
How do we do that?
Don't you know Chen Zhen took the coke?

275
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,642
Then we get it back! No?

276
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,727
Are you just going to let him have it?

277
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,106
I heard you have some Chinese friends.

278
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:44,525
Make some calls,
and see if they know anything!

279
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:45,985
Don't...

280
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,154
Don't be ridiculous.

281
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:51,991
What? Is it that hard to go around
and make a few calls?

282
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,743
Are you all going to sit back
and be so unproductive?

283
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,289
So frustrating.

284
00:40:58,873 --> 00:40:59,707
Pastor.

285
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,293
Suriname is tiny, right?

286
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:05,129
If we poke around,
we'll get something eventually.

287
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,595
The pastor isn't done talking.

288
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,346
You can go when he's done.

289
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,849
I can't believe this.

290
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:20,436
Are you sure you're Koreans?
Why are you slacking off?

291
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,982
There isn't a second to waste.
Let's go get the coke back.

292
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:26,317
Are we not going to?

293
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:35,826
Deacon.

294
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,497
Let him go.
He says he'll get our coke back.

295
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,016
Wow!

296
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:16,283
SANGMAN, I THINK I'M DONE WITH THE PASTOR
I'M MOVING ON MY OWN NOW

297
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,977
Hey, go back!

298
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,021
Move back!

299
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,652
Go back. Only Chinese can enter.

300
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,071
What is he saying?

301
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:59,577
You motherfucker.

302
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:57,319
I was going to wait a while

303
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:01,323
and tell Jeon
where Chen Zhen had hidden the goods.

304
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:04,493
But the bastard's
suddenly acting all weird.

305
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:12,543
Yes, we were checking that
through a different channel.

306
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:16,463
And you know David,
Jeon's legal advisor, right?

307
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:18,716
He's dead.

308
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:21,135
Jeon shot him.

309
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,553
<i>Yes, I'm aware.</i>

310
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:23,637
Was he...

311
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:26,974
Wait.

312
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:41,572
Damn.

313
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:56,545
Jeon's guys are on my tail.

314
00:45:57,504 --> 00:46:00,007
You have to take care
of this quickly, okay?

315
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,718
Chen Zhen keeps calling

316
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:05,179
and urging me to find a way to kill Jeon.

317
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,057
What the...

318
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,729
-Mr. Kang, what's going on?
<i>-What the fuck?</i>

319
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,481
What the fuck are you doing?

320
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:22,196
-Son of a bitch. You're the one to ask!
-What do you mean?

321
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:24,490
I was on a business call!

322
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:27,534
Business, huh? I like business too.

323
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:38,003
This is Kim Heewon.

324
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:41,256
Our business is a mess, Agent Choi.

325
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,010
Is this a W3 situation?

326
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:48,347
Yes. I'll put K on the phone again.

327
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,225
Hello?

328
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,309
Mr. Kang.

329
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:56,063
He is the NIS agent I told you about.

330
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:59,817
I ask that you cooperate with him.

331
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,737
I don't know what's going on.

332
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:05,614
But okay.

333
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:07,783
I will contact you again.

334
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,624
Let's talk on the way.

335
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:16,875
We can't be seen.

336
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:20,546
Lee and I are here to tail you
on Jeon's order.

337
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:25,551
You started off in Chen Zhen's gang
and made your way to work for Jeon?

338
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:27,386
It's a long story.

339
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:30,305
Were you the one
behind the ambush at the warehouse?

340
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:31,348
Yes.

341
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:33,183
Killing Jeon solves nothing.

342
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,769
If it were that easy,
I would've already done it!

343
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,021
Wow, if you guys are that smart,

344
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:40,107
why do you need a civilian
to do this dangerous job?

345
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,818
How ungrateful.
I'm helping you at a cheap price.

346
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:46,405
I led Jeon to shoot someone else
in order to save your life.

347
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:47,406
How ungrateful.

348
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:50,242
You're the one who should be thanking me.

349
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,514
You will only do
as Mr. Choi and I say from now on.

350
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:15,225
Your dogmatic behavior
can affect the lives of the captives

351
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:17,978
and even all of Suriname. Are we clear?

352
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,066
Yes, I get what you're saying,

353
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,277
but I don't like your tone.

354
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,528
Just how old are you?

355
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:30,282
What? I'm being more respectful
than when I'm being Byun.

356
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,410
We're the same age.

357
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:47,466
You were gonna tell Jeon
where Chen Zhen hid the coke, right?

358
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,426
So you could lead him to Puerto Rico.

359
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:53,055
Yes, but Chen Zhen chickened out.
Things got annoying.

360
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:57,267
I was also told to find
the location of the coke

361
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:59,770
using my past Chinese connections.

362
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:03,690
Is there any place in Chinatown
where he might have hidden the cocaine?

363
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,692
There are about five or six places.

364
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:09,529
But Chinatown is blocked off now,
so there's no way to go in and check.

365
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,205
So I was thinking,

366
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,959
Chen Zhen still answers your calls, right?

367
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:37,265
{\an8}PRESIDENTIAL PALACE, SURINAME

368
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:31,945
Come up.

369
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,274
Come in!

370
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:30,624
General Henk, this is the president.

371
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,961
Which troop is available
to be mobilized now?

372
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,757
To Chinatown.

373
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,997
Everybody, fire!

374
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:39,210
Boss! Soldiers have barged into Chinatown!

375
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:41,046
They're killing our brothers down there!

376
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:48,553
Hurry up!

377
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:51,222
-Get more things!
-Find your places!

378
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:57,062
This is an operation to root out the gang
that is involved in murders and drugs.

379
00:55:57,145 --> 00:56:01,816
We will not harm innocent civilians,
so stay in your homes.

380
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:03,276
I repeat.

381
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:09,491
This is an operation to root out the gang
involved in murders and drugs.

382
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:14,329
We will not harm innocent civilians,

383
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:19,125
so stay in your homes.

384
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:22,605
Shoot them!

385
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:54,364
{\an8}PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE, SURINAME

386
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:57,534
{\an8}The drug ring that has persecuted

387
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,203
and killed the people of Suriname

388
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:01,621
has been rooted out.

389
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:06,292
Innocent lives have been sacrificed
due to this war,

390
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:10,463
but we won in the end.

391
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:17,512
<i>Remind yourself of the motto of Suriname.</i>

392
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:21,558
<i>Justice, piety, and fidelity.</i>

393
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:26,020
<i>Today, we made a statement.</i>

394
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:29,691
<i>With piety, we found justice
and protected our fidelity.</i>

395
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:33,361
<i>We thank God for protecting us.</i>

396
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:37,782
<i>Fellow citizens, let us all pray</i>

397
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:41,119
{\an8}<i>for Suriname tonight.</i>

398
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:42,870
{\an8}<i>Amen.</i>

399
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:52,505
{\an8}NIS SAFE HOUSE, WASHINGTON D.C.

400
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:05,143
Today, the Lord of Hosts
took revenge on His enemies.

401
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:08,605
Today is the day
of vengeance for our Lord.

402
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:11,774
The Lord's sword shall be full
with the enemies it devoured!

403
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,109
-Amen!
-Amen!

404
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:15,028
Today, everything happened

405
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:19,115
as I had prophesized
and as God had promised.

406
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:22,744
Our good brothers
who sacrificed their lives

407
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:25,288
have passed through the gates of heaven.

408
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:30,251
Suriname has now become
the land of God and no one else,

409
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:33,713
so let's lift our praises to the Lord!

410
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:35,673
-Amen!
-Amen!

411
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:08,998
I heard you played a big role in luring
that Chen Zhen bastard out of hiding?

412
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:10,917
I did help.

413
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:21,511
Many upsetting things happened,
but you stood your ground.

414
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:22,887
I'll give you that.

415
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:25,682
What tree is more firmly rooted
than the tree of money?

416
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:28,601
But after a few big storms,

417
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,521
it's gotten harder to hold out.

418
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:37,610
Pastor.

419
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,033
How did it go?

420
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:46,369
Of Chen Zhen's Western Europe dealers,

421
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:48,413
the mainland Chinese are uncooperative.

422
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:50,957
If we get rid of those guys
and find a new route,

423
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,417
we will need more time.

424
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,462
So how long will it take
to sell all our goods?

425
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:57,797
At least

426
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:00,717
three to four months.

427
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:29,912
Hey there, Kang.

428
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:33,416
What's up? Have you been eating well?

429
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:36,335
<i>Hey, I had so much for breakfast
that my stomach's about to burst.</i>

430
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:39,088
<i>Sangman, Pastor Jeon would like
to speak with you.</i>

431
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:41,758
<i>It's been a while, Elder Goo.</i>

432
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:43,342
Oh, yes.

433
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:44,677
<i>So, what is it?</i>

434
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:45,636
SANGMAN

435
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:49,015
I'll make it simple.

436
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:52,268
Is the Puerto Rico route still available?

437
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:56,063
Why do you ask?

438
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:01,444
I was wondering
if we could let bygones be bygones

439
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:03,946
<i>and work together again.</i>

440
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:06,449
How could I trust you?

441
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:10,536
You might back out again
at the last minute.

442
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:14,457
I understand your concern.

443
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:20,129
So I'm going to do something
that will restore your trust in me.

444
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:26,677
I don't think it'll be easy
to trust each other again.

445
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:28,012
<i>I know that.</i>

446
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:31,557
Let me just confirm one thing.

447
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:36,103
If I send all the goods at once,
will I be paid immediately?

448
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:45,655
Well, after our deal fell through,
the funds were sent elsewhere.

449
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:47,740
So I would need to check.

450
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:51,452
But by the time Kang arrives
with the goods,

451
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:53,746
I should have the cash
to send back with him.

452
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:55,289
But before that,

453
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,875
what's this something
you're saying you'll do?

454
01:03:57,959 --> 01:04:00,211
If you confirm that for me,

455
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:03,005
I will send the goods
to Puerto Rico immediately.

456
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:09,262
"Immediately"?

457
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:12,098
Just how soon is that?

458
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:19,605
It isn't that hard to ask for a plane
from the Surinamese government, so...

459
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:28,114
I can get it shipped in three hours.

460
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:30,199
Will you accept the goods?

461
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:36,664
You have a deal.

462
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:39,917
Good, it's settled.

463
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:50,678
Great work, Sihyeon.

464
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:52,597
You did great.

465
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,181
-Good work.
-Great work!

466
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:58,185
Mr. Kang, let's get ready.

467
01:04:59,478 --> 01:05:00,479
Nice.

468
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,608
The deep-rooted tree
finally bears some fruit.

469
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:51,544
