BUT CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
HAVE BEEN REIMAGINED FOR DRAMATIC PURPOSES

00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:51,676
You will be transferred
to Sint Maarten and put on trial.

4
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,344
Drag him out.

{\an8}PRISON, SINT MAARTEN

7
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:06,918
How many times do I have to tell you?
I never smuggled any drugs.

8
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,587
How am I supposed to know that?

9
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,926
Isn't it the embassy's job
to help a citizen who's been wronged?

10
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:18,429
Shouldn't you be looking into this
and sending me a lawyer first?

11
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,807
Wait, you want me
to fill out the paperwork?

12
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,934
I told you, I'm in prison right now!

13
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:28,356
<i>Is this what you were planning to do
when you flew out there?</i>

14
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,150
<i>What were you thinking, dealing drugs?!</i>

15
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,402
I swear I didn't do anything.

16
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,738
You have to believe me.

17
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:41,119
Did you get a call from Suriname?

18
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,871
Eungsoo didn't contact you?

19
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,123
<i>No one called me.</i>

20
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,541
Honey,

21
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,127
I'll look for a lawyer.

22
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,546
You get started on your appeal, okay?

23
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:55,133
Getting a lawyer costs
tens of millions of won.

24
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,509
We can't do that.

25
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,970
We have to come up with the money somehow!

26
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,514
I'll break our lease.

27
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,183
No, Hye-jin!

28
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,727
Don't touch the apartment.

29
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,479
I don't ever want the kids to live
in a rented home.

30
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,942
Besides, by the looks of things,
it won't be easy to overturn the charges.

31
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,444
Don't waste any money.

32
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,362
Honey...

33
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,617
I'm just so scared...

34
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,996
<i>Hey, this is not a big deal, okay?</i>

35
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,666
You know I always figure something out.

36
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:30,293
Okay?

37
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,587
Let me talk to the kids.

38
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,514
<i>Dad!</i>

39
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,308
Hey, Hyungju.

40
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,937
Daddy's on a business trip.
I won't be able to call for a while.

41
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,106
So listen to your mom,
take care of your sister, and...

42
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,579
Dad's not there.

43
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,675
Daddy's just very busy, that's all.

44
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:23,805
He'll call back,
so let's pray for him while we wait.

45
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,682
-All right?
-Okay.

46
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,896
Yes, I understand.

47
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,274
Please wait a little longer.

48
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,654
Yes, I'll call you again.

49
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:25,825
Who are you?

50
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:30,163
Ingu, you look terrible, man.
What happened to you?

51
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,415
Who's this crazy bastard?

52
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:36,002
What the hell is all this?
Life really is a hellhole, right?

53
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:40,214
I'm from National Intelligence Service.
Act like we're friends.

54
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,057
Here.

55
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,333
I'm Choi Changho from the NIS.

56
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,544
Are you here because of the cocaine?
It wasn't me.

57
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,505
I know nothing about that!

58
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,382
I kept calling the embassy, but...

59
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,634
Yes, I am well aware.

60
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:28,054
I'm here to help you, Mr. Kang,
so don't worry too much.

61
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,623
How do you know I'm not guilty though?

62
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,626
We already know someone in Suriname
who'd be involved in such activity.

63
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,754
You know Pastor Jeon, right?

64
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,757
Yes. What about Pastor Jeon?

65
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:08,678
Jeon Yohan is the man responsible
for putting you in this situation.

66
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,270
{\an8}Jeon Yohan.

67
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,064
A pastor at a Korean church in Paramaribo.

68
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,817
But his true identity

69
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,155
is a drug trafficker who controls 60%
of Europe's narcotics distribution.

70
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,949
The Cocaine Godfather of Suriname.

71
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,385
What on earth are you talking about?

72

{\an8}INCHEON, 1990

74
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,077
{\an8}<i>Eighteen years ago,</i>

75
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,081
{\an8}<i>there was a massive operation to arrest
a meth-smuggling gang in Incheon.</i>

76
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,544
<i>The operation was successful,
and the network was shut down.</i>

77
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:11,175
<i>But the man in charge of distribution</i>

78
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,803
<i>slipped away with ten kilograms of meth.</i>

79
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,888
<i>That man was Jeon Yohan.</i>

80
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,017
<i>Later, the police tracked down
his escape route.</i>

81
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,062
<i>He had crawled more than 14 kilometers
through the sewers.</i>

82
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:27,733
It appears as though he continued
to deal meth after the incident.

83
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:32,488
But three years after,
he popped up on the radar again

84
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,823
for a different reason.

GEOJE CONSTRUCTION

Our company, Geoje Construction,
is targeting

87
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:45,209
the top 5%
non-Korean earners in East Asia.

88
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:49,880
We are discreetly working on a project
with the government.

89
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,925
That is, getting Geoje Mongdol Beach

90
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:57,888
on the list
of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

91
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:09,817
By the way,
what's his relationship with the VIP?

92
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:15,156
There are relationships in this world
that can't necessarily be spoken about.

93
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,201
You know the president
was born in Geoje, right?

94
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,079
I can tell you this.

95
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,875
That man also comes from Geoje Island.

96
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,253
It will most definitely become
a popular spot in Korea!

{\an8}GEOJE CONSTRUCTION
INVESTMENT CONTRACT

98
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,159
<i>Jeon Yohan's business, of course, failed.</i>

99
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:03,371
<i>After all, he never even got started
after he took the investors' money.</i>

100
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,333
<i>But his victims
couldn't file a police report.</i>

101
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,795
<i>Because before they knew it,
they were already addicted to his meth.</i>

102
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:25,976
<i>They started seeking out Jeon,
only to ask for more meth.</i>

103
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,977
Mr. Jeon,

104
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:34,110
these men have no intention of making
an issue out of the failed Geoje project.

105
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,821
Your used-car business in Cambodia,

106

I'll invest in that too.

107

Just let us have a glass
of your iced champagne.

108
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,788
My family doesn't get worked up
over such small amounts of money.

109
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,289
Here.

110
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,795
Here, you can use this
to get your business started.

with his fraudulent crimes.</i>

114

There you go.

What? That's it?

117
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:30,916
Hey, you only have to say a few lines.
What more do you expect?

118
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,961
I'm even giving you a bonus.

Aw!

00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,229
-Hey, grab that bastard!
-Where are you going?

Watch out!

What's up, you sons of bitches?

but to name-drop the president?

Don't kill me! Sir!

I'm so sorry.
I should never have done that!

You know what kind of place

Jeon realized it was too risky
to stick to the same methods,

143
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,920
so he made some drastic changes.

Amen.

<i>He used his female followers as mules
to smuggle drugs into Europe.</i>

207
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,037
<i>Even when they got caught,</i>

208
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:32,874
<i>they kept their mouths shut
because of their blind faith in Jeon.</i>

209
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:41,008
<i>And he trained the men to be soldiers.</i>

210
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,428
<i>He still used drugs
to make his followers obey.</i>

211
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:49,266
<i>Only this time, he switched from meth
to cocaine, which they take regularly.</i>

212
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:53,061
<i>Just like that,
Jeon created hundreds of zealots</i>

213
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,398
<i>and became the godfather
of Suriname's underworld</i>

<i>and its sole cocaine kingpin.</i>

218
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,911
is right here in Suriname!

We will build heaven, heaven in Suriname!

220

this man put cocaine in my skates?

Yes.

223
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:36,897
Jeon's smuggling route is
currently limited to Europe.

224
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,359
We think he was using
your shipping containers

225
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:44,029
to test a new route into Korea, Mr. Kang.

Fuck.

227
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:58,543
You know my friend, Park Eungsoo, right?
Where is he right now?

228
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,884
These messages were in your voice mail.

<i>Ingu, this is Eungsoo.</i>

<i>Call me once you hear this.</i>

231

<i>Hey, where are you, man?</i>

232

<i>Why can't I reach you?
Call me back, quick.</i>

233
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,859
<i>I have no idea what's going on.
Listen, Ingu...</i>

234
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:26,780
<i>I heard something
while I was in Chinatown today.</i>

235
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,699
<i>You know Pastor Jeon?</i>

236
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:33,703
<i>The Chinese folks told me
that he's a drug dealer.</i>

237
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,540
<i>He helped us because...</i>

238
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,921
Is Eungsoo still in Suriname?

239
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,215
Can I call him right now?

240
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:56,643
Unfortunately, Mr. Park has passed away.

241
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,236
Why?

242
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,365
Why did he die?

243
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:14,077
He appears to have been killed
by members of Jeon's gang.

244
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:33,555
I'm sorry for your loss.

245
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,366
Like I said,

246
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,037
there is no treaty regulating extradition
between Suriname and Korea,

247
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,207
so there is no way
to arrest Jeon right now.

248
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,336
That is why I'm here
to ask you for help, Mr. Kang.

249
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:14,763
My help?

250
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,057
You're asking me for help?

251
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,392
Strictly speaking,

252
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,479
we'd be helping each other out.

253
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:35,742
If we want to arrest Jeon,
we'd need to lure him to another country,

254
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:39,246
but our operation to drag him out
of Suriname already failed.

255
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,957
So the only option left

256
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:45,710
is to try and get him
to distribute his cocaine to the US.

257
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:50,882
The US can mobilize its army to arrest
those who smuggle drugs into the US,

258
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:54,844
even without permission
from the country involved.

259
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,473
If we can get Jeon to start shipping
his cocaine to the US,

260
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:02,519
the DEA will send their own men
into Suriname.

261
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,564
So what do you want me to do?

262
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:09,067
I would like you to return to Suriname,
get close to Jeon,

263
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,487
and convince him to start selling
his cocaine in the US.

264
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:19,369
Our agent on the ground
will ensure your safety, Mr. Kang.

265
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,747
And most importantly, if we catch Jeon,

266
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,083
all the false charges against you
will be dropped.

267
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:29,713
Let's be real.
It's not like I'm a soldier or a cop.

268
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,631
Why should I do anything like that?

269
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:36,678
Mr. Kang,

270
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:40,223
we have no other options.

271
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,850
Please help us.

272
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,185
You are our only option.

273
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,400
So, you're saying

274
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,486
I'm the only one who can do this, right?

275
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:57,490
Well, then, instead of trying
to get all emotional,

276
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,534
let's approach it like a business deal.

277
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,202
What?

278
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,497
I lost 500 million won in Suriname.
That was all I had.

279
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:07,417
I needed that to send my kids to college.
I mean...

280
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,794
Honestly, I don't care about my own life,

281
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,797
but I absolutely need to get
that 500 million won back.

282
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,634
I'm going to be straightforward with you.

283
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:18,470
You're asking me to do a service for you.

284
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:22,307
I'll help you,
but you need to help me too.

285
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:25,310
If you pay me 500 million won,

286
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,687
I'll do the job.

287
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,529
All right. We'll get the money for you.

288

I, Choi Changho of the NIS,
promise to give Mr. Kang Ingu

289
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,829
<i>500 million won for his special service.</i>

290
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:49,501
<i>That's 200 upon release from jail
and 300 once Jeon is in custody.</i>

291
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,466
So, what should we do first?

292
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:02,889
<i>Jeon's bodyguard from Nigeria
is also serving time here.</i>

293
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:07,143
<i>For seven months of your incarceration,
we plan on using him</i>

294
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,978
<i>to deceive Jeon.</i>

295
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,272
And how will we do that?

296
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,779
<i>We will provide you with the goods.</i>

297
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,740
<i>Distribute the drugs within the prison.</i>

298
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,285

00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,658
MAIN ENTRANCE

312
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,495
Hey, Ingu!

313
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,877
Hey, you did it! Good work.

314
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,631
You're really awkward, you know.

315
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:26,402
This is a colleague of mine.

316
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,571
-Hello.
-Hello, Mr. Kang.

317
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,373
The 200 million won promised
will be transferred every month

318
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,959
over the next ten months
into your wife's bank account.

319
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,337
So you've already changed our deal?

320
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,047
I can't work with you like this.

321
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,049
It's a lot of money.

322
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:53,096
This is a precaution we must take,
so please understand.

323
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:57,725
You're going to pay monthly
because you can't trust me 100%?

324
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,940
But make it five months,
so 40 million a month. All right?

325
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:06,567
I don't want to stay there for a year.

326
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:10,989
Of the 40, I want you to send 30 million
to me and the rest to Eungsoo's family.

327
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,283
They must be having a rough time.

328
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,911
All right. We will do that.

329
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,831
How about we go over
the first steps we need to take

330
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:23,084
to get Jeon to start
exporting cocaine to the US?

331
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,212
Whatever you say.
You're the boss who's paying me.

332
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,591
Jeon Yohan is the man who dominates
the cocaine trade routes

333
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,386
with the help of the government,
the army, and the police.

334
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,848
To keep his Korean followers
and expand his cocaine empire,

335
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,683
he needs more cash.

336
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:42,645
That's why he's been eyeing Korea
as a new route for export and...

337
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:49,694
This bastard stuffed
my skates with cocaine

338
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,696
to test things out and failed.

339
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:56,075
He still hasn't found a way into Korea.

340
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,203
Chen Zhen, the Chinese gang boss.

341
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,329
He does it all.

342
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,291
Smuggling, casinos, karaoke bars,
ripping off local fishermen.

343
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,834
Anything profitable.

344
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:09,505
His main business is smuggling meth
to Chinatowns throughout Europe.

345
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:13,509
Since profits have reached their limit,
he's also looking to get into cocaine.

346
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,095
He hasn't figured out a way to do it yet.

347
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,016
Our plan is to use this point
to our advantage.

348
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:20,933
Correct?

349
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,855
Once our first step succeeds,

350
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:29,442
you will be put under direct threat
from Jeon Yohan.

351
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,986
If you ever find yourself
in a life-threatening situation,

352
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,280
drop everything and run to the US Embassy.

353
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,783
But I won't get paid if I run away.

354
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,414
Honey, it's me.

355
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,583
<i>Where are you, sweetie?
Are you at the airport?</i>

356
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,835
<i>When will you arrive?</i>

357
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,505
Honey, there's something
I didn't tell you.

358
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:54,300
I have some work to do in Suriname
before going back to Korea.

359
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,219
What do you mean?

360
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,679
Why are you going back
to that dangerous country?

361
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,682
<i>Some publisher sent me
30 million won yesterday.</i>

362
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,767
<i>Is it because of that?</i>

363
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:06,354
The thing is, I made a deal
with the publishing company

364
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:09,190
to write a book
about doing business in South America.

365
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:13,027
So I need to go to Suriname
with the writer for research.

366
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,779
What are you on about?

367
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,447
Tell me what's really going on!

368
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,407
What do you mean?

369
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,701
This is what I always do.
Provide for my family.

370
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,953
How are the kids?

371
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:23,955
<i>Sweetie,</i>

372
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,623
why are you doing this?

373
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,458
Be honest with me. Please!

374
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:34,423
Did you find another woman there?

375
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,801
A woman? I'd never.

376
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:39,303
Then why would you ever go back there?

377
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:46,811
Hye-jin, I'll explain everything in detail
once I get back to Korea.

378
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,020
<i>You trust me, right?</i>

379
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,233
I need to stay in Suriname
for about five months,

380
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:55,945
so use the money for our lease
and living expenses.

381
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:58,281
Never put our house up for sale, okay?

382
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:03,161
I have to board the plane soon.
Let me talk to the kids.

383
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,247
-Dad!
-Dad!

384
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,792
Hey, Hyungju, Minseo.
Are you studying hard?

385
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:10,960
<i>-Yes!
-Yes!</i>

386
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:16,799
Good. Minseo, you have a knack for sports,
especially swimming and tae kwon do.

387
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:21,053
So think of them as your future jobs,
and give it your best, okay?

388
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,472
Okay, Dad. Tae! Kwon!

389
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,683
I'm doing my best,

390
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,935
but why aren't you coming home, Dad?

391
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,689
To make sure that our family is happy,

392
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:34,233
Daddy needs to take a difficult path.

393
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,903
Why do you have to do something difficult?

394
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:41,282
That's hard for me to explain to you
at the moment.

395
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,534
I'll tell you everything when I get back.

396
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,537
Until then, be good
and listen to your mom, okay?

397
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,999
I'm going to check all your report cards
when I get back.

398
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:52,001
So you have to study hard. Okay?

399
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,169
Dad.

400
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,172
Make sure you come back safely.

401
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,675
All right, my son.

402
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,386
I'll come home soon with a lot of money.

403
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,181
Bye.

404
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:14,440
{\an8}JOHAN ADOLF PENGEL INT'L AIRPORT
SURINAME

405
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,219
Some Korean called Fishman is here.

406
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,179
He's looking for the boss.

407
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:28,931
What should I do?

408
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,254
He's adorable!

409
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,896
Please forgive me, I beg you!

410
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:49,131
Hang him up at the Chinatown entrance.

411
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:52,051
Let everyone see this disloyal bastard.

412
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,385
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

413
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,432
Come here.

414
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:10,754
Boss.

415
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,882
Let's listen to what he has to say.
What do you think?

416
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,375
You're crazy.

417
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:10,814
Chen Zhen said it'll take a few days,
so we should wait.

418
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,777
I doubt he will give up the Korean market.
It's tons of money.

419
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,449
It's been a while since I had a drink.
I'm already drunk.

{\an8}NIS SAFE HOUSE, BRAZIL

421
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:33,921
{\an8}Introducing cocaine to the Asian market
is like digging up a gold mine.

422
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:37,591
Chen Zhen won't be able to resist
the smell of money.

423
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,593
<i>That's what I'm saying, man.</i>

424
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,762
<i>The smell is so strong too.</i>

425
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,264
Anyway, get a foot massage
or something in Brazil.

426
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,766
I'll call you again.

427
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:48,060
Okay. Take care, Sangman.

428
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:56,276
Get some rest
until we hear from Chen Zhen.

429
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,695
Get some sleep.

430
00:44:58,445 --> 00:44:59,279
Yes, sir.

00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:35,853
Follow me.

Byun Kitae!
What do you think you're doing?!

439
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,339
-Move out of the way.
-What?

440
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:28,757
You're not my boss.

441
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:30,968
What are you doing?

442
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,596
You're crazy!

443
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,391
Are you fucking serious right now?

444
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:21,601
All right.

445
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,479
We still have other matters to resolve.

446
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:26,231
What do you say we fight it out?

447
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:27,691
You dirty traitor!

448
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:29,943
You should be grateful
that we let you live!

449
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:30,902
Fuck you!

450
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:34,906
ON BEHALF OF GOD

451
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,200
Stop it.

452
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:43,165
Breaking the agreement means war.

453
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:51,506
We're not here to start a war, right?

454
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:53,550
Byun Kitae.

455
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:55,969
Listen very carefully.

456
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:59,347
If any of my boys lose
so much as a drop of blood here today,

457
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,600
I will kill all of you.

458
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:10,609
Hey, who are you to barge in
without an invitation?

459
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:11,943
Can't you see we're working?

460
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:16,573
I need you to come with us, Mr. Kang.

461
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:18,867
The pastor is looking for you.

462
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:37,594
Hey, mister.

463
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,847
Even for a cult,
that's some serious bullshit.

464
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,767
Who are you to mess
with someone else's business?

465
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:46,228
Accept the pastor's calling.

466
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:49,731
And if anything blasphemous comes
out of your mouth again,

467
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,733
something terrible will happen to you.

468
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:57,447
Mr. Kang,
if you don't come with us right now,

469
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,157
you'll die.

470
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:01,910
Come with us
when we're asking you nicely, okay?

471
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,624
Mister, let's go already.

472
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,459
I don't know what this is about,
but let's go.

473
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,045
You made the right decision.

474
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:57,257
What can you even do with people
who don't speak your language?

475
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,835
Were you in Suriname last year?

476
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,253
Have we met?

477
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:36,838
For a while...

478
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:41,551
Oh, where all the cocaine
comes from, right?

479
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:46,389
Explain to me why I need to answer you,
and I will.

480
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,228
How about you stick
to a need-to-know basis?

481
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:53,355
Knowing too much...

482
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:57,234
Okay.

483
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:00,320
Let's go.

484
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:34,497
Oh my goodness gracious, Brother Kang!

485
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:39,544
It's been a while. Have you been well?

486
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:43,506
What a load of bullshit.

487
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:48,386
Didn't expect to hear that from you.
Who are you to tell me to come and go?

488
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,180
Brother.

489
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:53,266
Do you know what "amen" means?

490
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:56,019
It's derived from ancient Hebrew.

491
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:59,022
It means, "I sincerely hope that happens."

492
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:04,277
I prayed with all my heart
that I'd meet you again,

493
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:08,073
and God has answered. Amen.

494
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,282
-Amen.
-Amen.

495
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:17,248
That is the reason why you are here,
in front of me.

496
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:20,710
Brother Kang.

497
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,797
Let me ask you one thing.

498
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,549
If you're not honest with me,

499
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:30,762
the wrath of God will lead you
to the swamp of death.

500
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:34,891
What is it?

501
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:40,063
Why did you come back to Suriname?

502
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:45,944
Why do you think? I came to make money.

503
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:53,118
I'll ask you one more time.
Tell me the truth.

504
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,081
Who knows?

505
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:05,255
Why the fuck are you back,
you son of a bitch?

506
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:58,404
