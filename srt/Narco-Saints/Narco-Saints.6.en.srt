THIS SERIES IS INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY

2
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:11,761
BUT CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
HAVE BEEN REIMAGINED FOR DRAMATIC PURPOSES

3
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,061
What the...

4
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:24,315
Hey, Mr. Kang.

5
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,443
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,865
You son of a bitch.

7
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:35,577
You think I don't know anything,
don't you?

8
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:00,935
Eungsoo.

{\an8}PMC BLUE TARGET BRIEFING ROOM
FLORIDA, USA

10
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,481
{\an8}<i>Dad, are you really coming back?</i>

11
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,233
Of course.

12
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,652
I've been looking at your report card.

13
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:59,280
It always makes me feel good. Have you
been spending time with your sister?

14
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,783
<i>She only likes sports.</i>

15
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,786
<i>She's terrible at math,
so I've been teaching her.</i>

16
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,955
<i>But I'm good at math too!</i>

17
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,999
It's all right.
Just keep doing what you're best at.

18
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,210
-Hyungju, put your mom on the phone.
<i>-Okay.</i>

19
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,338
<i>So when will you be back?</i>

20
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:19,509
If it works out, tomorrow.
I'll be back this weekend at the latest.

21
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,177
<i>Come home already.</i>

22
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,846
<i>The kids are growing so fast.</i>

23
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,015
<i>I gotta go. They have to go to bed.</i>

24
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,642
Okay, all right. Bye.

25
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,703
{\an8}SOUTHWEST FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
USA

26
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,957
As soon as the plane with the cocaine
arrives in Puerto Rico,

27
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,959
the DEA will start the attack.

28
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:57,880
You getting on that plane
and out of Suriname is the top priority.

29
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,758
Well, we're all done here.
Why would I stay?

30
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,760
<i>I'm sick of Suriname.</i>

31
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,596
Okay, then I'll see you
in Puerto Rico soon.

32
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,184
I'm so sorry I'm late.

33
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,645
All right.

34
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:24,532
Wow, the weather today is great.
Don't you agree?

35
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:28,786
"What you decide will be done,
and light will shine on your ways."

36
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,249
Well, it must be a sign
that everything will go smoothly.

37
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,753
Since our faith flows like a river,
God will surely protect us.

38
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,379
Shall we go?

39
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,889
How do you like the smell of coca?

40
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,601
This is what you call real phytoncide.

41
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,396
{\an8}OFFICE OF NIS DIRECTOR, WASHINGTON D.C.

42
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,107
What? A guarantor?

43
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,276
You punk.

44
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:27,029
You want the agency to be their guarantor?
You know that's over the line.

45
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,240
Just drop it!

46
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:32,660
Director, Jeon is loading his goods
on the plane right now,

47
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,745
and the DEA is ready to go into action.

48
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:38,291
I can capture him now in Suriname.
Do you really want us to quit?

49
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,553
Is everything all set?

50
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,180
-Are you sure?
<i>-Yes, of course.</i>

51
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,223
All that's left is your decision.

52
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,101
You're the one
who's been overseeing this operation.

53
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,188
How could we dare move
without your final say?

54
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,401
Son of a bitch.

55
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,820
You and your silver tongue.

56
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:11,115
The whole team is waiting
for your resolute decision.

57
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,200
Please give your approval.

58
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:27,757
Fine. I'll provide a guarantee.
Bring me a happy ending.

59
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,843
<i>And I'll deal with you later
when you return to the office.</i>

60
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,970
<i>-Hang up now!</i>
-Thank you, Director.

61
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,778
Pastor, the plane is ready.

62
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:50,905
Load the goods.

63
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,794
SANGMAN

64
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,299
Hey!

65
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,927
<i>Hey there, Kang.
Have you been eating well?</i>

66
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,138
Yeah, just had lunch, and I'm about
to have lemonade for dessert.

67
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:20,643
Everything's ready on our side.
I'll text you the final location and time.

68
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,062
I'll be flying to Puerto Rico now.

69
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,313
Excellent.

70
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,691
Great work.
Let's drink to celebrate later.

71
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:30,611
Yeah, make sure
you arrive safely with the goods later.

72
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:31,946
You know what I mean?

73
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,532
Of course I do. What do you take me for?

74
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,536
Anyway, you eat that in-flight meal, okay?

75
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,621
I'll see you later, yeah.

76
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,837
Oh, I got a text.

77
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,509
The time of our rendezvous
is 1:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time,

78
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,262
and the location
is Runway Three at Vieques Airport.

79
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,515
Okay, then.

80
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,350
Shall we go?

81
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,274
{\an8}VIEQUES AIRPORT, PUERTO RICO

82
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:45,227
The president even sent in
the best pilot from the Air Force.

83
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,814
He's finally doing things right
after you gave him a good scolding.

84
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:53,110
All right, then. I'll deliver it safely
and come back with loads of cash.

85
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,404
Hey.

86
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,705
You should stay here with me.

87
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,874
What? Why?

88
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,586
I have something to discuss with you.
Yes, that'd be better.

89
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,838
Deacon Lee will be going

90
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,216
to Puerto Rico alone.

91
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,717
Yes, Pastor.

92
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:26,102
Pastor, you know that's not
the right way to do business.

93
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,771
It's only right
that I deliver the goods myself.

94
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,107
Isn't that the traditional Korean way?

95
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,276
You've got a good point.

96
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,278
Then should I go too?

97
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,281
It'll be tiring for you...

98
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,450
Okay, then. Let's go.

99
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,622
Why bother going
when you'll be coming right back?

100
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,499
Let's just go and drink some soju.

101
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:54,463
I'm not sure Sangman would agree to this.

102
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,844
We don't need his permission
for everything, do we?

103
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,309
All right. Let me call Sangman, then.

104
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,696
Kang, you should still come yourself.

105
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,157
Get on a civil aircraft right now.

106
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,743
You're the key player.
You need to be there.

107
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,661
<i>I don't think I can.</i>

108
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,914
<i>After the deal is finished,
I'll see what I should do.</i>

109
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,750
That's just not acceptable.

110
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,919
Should I speak with Pastor Jeon?

111
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,921
<i>I don't think he'll change his mind.</i>

112
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,800
<i>I think the pastor and the deacon
discussed it amongst themselves.</i>

113
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:40,718
All right.

114
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:42,970
Then I'll

115
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,682
call you once the deal is over, okay?

116
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,852
<i>All right. That will do. Bye.</i>

117
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:01,781
Mr. Kang couldn't get on the plane.
Jeon didn't let him.

118
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,866
You don't think Jeon caught on, do you?

119
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,785
If he did, he would've backed out.

120
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,870
We'll have to think
he's just being cautious.

121
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,289
Lee Sangjun is coming instead.

122
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,958
What if there is no coke on the plane?

123
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:18,422
What if he loaded fake goods
to see how we'd react?

124
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,598
We have to ensure Mr. Kang's safety first.

125
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,521
ONE MILLION COUPONS FOR NEW CUSTOMERS
WE AIM FOR SAFE BUSINESS

126
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,493
ON BEHALF OF GOD

127
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,373
Are you disappointed you couldn't go?

128
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,004
Well, not necessarily, but it's a pity.

129
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,174
I heard they prepared a pool party.

130
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:05,845
Mr. Kang.

131
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,306
The pool party is not what's important.

132
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:11,934
Right.

133
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:20,609
Byun, what are you doing?
The best part's about to start.

134
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,735
Yes, Pastor.

135
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:28,033
<i>In this world, no one tells me</i>

136
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:32,121
<i>Which is a forest</i>

137
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:38,544
<i>And which is a swamp</i>

138
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,166
Why do you think Jeon made me stay?
Is he onto us?

139
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,835
It does seem he's holding you hostage.

140
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,505
But I'm not sure
what his ulterior motive is.

141
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,550
I'll create a distraction,

142
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,303
so when I give you a signal,
escape to the US Embassy.

143
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,806
But what happens when he finds out?
It'll all be over.

144
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,561
You don't need to worry about that.

145
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,230
Worry about your own life first.

146
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,901
Hey, I'm afraid the operation
I'm risking my life for will be ruined.

147
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,445
What are you gonna do
if Jeon gets wind of it and runs away?

148
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,865
If he runs into the jungle,
you'll never find him.

149
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,868
I'll make sure that doesn't happen.

150
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,120
How can I trust you?

151
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:59,291
If the NIS were so good at their job,
why would I even be here?

152
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,255
I'll mess with his car
so he can't get away.

153
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,592
You distract him and stall for time. Okay?

154
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,053
Wow, do you think you can pull that off?

155
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:16,225
Hey, I ran an auto repair shop
for ten years. I got this.

156
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,728
What are you two talking about
so intimately?

157
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:27,277
From where I was standing,
you were whispering like good friends.

158
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,529
Are you two close now?

159
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,698
Like hell.

160
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,492
This prick kept flipping the meat
like an unstable person,

161
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,578
so I told him not to,
and he's been yapping like a bird.

162
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:40,666
This idiot kept running his mouth
when I was doing it the way you taught me!

163
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,877
Did you really teach him
to grill pork like this?

164
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,672
After my parents died when I was nine,

165
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:51,385
the very first job that I had
was delivering meat in Majang-dong.

166
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:56,432
So when it comes to meat,
I am way more knowledgeable than you.

167
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,853
I mean, even if so,
if you grill pork like this,

168
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,771
won't you lose all the juice?

169
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,772
Hey.

170
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,984
Stop spitting on the meat
and go grab some sausages.

171
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,485
The Johnsonville ones. Okay?

172
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,112
Yes, sir.

173
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:19,056
All right, I got it.
I'll call you later, so just stop.

174
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:21,285
Hey. What took you so long?
The meat's ready.

175
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,789
I was on the phone with my wife
about my kids' cram school stuff.

176
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,457
Is that all the Johnsonville?

177
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,878
No, there were too many for me to carry.

178
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,508
Thank you for coming all this way,
Deacon Lee, yes.

179
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,094
Who is this?

180
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,389
Oh.

181
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,184
Not someone I should be introducing
out in the open.

182
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:30,729
In short, he'll be helping us
with the US Forces in Korea.

183
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,315
Shall we check the goods first?

184
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,902
The pastor ordered me
to check the money first.

185
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,204
I agree that money
is more important than life,

186
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:51,124
but out here, it's like announcing
that we're dealing drugs.

187
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,835
Once I check the goods,
I'll get you the money immediately.

188
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:00,592
I know.

189
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,307
Give me a minute.

190
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:28,370
Man, does that pork taste
like rib eye or what?

191
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,415
It's as miraculous
as the feeding of the 5,000.

192
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,507
As expected,
he told me to check the money first.

193
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,261
My God, this is frustrating.

194
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,639
Are you really that out of touch?

195
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,525
All right. How about this?

196
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:01,236
Why don't we move the plane to the hangar,

197
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,071
and then you can check the money inside?

198
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,867
My men are waiting
with the money in there, all right?

199
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,828
Let's stop drawing attention.

200
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:34,204
Okay, then. The money's here.
See for yourself.

201
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,228
Mr. Lee Sangjun, this is the NIS.
Put your hands up.

202
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,036
Damn it!

203
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,383
I believe in God, the Father Almighty...

204
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,886
Lee, it's all over.

205
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,389
Do you have any idea just how much
you all have disgraced our country?

206
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,892
It's all over. Let's go.

207
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,978
...suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, died...

208
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,942
...the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins,

209
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:50,614
the resurrection of the body,
and life everlasting. Amen.

210
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,007
We got it.

211
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,188
{\an8}PMC BLUE TARGET BASE, VENEZUELA

212
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:53,468
<i>Sir, Jeon's still sending messages to Lee,
asking for an update.</i>

213
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:54,553
<i>What should we do? Over.</i>

214
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:57,639
Look through their old messages
and send a similar reply.

215
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:02,143
Throw him off the scent
until we cross the Suriname border.

216
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,813
Buy us time any way you can. Over.

217
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,583
Has Mr. Goo contacted you yet?

218
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,794
No, he said he'd call
after the deal is over.

219
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,421
Why? Is Lee not responding?

220
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:56,865
PASTOR

221
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,041
Jeon will be arrested in 30 minutes.

222
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:10,128
Do you think he'll take the blame
for all the things that have happened?

223
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,589
He'll need a fall guy.

224
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,758
Who do you think it will be?

225
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,678
We shouldn't have teamed up
with a heathen.

226
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,056
It was not the path of God.

227
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:51,920
Damn.

228
00:27:56,299 --> 00:28:00,637
The maximum sentence for drug trafficking
is ten years in Korea.

229
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,851
But if the DEA
were to apply domestic laws,

230
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:10,105
you'll be stuck in a US prison
until you die, no...

231
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,273
even after you die.

232
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:14,651
So choose.

233
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:22,826
You cannot persecute or threaten me
with the laws of man.

234
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,704
I know. I know that very well.

235
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,790
But that's just how it's going to go.

236
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,876
We will extenuate your offense
and negotiate

237
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,587
between the DEA
and the Korean prosecution.

238
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:38,383
All you have to do is lie to Jeon
over the phone, okay?

239
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,224
PASTOR

240
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:51,938
Now,

241
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,442
I am going to pick this up,
whether you like it or not.

242
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:58,862
And your sentence
will all depend on this call.

243
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,614
Is that understood?

244
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,336
<i>Hello?</i>

245
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,589
Yes, Pastor.

246
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,924
<i>Why haven't you been picking up?</i>

247
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,845
<i>Hello? Did something happen?</i>

248
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,684
The reception's bad in here.

249
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:34,439
I checked the cash and handed over
the goods. It all went smoothly.

250
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:37,859
When I get back,

251
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,404
let's have a drink to celebrate.

252
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,032
<i>Is that so?</i>

253
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,618
<i>All right.</i>

254
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:51,247
<i>I'll be chilling
a bottle of nice champagne,</i>

255
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,291
<i>so come back in one piece.</i>

256
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:54,751
Yes, Pastor.

257
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:02,759
It all went well.
He's coming back with the money.

258
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:05,345
I gotta go prepare some good champagne.

259
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:06,573
LAST INVITATION FOR VIP
VISIT HERE IN TEN MINUTES

260
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,682
Mr. Kang,

261
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:35,101
what are you doing in Puerto Rico?

262
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,896
What are you talking about?

263
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,274
I'm in Suriname right now.

264
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:46,195
No, I'm talking about you and Goo Sangman.

265
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,532
What are you two scheming in Puerto Rico?

266
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:54,078
Are you trying to steal my coke
and take it to Korea?

267
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,590
What are you talking about?

268
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,843
Didn't you say it went well
and Sangjun's on his way back?

269
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:15,433
He said let's have a drink to celebrate.
Have you ever seen him drink alcohol?

270
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,019
What is it?

271
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,146
Did Goo capture Sangjun or something?

272
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,444
He must be high on seeing so much money
and is now craving alcohol.

273
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,029
He's human, after all.

274
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,115
You motherfucker...

275
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,619
You better come clean if you want to live.

276
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,788
Where are my goods right now?

277
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,427
Why do you have to be like this?

278
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,722
Why don't you radio the plane, then?

279
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:59,394
I thought we were going to celebrate.
You're killing the mood here.

280
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,613
I'm sorry to say this, Pastor,

281
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,451
but I think you have serious trust issues.

282
00:33:56,993 --> 00:34:00,079
Haven't you learned
to be more open-minded through faith?

283
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:04,584
I've always been open-minded,

284
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:08,546
but the Satan-possessed bastards
keep testing me.

285
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,989
{\an8}SURINAME AIR FORCE BASE

286
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,005
Shit!

287
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,054
When did you start planning this?

288
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,348
I wonder when it was.

289
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:27,268
Was it since you ruined my skate business?

290
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,438
No. Was it when I first came to Suriname?

291
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,565
I don't remember.

292
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,617
I thought Satan had you until now...

293
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,370
but you were a rat!

294
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,836
I don't have time.
You better answer me quickly!

295
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,172
Where is my coke?

296
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:59,383
It's in the US.
That place you're scared shitless of.

297
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,221
If you want it, go get it. Damn it.

298
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:06,390
You motherfucker!

299
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:02,029
I was trying to help you make big money.

300
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:06,867
Why'd you do something so stupid?

301
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,621
I just don't get it.

302
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,930
Hey, what are you doing, Byun?

303
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:14,602
Jeon Yohan.

304
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,272
It's all over.
Drop your weapon and surrender.

305
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,217
Fucking hell!

306
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,228
Let go, fuck!

307
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:18,958
Let go of me!

308
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:22,586
Shit!

309
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,089
Fuck, let go!

310
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:28,152
Shit!

311
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:33,449
You fucking bastard!

312
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,371
Go! Hurry, go!

313
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:48,370
Shit.

314
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:27,910
Shit!

315
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:18,418
Darn it!

316
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:22,548
Shit!

317
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:28,846
Shit!

318
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,024
You piece of shit!

319
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,313
Shit, you...

320
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:05,359
You fucking Satan!

321
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,195
In the name of God!

322
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:27,547
You ruined my life and Eungsoo's,
you son of a bitch!

323
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,349
Mr. Jeon Yohan. I'm with the NIS.

324
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,394
With the cooperation of the DEA,
you're under arrest

325
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:26,773
for drug trafficking, murder,
and aiding and abetting murder.

326
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,109
Shit.

327
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:32,237
You have the right to an attorney

328
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:34,656
and the right to remain silent.

329
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:32,339
Captain Kim.

330
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,758
You went through a lot.

331
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:37,302
That's just my job.

332
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,101
Hey.

333
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,856
Take a look at my mom's car, would you?
She says it keeps breaking down.

334
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,359
What's the model?

335
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,194
A Galloper.

336
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,280
Bring it over, then.

337
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:01,576
But let's go home first.

338
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,379
Mr. Kang.

339
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,799
Thank you so much.

340
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:19,136
Sure.

341
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,720
Great work.

342
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,248
EDEN SNACKS

343
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:58,842
Here's your <i>gimbap.</i>

344
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:00,927
-Thank you.
-Please enjoy.

345
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:05,640
Are you done? How much more today?

346
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,729
INSTANT TTEOKBOKKI

347
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,773
Did you solve the problems up to here?

348
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:16,735
What about this?
You didn't solve this one.

349
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:18,612
This too, okay?

350
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:20,780
That too.

351
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:22,782
-That too.
-Dad.

352
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,050
Dad!

353
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,552
Oh my goodness.

354
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,321
What took you so long?

355
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:04,658
I'm sorry.

356
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:13,208
Now, wait.
How did you get so much prettier?

357
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:14,918
I mean...

358
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:18,296
Did you get some work done?

359
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:22,425
And why did you get so ugly?

360
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:25,345
I married you for your handsome face.

361
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,141
Dad, are you leaving again?

362
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,603
No, I'm not.

363
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:36,147
Never.

364
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:53,456
{\an8}SIX MONTHS LATER

365
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,667
JACKSON CAR CENTER

366
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,634
You can't really tell this is

367
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,470
fake from the looks of it.

368
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:08,888
Of course not.

369
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:12,017
All the parts, including the tension arm,
affect the cushioning

370
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,768
of the lower body of the vehicle.

371
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:16,855
Since Westerners and Koreans have
different body structures,

372
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:19,941
I don't see the point
of using the original, you know.

373
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,652
I'm glad I heard about you and came here.

374
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:25,280
You made the right choice.

375
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:29,242
You saved money, and you used
Korean products like a true patriot.

376
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,506
Man.

377
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:50,305
I can't believe
someone is still driving this model.

378
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:53,516
Are you here to junk it?

379
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:55,143
No.

380
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:59,439
We received a report that an auto shop
in Dongducheon was ripping off customers.

381
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:01,066
So I'm here to crack down.

382
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,777
A report?

383
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:07,197
I haven't even been paid
the rest of the promised money.

384
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:09,991
I should be reporting you.

385
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,287
What happened to my money?

386
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:16,956
That's the reason I'm here.

387
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,551
I spoke with my superiors,

388
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:32,097
and due to accounting issues,
we'll give you

389
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,140
two shops in Uijeongbu instead of cash.

390
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:38,353
They're karaoke bars
under the agency's management.

391
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:42,899
You'll make way more than we promised
in just two years.

392
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:50,990
Nah.

393
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:52,659
Forget it.

394
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:55,620
I won't run that sort of thing.

395
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:59,999
Why? It's all yours for free.
There won't be any trouble.

396
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:03,169
Nothing is really free in this world.

397
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:06,840
And I don't want to get involved
in that business anymore.

398
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,184
Let me ask you something.

399
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:23,189
How long do I have to keep secret
that I took part in a NIS operation?

400
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:29,070
Well, you can tell the people around you,

401
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,865
but the NIS
won't acknowledge it officially.

402
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,366
Why do you ask?

403
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,703
Well, you know...

404
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,121
It's just...

405
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:44,836
That story's all I got after everything
I went through all those years.

406
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:49,007
When my kids grow up,

407
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:51,759
I gotta be able
to at least tell them that their dad

408
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:54,095
took part in a NIS operation,
wouldn't you say?

409
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,685
I went to see Jeon Yohan yesterday.

410
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:04,981
Yes, I heard he got ten years
and that he's appealing.

411
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:06,149
Yes.

412
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:10,069
But he asked me
to pass along a message to you.

413
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:12,322
He said there's something he needs back.

414
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:13,239
What is it?

415
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:16,159
He said it was some autographed baseball.

416
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:17,243
What?

417
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:22,707
Hyungju.

418
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:24,584
Bring that ball over here.

419
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:31,925
This ball with the fake autograph?

420
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:36,971
I'm not too sure myself,
but he said it was something he treasured

421
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:39,974
because it was
the only authentic thing he owned.

422
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,353
This is authentic?

423
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:49,192
I don't know. He said so, so it might be.

424
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,861
Who knows?

425
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:56,147
