THIS SERIES IS INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY

2
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:11,761
BUT CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
HAVE BEEN REIMAGINED FOR DRAMATIC PURPOSES

3
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:18,893
{\an8}SURINAME BORDER

4
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,349
<i>Do you know of a country called Suriname?</i>

5
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,934
<i>You probably don't.</i>

6
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,354
<i>A small South American country,
just north Brazil,</i>

7
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,565
<i>with a population of about 500,000 people.</i>

8
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:09,569
<i>It's a multiracial, multilingual country
where half of its land is a jungle</i>

9
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:14,032
<i>and more than half of its population
is involved in the drug trade.</i>

10
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,660
<i>What's a Korean guy doing
in a place like that?</i>

11
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,997
<i>The story I'm about to tell
is a story about just that.</i>

12
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,670
<i>It may be hard to believe,
but everything I'm about to share with you</i>

13
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,589
<i>is what I experienced firsthand.</i>

14
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:34,469
<i>Some of you will have a lot to say
about the authenticity of my claims.</i>

15
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,013
<i>Hear me out
before coming to your own conclusions.</i>

16
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,996
<i>In 1968, the year I was born,</i>

17
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,540
<i>my father volunteered
to fight in the Vietnam War.</i>

18
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,418
<i>He fought for five long years
in the jungle</i>

19
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:52,005
<i>until the Americans finally pulled out
and the war was over.</i>

20
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,840
{\an8}DONGDUCHEON, YANGJU
KOREA

21
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:57,927
{\an8}<i>He came back from the war with a limp.</i>

22
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:10,231
<i>The day after he returned home,
he headed out to start working.</i>

23
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:16,112
<i>In the only picture
where I could clearly see his face,</i>

24
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,364
<i>he was holding a huge gun.</i>

25
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,117
<i>I wondered what he had been up to
in that far-off country</i>

26
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,494
<i>and what he needed that big gun for,</i>

27
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,414
<i>but for some reason,
I was too scared to ask him.</i>

28
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:30,001
<i>It took me 30 years
before I could figure them out.</i>

29
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:35,506
<i>In middle school, I started judo
after a teacher suggested I try.</i>

30
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,221
<i>This was because I could go to school
and eat for free.</i>

31
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,223
Hold onto him properly.

32
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,976
Just focus on the legs!

33
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,729
There you go!

34
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,067
<i>I was 14 when I started my judo training.</i>

35
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,235
Kang Ingu!

36
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,863
<i>That's when my mother passed away.</i>

37
00:03:58,947 --> 00:03:59,948
YOGURT

38
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:05,161
<i>In the middle of a winter night,
she collapsed during her yogurt delivery.</i>

39
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,039
<i>It took more than three hours
for anyone to find her.</i>

40
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:24,138
<i>My younger siblings and I cried
for what seemed like forever,</i>

41
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,058
<i>but my father never shed a single tear.</i>

42
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,978
<i>He just kept pouring soju down his throat
with a side of fermented skate</i>

43
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,938
<i>and never said a word.</i>

44
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:37,110
<i>Yes, my father loved eating
his fermented skate more than anything.</i>

45
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,294
<i>He raised the three of us
by making cement deliveries.</i>

46
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,764
<i>He drove 20 hours a day
for six long years.</i>

47
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,353
<i>But that was as long
as my father could endure.</i>

48
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:30,997
<i>That's when I understood why
he could never cry at Mother's funeral.</i>

49
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,250
<i>The burden of debt and the reality of life</i>

50
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,211
<i>crushed whatever sadness felt
at the moment.</i>

51
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,386
<i>I had to make a living somehow,</i>

52
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,639
<i>so I sold</i> makgeolli <i>to the hikers
at the top of Mount Soyo during the day.</i>

53
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,892
Hey, there you are.

54
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,645
<i>And at night, I worked at a karaoke bar.</i>

55
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,279
Have a great night, sir.

56
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,159
-Is that all you can drink?
-Hey, have a drink!

57
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:12,914
<i>That's how I learned a lot of the stuff
they don't teach you at school.</i>

58
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,750
Thank you, sir.

59
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,044
I hope you enjoy
the rest of your night, sir.

60
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:21,130
PLEASE DON'T PARK HERE

61
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:32,683
<i>Because I was hardly at home,
my place was always a mess.</i>

62
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,482
Clean up the house, you punk. Damn it.

63
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,734
<i>I figured I couldn't do it
on my own any longer,</i>

64
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,821
<i>so I made some calls to the girls
who said they liked me.</i>

65
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,199
Hey, this is Ingu. How have you been?

66
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,203
Yeah, I just wanted to call and ask...

67
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,704
Well...

68
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,833
Will you marry me?

69
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,085
No, I'm not joking!

70
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,797
I thought about it a lot
before making this call.

71
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,215
Money?

72
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,009
I mean, we can start saving it now.

73
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,930
You know what the adults always say.
Money comes around once you get married.

74
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,265
A house?

75
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,058
Come on, woman.

76
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,061
Once we save up some money,
then we can buy a house.

77
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,063
What's with all these questions?

78
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,402
A condo?

79
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,737
Hey, isn't that a little too much?

80
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:30,366
You're not going to cut it.
Just forget what I said.

81
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,120
<i>They all seemed surprised
when I proposed to them.</i>

82
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,875
<i>But then, one said we should go for it
and moved in with all her stuff.</i>

83
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,294
BOARDING HOUSE

84
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,724
<i>This time, I was surprised.</i>

JAEIL CHURCH

87
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,984
<i>My wife made my life stable.</i>

88
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:08,196
<i>Once my siblings graduated high school,
life eased up a bit.</i>

89
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,745
<i>And in the midst of all that,
my own babies were born.</i>

90
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:31,135
<i>But with two more mouths to feed,
getting by wasn't going to be enough.</i>

91
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,515
<i>I learned how to repair cars</i>

92
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,726
<i>and ended up opening a garage
in front of the Dongducheon US Army Base.</i>

93
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,982
<i>Thanks to one of the guys I did judo with,</i>

94
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,944
<i>I was able to deliver food supplies
to the US base as well.</i>

95
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,321
<i>And to survive, I had to learn English.</i>

96
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,732
<i>At the bar, I even made it to manager
getting commissions for the clients.</i>

97
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,985
<i>I ended up buying the place out.</i>

98
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,904
-Wow!
-Whoa!

99
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:36,909
<i>And I also leased a house,
although I had to take out a huge loan.</i>

KANG HYUNGJU 100/100

102
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,209
<i>My first child was smart, just like me.</i>

103
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,003
<i>It made all the hard work worthwhile.</i>

104
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,754
-Dad!
-Hey.

105
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,132
Can I go to your karaoke bar tomorrow?

106
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:54,218
Daddy's karaoke bar is
for US soldiers only.

107
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,470
So you have to be a US citizen to get in.

108
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,518
<i>I thought that I was set
for the rest of my life.</i>

109
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,816
<i>But I wasn't sure how much longer
I could keep up at the pace I was going.</i>

<i>Life continued to weigh heavily on me.</i>

Hey, is this your place?

113
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,438
Quit your job if you don't want to work!

114
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,398
-Call the guys!
-I'll show you!

115
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,776
<i>My mother and father lived like this too.</i>

116
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,487
<i>They never took us out for a nice meal.</i>

117
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,615
<i>All they did was struggle
to make ends meet</i>

118
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,825
<i>until they finally passed away.</i>

119
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:04,455
<i>What's the point of just living
for the sake of living?</i>

120
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:09,502
<i>I knew that I shouldn't let my kids
live the way I did.</i>

121
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,796
<i>Something had to change.</i>

Let's see.

124
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,225
Dum-dum!

125
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,143
My, my.

126
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:30,564
I'm back from a trip around the world,
and I can't get a proper hello?

127
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,567
Look at this asshole.

128
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:37,154
I thought you were selling fish,
not slapping soybean paste on your hair.

129
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,739
How did you not get arrested?

130
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:42,493
Jeez, what the hell would you know?
You're trapped on this tiny peninsula.

131
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:45,579
This right here is the latest trend
over in Shinjuku, man.

132
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,582
Hey, this is for your wife and kids.

133
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:57,883
Wow, I bet I could make
some wash rags out of this stuff.

134
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,719
Flower-printed rags, huh?

135
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,138
You have no taste, man.

136
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,891
Just take it home to your wife.
She'll go crazy over it.

137
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,060
Come and massage my shoulders.
The pain is killing me.

138
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:09,478
Wait.

139
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,023
-Who's this grandma?
-What?

140
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,067
Hey, softly!

141
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,570
-Ma'am, please leave Eungsoo's body.
-Hey! Shit!

142
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,655
Please leave his body!

143
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,657
Do you like that, asshole?

144
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,243
-Here's your <i>samhap.</i> Enjoy.
-Thank you.

145
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,662
-Do you want the soup heated up?
-It's delicious.

146
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:31,959
In ninth grade, my dad passed away,
and things got hard for us,

147
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,128
so I didn't go to high school, you know?

148
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,423
You couldn't go
because you had the lowest grades.

149
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,507
Tell it right, boy.

150
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:44,221
Anyway, I skipped high school
and started to learn all about shipping.

151
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,391
After 20 years of working my butt off
on those boats,

152
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,853
I can still barely afford to raise my kid.
The same goes for you, right?

153
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:55,483
You and I both did all kinds
of rotten stuff just to make a buck.

154
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:59,153
That's life for everyone, man.
Nothing special about mine.

155
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,990
Do you remember what you told me
when you quit judo?

156
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:08,913
You felt like you had to do something,
or else your life would go to shit, right?

157
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:12,500
But after working your butt off,
what have you got to show for it?

158
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,085
At least I got a lease
on a condo, dumbass.

159
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,839
Idiot, that place isn't yours.
It belongs to the bank.

160
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,383
You can barely pay off your debts.

161
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,638
Hey, if we keep living like this,
we're really going to get messed up.

162
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:29,141
Working our asses off
until we keel over, dead.

163
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,102
You're talking gibberish in a weird way.

164
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,355
What are you trying to talk to me about?

165
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,776
This skate
that you're shoving down your throat,

166
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,487
did you know that 99% of it
comes from Chile?

167
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,114
They label it as "domestic"
before selling it.

168
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,283
And this stuff ain't cheap, man.

169
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,995
I heard even Chilean imports
are too expensive to buy these days.

170
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,082
What's with the fish talk?
What's your point?

171
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,584
What I'm saying is,

172
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,297
if you bring in these skates for free
and sell them here in Korea,

173
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,423
what's going to happen?

174
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,469
Hey, if it were that easy,
someone else would be doing it by now.

175
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,137
It's like printing your own money.

176
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,266
But who would give you free skates?
You must be crazy.

177
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,936
There's a country where nobody eats skate,
and they all get tossed out!

178
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,940
And I'm the only one that knows about it.

179
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,819
Have you ever heard of "Suriname"?

180
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,738
Suriname? What is that, a country?

181
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,699
See? No one knows about it. Hey.

182
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,576
I've lived on boats for 20 years,

183
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,328
and I went there
for the first time earlier this year.

184
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,376
Check this out.

185
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,837
It's this tiny country north of Brazil.

186
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,630
The entire population is only 500,000.

187
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,508
And its coastline is packed
to the brim with skates.

188
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:47,386
But it turns out these people think

189
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:50,055
that skates look weird
and smell like shit,

190
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,557
so they just toss them out.

191
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:55,853
I asked the head fisherman,
this old toothless grandpa right here.

192
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,022
He told me he'd sell them for pennies!

193
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:02,026
So, if you could bring in these skates
and sell them here in Korea,

194
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,402
what do you think would happen?

195
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,615
Is this for real?

196
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,284
Do you have to taste the thing
to tell if it's poop or chocolate?

197
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,328
You can come with me to Suriname, then.

198
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,214
No, there's no point in thinking about it.

199
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,718
And you're not even talking about America.
Suriname, really?

200
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,720
I didn't even know such a country existed.

201
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:32,014
That's the point though.

202
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,725
Since Asia and South America
are so far away,

203
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:39,021
such information is not easy to get,
hence this business opportunity.

204
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,606
Check this out.

205
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,692
I know Eungsoo is a good man.

206
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,405
But look at his gift. I can't trust him.

207
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,952
I don't trust his taste in anything,
but he's diligent.

208
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,996
I went along with it
and did some of my own research.

209
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,165
And it turns out he's telling the truth.

210
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:01,168
In Suriname, no one eats skate.

211
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,171
I got this from Yongtaek
at the fish market today.

212
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,255
Look.

213
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,840
Take a seat. Come on.

214
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,426
Frozen Chilean skate at wholesale prices

215
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,970
go for 30,000 won each.

216
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:15,224
But since there's been a lack of supply,
the prices are only going up.

217
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,725
Imagine what's going to happen

218
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,979
if we get Suriname skate for free
and sell them in this market?

219
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,648
This is some seriously lucrative stuff!

220
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,486
But still,

221
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:30,531
you can't shut down all your shops
and leave to a faraway country.

222
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,451
Honey, what makes a family?

223
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,121
A family is supposed to eat together
and stay together.

224
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,583
Don't get any wild thoughts.
Let's thank the Lord for what we have.

225
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,546
Of course I'm thankful,

226
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:48,632
but I'm doing this
so I can be even more thankful.

227
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:53,303
If we just get this thing off the ground,
making a billion is going to be a joke.

228
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,723
I don't care if you make tens of billions!

229
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,726
The kids are better off living poor
than growing up without a father.

230
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,064
How much longer
do we have to live like this?

231
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,817
What's wrong with living like this?

232
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,072
Jeez.

233
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:21,248
One for you, you, you, and you.

234
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,548
Twenty.

235
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:34,303
Raise. I'll see your 200,000
and raise you 500,000.

236
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,266
Wow. Yun's trying to make it a big pot.

237
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,851
You're so greedy.

238
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,437
Are you trying to earn
your sales revenue here?

239
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,900
The cost of living is going up,
so we're going to up the ante too.

240
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,568
I'll take this as tax.

241
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,822
How come we do all the work,
and you take all the rewards?

242
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:58,577
With the house rake and the dealer fees,
you are the only one making money!

243
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,122
Hey, with the rent and payroll,
I'm left with nothing but gas money.

244
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,207
What's with you today?

245
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,543
It feels like you're really trying
to make us broke today, that's all.

246
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,171
We all know
small change can add up to a fortune.

247
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,216
Jeez, you're awfully sensitive today.

248
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,427
Darn it.

249
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,390
Call.

250
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,601
Dang, I fold.

251
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,062
I'll raise your bottom line today, Yun.

252
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,481
What do you have? A pair of aces?

253
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,900
You think I'd be this confident
with a pair of aces?

254
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:31,652
Get ready.

255
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:35,948
I have a very, very straight hand.
Mountain straight!

256
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,244
Wow, you made it
to the top of the mountain.

257
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,871
-No wonder you were so confident.
-Jeez.

258
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,623
I never thought I'd see the day.

259
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,875
What is that?

260
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,586
I heard you had no customers today.
Sorry about this.

261
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,089
Wow, you got lucky in the end.

262
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:56,343
And this is because you're always
on time with your taxes, okay?

263
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,011
The tax-paying citizen always wins!

264
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,973
I got some good energy from you, Kang.
Buy yourself some cigarettes.

265
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,559
I will use it wisely. Thank you, sir.

266
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,644
-Give me one too.
-You always say that!

267
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:08,313
Boss, we have a DEFCON 3 situation.

268
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,985
Go ahead and deal. I'll be right back.

269
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,112
Dammit.

270
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,161
Jeez.

271
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,288
Wow.

272
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,126
Wait outside.

273
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,087
Where the fuck do you think you're going?

274
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,173
Hey, go grab her.

275
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,593
-Hey, come here. Come here!
-Hey, now!

276
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,512
What do you want with her anyway?
Wait outside.

277
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,597
Sir.

278
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,391
You'll only get mad with them around.
Sit down.

279
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:48,478
Gosh, you gentlemen
are some real tough guys.

280
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,523
Our girls couldn't be more sorry.

281
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,567
They went to write down
what they did wrong,

282
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,235
so please lighten up.

283
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,572
If you spend all this money and get mad,
it's not good for your health.

284
00:19:58,655 --> 00:19:59,823
You'll have diarrhea.

285
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,201
I'd like to offer this bottle of liquor
on the house.

286
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:06,163
And since my girls failed
to show you gentlemen a good time,

287
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:09,166
I'll only be charging you
for half of their time.

288
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,710
With everything all put together,

289
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,254
I only ask for 1,2 million won.

290
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,173
Is this some kind of joke?

291
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,594
You want me
to shut this place down for good?

292
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:25,641
I'm not paying, you jerk.
You should be paying me!

293
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,560
What are you going to do
about fucking up my evening?

294
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,772
Sir... Chairman?

295
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:36,235
Do we really have to wake up
our hardworking policemen

296
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,986
at this time of night?

297
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,614
I mean, how much do you guys
have right now?

298
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:44,284
Just give me that and call it a night.
Your wives are waiting for you.

299
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,580
Ah shit.

300
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,374
My money?

301
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,919
It's right here.

302
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,213
POLICE OFFICER
CHOI CHEOLYONG

303
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,301
Do you have a license for this joint?

304
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,804
You sure there aren't any minors
among those girls?

305
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:07,391
Your problem is
that you're too nice to people.

306
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,101
Hey!

307
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:12,938
And here we were,
trying to let you off nicely.

308
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:16,608
As long as I work at the city hall,

309
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,361
consider yourself closed for business.

310
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,615
I am so sorry, sir.

311
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,286
Please forgive me and...

312
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,247
This isn't much,
but it's for your cab ride.

313
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,291
I'm really sorry.

314
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,668
Fucking hell.

315
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,253
Hey, you fucker!

316
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,088
Hey.

317
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,425
-You fucker.
-What? What do you want?

318
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:45,512
Hey, asshole.
You want to have a go at me, huh?

319
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,432
Hey, you think this is about the money?

320
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,645
Is this how you treat your customers?

321
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,981
Huh? What's going on?

322
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,650
Hey, are you okay?

323
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,820
Hey! You bastard, get over here!

324
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,072
Hey, are you okay?

325
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,116
What the hell?

326
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:15,834
{\an8}JOHAN ADOLF PENGEL
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, SURINAME

327
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,559
WELCOME INGU

328
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:44,446
<i>It's only been 30 years since they gained
independence from the Netherlands.</i>

329
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:48,033
There aren't a lot of people here,
so they always lack the manpower.

330
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,951
That's why there are so many immigrants.

331
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:53,955
Dutch is their national language,
but everyone speaks a bit of English.

332
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,501
Some speak Chinese, Spanish, and others.
You know what I mean?

333
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,629
Nice speech.
How long did it take to memorize that?

334
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,339
-Let me guess. Two weeks?
-Whatever.

335
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:05,258
Hey, I know a lot more
than you do out here.

336
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,010
-So don't mess with me.
-Hey.

337
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:11,431
Did you know that Suriname joined
the Allied Forces during the Korean War?

338
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,226
Suriname fought in the Korean War? Why?

339
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,188
Eungsoo, are you trying to be
a travel guide out here?

340
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,690
Stop wasting time on useless trivia,

341
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:24,361
and please just focus your energy
on the skates.

342
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,863
I already discussed it
with the local head fisherman,

343
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,782
so you don't need to worry about it.

344
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:31,993
After liquidating my businesses,
I entrusted every single penny

345
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,830
to a guy who flunked out of school.
Of course I'm worried.

346
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,748
Do you know how to add and subtract?

347
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,334
Who are you kidding?
I never flunked school.

348
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,753
I don't know about anything else,
but I beat you at math.

349
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:45,006
Have you been drinking?
You never beat me at math.

350
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,926
And you finished last a few times.
I saw it with my own eyes.

351
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,720
Seven, eight.

352
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,432
What?

353
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,892
Seven times eight.
We're doing the times table now.

354
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,979
Ingu, you bastard.
You must be kidding me right now.

355
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:02,441
This has to be programmed into you.
Seven times eight.

356
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:05,569
Hey, I'm driving, man!
Just give me a second.

357
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:08,947
You should be able to answer it
even when you're driving.

358
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,031
Seven times eight.

359
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:15,036
I'm not good at multitasking, that's all.
I'll answer it later.

360
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,540
Look at the road.
You're gonna get us killed!

361
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:23,044
Oh wow!
You really don't know the answer, do you?

362
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:33,346
Hey, I bought a whole ton
at a dollar per kilo.

363
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,391
You see that? That's how business is done!

364
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,937
Mr. Park, I didn't expect this.
You did a good job.

365
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:44,024
Man, how much is all of this?

366
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,152
Why do you have to open it?

367
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:50,489
Wow, they still stink like crazy,
even when they're frozen.

368
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,450
Does that smell like fish to you?
Smells like money to me.

369
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:10,926
<i>It's safe over there, right?</i>

370
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,845
<i>How is the food? What about church?</i>

371
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,764
It's super safe here.

372
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,684
There are restaurants
from all over the world,

373
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,311
just like a department store.

374
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,437
It's like a party.

375
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,860
What about church?
Did you not go last Sunday?

376
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:32,572
I tried to make it a few times,
but the roads were blocked by the floods.

377
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,992
<i>It's all jungle out here,
so it takes time for them to fix it.</i>

378
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,287
I let you go only because you promised
to go to church.

379
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,873
I found a local Korean church for you,

380
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,960
so you should go this Sunday
and send me some pictures, okay?

381
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,295
Yes, ma'am. You can stop now.

382
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,591
I hear you loud and clear. All right.

383
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:55,720
Phone calls cost a lot out here,
so I'll call you back later.

384
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:56,763
All right.

385
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:02,018
Why? What did she say?
Why do you look so down?

386
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,062
She wants me to take pics at the church.

387
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,106
Oh yeah!

388
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:09,192
Going to church was a condition
of your marriage, right?

389
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,528
Have you been saying your prayers?

390
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,948
Jeez, I'm worried that my faith
is growing every day.

391
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:20,829
More ice. More!

392
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,750
You missed a few!

393
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,677
I want to see more!

394
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,811
I want a box that's already full.

395
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,178
What's this guy saying?

396
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,308
These assholes are here to rip us off.

397
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,963
Just a little bit.

398
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,966
Okay. That's it. Right there. Okay.

399
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,933
Jeez, let's go.

400
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:14,479
Look at you. Having some experience
doing business really shows, man.

401
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:17,982
Hey, so now we have
the government watching our back, right?

402
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,151
It's going to be
smooth sailing from now on.

403
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:23,196
Hey, you really have a problem
with thinking things through.

404
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,659
The last people you should ever trust
in this world are government workers.

405
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:30,411
They lounge around all day
and take no responsibility.

406
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:34,833
These wise words coming from the guy
who almost went to jail for beating a cop.

407
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,668
I promise I'll take it to heart.

408
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:38,670
Wait.

409
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:44,342
Good morning, Mr. Shin.
Did you receive the skates?

410
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,302
Yes.

411
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,973
Sorry? You want 500 kilos by next week?

412
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:56,980
We've got so many orders backed up.
It's hard to keep up with the demand.

413
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:00,233
Oh no.

414
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,487
Oh, dear.

415
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,407
I guess I'll have to do my best
to make it work.

416
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:11,077
So do you want the shipment by the 23rd?

417
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,664
Okay, sir. Have a great day, sir.

418
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,332
We can't...

419
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:21,004
You can't just take deals like that.
I only get four hours of sleep as it is!

420
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,091
Mr. Shin said that he will pay us
8,000 won more for each kilo

421
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:27,677
if we ship to him by the 23rd,
you son of a bitch!

422
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:31,139
We'll just have to work all night,
you asshole!

423
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,310
-Hurry!
-Hurry!

424
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,269
You're not working.

425
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,771
Get to work! No work, no money!

426
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,127
How's the new cram school?

427
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,880
<i>The other kids have already gotten
so much further ahead,</i>

428
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,423
<i>so it's kind of hard.</i>

429
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:08,092
That's better for you.
What did I always tell you?

430
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:11,179
An easy road leads to a predictable life.
A hard road leads you to...

431
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,514
<i>-A happy life.</i>
-There you go.

432
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:17,518
If you find your academy classes hard,
it means that the happy life is not far.

433
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,686
How nice is that?

434
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:33,368
Hyungju, I'll call you back.
Have Mom check your homework.

435
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,705
-What's up?
-Did someone punch him?

436
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,582
Hey, what's wrong?

437
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,209
-Oh, those guys...
-What the...

438
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,388
What the hell? Get up.

439
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,559
What in the...

440
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,921
What are these guys saying?

441
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,257
Some local hobos, I guess.
Let's just leave.

442
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,765
Are you okay?

443
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,893
Fuck, if your deal doesn't work,
what are we supposed to do?

444
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:50,064
Hey, you don't know the first thing
about dealmaking, do you?

445
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,984
You don't stop until you make it work.

446
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,828
IT MUST BE HARD OUT THERE FOR YOU.
THAT'S WHAT CHURCHES ARE FOR, RIGHT?

447
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,413
I'LL BE WAITING FOR THE PICTURES.

448
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,749
Ah shit.

449
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,884
{\an8}KOREAN CHURCH, PARAMARIBO

450

<i>There is a refuge here</i>

00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:37,278
<i>So all those who are in need</i>

00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:45,036
<i>The land may change</i>

454
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,040
<i>And the waters may rise</i>

455
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:52,960
<i>To top even the highest mountains</i>

456
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,964
<i>But I am not afraid</i>

457
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,927
<i>May it ring out from this room</i>

458
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,930
<i>Across the nations...</i>

459
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:04,972
Oh, wait.

460
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,724
-Can you see my bruises?
-Yeah.

461
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,561
I don't want her to get worried.
Just take a shot of me praying.

462
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:15,733
There you go.

463
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:19,070
Try and get all the people in the frame.

464
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,404
-A wide shot.
-Oh, wide.

465
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,156
Here, I'm praying.

466
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,077
You can see all the people.

467
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,579
Okay, that's it.

468
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:42,385
As it was written in the book of Timothy,

469
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:47,974
"for we brought nothing into the world,

470
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,809
we take nothing when we depart it."

471
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:56,440
"But if we have food and clothing,

472
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,276
we will be content with that."

473
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,027
Amen.

474
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:05,157
"The Lord has said
that money is the root of all evil

475
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,034
and that those who covet it

476
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,037
will have pierced themselves
with many sorrows."

477
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,540
"They will have a glimpse of hell."

478
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,335
Amen.

479
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:22,425
Some brothers have come all the way here
to follow the words of Jesus.

480
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:23,884
Right over there.

481
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,810
As you long to pursue
God's meekness and love,

482
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:35,313
let's give them a round of applause.

483
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,369
Hallelujah.

484
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:56,167
I'm Kang Ingu from Dongducheon,
here for a seafood processing business.

485
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,835
Nice to meet you.

486
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:05,801
Yes, we actually work with skates,

487
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:10,139
and they are high in protein
and great at removing toxins in your body.

488
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:13,642
We'd be more than happy to provide you
with skates at our cost.

489
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,395
Feel free to reach out to us at any time!

490
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,570
What thoughtful words, full of nutrition.

491
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:28,240
Let's greet them with a warm hallelujah.

492
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,367
Hallelujah!

493
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,410
Hallelujah!

494
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,164
Come in.

495
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:47,551
Taking skates from Suriname
and selling them in Korea.

496
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,013
That's a neat idea.

497
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:55,184
I'm a bit embarrassed to be talking
about business in such a holy place.

498
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:58,854
No. It's not like that at all.

499
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,565
The Lord said in his Book of Proverbs

500
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:05,653
that those who are sincere in their work
will serve before kings.

501
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,157
As long as you are sincere in your work,
you will be blessed by god.

502
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,660
Thank you for your kind words.

503
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,957
I just have something
that's been bothering me.

504
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:23,212
Have you been facing a lot of difficulties
running your business recently?

505
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,630
Your faces...

506
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,676
This?

507
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,430
It's sort of a trade conflict
between countries.

508
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,973
I'll be sorting it out soon.

509
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,893
If it's not too much trouble,

510
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,272
may I ask you what kind of situation
you got involved in?

511
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,693
Let's just tell him.

512
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,112
I don't think that's necessary.

513
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:54,160
We secured a supplier for our skates,

514
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:57,830
but some Chinese guys asked for money,
saying that the ocean was theirs.

515
00:40:57,913 --> 00:41:00,749
We've been paying
some soldiers for protection,

516
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,210
but they say that they only deal
with issues on land.

517
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,421
So it's causing us quite a lot of trouble.

518
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,972
Sorry for bothering you with our issue.
Let's go.

519
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:17,641
Did one of the Chinese men

520
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:21,562
happen to have long hair, and did he...

521
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,981
Did he look like he'd smell really bad?

522
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:26,066
Yes. Do you know him, sir?

523
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,071
Yes.

524
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,408
He's a Chinese gangster named Chen Zhen.

525
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,745
He's the type of guy who kills
if the price is right.

526
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,622
Satan is what he is.

527
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,336
Lord,

528
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,714
is this all part of your great plan?

529
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,306
Seeing as how he sent
two Koreans here to our church

530
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:59,767
and how he let me learn
about your recent story,

531
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:04,355
I believe that God is
ordering me to step in.

532
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,192
It won't be easy, but I shall find a way.

533
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:12,696
If you can figure something out for us,
I promise to make a sizable donation.

534
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:17,034
Brother, money truly
does not mean anything to me.

535
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:21,497
All I'm doing is following
what God has ordered me to do.

536
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,131
Yes, Preacher Byun?

537
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:35,594
I'll have to hold a service in Chinatown.

538
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,642
{\an8}CHINATOWN, PARAMARIBO

539
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,162
Welcome.

540
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,221
All of this right here
is what we call idolatry...

541
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,475
Mr. Byun.

542
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,811
Shall we place our orders first?

543
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,355
Yes, sir.

544
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,024
Lay out some hot pots
and <i>baijiu</i> on the tables.

545
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:13,067
Yes, sir.

546
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,325
Brother Kang.

547
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:24,203
-Yes, sir.
-Brother Park.

548
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,120
Yes.

549
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:37,007
Who's making all this noise
in my territory?

550
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,644
This asshole.

551
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:01,323
Mr. Byun.

552
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,286
I don't like to mix with any heretics
who indulge in idol worship.

553
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:10,124
Just say what you need, sir.
I'll let him know.

554
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,758
All of the skates in Suriname
belong to God.

555
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:22,428
All of the skates in Suriname
belong to God.

556
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,681
Brother Kang, over here,

557
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:30,060
was sent by God to come to this land
and catch his skates.

558
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,938
Brother Kang is here on God's orders.

559
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:37,443
If you interfere and persecute him,

560
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:40,612
you will be judged by God
just as the Amalekites were judged,

561
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,866
with the wrath of many swords and spears.

562
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,951
If you don't let him have the skates,

563
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:49,037
I'll cut you into tiny pieces.

564
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,629
Byun Kitae. You tell him.

565
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:03,051
We should all stick to the territories
we agreed to stick to.

566
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:07,181
If you bust in here with your Jesus talk
and try to do as you please...

567
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,777
This is what God commands,
you son of a bitch.

568
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:39,087
Chen Zhen?

569
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:40,172
Chen Zhen.

570
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:43,926
Today is the day when even God
is supposed to rest.

571
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:45,677
Today is the Sabbath...

572
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:51,308
So, let's solve things peacefully
and get some rest for ourselves too.

573
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,101
Let's get some rest.

574
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:54,770
How about that?

575
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:03,487
So your god has to get involved
over a little dispute about fish,

576
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:07,658
and he can't even get a break
on his day of rest?

577
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:11,286
What a piece of shit!

578
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:17,793
I'm going to let you save face today.

579
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,128
If you want the skates that bad,

580
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,006
then you can have them.

581
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:31,181
He says he wants to let you save face
and take the skates.

582
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:33,475
Yeah?

583
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,603
I guess things turned out well.

584
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,575
Since you came all the way
into my territory,

585
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:52,160
this one's on me.

586
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,163
Have a drink before you go.

587
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:09,595
Get the hot pots out.

588
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:22,774
<i>Apparently, that pastor is no joke.</i>

589
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:26,486
Last Christmas, he built tons of farms
and factories and donated them.

590
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:30,490
He's close with all the politicians
and the president and all that.

591
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:33,368
Anyway, he has
so much influence in Suriname.

592
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,329
People call him the governor of Suriname.

593
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:39,416
Some Koreans here are saying
that he might even run for president.

594
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,587
-Do you believe that?
-Why not?

595
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,505
You think being the president is a joke?

596
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:49,301
Would you vote for a Chinese or a Mexican
in our presidential elections?

597
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,304
All sorts of people live together here.

598
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:55,015
I heard there was
a Chinese prime minister a few years ago.

599
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:57,059
-A Chinese guy?
-Yeah.

600
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,226
Are you sure of that?

601
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,605
Come on. Why would I bullshit you
while I'm enjoying this expensive fish?

602
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:03,815
I asked all around the Korean district.

603
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,578
Then let's go visit
the governor of Suriname

604
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:17,871
and pay him tribute.

605
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,499
You know the last shipment
of skates that came in?

606
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:23,669
Let's pick the freshest-looking one
and give it to the pastor.

607
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,505
Remember that ginseng liquor
your wife sent last week?

608
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:28,256
Let's send him a bottle of that too.

609
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:33,011
Hey, my wife sent me that,
so whenever I get back home,

610
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:34,846
we have a go at our second child.

611
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:37,349
If you actually do have another kid,

612
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:41,436
how will you pay for everything
from baby formula to college costs?

613
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,856
It's our chance for a proper introduction.
Are you going to skimp on some liquor?

614
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,902
Wow, look at you, man.

615
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,697
This punk's hesitating again...

616
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,324
Hey, no need to get upset.

617
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,535
I'm disappointed, you prick.

618
00:49:56,618 --> 00:50:00,455
I hope you enjoy that bottle of ginseng
and pop out two or three more babies.

619
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,874
You are not business-savvy.

620
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:06,420
Those are some harsh words.
I'm not skimping on anything!

621
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:11,174
I was just worried about that rule
about pastors not drinking.

622
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:12,926
You saw him drinking the other day.

623
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,429
Monks aren't allowed to drink.
Pastors are good to go.

624
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,514
Do your research, man.

625
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,062
Why aren't you saying anything?
Go give him the stuff already!

626
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:28,608
Listen, ginseng liquor is
like soul food to us Koreans.

627
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:31,486
He will like it, no matter what.
Just give it to him.

628
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,448
Yes, sir. Mr. Boss, sir.

629
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:37,951
-Seven times eight.
-Fifty-six.

630
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:41,830
You've been studying, haven't you?
You got it right.

631
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:43,582
I knew the answer all along.

632
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:46,334
-Eight times seven makes...
-Sixty-four.

633
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,003
You're crazy, man!

634
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,470
<i>Hello? Is this Mr. Kang?</i>

635
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:40,430
<i>This is Captain Kim from the Dolphin!</i>

636
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,891
Yes, Captain.
Did you already make it back to Korea?

637
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:44,684
<i>Korea, my ass!</i>

638
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,395
<i>I had to swing by Aruba
to pick up another container</i>

639
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,147
<i>and got hit with an inspection!</i>

640
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:52,234
<i>They found cocaine in your skates!</i>

641
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,654
Cocaine? Inside the skates?

642
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:57,989
<i>They just let me out
after five days of interrogation.</i>

643
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,574
<i>Have you been loading drugs onto my ship?</i>

644
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:02,661
No, not at all, sir.
I would never do anything like that.

645
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,956
Sir, can you tell me again clearly?

646
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:07,958
They found cocaine inside our skates?

647
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:10,919
If you could tell me exactly...

648
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,587
<i>Hey, I don't need any of that.</i>

649
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:16,591
<i>I left all of your stuff in Aruba.
Figure it out on your own!</i>

650
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:18,051
Hello? Sir?

651
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:23,765
What's he talking about?
Cocaine in our skates?

652
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:29,271
Yeah, in Aruba.

653
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,357
Aruba. That's a Dutch island, right?

654
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,612
But why would they find cocaine
in any of our cargo?

655
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,244
Wait.

656
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:46,621
What are you doing?

657
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:51,251
Eungsoo, I need you to go
to our local management office

658
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,752
and find out what happened.

659
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:55,338
-Right now?
-It's half past ten. They must be awake.

660
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,256
-Hurry.
-Okay.

661
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:03,138
-What about you? You're not coming?
-I'm going to call Pastor Jeon.

662
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:05,515
He's close with the president,
so he might help us.

663
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:06,641
Yeah, right.

664
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:09,728
Hey, did you send him
the skates and the ginseng liquor?

665
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,441
I sent him the skates,

666
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:17,819
but the ginseng liquor
hadn't aged as much, so I was waiting...

667
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:20,655
Are you fucking crazy?
I texted him we'd be sending him a bottle.

668
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:22,407
All right, I got it. I'll send it.

669
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:26,077
I'm going to check in at the office,
and I'll call you right after.

670
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,038
-Keep me updated, okay?
-Yeah.

671
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:36,796
PASTOR JEON YOHAN

672
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,964
OUTGOING CALL

673
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,598
<i>Hello, brother.</i>

674
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,475
Hello. I'm sorry
for calling you at this hour.

675
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:51,770
<i>Oh, not at all.
What seems to be the problem?</i>

676
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:55,440
I'm so sorry, but I've been put
into a really tight spot.

677
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:57,776
I had no other choice
but to make this call.

678
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:08,203
Lord, how could
something like this happen?

679
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,250
Don't panic.

680
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,168
Wait patiently.

681
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,420
I'll try and figure something out.

682
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:20,548
Thank you so much, Pastor. Please help us.

683
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,968
The ginseng liquor
should be with you shortly.

684
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,678
<i>Yes.</i>

685
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:26,179
Sure.

686
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:52,038
<i>The person you are trying to reach
is outside of the service area.</i>

687
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,832
<i>Please leave a voice message.</i>

688
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:59,254
Hey, Eungsoo, where the hell are you?

689
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:01,339
You were supposed to call me right away!

690
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:13,828
Get him!

691
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:18,416
Freeze!

692
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,378
Freeze!

693
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:48,822
Freeze!

694
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:05,755
Hands up!
