00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:08,299
THIS SERIES IS INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY

2
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:11,761
BUT CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
HAVE BEEN REIMAGINED FOR DRAMATIC PURPOSES

3
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,598
{\an8}BRAZILIAN BORDER

4
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,939
-What's going on?
-That's what I wanna know.

5
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,611
Are you insane?

6
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,114
You're going to get us all killed.

7
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,033
Don't call anyone. I'll try to handle it.

8
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,899
Lima. Macedo.

9
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,233
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

10
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,527
Open it up.

11
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,760
Shit, we're fucked, man!

12
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,984
Arrest all of them.

13
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,387
Romeido.

14
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,807
Take all the boxes,
and check the truck for more.

15
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,766
Yes, sir.

16
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,269
-We have to leave soon. Hurry up!
-Yes, sir.

17
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,728
Shit! Man, what the fuck?

18
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,774
Don't leave! Stay!

19
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,110
Shoot! Hide and shoot!

20
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,657
Shoot! Hide and shoot!

21
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,327
Shit! Careful!

22
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,790
We have to go!

23
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,544
Shoot at 12 o'clock!

24
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,720
Hey! Pull him in!

25
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,097
Radio the second squad!

26
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:45,808
Run!

27
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,560
To that side, quickly!

28
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,657
Get in, quick!

29
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,077
Take him in!

30
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,831
Hey, get back!

31
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,837
Watch out! Move, get out of there!

32
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,130
Hurry up and get in!

33
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:17,757
Come on, get in!

34
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:32,897
Dammit!

35
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,222
As it was written in Matthew,

36
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:33,601
"Blessed are those who are persecuted
for righteousness' sake,

37
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,521
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."

38
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,772
Amen.

39
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,023
-Amen.
-Amen.

40
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,620
What kind of half-assed plan was that?

41
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,163
Is that the best the NIS can do?

42
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:58,000
<i>They were meant to take the cash and coke
and only cause us minimal trouble.</i>

43
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,669
<i>What happened today was unexpected.</i>

44
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,088
That means I was supposed to be
in minimal danger too.

45
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,176
Forgive me
for nearly dying out there unexpectedly.

46
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,721
<i>You have every right
to be angry right now.</i>

47
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,348
{\an8}Ultimately, the operation was a success.

48
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,641
{\an8}NIS SAFE HOUSE, BRAZIL

49
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,894
We've managed to tie up Jeon's shipment
by blocking his Brazilian route.

50
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,897
If we proceed with the next step,
everything will be fine.

51
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,400
The next step is not our concern.

52
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,735
I've lost all my trust in the NIS, in you.

53
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,448
What can I do to make you trust us again?

54
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,367
Let me ask you something.
Because when you first approached me,

55
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,703
you never said it would be this dangerous.

56
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,665
To be exact, I said
I'd take responsibility for your safety.

57
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,334
Right. You told me
a NIS agent would keep me safe,

58
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,837
and if that wasn't an option,
I should run to the US Embassy.

59
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,631
But from what I saw today,
there weren't any of your agents

60
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,634
or US Embassies out
in the middle of the jungle, were there?

61
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,846
We did the best with what we had.

62
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,389
There's more than meets the eye.

63
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:54,849
No, wait.

64
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:59,020
While I was busy getting shot
and driving that truck out of there,

65
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:02,857
I realized that I'd end up dead
if I kept listening to the NIS.

66
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:08,654
So from now on, I'll be making the calls
on how and when the operations take place.

67
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,491
This isn't some town hall meeting
that only you and I are in.

68
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,660
It's an international operation
with multiple organizations involved!

69
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:18,331
Why don't you get all those guys together
and figure it out?

70
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:21,375
Because I'm the one putting my life
on the line out here!

71
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:40,144
{\an8}<i>A firefight broke out
between Brazilian soldiers</i>

72
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,272
{\an8}<i>and Surinamese drug gangs
at the Brazilian frontier.</i>

73
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:47,109
{\an8}<i>In the midst of constant crimes
committed by drug gangs,</i>

74
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:52,615
{\an8}<i>the Brazilian government said it's time
to wage war against drug trafficking.</i>

75
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:56,911
<i>The Brazilian government intercepted
a large amount of cocaine and money</i>

76
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,621
<i>from the gang members...</i>

77
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,814
Uh, Pastor,

78
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:29,110
all of our accounts connected
to European banks have been cut off.

79
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,032
What?

80
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:38,953
I'm afraid all of our accounts
have been frozen.

81
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,665
All of a sudden?

82
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,251
The only thing we know
is the order came down from Europol.

83
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:50,256
Yeah, what I want to know
is why they suddenly froze my accounts!

84
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,885
It seems like a direct response
to the incident at the border...

85
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,806
The church members captured in Brazil
must have given up some information.

86
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,027
In the middle
of that vast Amazonian jungle,

87
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,613
the Brazilian army found us
on our first sale?

88
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,616
What are the chances of that happening?

89
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:20,119
And then, as if that's not enough,
Europol bursts into the picture

90
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,787
to freeze my accounts?

91
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:27,877
There's someone among us
who's going against God's will.

92
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:31,464
A man possessed by Satan. I'm sure of it.

93
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,679
I got patched up.

94
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,061
I was on the phone with Mr. Goo earlier,

95
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:48,981
and he's asking how you will
take responsibility for this deal.

96
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,108
What? "Responsibility"?

97
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,320
We almost died out there at the exact time
and place of your choosing.

98
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:59,158
Then there's the 20 billion won worth
of product and Mr. Goo's lost cash.

99
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:03,037
You know I could file a claim for damages
under international trade laws, right?

100
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,954
Don't you?

101
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:07,124
Hey, motherfucker.
Show some respect, or I'll put you down.

102
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,167
Stay out of this, Byun.

103
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,547
I was actually trying

104
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,467
to find the hole that all my secrets
seemed to be leaking out of.

105
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,429
Until it becomes clear who is responsible,
I want you to stay put too, Mr. Kang.

106
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,642
Hey, you guys are the ones who organized
the schedule and the drop-off point,

107
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,560
and you messed it all up.

108
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,567
I feel like we keep
misunderstanding each other.

109
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,487
How about you and I
just stop doing business?

110
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,073
The schedule and the location...

111
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,118
You knew about it
just as much as we did, didn't you?

112
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,787
This is so ridiculous.

113
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,999
Who's the guy that made sure to bring back
the shipment in the middle of that mess?

114
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,001
Do you really not get it?

115
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:55,214
Fine, let's say the Brazilian soldiers
caught us by coincidence.

116
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,217
We still could have
taken care of it smoothly.

117
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,220
But someone got on his walkie-talkie
and started that mess!

118
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,389
Why did he have to go and do that? Huh?

119
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,809
Pastor's products all belong to God.

120
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,395
Protecting them
is the only right thing to do.

121
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,773
There we go, fanboy.
I knew you'd say something like that.

122
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,027
There's no need for all of this hostility.

123
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:21,866
One good look is all it takes to determine
if they're human or Satan.

124
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,273
Pastor,

125
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,277
what's the point
in complicating something so simple?

126
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,947
The person who is the most opposed
to us selling products in Korea...

127
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,616
That must be Satan, right?

128
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,204
Then, as it were, that would be Chen Zhen.

129
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,706
And someone here used to work for him

130
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,793
and still loves
to yap with him in Chinese.

131
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,003
Like this guy.

132
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,173
You fucking piece of shit!

133
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,090
Pastor,

134
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,010
let's take him out
and end this right here.

135
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,679
I told you not to act up,
you impious bastard!

136
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,310
You won't stop acting
like a gangster, will you?

137
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,479
You piece of shit!

138
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,900
You have a lot more repenting
to do, don't you?

139
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,445
No, Pastor. I repent and ask God
for forgiveness every day!

140
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,364
-Hey, Byun Kitae.
-Yes, sir.

141
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,617
-Are you possessed by Satan?
-No, Pastor, not at all!

142
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:50,663
<i>He who shouts the Lord's name</i>

143
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,874
<i>Will be granted salvation</i>

144
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,461
<i>He who shouts the Lord's name</i>

145
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,630
<i>Will be granted salvation...</i>

146
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:08,347
Whichever satanic pieces of shit
betrayed the Lord,

147
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,891
I have my eyes on all of you!

148
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,685
You guys

149
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,980
better act faithfully, got that?

150
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,022
Amen!

151
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,613
All this holy energy is
making me feel uncomfortable.

152
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:29,034
You guys can focus
on the Satan hunt by yourselves.

153
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,119
But Pastor,

154
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,497
let's end our business here.

155
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,713
What do you mean end it
when it's already a mess?

156
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,798
It's all in the open now.

157
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,135
Walk with me.

158
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,400
Thanks to you driving the truck back,

159
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,903
you saved 100 kilograms of my cocaine.

160
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:07,156
In the midst of all that...
Gosh, that's an act of bravery.

161
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,658
Bravery, my ass. I had no choice.

162
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,036
That was my livelihood and my money.

163
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,416
Your money?

164
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,795
The more I think about it, Mr. Kang,

165
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,798
the cooler you get.

166
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,635
This is anything but cool.
What are you going to do?

167
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,636
It's all falling apart.

168
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,097
Hey, but if things end here,

169
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:36,310
we can't make the big bucks
you seem so fond of.

170
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,145
Mr. Goo is furious right now.

171
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,522
I'm not sure
if he's even interested anymore.

172
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,653
I understand what you're saying.

173
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,029
Rest up for today,

174
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,949
and let me take you somewhere tomorrow.

175
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,033
Do you have a clean suit?

176
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:02,628
KANG, LET'S CHAT
SANGMAN

177
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:10,594
Yeah, I told him we wanted to call it off.

178
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:14,264
Let's see how Jeon wants to play his cards
and respond accordingly.

179
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,724
Okay, that sounds good.

180
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,645
It doesn't matter how things play out
as long as Jeon jumps into the US market.

181
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:22,398
You've been doing a great job.
Please keep it up.

182
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,026
I should be saying that to you.
Can you please do a great job?

183
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,946
If things go sideways again,
then that's it for me.

184
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,364
I'm gonna start making big bucks.

185
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,120
There won't be
any more regrettable situations.

186
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,165
Please. I really hope so.

187
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:53,429
Sihyeon.

188
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,765
You can wiretap K's cell phone, right?

189
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,766
Yes, sir.

190
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,685
Get it started. Quietly.

191
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,936
{\an8}PRESIDENTIAL PALACE, SURINAME

192
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:15,803
Oh, introduce yourself.
President Delano Alvarez of Suriname.

193
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,985
How do I say "karaoke bar" in English? Oh.

194
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,241
Come on,
why do you have to say it like that?

195
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,298
Oh, yes.

196
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,887
HONEY APPLES FROM DAEGU

197
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,601
That punk, President Delano...

198
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:13,772
It didn't use to take so much
to move him when he was younger.

199
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,484
But now he's so lazy that
no matter how much money I feed him,

200
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,820
he's slow to move.

201
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,447
Terrible mileage, if you know what I mean.

202
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,034
Oh, that's right. Come to think of it,

203
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:30,038
you and the president are alumni
from the same school.

204
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,290
Alumni?

205
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,710
Oh, you mean the prison?

206
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,877
Yeah.

207
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,963
Sint Maarten Prison.

208
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,590
He spent a few years there
on drug charges.

209
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:48,140
Three out of four people in Suriname
are somehow involved in the drug trade,

210
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:52,561
which means I'm basically
driving the economy here.

211
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,272
But the guy
who calls himself the president

212
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,648
is so stupid.

213
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,692
All he cares about are petty bribes.

214
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,279
Jeez, he should be more concerned
with the economy.

215
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:06,783
Wait, but why did you suddenly
introduce me to the president?

216
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,747
For our vision.

217
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,249
Our vision?

218
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,170
Mr. Kang.

219
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:22,257
I'm going to make sure
I catch the rat inside my organization.

220
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,011
Yes, you should.

221
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,597
I mean, Byun Kitae seems a bit off,

222
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,017
but to me,
there's something suspicious about David.

223
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,436
<i>When it comes to David,</i>

224
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,856
<i>as I'm sure you've seen,
he can't do anything on his own.</i>

225
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:40,609
<i>He's a coward with that pale face of his.</i>

226
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:45,447
<i>You never really know what goes on
in another person's head, so they say.</i>

227
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:48,867
Yeah?

228
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:55,749
Well, I might just fill you in
on what's going on inside my head today.

229
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:56,750
What do you think?

230
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:21,024
My rat problem aside, when I think
of all the guys that work for me,

231
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,151
I get so frustrated.

232
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:27,906
There's no one who has what it takes
to step up and become my partner.

233
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,618
Kitae, first of all,
he's not Korean like us.

234
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,870
You see, I like to work with my own kind.

235
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,873
Then there's David, who's too petty.

236
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,376
And while Sangjun has the guts...

237
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,586
He's a bit much, isn't he?

238
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,588
Shit.

239
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,716
At the end of the day,
dealing with people is the hardest.

240
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:50,846
MILITARY ZONE

241
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,282
Wow.

242
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,376
From here to as far as your eyes can see,

243
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:25,505
the president of Suriname designated
the entire area as a military zone.

244
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,759
No one's allowed in,
and no one's even allowed to look inside.

245
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,935
You see that over there?

246
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,229
That's where we put the processing plant.

247
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,608
We even built a canal that leads
straight into the Atlantic Ocean.

248
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,821
We just need to start growing
our coca leaves over there.

249
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,699
Wait, your plan is

250
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,869
to handle production, processing,
and distribution by yourself?

251
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:01,416
How much longer do we need to beg
the Colombians for the products?

252
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,377
The margins are bad,

253
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,881
and it's really just not enough
to satisfy my appetite.

254
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,350
How long will it take
to get everything ready?

255
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:24,314
It costs a lot more than you'd expect
to develop proprietary technology.

256
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,983
I was looking at about three years.

257
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:31,112
But thanks to your new route to Korea,
we can use that cash for R&D

258
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,281
and hopefully get it done in six months.

259
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,482
If you do a good job of exporting to Korea
and this empire finally gets built,

260
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,694
I want to make you my managing director.

261
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:16,199
You'll be right next to me
and oversee the entire operation.

262
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,039
Managing director?

263
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,625
Let's trust in that common gene we share.

264
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,169
The no-nonsense moneymaking gene.

265
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,255
Let's make a fortune.

266
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:34,009
As an incentive,
I'll give you 10% of the gross profit.

267
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,812
It depends on the yield,

268
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,940
but that's at least one billion won
monthly for you.

269
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,359
Imagine if you could send
even half of that back to Korea.

270
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:55,697
What kind of car would your wife drive?
What kind of school would your kids go to?

271
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,453
It's an honor
to hear that from you, Pastor.

272
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:05,290
Stop with that pastor thing.
We're all in the know.

273
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:09,044
There's no need for all that
when it's just you and me.

274
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:13,089
Just, fuck it, you know?
Between you and me, let's keep it real.

275
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,677
<i>Do you play golf, Mr. Kang?</i>

276
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,638
<i>You appear to be pretty athletic.</i>

277
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:23,350
<i>Oh, I don't invest any of my time
into things that don't make me money.</i>

278
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:25,810
<i>You know what?</i>

279
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,732
I love people like you
who are devoutly pragmatic.

280
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:34,653
Most people want to believe
in things that don't even exist.

281
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,281
Isn't that because their real lives
are that difficult?

282
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:41,785
That's why people go crazy over drugs.

283
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:46,122
When they're high, they get a glimpse
of things they have never seen before.

284
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,624
And it's unforgettable.

285
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:48,708
Yeah.

286
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:58,718
It's Mr. Goo. He seems really angry.

287
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,637
He says he wants
to pull out of South America.

288
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,307
What a fucking prick!
The son of a bitch is acting out.

289
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,686
What do you think about my vision?

290
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,605
I've shown you everything
from the inside out.

291
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,569
If I'm being completely honest,
it all came as a shock to me.

292
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,363
Even the offer you made me.

293
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,199
Thank you, genuinely.

294
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,913
Then convince Mr. Goo

295
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,332
and have him give you
another route into Korea.

296
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,834
For our vision.

297
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,880
Now it's your turn
to make a decision, Mr. Kang.

298
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:41,052
"To be, or not to be,
that is the question."

299
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:54,774
<i>Now it's time for us to throw out
the final piece of bait for Jeon Yohan.</i>

300
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,611
But I've only barely
gotten him to trust me.

301
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,280
Can't we wait a little longer?

302
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,866
<i>If you look at it from Jeon's perspective,</i>

303
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,493
<i>he hasn't been able to move
a single brick at this point.</i>

304
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:09,664
<i>Why not let some of his product trickle in
until the perfect time comes along?</i>

305
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,417
With all of Jeon's accounts still frozen,

306
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,754
he needs to find a way
to pay the Colombians in one month.

307
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,298
Forcing him into a corner
is the correct thing to do.

308
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,802
Hey, I get what you're saying,
but rushing things like that

309
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,304
might mess everything up.

310
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,140
This is not the right time.
Let's take things slow.

311
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,351
Mr. Kang,

312
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:34,314
are you telling me
you won't be taking orders from the NIS?

313
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,066
No, that's not what I mean.

314
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,986
I'm asking you to listen
to the man on the ground here.

315
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,322
There are certain things
that only I can get a feel for.

316
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,118
Mr. Kang, let me confirm one thing.

317
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,288
Do you and I both still have
the same goal in mind?

318
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:58,004
I'm asking in case
you have different intentions.

319
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,631
As long as that's not the case,

320
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,133
<i>we're going to move forward with our plan.</i>

321
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,067
I trust that K won't be switching sides
to go over to Jeon,

322
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,486
but don't we need to come up
with a plan B?

323
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,832
Sir, you have a call from the DEA.

324
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,009
How did it go?

325
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,179
Man, that guy has a shit personality.

326
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,515
It wasn't easy,

327
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:54,227
but he says he's looking
for another route into Korea.

328
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:58,022
You did well. You did really good.

329
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,232
I told you!

330
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,193
Thanks to me, you have new hope.

331
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,195
All right, then.

332
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,281
Let's get some work done, then.

333
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:09,200
Fucking hell!

334
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:12,453
It's a fucking blessed day today,
isn't it?

335
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,788
Why don't you take a whack?

336
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,208
Sure.

337
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,716
All right. I'm going to give it a swing.

338
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,972
It's okay. It happens.

339
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,823
{\an8}DEA HEADQUARTERS
ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA

340
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:27,296
{\an8}WASHINGTON, D.C., USA

341
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,391
<i>Sangman, what are you up to? Can we talk?</i>

342
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:41,728
What are you calling for, punk?
I said I'd call you later.

343
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,564
This is Pastor Jeon.

344
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,065
Oh, of course.

345
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,317
I heard you were a pro
with over ten years of experience.

346
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:51,779
It's a shame you made
such an amateurish mistake delivering.

347
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,784
I feel the same way.

348
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:02,415
But why don't we save our discussion
about that mishap for another time?

349
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,918
I heard from Mr. Kang

350
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,129
that you found a new route into Korea?

351
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,659
Hello? Sangman.

352
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,205
What is he doing?

353
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:45,458
Mr. Goo? Hello, Mr. Goo?

354
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:51,214
What the hell? What is he doing, dammit?!

355
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:00,765
{\an8}NIS SAFE HOUSE

356
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,850
{\an8}Send your stuff to Puerto Rico.

357
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:07,021
To where? Puerto Rico?

358
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,619
Yeah. Our path through Brazil
is blocked right now.

359
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:24,038
Going through Puerto Rico
is the only way to get to Korea.

360
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:28,543
A cargo ship carrying relief goods
is running from Suriname to Puerto Rico.

361
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,796
If you can load your goods onto that ship,

362
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:35,299
they'll get packed in Puerto Rico
and fly straight to the US base in Korea.

363
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,845
<i>But the problem is...
What's wrong with my phone?</i>

364
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,429
Yes, I'm listening, Mr. Goo.

365
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,059
This plane departs in two weeks.

366
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,894
That means we don't have much time.

367
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,730
So you're saying we have to use
the ship in Suriname

368
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:53,568
to ship my goods to Puerto Rico
within two weeks, is that it?

369
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,778
<i>Yes, that's the only option as of now.</i>

370
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:59,073
But don't force it.
We don't want any more accidents.

371
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,326
That won't be a problem.

372
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:06,414
We'll go through the Surinamese government
to load the product as relief goods.

373
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,417
Is everything good, then?

374
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:21,012
Please proceed as fast as possible, and...

375
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,027
Mr. Kang,

376
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,988
what the hell is this?

377
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,407
What do you mean?

378
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:46,287
Puerto Rico is a US territory,
for fuck's sake.

379
00:36:58,883 --> 00:36:59,884
The US?

380
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,306
Hello? Is there a problem?

381
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:06,807
Pastor?

382
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,476
Kang?

383
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,771
Mr. Goo.

384
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:15,024
We won't be able to handle it
if we run into the US with a drug issue.

385
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,359
Don't you know this?

386
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:18,277
What are you talking about?

387
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,696
What's the US got to do with this?

388
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:26,202
I'm sorry, but are you unaware
that Puerto Rico is a US territory?

389
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,373
Yes, I'm well aware.

390
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:32,959
Territorial sovereignty
is a complicated topic,

391
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,877
but it's not a part of the US.

392
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,713
Do I really need to explain
everything to you? Come on!

393
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:43,552
Sangman, don't get so worked up.
Just try to explain things nicely.

394
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:46,806
<i>Think back to earlier this year,
the Baseball Classic.</i>

395
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,182
You mean the WBC?

396
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,850
<i>Yeah, the World Baseball Classic.</i>

397
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,228
Puerto Rico was one
of the participating countries.

398
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,647
You love baseball. I'm sure you saw it.

399
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:58,693
<i>Yes, Puerto Rico was eliminated
in the second round.</i>

400
00:37:58,776 --> 00:37:59,777
Yes, exactly.

401
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:03,698
Both the US and Puerto Rico competed
in that tournament. Yes?

402
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:08,160
If Puerto Rico was a part of the US,
why would they compete against each other?

403
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:12,873
Yes, they are close with the US,
but they pick their own heads of state.

404
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,668
They're basically two distinct countries.

405
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,169
I see.

406
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:22,049
I hear you loud and clear.

407
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,261
Then send your goods to Puerto Rico,

408
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,680
and don't mess it up.

409
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,480
I understand what you're saying...

410
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:46,198
but when you're dealing
with money, guns, or drugs,

411
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:50,286
the last thing you ever want to do
is get tied up with the US.

412
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:55,124
<i>So, find me another route
that doesn't include any US territories.</i>

413
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:01,881
Wait, we only had one month to pull
this thing off when we first started.

414
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:04,300
And even though
you guys screwed everything up,

415
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:07,386
Ingu begged me
to find a new route, so I did.

416
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,512
Now you want another one?

417
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,431
<i>Things have become difficult,</i>

418
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,017
so I'm saying
that we should play it safer.

419
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,811
I'll give you more time,
so find another route.

420
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,189
What? You're giving me more time?

421
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,983
Do you think I'm your subcontractor?

422
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,614
What's with your tone?

423
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,744
Fuck, man. This is pissing me off again.

424
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,039
Who's the one
that messed up the delivery, huh?

425
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:38,626
If you're the one who shit the bed,
the least you can do is clean it yourself.

426
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:42,088
Satan must be playing with your tongue.

427
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:45,091
That's some fucking tone
you're taking with me.

428
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:48,302
How do I know you won't behave
like a bunch of amateurs again?

429
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:52,181
Why do I have to take on all that risk
just to keep doing business with you?

430
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,308
If that's how you want it, then fuck it.

431
00:39:58,604 --> 00:39:59,438
Hey, Sangman.

432
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,190
May I? Thank you.

433
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,402
Hey, why don't we do this?

434
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:07,154
Since both of you have good points,

435
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,240
let's try to reach an agreement...

436
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:12,034
<i>Ingu, you asshole.
Is this some kind of fucking joke?</i>

437
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:15,663
You want me to talk business
with those fucking dipshits you found?

438
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,624
Hey, what's with the language, man?

439
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,835
You know how I do things, right?

440
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,421
I can't do business with you like this.

441
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,883
If you continue, I've got no choice
but to call the deal off. Got it?

442
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,677
You can't just call it off like that.

443
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,764
Frankly, it could be your side
that leaked the intel to the Brazilians.

444
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,225
Why are you throwing a fit, man?

445
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,938
Hey there, Goo Sangman.

446
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,940
You want to call it off?

447
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,110
Then be my guest, you son of a bitch.

448
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,594
Agent Choi, do you think
that's going to cut it?

449
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:15,931
Good luck, then.

450
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,357
Come on, what did I tell you?

451
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,485
I told you it wouldn't work.

452
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,278
What are you going to do now?

453
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:33,032
<i>He's not going to take the deal
even if we coddle him.</i>

454
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:38,037
We need to keep pushing.
Jeon will fall eventually.

455
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,248
Wow, look at you.
You have no idea how to read people.

456
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:45,878
There are times when you should
and shouldn't push people into corners.

457
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,463
Mr. Kang,

458
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:50,633
Jeon will never be able to unload
his entire inventory in time.

459
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,801
That's what our close analysis tells us.

460
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,929
It may take some time,

461
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,931
<i>but he'll say yes to our plan.</i>

462
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,314
Hold on a second. I'll call you back.

463
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:09,276
Hey, little girl.
What are you doing here? Huh?

464
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,570
What are you doing out here?

465
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:16,033
Do you believe in this church too, mister?

466
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:19,662
No, I came here to do business.
I don't believe in God.

467
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:23,415
Then please save me.

468
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,834
What do you mean?

469
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,503
I want to go home,

470
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,713
but my daddy left overseas
and never came back.

471
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,299
And all my mom does is pray.

472
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:41,809
Hey!

473
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,897
I told you not to come here!

474
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:15,301
There is no other way for us
to capture Jeon at this point.

475
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,303
Didn't I already explain everything?

476
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:27,521
I mean, is that really
the only option we have?

477
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,608
Why are you taking the long route?

478
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:35,195
Wouldn't this whole thing be over
if you just took out the cultist psycho?

479
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:36,947
What do you mean?

480
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,240
<i>To be completely blunt,</i>

481
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:42,328
why can't we just
keep it simple and kill him?

482
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:50,336
The NIS isn't authorized
to officially engage in an assassination.

483
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,757
Then what about unofficially?

484
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,468
What do you mean unofficially?

485
00:43:57,551 --> 00:44:00,763
I mean, there are
multiple ways to kill a person.

486
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:02,723
I wouldn't even have to do it myself.

487
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,976
We need to keep Jeon alive
so he can testify in court.

488
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,020
That's the only way to truly punish him.

489
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:12,983
Are you doing this so you can get
a promotion or something?

490
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:13,901
What?

491
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:19,490
I've never been one
to care about that kind of thing.

492
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:23,494
I just hope this operation
we've been working on for three years

493
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:25,537
ends successfully.

494
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:29,416
Hey, it's already packed full of problems.

495
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,419
How can you possibly expect things
to end smoothly?

496
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:36,215
Hey, I don't know, man.
I'm going to make my own decisions.

497
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:38,175
I'll call you back later.

498
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:51,605
Even if we use our church members
to maximize our exports to Europe

499
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,023
within a safe range,

500
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,859
unloading the remaining 1,9 tons

501
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,278
will take over a year.

502
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:01,115
What about selling
to the European mob families?

503
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,409
I sent out some offers
to a few different places,

504
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:07,371
but most of them are already working
directly with the Cali Cartel,

505
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,540
<i>so even if we strike a deal...</i>

506
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,879
<i>I got another call
from Colombia this morning.</i>

507
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,424
<i>They heard about what happened in Brazil.</i>

508
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:22,970
<i>They started pestering me
about paying their money back.</i>

509
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,252
There's something else. Another way we.

510
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,087
Sir?

511
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:01,925
The dirty way.

512
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,262
Get the car ready.

513
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:25,115
IS PASTOR JEON LOOKING
INTO A DIFFERENT ROUTE?

514
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,747
SANGMAN

515
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:43,809
