1
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:08,299
THIS SERIES IS INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY

2
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:11,761
BUT CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
HAVE BEEN REIMAGINED FOR DRAMATIC PURPOSES

3
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:24,149
A believer in Daegu
sends me these every month.

4
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:27,527
This month, they're extra crisp and juicy.

5
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,154
Here, have a bite.

6
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,699
Just cut to the chase and ask away.

7
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,745
Your soul is filled with anger.

8
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,621
Let's try and calm down a bit.

9
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:43,126
If it was you who lost
every penny you owned

10
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,962
and just came back
from doing time in a foreign country,

11
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,006
would you be able to calm down?

12
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:50,800
Look.

13
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,344
Why did you kill my friend Eungsoo?

14
00:00:56,097 --> 00:01:00,268
Every part of life, including death,
is planned by God Almighty.

15
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,480
What a load of bullshit.

16
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,231
That doesn't make any damn sense.

17
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,608
{\an8}ON BEHALF OF GOD

18
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:14,157
All I did was ask you
why you came back to Suriname.

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,909
But our conversation is dragging on.

20
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:18,369
I asked, so answer me.
Let's get it over with.

21
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,664
How many times do I have to tell you?
I'm here to make money.

22
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,335
I heard Suriname has loads of cocaine.

23
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,629
I plan on setting up shop
and selling it in Korea.

24
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:31,508
You're telling me that you came back
to sell cocaine in Korea?

25
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:35,178
I lost everything I have,
so I can't even afford to raise my kids.

26
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:38,431
This happened unexpectedly
because of some asshole,

27
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,017
so I need to make
a lot of money, you know?

28
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,784
It's true.
Cocaine is worth a lot of money.

29
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,831
But you'll need my help
if you want to source any from Suriname.

30
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:09,504
I decided to collab with Chen Zhen.
You know, the owner of the hot pot place.

31
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,757
Coming from a continental country,
he's really straightforward.

32
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:13,675
No bullshit.

33
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,178
Chen Zhen only deals in meth.

34
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:22,016
Meth is synthetic, man-made.
It's like Satan's phlegm.

35
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,268
Whereas cocaine

36
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,479
is a natural blessing from God.

37
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:30,900
And the only person
who can handle that blessing in Suriname

38
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,485
is yours truly.

39
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,488
Shit, I don't give a damn
about any of that.

40
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,490
Chen Zhen told me he has his own ways.

41
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,246
And a smart guy like you believed him?

42
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,213
His only way is to scrape a few crumbs
off the streets of Suriname.

43
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,800
But even those tiny crumbs
come from me in the first place.

44
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,637
Retail price is bound to be expensive,
and your margins will be low.

45
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:20,491
You'll only get your hands on meth
if you work with Chen Zhen.

46
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,702
How much would you make
with meth in Korea?

47
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,329
Brother.

48
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,874
Now that you've heard my words,
are you starting to see the light?

49
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,322
SANGMAN

50
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:58,840
Hey, Sangman?

51
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,259
<i>Hey there, Kang.
Have you been eating well?</i>

52
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,678
<i>How's business with the Chinese folks?</i>

53
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,097
We have different tastes,
so it hasn't been easy.

54
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,933
I think we're on the verge
of a diplomatic conflict.

55
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,768
We can't come to an agreement.

56
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,146
{\an8}China and Korea
have been fighting for 5,000 years.

57
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,355
{\an8}NIS SAFE HOUSE, BRAZIL

58
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,524
{\an8}It'll be difficult to suddenly get along.

59
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,654
Yeah, I'm "fighting for the money"
as we speak.

60
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,741
Now, I ran across a distributor here.

61
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,243
He's Korean.
I know it may feel a bit sudden,

62
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,162
<i>but can you talk business right now?</i>

63
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,831
Yeah, sure. Put him on.

64
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,291
Go ahead.

65
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,213
Hello.

66
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,800
This is Pastor Jeon,
and I lead a church here in Suriname.

67
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,552
Oh yes, hello.

68
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,305
I'm Goo Sangman in the trading business.
It's a pleasure.

69
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,973
So you're a pastor?

70
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,142
I'm actually a church elder.

71
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,311
<i>What a delightful surprise.</i>

72
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,690
Indeed. Amen.

73
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:01,652
Let's continue our spiritual conversation
at another time.

74
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:02,779
Mr. Goo,

75
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,699
I heard our goods can be delivered
from here to Korea.

76
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,618
How does that work exactly?

77
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:13,748
I cannot give you details
since it's my business know-how,

78
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,292
but to put it simply,

79
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,505
the US forces in Korea
eat a lot of chicken,

80
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,424
and 60% of that is imported
from where I am, Brazil.

81
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,802
<i>Stuff the chickens with your goods
and ship them out.</i>

82
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,305
<i>They'll go straight to Itaewon and Gangnam
without passing customs.</i>

83
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,067
That does sound like an interesting plan,

84
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:46,155
but I don't think it's right
to talk business over the phone.

85
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:50,701
What do you say we meet up
and talk about it in person?

86
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,710
<i>That sounds wonderful to me.</i>

87
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,547
The thing is,
I have a lot on my plate at the moment.

88
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:08,094
Would you mind making a trip to Brazil?

89
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,973
If you do, I'll show you a good time
and make it memorable.

90
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,225
Brazil is a great place to party.

91
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,152
It would be great

92
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,821
for me to get some fresh air,

93
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,489
but as a member of the clergy,

94
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,909
I couldn't miss out
on any of our services.

95
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,832
Ah, I see.

96
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:41,461
Jeez. As a member of the church,
I should've thought of that.

97
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,588
I apologize, Pastor.

98
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,257
How about you take a trip
to Suriname instead?

99
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,396
I made a big mistake, Pastor.

100
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,355
Sorry?

101
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,816
Of course,
I should be the one traveling to you.

102
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:08,196
Let me clear my schedule
and head over to Suriname.

103
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,991
Hallelujah! Thank you!

104
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:17,205
Let me know about your travel plans.
I'll treat you as a guest of the state.

105
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,959
Sangman, are you sure? Aren't you busy?

106
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,337
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

107
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,840
<i>If I can help you make some money,
one flight is not a big deal.</i>

108
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,885
I'll clear my schedule
and let you know right away.

109
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:31,928
See you soon.

110
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:35,848
Okay, then. Enjoy your in-flight meal,
and we'll be seeing you soon.

111
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,811
All right. Why don't we discuss
our business conditions now?

112
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:45,775
Let's keep it simple and go with
the international standard of 50-50, okay?

113
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,444
Brother,

114
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:53,366
the book of James tells us
that desire gives birth to sin.

115
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,786
And when sin is grown,
it gives birth to death.

116
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:01,123
I take 70, you take 30.
That's the way it goes.

117
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,291
Seventy?

118
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,377
Are you joking?

119
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,128
Let's just call it off.

120
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,633
Someone's obsessed with money.

121
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,802
Thanks to someone.

122
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,227
We'll discuss the split
when Mr. Goo gets here.

123
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,991
Sir, don't you think
this might be too dangerous?

124
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,743
If your identity is revealed,

125
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,954
the operation fails.

126
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,039
It fails if I don't go as well.

127
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,794
And I've always wanted to see
that damn face of Jeon's.

128
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,839
Been chasing him for three years.

129
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,008
It'll break my heart
if I don't see him at least once.

130
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,640
Let's get ready for a business trip.

131
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,041
INCOMING CALL
KANG THE PROFESSIONAL

132
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,753
Hey there, Kang.
Have you been eating well?

133
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,589
<i>I'm eating alone
at the hotel breakfast bar.</i>

134
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:32,923
<i>What time is your flight?</i>

135
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,218
Yeah. My flight leaves at 9:30.

136
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,679
I had been meaning to call you
before I flew out.

137
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:43,184
<i>Here's the thing. I was planning
to go out and meet you at the airport,</i>

138
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:46,312
<i>but Jeon told me to stay put
because he was gonna take care of it.</i>

139
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,731
<i>Isn't that a bit strange?</i>

140
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,776
It sure is. I wonder why he did that.

141
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,071
<i>He said things would get complicated
if I showed up.</i>

142
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,365
<i>Anyway, have a safe flight.</i>

143
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,618
All right. Don't worry too much.
I'll be okay.

144
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,621
<i>Oh, I wanted to say this just in case.</i>

145
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:07,375
<i>You should be mindful of your attire.</i>

146
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,670
<i>You're supposed to be
a businessman from the underworld.</i>

147
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,130
<i>It would be weird
if you look like a straitlaced guy.</i>

148
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,341
All right. I understand.

149
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,259
I'll dress appropriately.

150
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,179
<i>Okay. I'll see you soon. Goodbye.</i>

151
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,681
Bye.

152

{\an8}JOHAN ADOLF PENGEL INT'L AIRPORT
SURINAME

153
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,841
Hello, I'm David Julio Park,
Pastor Jeon's legal advisor.

154
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,635
This is Deacon Lee Sangjun.

155
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,388
Goo Sangman,
international trade businessman.

156
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,307
You guys are a bunch
of good-looking fellas, aren't you?

157
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,941
If you'd give me your passport,
I'll help with your entry.

158
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:20,156
Wow, I sure feel His power and glory.
Here it is.

159
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,377
Salute!

160
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,821
Show him a good time, girls.

161
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,532
Make yourself comfortable, daddy.

162
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,744
-Awesome, fucking awesome.
-Relax.

163
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:48,410
Hey there, Kang.
Have you been eating well?

164
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,665
Aw, the food here is not that great.

165
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,917
Hey, this here is Pastor Jeon.

166
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,293
And this here is Mr. Goo.

167
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:59,755
So we finally meet under God's guidance.
It's an honor.

168
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,761
I'm grateful that you made the long trip
all the way out here.

169
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,264
Shall we?

170
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,181
Sure.

171
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:13,143
It would have been nice
if you had come to Brazil.

172
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,856
It's a great place for men
if you know what I mean.

173
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,901
As a clergyman, I try to abstain
from those sorts of activities.

174
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,404
But I must say, I sure am curious.

175
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,742
As you already know,

176
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,453
the GDP of Northeast Asian countries
has been on the rise in tandem

177
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,788
with China's economic growth.

178
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,375
As a result, the demand for narcotics
is also increasing at a tremendous rate.

179
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,211
Yes, indeed.

180
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,215
But traditionally speaking,

181
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,384
isn't the consumption of cocaine
rather low in Korea?

182
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,470
It's no surprise,
given the poor quality of the products.

183
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:54,059
Koreans still line up to buy
German Mercedes and French Chanel bags.

184
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,103
I call that the power of luxury goods.

185
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,650
Pastor, now it's time
for Colombian cocaine to shine.

186
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,529
My plan is to unload
the entire supply in one go.

187
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,949
Not just in Korea
but also in China and Japan.

188
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,576
A synchronized launch.

189
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,208
Well...

190
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:23,088
Chinese folks still suffer trauma
from the Opium Wars.

191
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,383
They're bound to have a fit
at the first mention of drugs.

192
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,740
REPUBLIC OF KOREA
GOO SANGMAN

193
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,712
You must be tired after the flight.

194
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,424
I flew first class, so it wasn't too bad.

195
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,719
Travel fatigue can lead
to serious diseases.

196
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,099
Preacher Byun, would you take our guests

197
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,267
to get some rest?

198
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,144
Yes, sir.

199
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,303
Our guests need to rest.

200
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,452
Rest up, then.

201
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:41,477
<i>Wow, this is fucking depressing.
Not a single window in here. Dang...</i>

202
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,896
<i>Are we locked up in here?</i>

203
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:47,316
<i>Nah, he probably wants us to sleep well
without any sunlight.</i>

204
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,497
What should we do, Pastor?

205
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,688
Did you get some rest?

206
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,401
It's nice and cozy,
without the sun bothering you.

207
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,500
Mr. Goo, let me ask you a few things.

208
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,419
Two years ago,

209
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,006
you were here in Suriname, is that right?

210
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,175
Can you explain?

211
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,228
You're right.

212
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,314
I came here two years ago
in search of cocaine.

213
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:13,235
But try as I might,
I couldn't get my hands on any, so I left.

214
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,071
He's right.

215
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,074
That was when Sangman came to Suriname

216
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,660
and told me
about the skate business opportunity,

217
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,912
which went down the drain
thanks to someone.

218
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:35,883
You came here for cocaine,
but you visited the US Embassy?

219
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:43,432
A thief went to the police station
to steal, is that right?

220
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,904
I'm busy, that's all.

221
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:00,908
Whether it's a lie or whatever it is,
let's just hear it already. Damn it!

222
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,628
There was an employee...

223
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,382
who was in charge of trades
and involved in smuggling too.

224
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:21,178
I reached out to him to find out
if there's a way to move some coke,

225
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,512
but this asshole...

226
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,727
This fucking Yankee owed gambling debts
to the Chinese loan sharks.

227
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,772
He was too scared to walk outside,
so he called me to the embassy.

228
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,651
When I went there,
all he was selling was fucking meth.

229
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,194
So I called it off and walked out.

230
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,403
The Yankee's name?

231
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,242
I think it was Douglas Harper?

232
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,454
Preacher!

233
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:51,166
You were rolling with the Chinese gang
two years ago, right?

234
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,502
Do you know Douglas Harper?

235
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,968
There are a lot of white boys

236
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,929
who borrow money for gambling and meth.

237
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,100
I don't remember all of their names.

238
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,853
Come on, you guys.

239
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:15,524
We don't like doing business
like countryside gangsters.

240
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,568
We're not filming an action movie, are we?

241
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,659
We can't always do what we like, you know.

242
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,540
Just tell the truth
before I interrogate you guys for real.

243
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,293
What are you guys even doing out here?

244
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,129
Fuck it, then.
I'm not taking any more of your bullshit.

245
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,257
Let's call it off.

246
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,970
No one is allowed to leave
until the pastor says so.

247
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,388
Piss off, asshole!

248
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,725
Hey, Sangman, come on.
You're scaring me now, Sangman!

249
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,977
Let's calm down,
take a seat, and talk it over.

250
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,688
Hey, forget it.
I don't want you to ever call me again.

251
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,857
You know I can't stand punks
who don't make me money.

252
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,651
Where'd you find this group
of fucking amateurs, anyway?

253
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,241
Hey, what was that? What happened?

254
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,828
No outs, a batter walked,
and the next one hit a double.

255
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,497
Ah, come on, dammit!

256
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,641
That's it!

257
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,354
Let's get one more out, Chanho, okay?

258
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:41,068
We should support our fellow citizens
living so far away from home, no?

259
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,664
Douglas Harper, was it?

260
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:59,836
You guys can sit tight
until we check that Yankee out.

261
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,176
We can't do business together
if things don't feel right.

262
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,304
What if I go back?

263
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,598
What are you going to do
if I go back to Brazil?

264
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,934
Who are you to tell me to sit tight?

265
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,478
Either way,

266
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:20,107
you can't go back to Brazil
without my permission.

267
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,234
Preacher!

268
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,779
-Take them to a hotel.
-Yes, Pastor.

269
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,699
Well, well!

270
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:35,038
Gosh! That's a good ball.
A really good ball, man!

271
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,627
David,

272
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,588
don't let those guys leave the country.

273
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,633
And check the US embassy
for this Douglas Harper.

274
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,138
The list of employees at the US Embassy...

275
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,014
That's not going to be easy to get.

276
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,689
I don't care if you bribe them
or roll a tank through their front door.

277
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,066
Figure it out by the end of the day.

278
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,862
Hey, David.

279
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,158
I asked you nicely,
but an order is still an order.

280
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,172
Can we still salvage this situation?

281
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,883
You must have had a clean passport
if you're a NIS agent.

282
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:13,345
Just like you said in your initial report,
Jeon is overly skeptical.

283
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,639
If I showed up with a clean passport,

284
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:18,725
he would never give us
the two tons of product that we need.

285
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:21,019
Wait, so it was your plan
to make him suspicious?

286
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,187
Not necessarily.

287
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,648
But it's true
Douglas Harper worked at the US Embassy,

288
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,650
and there were issues with his conduct.

289
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,819
If this works out,
it'll be easier for you to work.

290
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:34,574
You should have told me about this
before I came into the country.

291
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,743
You had me spooked back there.

292
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,872
You're not so different from Jeon
when it comes to not trusting people.

293
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,793
I know you're going through a lot.

294
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:46,962
But I want to be clear

295
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,674
that everything is being controlled
under the strategy of the NIS.

296
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:55,053
The NIS that's asking a karaoke bar owner
to carry out their mission?

297
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,769
<i>Hello. How did it go?</i>

298
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,355
<i>It's been five hours already!</i>

299
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,610
David, just pull out.

300
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:55,989
It's a shame, but let's get rid
of Kang Ingu and Goo Sangman.

301
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,408
Why don't we wait a bit longer?

302
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:02,162
Two Korean men found dead at a hotel
will draw some attention.

303
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:04,581
<i>Hey.</i>

304
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:07,250
That's for me to worry about!

305
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,306
I'll take care of them
as cleanly as possible, sir.

306
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,691
Shut off all the security cameras.

307
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,860
We're going in five minutes.

308
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,667
<i>The CIA agent we used to work with
introduced me to the guy.</i>

309
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,502
<i>We can trust him.</i>

310
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,880
<i>Douglas Harper's name
is right here on the list.</i>

311
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:40,009
<i>And his performance reviews mention
both smuggling and his debts.</i>

312
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,823
PASTOR JEON

313
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:05,744
It's the pastor.

314
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:12,917
<i>Mr. Kang.</i>

315
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,504
I have an offer to make.

316
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:56,836
When I saw him watching a baseball game
in the middle of a meeting,

317
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,588
I thought he didn't need any money.

318
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,799
Why don't you stick to cheering
on Chanho Park?

319
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:04,219
Hey, die-hard baseball fans
would rather starve

320
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,805
than ever miss a single game.

321
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,556
Let's respect his interests.

322
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,854
I have to admit, I may have been impolite.

323
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,856
To express my regret,

324
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:22,111
I will send the two tons of cocaine
as we discussed.

325
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,574
You mean it?

326
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:32,330
But you need to deliver it in person
to a spot near the Brazilian border.

327
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,498
Can you make it happen?

328
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,583
Yes, of course.

329
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,670
But since it's such a large shipment,

330
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:43,007
To get that weight from Colombia,
pack it up nicely, and deliver it to you...

331
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,221
I'll need about a month.

332
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,639
One month?

333
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,478
It will arrive
right before the ship departs.

334
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,855
The ball.

335
00:30:58,731 --> 00:30:59,732
Then...

336
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,653
you can consider it a done deal.

337
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,905
How do you intend
to make your advance payment?

338
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,870
Let's do this.

339
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,956
You import it from Colombia, right?

340
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,334
We need to take a look at the goods too.

341
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,005
If you show the goods to Mr. Kang
after I return to Brazil,

342
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:24,674
I'll wire the money to an escrow account.

343
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,887
Sure, that sounds fair.

344
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:29,888
Let's do that.

345
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,432
Yes. Let's do it.

346
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:34,809
The ball.

347
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,691
I take 60, you take 40.

348
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:44,694
I'm afraid God won't allow
anything higher than that.

349
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:50,074
Okay, fine.
Let's talk about it again later on.

350
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,662
It's been a while
since I last threw a ball.

351
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,837
Wow, you got a great arm!

352
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:07,050
To celebrate our deal,
let's all have a meal together.

353
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,176
That sounds good.

354
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,594
Sure.

355
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:43,169
Hey, before you leave,

356
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:46,381
can you introduce me
to your NIS agent in Suriname?

357
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,443
If undercover agents know each other,

358
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,445
it increases the chances
of getting caught.

359
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,948
What? Am I an agent too?

360
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,575
Well, not exactly,

361
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,036
but trust me on this one.

362
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:21,207
Wait, you keep on saying
trust this and trust that.

363
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:24,502
How can I trust you
when you're all talk and no action?

364
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,424
They have raw beef there!

365
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:34,804
How's the food?

366
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,891
The chefs here are great
at whipping up Korean food.

367
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:42,311
I heard you like Korean-style raw beef,
so I had them prepare it.

368
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,813
Oh, the raw beef?

369
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:46,357
I mean, it's not bad,

370
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,235
but the texture of the meat is so soft.

371
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,946
It feels like the infamous American beef.
Am I right?

372
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:56,200
It'd be more appropriate to say
that it melts in your mouth,

373
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,869
thanks to the marbling.

374
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,287
Try some more.

375
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,460
Oh, Mr. Kang.

376
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:06,377
Yes.

377
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,966
Now that the major contract is closed,
we're business partners.

378
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,720
Why don't you move into my house
until the deal is finished?

379
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,555
You can save money on hotel fees.

380
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:25,730
You're still so suspicious
that now you're trying to hold me hostage?

381
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,565
Oh gosh, no!

382
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:32,945
It will be nice for two baseball fans
to root for Chanho Park together.

383
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:38,743
You see, when like-minded people
spend time with each other,

384
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,870
that's how you create synergy.

385
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:46,000
I thought you and I were rather different.

386
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:54,717
I'm saying we should try
to get along by staying together.

387
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:58,805
Ever since I saw you living
in that shabby skate fish factory,

388
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,766
it's weighed heavily on my heart.

389
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,935
Yeah, right.

390
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,939
What about ruining my skate business?
Do you feel bad about that?

391
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,614
I suffered losses from that too.

392
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:21,994
It was an unfortunate accident
that I never intended to happen.

393
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,047
I'll send someone tomorrow, so move in.

394
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:40,031
To get two tons of cocaine from Colombia,

395
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,742
Jeon will to have to spend a lot of money.

396
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,536
We will use that point to our advantage.

397
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,636
There's one thing I don't understand.

398
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,262
My skates...

399
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:07,975
How did Dutch customs know
that there was cocaine in the fish?

400
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,314
I heard this while I was in prison,

401
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:16,776
but the chances of anything being
discovered without an insider tip

402
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,736
is less than a thousand to one.

403
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,324
So this whole time,

404
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,202
I just thought I got super unlucky.

405
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,961
Could it be

406
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,381
that the NIS made the tip-off?

407
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,010
That my skates were full of coke?

408
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,598
I mean, I thought long and hard about it,
and that's the only explanation.

409
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:52,645
Am I right?

410
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,648
Wow, I am right!

411
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:58,359
And now you're forcing me
to do all of this?

412
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,405
We were trying to stop Jeon's cocaine
from making it into Korea.

413
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,699
We never intended
to cause you any harm, Mr. Kang.

414
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,909
Hey, you punk!

415
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,996
If they find coke in my fish,
of course, I would be affected.

416
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,539
Are you kidding me?

417
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:15,126
I poured all my money into the business,
and you're the ones who wiped me out!

418
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,460
Mr. Kang.

419
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,422
I work for the greater good
of our country.

420
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:22,174
We make the best call
for the national interest and...

421
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,969
Are you being serious? National interest?

422
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:28,097
Are you playing with me?
What <i>is</i> the national interest?

423
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,142
Is it ruining the life
of an ordinary person like me?

424
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,352
We weren't trying to ruin your life.

425
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:36,939
But for all that's happened,

426
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:38,983
I feel sorry for you.

427
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:49,368
Gosh, you forced your way into my life,
and you're still shameless.

428
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,912
How do you expect me to trust you
and work for you?

429
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,415
I'd rather work with Jeon
and make some real money.

430
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,001
What do you mean by that?

431
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:59,170
What's the difference
between him and the NIS?

432
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,088
You're both doing the same thing,

433
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,299
backstabbing and exploiting people.

434
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:07,720
I'm saying I'd rather choose the side
that actually makes money.

435
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,558
I'm going to think
you said that in a fit of anger.

436
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,435
No, it's not out of anger.

437
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,812
Just as national interest
is your number one concern,

438
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:19,190
my personal interests
are my number one concern.

439
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,823
That raw beef must've gone bad.
I feel so nauseous.

440
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:55,267
Kang. Make sure you eat well.

441
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,770
Let's have some fun
while we make big bucks, okay?

442
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,606
Yeah, we'll be making a lot of money.

443
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,942
Go get some rest, and take a shower.

444
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:03,859
Sure.

445
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,528
Welcome!

446
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,905
Good morning. It's a good day.

447
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:53,033
All right.
Let's start making some real money now.

448
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,452
When are the goods coming in?

449
00:40:55,578 --> 00:41:00,749
I must say, I think your head is filled
with cash instead of a brain.

450
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,211
Take a tour of the place first.

451
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,797
Enjoy a little jacuzzi time with us.

452
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,049
Show him a good time.

453
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,802
Whoa, no. I'm fine.

454
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:15,181
I'm a bit of a loner,
so I feel more comfortable being alone.

455
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,977
You came here to be saved,
and you run away?

456
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,688
Get your act together.

457
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:52,695
We pray to you, Lord.
Please forgive this sinner.

458
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,989
Please forgive her.

459
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:58,576
Save your daughter from her greed.

460
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,744
Please save her.

461
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:04,039
We gave in to temptation.
We repent of our sins.

462
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,708
Please embrace us.

463
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,543
Please embrace us.

464
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:11,046
Lord, protect us from evil!

465
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,550
We repent for our arrogance and pride!

466
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:16,635
Amen.

467
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,220
Amen.

468
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,264
Amen.

469
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:22,933
Amen.

470
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,518
Amen.

CHEN ZHEN

475
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:52,463
{\an8}NIS SAFE HOUSE, BRAZIL

476
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,345
Hey there, Kang.
Have you been eating well?

477
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:00,929
<i>Yes, I'm alone right now.</i>

478
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:03,098
I found an area behind Jeon's house

479
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,351
that hasn't been bugged yet.

480
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,437
I've been waiting for your call.

481
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,857
First, there's something I'd like to say.

482
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:13,942
I sincerely apologize

483
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:17,655
for the tremendous damage
the NIS operation has caused in your life.

484
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,782
Forget it. I don't wanna talk about it.

485
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:22,868
No, I'd like to express
my apologies once again.

486
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,872
You're going through
a lot more than we expected,

487
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:30,125
so we're discussing a possible reward
in addition to the agreed-upon payment.

488
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:33,003
Now things are finally working out.

489
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:36,590
Thank you for approaching the matter
in such a sincere way.

490
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,093
And I will generously accept your apology.

491
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,178
Is there anything else you want to report?

492
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:44,598
Chen Zhen keeps on threatening me
to meet up with him.

493
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,642
<i>How should I deal with this punk?</i>

494
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:48,268
CHEN ZHEN CONTINUES TO THREATEN

495
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:51,271
If you end up arranging a meeting,
let us know.

496
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,856
We will come up with a plan.

497
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:56,568
Also, about his followers...

498
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,071
Yes, you can speak freely.

499
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:02,074
I observed them like you asked me to,

500
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:06,161
and it seems they punish each other
and beat each other up. It's wild.

501
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:09,331
They even hand out drinks
laced with cocaine,

502
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:12,668
but the problem is that
even children are drinking them.

503
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,462
The children?

504
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:25,764
{\an8}SURINAME AIR FORCE BASE

505
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,316
Ah shit.

506
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:19,193
Welcome, my dear friend!

507
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:23,655
Everything is good, pal.

508
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,391
Here.

509
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:58,440
Yes.

510
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,586
The merch is ready.

511
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,773
It's pure, as expected.

512
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:45,195
Colombian cocaine truly is the real deal.

513
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:48,866
It's filled with the Holy Spirit. Yes.

514
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:07,968
<i>Hey there, Kang.
Have you been eating well?</i>

515
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:11,388
I just arrived at Chen Zhen's casino.
No one's around.

516
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,435
Wait, you can't just go there
without a heads-up...

517
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:19,271
All right.

518
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:21,607
<i>What's your plan
when you meet with Chen Zhen?</i>

519
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,611
What else is there to do?
I'll stall for time and tell him to wait.

520
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,405
You don't think they'll hurt me, do you?

521
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:32,951
<i>It's not easy for a Chinese and Korean guy
to communicate in English.</i>

522
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:36,204
<i>Catch him. Grab him!</i>

523
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:37,122
Mr. Kang.

524
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,541
What's going on? Mr. Kang.

525
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:41,376
Hey, Kang!

526
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,838
-Grab him!
-Fuck!

527
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,131
-Kick him.
-Knock him down!

528
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:47,132
Fuck!

529
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,259
Fuck!

530
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:54,598
Fucking bastard!

531
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,361
Goddamn it!

532
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,753
Boss, let's cut and feed him
to the gators.

533
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:48,920
Sure.

534
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:55,946
INCOMING CALL
KANG THE PROFESSIONAL

535
00:51:58,532 --> 00:51:59,741
<i>This is Kang Ingu.</i>

536
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,493
Mr. Kang, are you okay?

537
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,120
Am I okay?

538
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:06,039
Chen Zhen's gang just released me.

539
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,707
I nearly got eaten by gators.

540
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:09,960
I'm so sorry.

541
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:12,504
We should've paid more attention
to your safety...

542
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:14,923
Where's that agent
who was supposed to help me

543
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:16,258
when things get dangerous?

544
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:17,634
Are they busy right now?

545
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:18,718
Do they even exist?

546
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:23,098
As you know, it's difficult for outsiders
to enter Chinatown.

547
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:28,019
Are you telling me to be in danger
only when I'm outside of Chinatown?

548
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,814
From this point on,

549
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:32,607
<i>we'll pay more attention to your safety.</i>

550
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,585
How did you know I was here?

551
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:56,089
We were unable to locate you,
so Pastor Jeon ordered us to ask around.

552
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:59,467
Do you have some sort of beef
with the Chinatown gangs?

553
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:04,764
No, I played baccarat at the casinos
and lost all my money.

554
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,349
So I borrowed some extra cash,

555
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,476
and those bastards wanted to play dirty.

556
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,353
That's what happens

557
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,732
when you leave the house
without saying a word, boy.

558
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:16,234
The pastor's been waiting a long time.

559
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:17,611
Let's go.

560
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:30,790
Track the location of K's phone.

561
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:38,381
-Put this on your head.
-What is that?

562
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,637
Gosh, could you guys be
any more old-fashioned?

563
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:33,228
It looks like Byun pulled a prank on you.

564
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:39,526
What's wrong with your face?

565
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,361
That's just from my gambling debts...

566
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,447
What is all this?

567
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:45,991
It just arrived today.

568
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:49,035
That's why we were being extra cautious,

569
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,120
so bear with it.

570
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:53,081
You're saying that this is our shipment?

571
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:54,457
That's right.

572
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,627
It's our cocaine,
destined to wake up the souls in Asia.

573
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:08,888
What is it about this white powder
that touches people so powerfully?

574
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:11,308
It's top-notch, that's why.

575
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:15,020
A total of 80 packages,
each weighing 25 kilograms.

576
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,148
Okay. I'm done checking.

577
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,026
Let me take a photo to send to Brazil.

578
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:23,695
Let's see.

579
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:28,992
TWO TONS CONFIRMED

580
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:34,164
Okay. We finally got Jeon where we want.

581
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:35,832
Send the advance to Jeon's account,

582
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:38,418
and contact the ABIN
so we can start working together.

583
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:53,892
We received the advance
of eight million dollars.

584
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:01,524
Wow, that punk sure moves fast.

585
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:06,946
As for our route
toward the Brazilian border,

586
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,240
try and make it
through the Sipaliwini River area.

587
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,243
Somewhere as safe as possible for us.

588
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:17,707
We'll try and seize control
of the rendezvous point.

589
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:25,673
I heard they found a route
to the Brazilian border.

590
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:28,885
They want to know if you're available
the day after tomorrow

591
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:30,095
for the initial meetup.

592
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:33,848
Jeon says he'll let us know
the exact location later on.

593
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:36,393
It doesn't matter,
as long as it's Brazilian territory.

594
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:39,813
If you do exactly as I tell you,
you will be safe.

595
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,399
Okay, I'll keep that in mind. Don't worry.

596
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:46,361
<i>Is there anything else
I should be aware of?</i>

597
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:49,030
There's nothing special,

598
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:53,910
but being in a foreign country
hasn't been good for my mental state.

599
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,957
A long time ago,
my father went to Vietnam to make money.

600
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,834
He probably felt the same way, right?

601
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,252
It's the same for me too.

602
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,925
I know how you feel
after living overseas for years

603
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,176
serving our country.

604
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:14,013
If the Brazil operation is successful,
the DEA will move in no time.

605
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,099
Please hang in there
for just a little while.

606
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:17,016
All right.

607
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,102
One more thing.

608
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,939
Remember the bonus
you talked about before?

609
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,733
Yes, are you talking
about the reward payment?

610
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:27,735
<i>Yes, the 20 million won.</i>

611
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:33,324
Would it be possible to send that
to Eungsoo's family today?

612
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:36,828
It's Eungsoo's birthday today.

613
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:41,166
Oh, I see. I'll try to make it happen.

614
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,878
<i>Okay then, Mr. Kang.
I'll see you in two days.</i>

615
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:47,380
Yes. I'll see you in Brazil, Sangman.

616
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,305
Now...

617
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:59,058
Here.

618
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:18,286
Mr. Kang.

619
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:22,874
This must be your first time
doing anything like this.

620
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:25,126
How do you feel? Are you nervous?

621
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:29,714
Not even. I'm thrilled to be making money.

622
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,886
An autographed ball celebrating
Chanho Park's 100th win.

623
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:38,431
It's always been my lucky charm.
I'm giving it to you as a gift.

624
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,976
Gosh. Chanho Park? You didn't have to.

625
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,312
I feel bad
for not being able to go with you.

626
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:45,730
I have worship service.

627
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:49,692
It's just my way of saying
go out there and break a leg.

628
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:51,277
All right.

629
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:06,793
{\an8}SURINAME-BRAZIL BORDER

630
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,209
DAVID PARK

631
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:49,377
We got it.

632
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:55,425
We received the final coordinates
from Jeon's side.

633
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:56,843
We're ten minutes out.

634
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,304
As I already mentioned,
my team will be handling the deal.

635
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:03,308
<i>As for the Venezuelan team,
when the Brazilian border patrol shows up</i>

636
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:05,226
<i>and tries to confiscate the cocaine,</i>

637
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:07,645
<i>all you have to do
is act sufficiently surprised.</i>

638
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:10,898
<i>The guns we provided
should be thought of as props.</i>

639
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:16,362
Our goal for this mission is to peacefully
have the cocaine and money seized

640
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:17,905
without the use of any firearms.

641
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:22,368
Note that any further details
cannot be shared due to our policy.

642
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:25,121
<i>Thank you for your cooperation. Over.</i>

643
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:28,082
That's a normal day at the office. Over.

644
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:35,983
Kang! Have you been eating well?

645
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:39,737
No rest stops on the way here,
so I didn't get a single bite.

646
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:42,907
But it's fine. I brought something
a lot tastier than food.

647
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:43,950
Great!

648
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:48,121
Mr. Park, all of you must be starving.
Shall we get right to it?

649
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:00,925
Nice. That's a good habit.

650
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:02,009
Hey, come on.
