1
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,840
Coming!

2
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,440
Regarding the recent drama on set,

3
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,840
do you have any comments?

4
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,600
Are the online rumors true?

5
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,160
Excuse me, please make way.

6
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,680
Is it true that Mr. Cheng Dong fainted on set

7
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,039
because of you?

8
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,280
Is Mr. Cheng's resignation related to you

9
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,560
and your financial backers?

10
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,120
What you're doing

11
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,360
could this be considered disrespect to seniors and workplace bullying?

12
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,760
Were you at the filming location?

13
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,560
Did you see it with your own eyes?

14
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,640
You're not a legitimate media outlet, are you?

15
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,880
You're drawing conclusions based on one-sided information.

16
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,940
Is this your professional standard?

17
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,920
Your question just now constitutes defamation.

18
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
I reserve the right

19
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,360
to take legal action.

20
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,020
Heaven sees everything we do.

21
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,220
What's wrong can never be made right.

22
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,340
The truth won't stay hidden forever.

23
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,760
Mind what you do.

24
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,040
I rushed back as soon as I saw the news.

26
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,370
Regarding this matter,

27
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,320
don't respond to it anymore.

28
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,480
Why?

29
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,930
He's clearly turning the tables on me.

30
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,560
Why would he turn the tables on you?

31
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,620
To shift the blame,

32
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,160
to ride on the publicity,

33
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,360
what else could it be?

34
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,960
Exactly.

35
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,400
Riding on publicity.

36
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,680
The more you respond,

37
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,810
the more attention he gets.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,920
So I'm supposed to do nothing?

39
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,080
Why should I?

40
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,840
Why should he use his seniority

41
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,480
to smear my reputation?

42
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,000
Why should I be slandered

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,330
and just have to take it?

44
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,920
Not all grievances can be voiced.

45
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,640
Not all truths

46
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,040
can be known to everyone.

47
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,079
Think about it.

48
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,520
If he gets what he wants,

49
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,650
what will he do next?

50
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,120
He'll stick to you like glue,

51
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,440
whenever he needs to,

52
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,840
he'll drag you out to humiliate you.

53
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,500
I don't want to tolerate this.

54
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,040
Not at all.

55
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,140
It's not about tolerance.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,400
To be precise,

57
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,680
it's about giving him the cold shoulder.

58
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,600
That's the wisest approach right now.

59
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,920
At a time like this,

60
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,480
who cares about being wise?

61
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,520
I don't care who he is.

62
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,600
Let's just confront him and be done with it.

63
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,860
You might feel better,

64
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,120
but who will clean up the mess?

65
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,960
Shen Yifan?

66
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,120
Do you really want him to deal with all this?

67
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,850
We don't necessarily need to clean up afterward.

68
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
How could we not?

69
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:56,960
Think about it.

70
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,440
What would be the consequences of a direct confrontation?

71
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,120
What would people say about you?

72
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,040
Aggressive,

73
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,840
unforgiving even when right,

74
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,300
disrespectful to elders.

75
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,690
Doesn't Cheng Dong have connections behind him?

76
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,320
In the end, both sides will lose.

77
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,960
Do you think Shen Yifan wouldn't step in to handle it?

78
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,640
Yes,

79
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,800
people in the industry would respect him.

80
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,440
But

81
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,450
if there's a need in the future,

82
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,770
wouldn't you have to repay this favor?

83
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,400
I understand.

84
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,210
Don't go online these days.

85
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,980
Focus on your filming.

86
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,640
After this blows over,

87
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,900
if you want to rest,

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,530
I'll ask the crew for leave.

89
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,159
If necessary, we can go back and stay home.

90
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:54,960
Stop.

91
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,920
I still need to focus on my filming.

92
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,760
Since we've decided on the cold treatment,

93
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,560
let's pretend it never happened

94
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,850
and go about our business as usual.

95
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,240
What's wrong, sweetie?

96
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,920
Mom,

97
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,680
I want to go find Dad.

98
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,250
It's so late now.

99
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,920
Let's not disturb

100
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,880
your father.

101
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,560
Sleep with Mommy,

102
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,440
okay?

103
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,240
But I already promised Dad.

104
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,040
Dad will be very busy today

105
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,040
and Mom misses you too.

106
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,159
Mom,

107
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,920
why don't you sleep with Dad tonight?

108
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,480
Mom is also very busy.

109
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,260
How about this.

110
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,600
You go to Dad tonight.

111
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,840
Remember to behave.

112
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,680
Don't cause any trouble.

113
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,560
Okay?

114
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,360
Okay.

115
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,080
Good girl.

116
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,720
Let's go.

117
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,850
I'll take you there.

118
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,720
No need.

119
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,200
Cuckoo, cuckoo.

120
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,640
What does that mean?

121
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,720
Cuckoo, cuckoo.

122
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,400
Slow down.

123
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,160
Sugar daddy. Mistress. Diva behavior.

124
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,280
Revealing photos. Plastic surgery.

125
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,360
It's always the same few words over and over.

126
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,820
Don't they get tired of it?

127
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,720
Ugly freak.

128
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,920
Get out of the entertainment industry.

129
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,080
How original.

130
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,410
Someone actually called me an ugly freak.

131
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,800
All fancy moves done by a stunt double.

132
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,520
Not worthy of playing Shanlan.

133
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,380
The power of money is terrifying.

134
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,840
Which eye of yours saw me using a stunt double?

135
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,370
Do you even prepare before spreading rumors?

136
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,880
Can this industry darling just get out of showbiz?

137
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,840
Where should I go?

138
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,280
To your house perhaps?

139
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,740
Get lost. You're the one who should get lost.

140
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,640
I have to endure when things are transparent.

141
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,520
I still have to endure when they're not.

142
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,560
Am I a Ninja Turtle or something?

143
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,720
It's nothing.

144
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,780
It's not like I haven't been scolded before.

145
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,400
It's no big deal.

146
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,400
If feeling wronged

147
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,100
is the necessary path to becoming stronger,

148
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,160
then let the grievances

149
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,800
come even more fiercely.

150
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,290
Once I get through this,

151
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,480
I'll still be standing strong.

152
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,080
Hello?

153
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,050
Why hasn't he made his move yet?

154
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,760
No, what does he mean?

155
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,650
Come here right now.

156
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,360
I'll call you back later.

157
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,640
Is this what you've been working on

158
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,570
for three weeks? Your company transformation plan?

159
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,640
Yes.

160
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,000
For a successful transformation,

161
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,680
the only way is to abandon the family business model,

162
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,760
remove those board members who occupy positions

163
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,600
but don't contribute anything,

164
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,000
integrate existing resources,

165
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,660
and increase investment in the Yiping Sunshine Film subsidiary.

166
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,640
Increase film investment?

167
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,840
Don't think I don't know what you're up to.

168
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,640
You're doing all this for a woman,

169
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,640
willing to ruin the entire company!

170
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,720
Yes.

171
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,770
I do like Zheng Ying.

172
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,080
But I would never be someone who damages the company's interests

173
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,540
to satisfy my own desires.

174
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,530
Director Cheng.

175
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,960
Don't you think

176
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,250
you're being a bit narrow-minded?

177
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,760
You're right.

178
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,530
After all, I'm not like you.

179
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,040
Shen Yifan.

180
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,720
Are you even a man?

181
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,600
Do you have any idea

182
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,920
how much your girlfriend is suffering right now?

183
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,040
And you're just standing here doing nothing.

184
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,040
Do you even care about her feelings?

185
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,300
You know very well.

186
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,000
She's my girlfriend.

187
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,040
So you don't want to handle this?

188
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,920
If you won't, I will.

189
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,600
Mr. Cheng.

190
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,880
This path was never meant to be smooth.

191
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,600
But also.

192
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,890
This is her own journey.

193
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,480
Just like mushrooms need to be watered

194
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,760
to grow.

195
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
She needs to rely on her own strength

196
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,900
and her own efforts

197
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,530
to resolve this situation.

198
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,960
Only then can she achieve her own transformation.

199
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,200
No.

200
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,560
Why?

201
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,080
Why should she rely on her own strength?

202
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,200
With your abilities, Shen Yifan,

203
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,040
is it that you can't protect her

204
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,300
or you don't want to keep protecting her?

205
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,690
But I won't be like that.

206
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,680
If her path is rough, I'll smooth it for her.

207
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,080
I'll smooth it completely, till the very end.

208
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,800
But in this world,

209
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,960
not everything can go as you wish.

210
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,960
Your life,

211
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,060
your promises,

212
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,020
are worthless in the face of time.

213
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,240
Your solemn vows right now

214
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,480
only prove the present.

215
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,140
The future is unpredictable.

216
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,800
Besides,

217
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,640
Zheng Ying isn't the type of person

218
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,000
who wants to be protected for her entire life.

219
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,060
Do you understand?

220
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,840
Hello?

221
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,840
Mr. Cheng,

222
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,810
your father is in emergency care at the hospital.

223
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,970
I'll be right there.

224
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,720
Mr. Shen,

225
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,140
I heard many shareholders of Cheng Group

226
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,320
have rushed to the hospital.

227
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,240
How many of them

228
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,500
are actually there to visit the patient?

229
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,900
Cheng Moyang's days ahead

230
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,200
are going to be tough.

231
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,680
Mr. Shen,

232
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,680
shouldn't we go to the hospital too?

233
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,090
Let's go to the film set.

234
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,200
Mr. Shen,

235
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,600
there's nothing left to do at the film set.

236
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,320
Why don't you go home and rest?

237
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,040
If she keeps putting up with this,

238
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,240
she wouldn't be Zheng Ying anymore.

239
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,080
But didn't you say

240
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,280
you wouldn't interfere in her affairs?

241
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,570
I can choose not to do anything.

242
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,360
But I must give her

243
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,890
the confidence to do whatever she needs to do.

244
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,880
I've got some juicy gossip,

245
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,880
want to hear it?

246
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,600
It's free.

247
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,610
I doubt there's any gossip juicier than mine.

248
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,240
Your story,

249
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,600
I haven't sold it out.

250
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,460
I actually wish you would sell it.

251
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,320
At least that way,

252
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,240
some people would know the truth.

253
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,200
You think I don't want to?

254
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,520
It's just that Brother Youyi said

255
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,600
the time isn't right yet.

256
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,460
We have to wait.

257
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,400
Otherwise,

258
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,440
it would be disadvantageous to you.

259
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,240
So,

260
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,120
I'm being considerate, right?

261
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,000
Yes. I knew you were loyal from what happened last time.

262
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,640
Come on,

263
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,100
help me rehearse my lines.

264
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,530
Let me try to grab it.

265
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,320
Like this.

266
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,360
Ni Hao has been clinging to you lately.

267
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
Must be causing you a lot of trouble.

268
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,200
Not at all.

269
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,840
He does call me dad after all.

270
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,900
I definitely will.

271
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,000
I just meant that

272
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,960
I really like Ni Hao.

273
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,840
So...

274
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,560
You go first.

275
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,800
A thank-you gift.

276
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,240
Thank you.

277
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,650
I'll go back to work now.

278
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,680
Mr. Shen.

279
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,720
Young master.

280
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,440
Zheng Ying still has two more scenes before she's done.

281
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,120
Why don't

282
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,320
you rest for a while?

283
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,200
When she comes back,

284
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,200
I'll let you know.

285
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,040
Don't run!

286
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,680
Stop right there!

287
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,600
Cut!

288
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,340
Let's do one more take.

289
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,160
Okay.

290
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,920
Cut!

291
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,140
Let's do another take.

292
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:46,760
Okay.

293
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,800
Cut!

294
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,000
I thought we could wrap up early.

295
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,800
Now look.

296
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,260
This is never going to end.

297
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,640
She's trying to build an image of being dedicated to her job.

298
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,500
So we have to play along, don't we?

299
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,880
This actress has such strong commitment.

300
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,240
After all that criticism,

301
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,840
she can still act like nothing happened.

302
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,560
Yeah.

303
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,200
By the way,

304
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,080
Mr. Cheng has a livestream tonight.

305
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,120
Don't forget to watch it.

306
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,080
Maybe

307
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,080
there will be some big revelations.

308
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,880
If I keep putting up with this,

309
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,240
I won't be Zheng Ying anymore.

310
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,560
Is she back?

311
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,680
I'll go get her.

312
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,280
No need.

313
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,200
Don't tell her I came by.

314
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,000
Alright.

315
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,840
Yes.

316
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,440
I'm wearing a hospital gown

317
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,700
still in the hospital.

318
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,460
I'm doing this livestream

319
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,720
to thank everyone for your concern.

320
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,000
The doctor says

321
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,400
I can be discharged soon.

322
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,440
Please don't worry about me.

323
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,260
Some people are asking

324
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,840
why I quit the show

325
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,840
and if there's any inside story.

326
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,520
Well, my health

327
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,040
isn't in good condition, right?

328
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,160
I can't delay

329
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,080
the production schedule,

330
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,640
can I?

331
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,440
So

332
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,840
I resigned from the role.

333
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,000
Mr. Cheng,

334
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,800
what's your take on internet celebrity actors?

335
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,290
Well, about that...

336
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,120
As long as they're professional

337
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,320
and have acting skills,

338
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,520
they're good actors.

339
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,450
As for the others...

340
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,240
I won't say more.

341
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,200
Those who know, know.

342
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
Stop.

343
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,730
Please stop sending gifts.

344
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,720
Look.

345
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:37,800
This...

346
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,280
This...

347
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,600
Where is the button

348
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,520
to turn off donations?

349
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,840
I really don't

350
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,370
understand how this works.

351
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,320
Thank you all,

352
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,240
please stop sending gifts.

353
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,700
I appreciate the gesture.

354
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,080
Mr. Cheng.

355
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,320
Could it be that

356
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,800
there's alcohol in your thermos?

357
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,440
Mr. Cheng.

358
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,240
Are you feeling better?

359
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,120
The doctor says

360
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,400
I'm just overworked

361
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,240
and need

362
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,760
some rest for a while.

363
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,440
So it's overwork.

364
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,000
I thought it was

365
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,160
that smell again.

366
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,000
The first time I met you in the dressing room,

367
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I smelled it.

368
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,760
And during filming too.

369
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,560
What is that smell exactly?

370
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,820
What smell could there be?

371
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,640
Don't make wild guesses.

372
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,400
I know now.

373
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,560
It's alcohol.

374
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,360
My goodness, Mr. Cheng.

375
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,880
You were drinking while filming too.

376
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,960
And you're still drinking while in hospital.

377
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,240
You really don't take care of yourself.

378
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,440
Don't talk nonsense.

379
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,400
Let me help you.

380
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,800
Isn't this just alcohol?

381
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,480
You.

382
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,680
You clearly have alcohol dependency.

383
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,280
You can't remember your lines

384
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,760
yet you blame me for it.

385
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,440
Not only that,

386
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,240
you're stepping on me to boost your own popularity.

387
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,080
Ms. Cheng,

388
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,920
you're quite the role model

389
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,680
as a senior in the industry.

390
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,480
I step on you

391
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,880
to gain popularity.

392
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,210
You can do the same to me.

393
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,520
No one cares

394
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,850
about the truth.

395
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,340
It's mutually beneficial, we each get what we need.

396
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,160
You attention-seekers

397
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,180
don't even understand

398
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,770
this basic concept?

399
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,760
I understand,

400
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,490
but I'm not interested.

401
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,520
Maybe my acting skills aren't good enough yet,

402
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,050
but that's only temporary.

403
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,480
I want to climb up

404
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,480
step by step through my own efforts.

405
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,720
My foundation

406
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,120
can only be my own ability,

407
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,380
not publicity stunts.

408
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,080
This matter

409
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,040
ends here.

410
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,480
I hope you,

411
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,280
Ms. Cheng, will take care of yourself.

412
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,010
Stop acting so high and mighty.

413
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,360
Aren't you just backed by capital?

414
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,480
Go back

415
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,400
and work on your acting skills.

416
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,800
You're not qualified

417
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,320
to criticize me yet.

418
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,380
I may not have your seniority,

419
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,360
but when it comes to being a decent person,

420
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,520
you fall far short.

421
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,920
Good morning, Youyi.

422
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,050
What makes you think I'm in a good mood?

423
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,850
I need to freshen up.

424
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,240
Why did you go to the hospital last night?

425
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,300
Why did you go looking for Chengdong?

426
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,320
Didn't we agree to let things cool down?

427
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,650
Why add fuel to the fire?

428
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,400
Do you have any idea

429
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,240
how many trending topics you're in right now?

430
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,000
Letting things cool down

431
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,240
won't reduce the number of trending topics about me.

432
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,640
The outcome is the same either way.

433
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,880
So why should I keep carrying all these false accusations?

434
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,960
Besides, he clearly has no

435
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,490
intention of backing down.

436
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,880
And I just happened to discover

437
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,610
that he's likely an alcoholic.

438
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,380
So I decided to test my theory.

439
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
Test your theory?

440
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,200
What if you're wrong?

441
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,920
Have you thought about how to handle the fallout?

442
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,280
Fine, let's take a step back.

443
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,640
Even if your judgment is correct,

444
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,560
how can you be sure that reporter who was secretly filming you

445
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,120
captured the entire process?

446
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:12,920
If they didn't capture everything,

447
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,320
do you know what the consequences would be?

448
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,680
Do you realize what rumors people will spread

449
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,840
about an actress going to a hospital

450
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,120
in the middle of the night?

451
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,720
Have you thought about that?

452
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,440
Do you still want a career in this industry?

453
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,160
They definitely got the footage.

454
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,400
Where's this confidence coming from?

455
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,200
Because

456
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,800
I hired the reporter myself.

457
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,970
What did you say?

458
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,720
Mr. Wan,

459
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,050
do you know any entertainment reporters?

460
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,120
I do.

461
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,280
But what do you need them for?

462
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,280
Buying melons?

463
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,340
Or selling melons?

464
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,600
Or growing them?

465
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,640
You're playing entrapment here.

466
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,600
No.

467
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,900
You're so impressive.

468
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,770
Does your Mr. Shen know about this?

469
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,800
He'll definitely be proud of me.

470
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,080
After all, Chengdong publicly apologized.

471
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,880
My reputation has been cleared.

472
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,090
You're something else.

473
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,160
No wonder

474
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,220
you're the woman Shen Yifan fell for.

475
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,380
I'll go take care of it.

476
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,480
Leave it to me.

477
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,000
Take these photos and get them processed.

478
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,760
Thank you for your hard work.

479
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,480
I'm sorry.

480
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,160
Zheng Ying is currently on set.

481
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,640
It's not convenient for an interview right now.

482
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,320
Alright.

483
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,920
We can consider doing a magazine cover.

484
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,100
Brother Youyi.

485
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,460
Zheng Ying is getting even more popular.

486
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,730
You're really amazing.

487
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,200
Be careful with business contacts.

488
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:58,560
Okay.

489
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,890
Continue with the magazine shoot.

490
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,400
Mr. Shen.

491
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,700
What are you doing?

492
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,960
If Zheng Ying calls later,

493
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,840
tell her

494
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,050
that I'm busy right now.

495
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,320
Hello.

496
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,040
This is Wu Yu.

497
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,440
Mr. Shen is very busy now.

498
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,440
He'll get back to you

499
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,440
later.

500
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,640
I see.

501
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,170
I'll wait for his call then.

502
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,600
Take good care of him.
