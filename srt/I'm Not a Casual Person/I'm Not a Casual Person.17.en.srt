1
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,940
Someone has definitely been in here.

2
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,840
Why don't you

3
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,960
go wash up first?

4
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,440
It's fine.

5
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,130
I'll wash up after I'm done.

6
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,920
I think you should wash up first.

7
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,690
Alright.

8
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,800
Forget it.

9
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,320
Better not tell her.

10
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,520
Why isn't he coming over?

11
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,920
Maybe she should change rooms tonight.

12
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:46,560
No.

13
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
She'll definitely get suspicious.

14
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,680
She's living here alone.

15
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,940
I'm worried about her.

16
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,329
Looks like I'll have to stay here tonight.

17
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,840
Why isn't he saying anything?

18
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,440
It's awkward when he's quiet at a time like this.

19
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,600
Hey.

20
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,320
The director said

21
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,920
it's time for you to go to bed.

22
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,400
Then I'll go to sleep now.

23
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,159
Um...

24
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,760
At 7 a.m.,

25
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,640
why were you coming out of this room?

26
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,970
What were you two doing?

27
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,500
None of your business.

28
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,480
I'm a very open-minded person.

29
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,000
I won't have any dirty thoughts.

30
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,360
Even though you two are boss and employee,

31
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,960
but you were coming out of her room.

32
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,360
Right?

33
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,840
Look, if you need something, you can tell me.

34
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,840
I can pass the message to her.

35
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,120
Or you could just call her, right?

36
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,250
Technology is so advanced these days.

37
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:12,840
Hey.

38
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,240
What did they do?

39
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,640
A single man and woman alone together

40
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,680
and it's Christmas Eve.

41
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,480
How is this possible?

42
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,360
Either there's no chemistry

43
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,240
or no charm.

44
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,760
Nonsense. How could that be?

45
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,360
Don't believe me? See for yourself.

46
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,220
This character profile you wrote

47
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,400
completely fails to show

48
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,120
Shanlan's appeal.

49
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,200
Come.

50
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,400
Let's analyze

51
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,720
how to find this character's charm.

52
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,800
She can

53
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,000
do things

54
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,210
that don't make logical sense.

55
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,160
But they must be consistent with her personality.

56
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,970
You can't just analyze her life story.

57
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,160
You need to fill in her character background yourself.

58
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,880
You even

59
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,600
need to create

60
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,520
events that are important to her.

61
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,240
He got away.

62
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,800
Xiaoying.

63
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,290
Why can't I see her anymore?

64
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,050
Who did this?

65
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,960
Why are they stopping me from seeing Xiaoying?

66
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,690
It must be her boss, Shen Yifan.

67
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,080
He's the one who made her film those exhausting fight scenes.

68
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,400
Always following her.

69
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
Controlling her.

70
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,920
Xiaoying.

71
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,960
Don't be afraid.

72
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,280
I...

73
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,440
I'm coming to save you right now.

74
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,480
Where could he be rushing off to?

75
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,680
Excuse me, who are you?

76
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,560
If you don't come with me,

77
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,420
I'll detonate the bomb in the car.

78
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Think carefully.

79
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,360
Hitting me with a stick

80
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,960
and causing moderate injury

81
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,840
will get you at least 3 to 5 years,

82
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,240
or up to 8 to 10 years. Is it worth it?

83
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,080
So...

84
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,490
what should I do?

85
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,440
There are too many people in the hotel. Keep him calm first

86
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,560
to prevent the explosion from hurting innocent people.

87
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,040
I've already held out my hands.

88
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,240
Don't tell me you didn't bring any rope?

89
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,180
Your cross knot is completely wrong.

90
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,520
Look.

91
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,240
Hold this, I'll teach you.

92
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,920
Wrap it around twice like this.

93
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,760
Then wrap it this way.

94
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,170
Now, thread it through the middle.

95
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,409
What's next?

96
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,100
Should I get in the car?

97
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,560
Why are you just standing there? Open the door.

98
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,720
If you don't blindfold me,

99
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,600
I'll be able to tell

100
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,080
that we're going to Shimo Mountain, right?

101
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,010
Shimo Mountain.

102
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,880
Untie me.

103
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,080
What if you run away?

104
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,000
We're on a mountain now.

105
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,330
We're on a mountain now.

106
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,280
There's no one for miles around.

107
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,200
Highway on the left, cliff on the right.

108
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,860
Where could I possibly run to?

109
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,320
Look.

110
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,840
Do you like it?

111
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,960
Not bad.

112
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,920
If we weren't in the southeast corner,

113
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,800
we wouldn't see such a beautiful view.

114
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,920
I remember you once said

115
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,360
that you love standing on mountains looking down.

116
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,490
You feel like the whole world is yours.

117
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,840
I just love the stars in the sky.

118
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,160
You shine like the stars in the sky.

119
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,160
You're so beautiful, so dazzling.

120
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,120
I know.

121
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,970
I'm not worthy of you right now,

122
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,480
but if you're willing to give me a chance,

123
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,360
wait for me.

124
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,640
I, Wang Lin, will definitely treat you well in the future.

125
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,000
You're waiting for Shen Yifan, aren't you?

126
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,760
I...

127
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,240
I'm just looking around.

128
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,480
Just looking around?

129
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,880
I like you so much.

130
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,040
I came all this way to see you,

131
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,570
and this is how you treat me?

132
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,640
You're with me

133
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,440
but thinking about another man.

134
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,000
Is this how you treat me?

135
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,040
Xiaoying.

136
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,730
Since you're so heartless,

137
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,580
don't blame me for what happens next.

138
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,480
If you don't show up soon,

139
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,200
this once-in-a-millennium chance to be my hero

140
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,400
will be gone.

141
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,480
Let go!

142
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,760
Let go!

143
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,320
Police! Freeze!

144
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,560
Stay put. Get down.

145
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,400
Are you hurt anywhere?

146
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:49,920
Let go!

147
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,920
Thank goodness you're okay.

148
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,320
Don't ever do this again.

149
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,040
Oh my god.

150
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,120
These obsessive fans are terrifying nowadays.

151
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,640
They even follow you home.

152
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,400
Look.

153
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,730
Would this work?

154
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,440
Contact immediately

155
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,880
the security company we've been working with.

156
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,160
Now. Right now.

157
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,530
Still thinking about Wang Lin?

158
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,380
I'm thinking about

159
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,240
what approach I should take

160
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,200
to guide my fans

161
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,480
to do what they should be doing.

162
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,760
Celebrities do have a strong halo effect.

163
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,490
They should set a good example.

164
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,880
Rather than me being cold,

165
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,800
I'm more worried about you catching a cold.

166
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,120
One day everyone will see that

167
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,720
I'm an actress who wants to be recognized

168
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,120
for my talent,

169
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,090
not just someone who knows how to create hype.

170
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,960
I have my own aspirations,

171
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,050
and I'm working hard toward my dreams.

172
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,440
I believe

173
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,450
my fans are the same way.

174
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,040
Everyone is unique.

175
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,540
You can't imitate others,

176
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,520
and others can't replicate you.

177
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,050
Everyone has their own path to follow.

178
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,800
But I still need to be careful,

179
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,280
so that some irrational fans

180
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,170
don't get jealous and hurt you.

181
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,840
It's fine.

182
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,210
Have you two been together for a long time?

183
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,520
Do you think I'm ridiculous?

184
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,240
Of course not.

185
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,440
We

186
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,640
never intended to hide it from you.

187
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,770
Enough, Shen Yifan.

188
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,620
Let me tell you now.

189
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:34,960
I don't care if she

190
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,360
is with you now.

191
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,040
I will absolutely not give up.

192
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,570
When it comes to Zheng Ying,

193
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,760
I will never give up.

194
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,360
Of course, if you mind...

195
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,090
I don't mind.

196
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,000
You liking her is your business.

197
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,940
Whatever you want to do

198
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,080
is up to you.

199
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,770
I don't mind because

200
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,210
you can't take her away from me,

201
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,720
and you can't beat me.

202
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,240
Like this. Add a spin.

203
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,200
Strike.

204
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,960
Not bad.

205
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,560
That action scene just now

206
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,680
was well executed.

207
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,840
Keep up the good work.

208
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,570
Yes, Master.

209
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,820
Director Zhou.

210
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,770
Let's go, Director.

211
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,800
Look at this.

212
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,240
This move of yours

213
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,960
actually still needs work.

214
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,920
Xiaoying, can I take a photo with you?

215
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,920
I'm so happy to be filming

216
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,080
with you this time.

217
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,160
Sure.

218
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,000
Thank you, Xiaoying.

219
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,040
Xiaoying, can you take a photo

220
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,840
with us, please?

221
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,320
Okay.

222
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,000
Thanks!

223
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,450
Come.

224
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm sorry,

225
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,280
Xiaoying needs to change her makeup soon.

226
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,410
We can take photos another time, okay?

227
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,370
Your timing is perfect.

228
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,080
You on one side, Wan Yuchen on the other.

229
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,560
You think I can be in two places at once?

230
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,840
Just the two of us?

231
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,840
You must have another side job.

232
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,920
Well...

233
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,680
No, where's your boyfriend?

234
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,410
Did he leave?

235
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,120
Why aren't you as enthusiastic as before?

236
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,880
We're keeping a low profile, understand?

237
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,520
Now you know about keeping a low profile.

238
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,240
We were just colleagues before.

239
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,680
Nothing to hide then.

240
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,480
Now you're dating,

241
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,920
you should be even less concerned about appearances.

242
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,120
Unless...

243
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,680
you two are doing something inappropriate

244
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,080
in broad daylight.

245
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,000
If you ask me, you don't need to worry.

246
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,120
Shen Yifan is totally the reserved type.

247
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,880
That kind of man can't even be seduced.

248
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,240
Let me tell you...

249
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,560
Hey, darling.

250
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,800
Did you hear all that?

251
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,280
Yes, that's Yu Youyi.

252
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,410
Years of friendship can't compare to one man.

253
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,050
How was your first day of shooting?

254
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,000
It went well.

255
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,400
It's just that

256
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,450
I'm not quite used to it.

257
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,170
What aren't you used to?

258
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,800
The food.

259
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,600
The boxed meals aren't good.

260
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,520
Then

261
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,720
take a look in the fridge.

262
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,359
How did you know I wanted these?

263
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,480
Look under the table too.

264
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,099
When you're tired, you can soak your feet and relax.

265
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,060
You can also make your own snacks if you want.

266
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,480
You've prepared quite thoroughly.

267
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,220
But it's still not enough.

268
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,240
I miss my boyfriend.

269
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,440
Can you have one delivered to me?

270
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,760
Of course.

271
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,920
There might be some shipping delays though.

272
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,680
Can you wait?

273
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,290
Of course I can wait.

274
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,800
By the way.

275
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,680
I've prepared a gift for you too.

276
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,560
A gift?

277
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,360
10 o'clock.

278
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,360
Dried fruit to boost your vitamin C.

279
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,800
Energy for the whole day.

280
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,120
1 PM.

281
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,440
Afternoon tea snack.

282
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,320
Mix with warm water to aid digestion.

283
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,840
Makes you feel great.

284
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,640
4 PM.

285
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,200
Snacks to fully recharge you.

286
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,280
8 PM.

287
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,440
Calming tea powder. Sleep soundly till morning.

288
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,200
Cut!

289
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,170
Not bad. Let's prepare for the next scene.

290
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,960
Angelica egg and brown sugar drink.

291
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,480
Don't look at me. I didn't prepare it.

292
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,940
Your husband prepared it.

293
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,400
He's here?

294
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,320
He arranged it remotely.

295
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,360
As if you deserve it.

296
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,560
Keep standing there.

297
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,440
Cut!

298
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,000
Okay.

299
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,680
What scene are you acting out?

300
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,200
It's your husband.

301
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,320
He knows you have a water-splashing scene today.

302
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,520
He specifically asked me to check on you.

303
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,240
He's here.

304
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,620
Come on.

305
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,600
Smile! I need to take a photo to check in.

306
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,820
I'll send it to him too.

307
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,730
What do you need a knife for?

308
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,740
I want to try my skills.

309
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,080
Here's an extraordinary...

310
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:49,960
Knife.

311
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,770
I didn't know you had such amazing skills.

312
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,920
Well.

313
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,360
The way you're flailing around

314
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,800
makes it hard to focus.

315
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,130
I can't help it. I attract mosquitoes.

316
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,680
Thank you.

317
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,890
Our guest star, award-winning actress Ms. Ni Shang.

318
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,280
Shen Yifan sent it.

319
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,500
Looks like it's meant for you.

320
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,680
He sent it?

321
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,400
Are you okay, Ms. Zheng?

322
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,240
I'm fine.

323
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,530
Director, let's continue.

324
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,220
Come on.

325
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,960
Alright, ready.

326
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,360
Action.

327
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,840
Forget it.

328
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,240
Better not make him worry.

329
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,040
Shen.

330
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,650
Why are you here?

331
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
Give me your hand.

332
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,400
No need, I can do it myself.

333
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,930
Just listen to me this once.

334
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,580
In your heart, he might seem perfect.

335
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,360
But in my opinion,

336
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,400
he's not a qualified boyfriend.

337
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,240
He's not what you think.

338
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:51,970
Listen to me.

339
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,220
The old man wants me to go back.

340
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,130
It's urgent.

341
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,680
I might not be able

342
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,040
to watch over you at the set every day.

343
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,100
But remember this.

344
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,480
Fame brings trouble.

345
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,320
I worry about you,

346
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,050
so I asked him to accompany you.

347
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,410
Let me emphasize again.

348
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,000
This doesn't mean I'm giving up.

349
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,120
Where is everyone?

350
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,970
Which outfit should I wear for the next scene?

351
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,520
Is it this one?

352
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,600
Why are you here?

353
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,160
You said

354
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,360
you wanted a boyfriend delivered here.

355
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,200
Is your hand still hurting?

356
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,640
Not anymore.

357
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,040
Who put this plaster on?

358
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,380
I'll put a new one on for you later.

359
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,320
What are you smiling at?

360
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,680
You're jealous.

361
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,880
Come here.

362
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,760
Sir.

363
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,000
At a time like this,

364
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,040
shouldn't you show some restraint?

365
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,160
I'm jealous

366
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,760
and can't help it.

367
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,570
I asked Wu Yu to send everyone away.

368
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,000
They should all be having coffee by now.

369
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,880
Why is your style different today?

370
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,250
You've turned into a sighing Zheng Daiyu.

371
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,160
It feels like forever since I last saw him.

372
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,960
I miss him so much.

373
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,440
You just saw each other 10 minutes ago.

374
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,320
We're filming right now.

375
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,650
I'm the male lead standing in front of you.

376
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,680
If only the male lead in this film with me

377
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,040
could be him instead.

378
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,080
You can use your imagination.

379
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,160
Just pretend I'm him.

380
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,600
This human prop doesn't mind at all.

381
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,240
That's actually a good idea.

382
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,560
General,

383
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,640
you've done great service in repelling the enemy this time.

384
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,560
The Emperor hinted that you should become a royal son-in-law.

385
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,920
Why did you refuse?

386
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,480
A man's ambition lies in the four corners of the world.

387
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,880
Why bother with romance?

388
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,800
Life is long.

389
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,250
Should the rest of my bright future

390
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,000
be tied to a woman's hand?

391
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,840
Who?

392
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,330
I fell in love with you at first sight when I was 16.

393
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,080
You promised me I would be a general's wife.

394
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,010
Now you're going back on your word.

395
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,240
Who?

396
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,080
Thanks.

397
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,040
Did I say you could leave?

398
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,240
You really don't know how to treat a lady.

399
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,840
Who was just claiming

400
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,160
to be a general's wife?

401
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,240
You...

402
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,800
Never mind. I have urgent matters to attend to.

403
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,610
Thank you, General.

404
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,370
Until we meet again.

405
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,090
General, as you predicted,

406
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,000
the wanted woman in red is nearby.

407
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,800
Also, the young master has arrived

408
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,730
and met secretly with Lord Niu and Lord Ma last night.

409
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,680
We received intelligence

410
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,080
that the assassin who tried to kill Lord Ma is wounded

411
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,680
and hiding in this teahouse.

412
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,890
Search thoroughly.

413
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,560
We'll find her for sure.

414
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,360
Search!

415
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,410
We can't just wait to be caught.

416
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,330
Let's go.

417
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,640
The lord says this person is the Red Robe Bandit.

418
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,320
Arrest her!

419
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,840
My people.

420
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,810
