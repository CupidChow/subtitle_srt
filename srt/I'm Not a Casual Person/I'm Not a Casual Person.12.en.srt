1
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,450
I will have to leave eventually

2
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,079
and it might be soon.

3
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,120
I have one and only one goal:

4
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,320
to make you famous.

5
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,040
This opportunity is very important for you.

6
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,970
I hope you can stay focused enough.

7
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,960
Now go get some rest.

8
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,840
Aren't you afraid

9
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,920
that all your efforts will be in vain?

10
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,200
Not trying would be an even bigger waste.

11
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,680
So,

12
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,010
hard work doesn't guarantee success,

13
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,440
but without effort,

14
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,360
there's definitely no hope.

15
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,130
It's not that you don't like me.

16
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,340
You're afraid to like me, aren't you?

17
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,760
Why?

18
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,560
Didn't you see my messages?

19
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,600
Didn't you hear my calls?

20
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,600
Why didn't you show up?

21
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:53,560
Hello?

22
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,320
Hello?

23
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,720
Shen Yifan.

24
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,320
Do you like me or not?

25
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,400
This feels so real.

26
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,480
So it's not a dream.

27
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,440
You're drunk.

28
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,080
Get some rest.

29
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,720
Trying to run away?

30
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,320
Not a chance.

31
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,560
Listen to me.

32
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,680
I have something to tell you.

33
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,640
What do you want to say?

34
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,960
I like you.

35
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,240
Didn't I tell you-

36
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,400
I said I like you.

37
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,240
Zheng Ying.

38
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,400
I said I like you.

39
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,200
You're drunk.

40
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,720
Get some rest.

41
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
You're right.

42
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,760
I'm afraid to like you.

43
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,160
You're so brave.

44
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,560
I want to be brave too.

45
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,640
Just this once.

46
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,960
But someone who's far from hope

47
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,560
and close to death

48
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,600
has no right to get close to

49
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,800
someone who loves life as much as you do.

50
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,040
It's the doctor.

51
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,680
I know.

52
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,280
Time to increase my medication.

53
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,210
Get me some wine.

54
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,570
Bring me a drink.

55
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,080
Mr. Cheng,

56
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,200
why are you drinking alone here?

57
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,530
What are you doing here?

58
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,400
Mr. Cheng,

59
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,600
I heard that you've purchased the rights

60
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,760
to 'Drunken Jade Mountain.'

61
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,159
Why didn't you inform me?

62
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,730
Why should I inform you?

63
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:54,760
Mr. Cheng,

64
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,159
don't you think

65
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,090
I'd be perfect for the female lead?

66
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,370
I don't think so.

67
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,530
Besides, we've already cast the female lead.

68
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,360
Who is it?

69
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,040
Zheng Ying.

70
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,080
No way!

71
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,120
Why?

72
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,880
Didn't you promise me the role?

73
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,200
Who promised you that?

74
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,440
I never considered you

75
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,880
for this project at all.

76
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,160
Zheng Ying, you just wait and see.

77
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,080
I couldn't have taken advantage of him while drunk, could I?

78
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,540
Don't panic, don't panic.

79
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,640
This is his home. It's normal to find his clothes here.

80
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
No way.

81
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,120
Could something really have happened between us?

82
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,960
Whether you've woken up or sobered up,

83
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,890
come out and eat.

84
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,320
I'm awake now,

85
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,080
wearing his clothes,

86
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,960
eating the food he prepared.

87
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,160
This scene...

88
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,640
why does it feel like we're married?

89
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,600
Why be shy at this point?

90
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,320
Seriously.

91
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,000
Don't worry.

92
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,410
I'll take responsibility for you.

93
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,900
This is hangover soup.

94
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,120
Drink it quickly.

95
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,080
What do you mean?

96
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,560
Last night we clearly...

97
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,850
Do you even know what happened last night?

98
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,040
You took off your clothes

99
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,440
and now you're pretending to have amnesia?

100
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,120
So

101
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,560
you took off your own clothes.

102
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,680
Then what about my clothes?

103
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,810
I couldn't have taken them off myself.

104
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,760
Call housekeeping.

105
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,200
I...

106
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,140
I thought something would actually happen between us.

107
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,460
Listen carefully.

108
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,120
Nothing will ever happen

109
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,600
between us.

110
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,610
So stop your wild imagination.

111
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,160
Stop right there.

112
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,920
Are you leaving because I'm angry?

113
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,800
What?

114
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,320
Ma'am.

115
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,060
Here you go.

116
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,760
Take your clothes.

117
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,220
I can't stay passive anymore.

118
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,240
I need to find a way to make her give up sooner.

119
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,280
Give up?

120
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,680
No way.

121
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,920
Youyi.

122
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,880
Any news?

123
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,080
No.

124
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,540
Xiao Wan probably won't come.

125
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,640
Although this film festival opening ceremony isn't large in scale,

126
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,040
it's quite prestigious.

127
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,680
They've invited award-winning actors,

128
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,210
directors, and producers.

129
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,400
You don't really

130
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,580
fit in with this festival.

131
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,400
What do you mean I don't fit in?

132
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,240
Did those actors win awards as soon as they entered the industry?

133
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,600
Didn't they all start from the bottom

134
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,460
and work their way up just like me?

135
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,840
They didn't specifically say

136
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,580
that those without awards can't attend, right?

137
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,400
Youyi.

138
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,080
As long as I haven't been explicitly rejected,

139
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,140
it means I still have a chance, right?

140
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,480
Miss Ni.

141
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,840
Are you getting rid of all these things?

142
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,170
Throw them away.

143
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,360
Yes.

144
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,880
Hello, Mr. Shen.

145
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,480
There's a film festival opening ceremony.

146
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,280
I think it's a good opportunity.

147
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,290
I want to attend.

148
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,480
This way, I can meet more people

149
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,980
and get more exposure.

150
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,130
As long as it doesn't affect your work,

151
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,290
how you manage your time is your business.

152
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,840
Don't worry, it definitely won't.

153
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,200
But the thing is,

154
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,880
I don't have a formal dress.

155
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,520
I got it.

156
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,000
When trying on the dress,

157
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,130
you need makeup to see the full effect.

158
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,520
So...

159
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,280
Why is it you?

160
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,560
Mr. Shen said he's too busy to pick you up,

161
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,290
so he asked me to take you there.

162
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,480
This one is too small.

163
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,320
This one is too big.

164
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,080
This one doesn't fit.

165
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,760
This one,

166
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,680
this one,

167
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,000
and this one too.

168
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,040
Let her try them on.

169
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,400
Okay.

170
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,330
I'm leaving now.

171
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,300
Young Mr. Shen,

172
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,040
you're deliberately avoiding her, aren't you?

173
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,440
On behalf of Mr. Shen senior and myself, I'm quite pleased.

174
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,800
Aren't you reminding me every day

175
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,330
that she'll leave someday?

176
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,400
So I'm not seeing her. Is that okay with you?

177
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,080
Ying.

178
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,530
Come on. It's over here.

179
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,490
What a coincidence.

180
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,400
Mr. Shen, who said he'd be busy all day,

181
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,000
how come you're here?

182
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,480
All because a certain artist wanted to try on dresses.

183
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,360
Miss Zheng, please try this one first.

184
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,480
Mr. Shen,

185
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,060
can you stay and watch me try it on?

186
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,130
Otherwise I won't feel confident.

187
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:46,880
Sure.

188
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,840
Trying to avoid me, huh?

189
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,120
I'll make sure you have nowhere to hide.

190
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,760
Big drama alert.

191
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,760
Mr. Shen,

192
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,640
I can't reach the zipper on my back.

193
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,760
Could you help me?

194
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,410
Miss Zheng, let me help you.

195
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,359
I can't open it.

196
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,890
Mr. Shen, could you help me?

197
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:24,880
I'll do it.

198
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,720
It's just the two of us here.

199
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,360
You can't keep avoiding me, can you?

200
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:38,960
Mr. Shen,

201
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,720
I just had some water

202
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,460
and need to touch up my makeup.

203
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,320
So...

204
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,220
Go ahead and fix it.

205
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,930
I'll hold it for you.

206
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,760
No need.

207
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,320
I have hands of my own.

208
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,240
Playing is a child's nature.

209
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,600
If he doesn't like toys,

210
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,800
why not take him to do what he wants to do?

211
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,600
Today I'm going to play and have fun with him.

212
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,560
Hello there.

213
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,520
Have you finished your piano lesson?

214
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,880
You still have Lego and programming classes later,

215
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,920
and fencing and golf lessons in the evening.

216
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,040
We need to hurry up!

217
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,600
I, Zheng Ying, am not someone who gives up easily.

218
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,120
My life motto is:

219
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,240
As long as I don't lose hope,

220
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,840
there's still hope for the future.

221
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,300
Someone like Shen Yifan can't bring me down.

222
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,600
There must be a way.

223
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,460
Don't you think so, Youyi?

224
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,480
Energy fully recharged.

225
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,020
I'm about to turn into a tiger.

226
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,160
You're quite fierce indeed.

227
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,610
What are you going to do?

228
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,600
Hunt.

229
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,320
Mr. Shen,

230
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,720
I know Miss Zheng Ying

231
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,520
has never been on a variety show before.

232
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,960
But don't worry, Mr. Shen.

233
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,240
Our show is very relaxed

234
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,080
and very friendly to performers.

235
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,080
And as you know, this show

236
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,960
has already run for three seasons

237
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,400
with ratings above 8.5 for each season.

238
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,400
If you've already done three seasons

239
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,060
and they were all successful,

240
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,920
why change everything for season 4?

241
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,080
Precisely because we've done three seasons,

242
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,040
it's getting stale.

243
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,840
So

244
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,560
I want to try a new approach

245
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,600
and bring in

246
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,560
interesting guests with unique personalities.

247
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,220
I think Zheng Ying is quite distinctive.

248
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,440
Speak of the devil.

249
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,920
I'm working.

250
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,320
Work, huh?

251
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,080
I understand.

252
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,400
From now on, anything about his work,

253
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,600
you can tell me.

254
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,800
I've got his back.

255
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,760
Zheng Ying is indeed special.

256
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,340
Well, Mr. Shen,

257
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,040
please consider our cooperation.

258
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,200
I'll drink for him.

259
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,040
Come in.

260
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,600
Wu Yu.

261
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,080
I'm here.

262
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:27,880
Wu Yu.

263
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,140
Let me handle this.

264
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,160
That's it.

265
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I understand what you're thinking.

266
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,700
But you underestimated my persistence.

267
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,300
And you underestimated my feelings for you.

268
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,060
What do you want from me

269
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,480
to give up?

270
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,000
In my lifetime, the chance

271
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
to meet someone I truly like

272
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,600
probably comes just once.

273
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,040
I won't give up.

274
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,000
Are you touched by that?

275
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,360
I dare not move.

276
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,130
You said you had no feelings for me.

277
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,160
Are you playing hard to get with me?

278
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,560
Zheng Ying.

279
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,760
My patience has its limits.

280
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,240
What are you so afraid of?

281
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,280
Do you know?

282
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,760
Some opportunities, once missed,

283
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,820
can never be recovered, even with a lifetime of regret.

284
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,280
Shen Yifan.

285
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,690
I will make you understand this truth.

286
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,160
Mr. Shen.

287
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,320
Are you alright?

288
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:09,890
I'm fine.

289
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,040
So she should give up now, right?

290
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,600
Handsome boy.

291
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,600
Why are you alone? Where's your nanny?

292
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,320
I'm hungry.

293
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,400
Well, I wonder if you'd like

294
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,060
to get a hamburger, handsome?

295
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,200
But we need to let your nanny know first,

296
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:44,760
okay?

297
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,640
Okay.

298
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,610
Let's go.

299
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,760
It fell down.

300
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,000
Great!

301
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,360
Come on.

302
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,080
Can you be my daddy?

303
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,840
I have a daddy now!

304
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,480
I'm nervous now,

305
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,810
but not because of this.

306
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,520
So pathetic.

307
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,620
Isn't this just like filming?

308
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,720
Just with a few more cameras.

309
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,640
Let's welcome

310
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,170
Ni Shang and Zheng Ying to the interview area.

311
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,560
Miss Ni Shang,

312
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,520
may I ask if you're planning to continue your career back in China?

313
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,320
Actually, as an actress,

314
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,840
it doesn't matter where I work.

315
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,240
Next walking on the red carpet

316
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,960
is our mysterious guest of the year,

317
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,320
Mr. Shen Yifan.

318
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,800
Miss Ni Shang,

319
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,680
do you have any stories from filming 'Tale of Two Beauties'

320
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,280
that you could share with us?

321
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,440
This film 'The Duel of Two Beauties'.

322
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,960
Why is he here? Did he come to see me?

323
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,840
Her character

324
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,360
is very impressive in the film

325
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,440
and fully developed.

326
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,080
Zheng Ying,

327
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,240
do you have anything you'd like to share with everyone?

328
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,160
Miss Zheng Ying, may I ask what role

329
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,360
you play in this film?

330
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,840
I play an assassin in this film.

331
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,360
The cold-blooded, ruthless kind who's focused only on killing.

332
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,200
How do you understand this character?

333
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,000
Is she very different from who you are in real life?

334
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,280
I play an assassin in the film,

335
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,120
but that doesn't mean I have

336
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,400
the same personality in real life.

337
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,080
I still remember Miss Zheng Ying's

338
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,000
story about being brave in love and hate.

339
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Miss Zheng, do you currently have a new relationship?

340
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:26,960
I'm sorry.

341
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,440
Please try to ask questions

342
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,640
related to the work.

343
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,480
Thank you.

344
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,320
I have someone I like.

345
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,880
Miss Zheng is indeed someone who loves and hates boldly.

346
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,840
What about him?

347
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,240
Does he know how you feel?

348
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,120
He should be very clear about it.

349
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,520
I'm just not sure

350
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,600
what kind of feelings he has for me.

351
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,440
I'm also looking forward to

352
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,560
him giving me a clear answer.

353
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,160
Mr. Shen,

354
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,920
how do you feel right now?

355
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,440
What I mean is,

356
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,760
when capital generally doesn't favor

357
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,840
the film and TV industry,

358
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,520
you suddenly returned to China to enter the industry.

359
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,640
During this time,

360
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,040
what are your thoughts about the industry?

361
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,850
To be honest,

362
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,720
I don't have any particular feelings.

363
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,780
I am a businessman.

364
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,340
Finding good projects

365
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,960
and good actors to work with

366
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,280
is my job.

367
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,920
Anything beyond that,

368
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,530
I couldn't care less about.

369
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,240
Mr. Shen is indeed very rational.

370
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,120
In that case,

371
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,360
Mr. Shen seems more like

372
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,760
a cold-blooded killer.

373
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,120
Indeed.

374
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,320
I'm sorry,

375
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,120
excuse me.

376
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,040
When luck turns against you,

377
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,920
everything goes wrong.
