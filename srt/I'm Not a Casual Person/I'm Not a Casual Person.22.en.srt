1
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,300
So according to Mrs. Shen's plan,

2
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,840
what should we do next?

3
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,009
What's this?

4
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,200
Since we're short on time,

5
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,660
we need to speed things up.

6
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,440
You'll just have to make do for now.

7
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,680
Quick, call me Dad.

8
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,640
Dad.

9
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,520
Good boy.

10
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,900
Where are we going?

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,720
It's our son's parent-teacher conference today.

12
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,920
You didn't even know?

13
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,280
This is a middle school conference?

14
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,800
We can't waste time.

15
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,130
Hurry up.

16
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,380
Our son is waiting.

17
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,970
With so many children here,

18
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,490
which one is our son?

19
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,160
Usually his mother comes. I never had the time.

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,360
Yes.

21
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,400
That's him.

22
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,400
How could you not recognize your own son?

23
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,200
Go now.

24
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,180
It's been over 10 minutes.

25
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,340
Why aren't you coming out yet?

26
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,160
Why are you so slow?

27
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,960
I was just talking with that teacher

28
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,090
about a math problem for quite a while.

29
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,240
What's wrong?

30
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,900
My belly...

31
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:13,960
Hurry!

32
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,440
Honey,

33
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,600
I'm going into labor with our second child!

34
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,400
Second child?

35
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,360
Let's go!

36
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,000
Let's go!

37
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,010
Have some fruit.

38
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,079
At 40,

39
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,720
we're a happy family of four.

40
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,880
You're both 45 now.

41
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,380
Are you still this sweet with each other?

42
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,580
Let's have a third child tonight.

43
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,920
At 55, our son has graduated.

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,400
Good.

45
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,120
At 60,

46
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,500
all our children are married.

47
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,040
At 70,

48
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,880
our grandson...

49
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,280
what was his name again?

50
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,320
Have you been waiting long?

51
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,400
Time flies so fast.

52
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,240
It feels like only a day has passed.

53
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,920
Yet it also feels like a lifetime.

54
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,880
Get into character.

55
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,000
We're eighty years old now.

56
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
If I could really see you at eighty,

57
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,280
that would be wonderful.

58
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,560
I'm old now.

59
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,200
Am I ugly?

60
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,300
Your skin is wrinkled.

61
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,090
Your eyes have lost their sparkle.

62
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,720
Your lips are sunken.

63
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,640
And when you walk,

64
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,100
you're slower now.

65
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,280
What?

66
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,060
Are you disgusted with me?

67
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,800
I love you.

68
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,180
Is this the life you imagined?

69
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,800
What's wrong?

70
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,280
Is it different from what you imagined?

71
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,420
According to my imagination,

72
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,200
in the future,

73
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,400
you'll become an incredible actress.

74
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,320
From home to abroad,

75
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,250
winning countless awards.

76
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,300
You'll spend your brilliant life

77
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,090
in the career you love most.

78
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,820
That's not a conflict.

79
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,050
I can become an incredible actress

80
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,360
and still spend my life with you.

81
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,360
Today,

82
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,450
do you have any regrets?

83
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,560
We're in such a rush today.

84
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,080
There's so much I still want to do.

85
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,560
Look,

86
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,200
we haven't given our child

87
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,480
a beautiful name yet.

88
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,480
We haven't taken a trip together either.

89
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,280
That's right.

90
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,440
We never made it to that revolving restaurant we talked about.

91
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,320
And we

92
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,120
still need to visit your hometown,

93
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,450
to see where you grew up.

94
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,360
You haven't met my grandmother yet, have you?

95
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,080
My grandmother gives very generous New Year money.

96
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,560
And my hometown

97
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,200
is so lively during New Year's.

98
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,080
When we go,

99
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,680
the whole family will surround you

100
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,200
and take turns complimenting you.

101
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,460
We should also go to...

102
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,780
Shen Yifan?

103
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,880
Shen Yifan!

104
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,560
You scared me to death!

105
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,290
We're both over eighty now.

106
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,180
For people our age,

107
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,360
passing away mid-conversation

108
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
is actually quite likely to happen.

109
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,410
Don't you dare leave me behind.

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,640
Alright.

111
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,200
Actually,

112
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,880
in this life,

113
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,560
being with you

114
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,360
has already been worth everything.

115
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,120
Me too.

116
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,620
I should go now.

117
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,240
Do you want me to accompany you to Switzerland?

118
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,540
Do you remember

119
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,410
when you said

120
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,640
that we

121
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,500
are more like comrades-in-arms?

122
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,640
Your career,

123
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,240
your dreams,

124
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,559
are what we've been working toward together.

125
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,799
I don't want you

126
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,799
to give up

127
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,880
those important plans in your life because of me.

128
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,559
Promise me

129
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,700
you'll keep going.

130
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,610
You also need to do it for yourself.

131
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,800
Don't give up.

132
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,490
Don't worry.

133
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,560
Are we just leaving like this?

134
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,360
Aren't you going to see them off?

135
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,880
What's the point?

136
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,500
It's not like he's never coming back.

137
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,880
Mr. Shen,

138
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,360
we'll definitely be back.

139
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,080
How many times have I told you?

140
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,560
Why won't you change?

141
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,560
Get away from me.

142
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,680
Don't interfere in my business.

143
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,320
Are you going to listen to me or not?

144
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,640
I won't listen to you.

145
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,770
Are you still the mother of this child?

146
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,930
Give it to me!

147
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,560
Let go!

148
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,160
Give it to me!

149
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,320
Let go!

150
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,400
Mom, don't leave!

151
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,440
Moyang.

152
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,040
You.

153
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,200
If you want to leave, go ahead.

154
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,400
But my son stays here.

155
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,760
You.

156
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,440
Mom, Mom, don't go!

157
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,680
Mom.

158
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,040
Be good.

159
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,050
This is excellent wine.

160
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,090
Are you really sure about this?

161
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,460
Once you leave,

162
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,240
there's no turning back.

163
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,360
Turning back?

164
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,480
I never thought about turning back.

165
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,880
So what if I'm expelled from the Three Halls?

166
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,080
Fighting for justice

167
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,480
is what I, Shanlan, was born to do.

168
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,960
I believe the day we reunite with our junior sister

169
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,000
will come soon.

170
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,210
Alright, that's a wrap.

171
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,450
Come on, let's prepare for the next scene.

172
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,980
Old classmate.

173
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,930
Your artist is really impressive.

174
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,240
Just went through that trending topic controversy.

175
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,640
Yet her acting condition is so well-adjusted.

176
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,040
Completely unaffected.

177
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,000
Well, you should consider

178
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,200
which manager is handling this artist.

179
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,000
Enough.

180
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,240
If your artist is doing this well,

181
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
how are you doing?

182
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,720
What's wrong with me?

183
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,580
I'm doing fine.

184
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,600
Looking at all this equipment,

185
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,330
doesn't it make you feel itchy?

186
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,240
Come on.

187
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,480
I have things to do.

188
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,210
I'm leaving.

189
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,080
What you need to face

190
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,080
you'll have to face sooner or later.

191
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,260
Let me tell you,

192
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,400
you must follow my lead tonight.

193
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,000
You shoot whatever I tell you to shoot, got it?

194
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,840
Come on,

195
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,400
the cinematographer said

196
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,760
we'll just casually shoot some footage today,

197
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,360
just establishing shots of the night scene.

198
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,090
Just shoot whatever, you know?

199
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,600
No,

200
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,760
how can we be casual about photography?

201
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,760
Just listen to me,

202
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,760
let's go over there.

203
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,360
Fine.

204
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,200
Dad, I'm here!

205
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,120
Dad, teach me how to take photos!

206
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,410
I don't touch machines.

207
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,880
Dad, aren't you touching it right now?

208
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,360
Teach me how to take photos!

209
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,010
Alright.

210
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,000
Let's go.

211
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,780
Come on.

212
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,000
Haven't I told you many times?

213
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,600
I don't want to see you again.

214
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,840
Don't think that by doing this,

215
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,900
I will forgive you.

216
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,480
Ma'am,

217
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,240
I'll be going now.

218
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,120
Don't forget

219
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,980
there are 20 more boxes tomorrow.

220
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,320
How is it?

221
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,760
This is way too shabby.

222
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,360
What,

223
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,680
are you suggesting that we're stuck

224
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,010
in this tiny editing room forever?

225
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,520
068,

226
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,010
prosperity all the way.

227
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,520
Baby.

228
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,610
Do you remember everything Mom just told you?

229
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,120
Yes, I do.

230
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,360
Good girl.

231
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:50,880
Mom,

232
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,760
why did you ask me to learn photography from Dad

233
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,560
and now you're here again?

234
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,120
What's really going on?

235
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,890
To save someone.

236
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,160
Are you willing to help?

237
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,120
Yes,

238
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,120
I want to save Dad.

239
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,460
That's my girl.

240
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,210
Let's go.

241
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,330
It's so late.

242
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,690
Why are you all here?

243
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,280
We're here to rescue someone.

244
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,050
I don't have anyone.

245
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,250
Do you want to go in and check together?

246
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,970
Ni Hao is asleep.

247
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,810
She won't wake up anytime soon.

248
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,520
Thank you for today.

249
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,480
It's nothing.

250
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,880
What's your plan now?

251
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,600
To reclaim the career

252
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
that I've lost.

253
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,130
That's good.

254
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,160
And to win back

255
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,620
the person I let slip away.

256
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,560
Ni Shang.

257
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,640
Let's start over.

258
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,440
Mom, where are you?

259
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,120
Ni.

260
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,760
Ni Hao is awake.

261
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,880
I'll go check on her.

262
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,880
You don't need to answer me right away.

263
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,410
I'm ready whenever you are.

264
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,840
Okay.

265
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,020
Just got off the plane?

266
00:18:59,200 --> 00:18:59,840
Yeah.

267
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,460
What about you?

268
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,420
I just got back.

269
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,120
Good morning, my boyfriend.

270
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,840
No, wait.

271
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,640
To the outside world,

272
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,170
we're not a couple anymore.

273
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,280
So what should I call you?

274
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,960
Ex-boyfriend?

275
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,560
A few days ago you were still Mrs. Shen.

276
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,600
Just a few days apart,

277
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,360
and suddenly you're my ex-wife.

278
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,160
Impressive.

279
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,800
What's on your schedule today?

280
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,360
How did his artificial heart surgery go?

281
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,400
Well,

282
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,680
the artificial heart

283
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,080
is a pump device assisting his left ventricle,

284
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,520
helping the heart pump blood

285
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,040
to extend his time.

286
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,960
Next is waiting for a matching heart donor

287
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,040
for a heart transplant.

288
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,880
I saw a term today

289
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,410
called Pareto optimality.

290
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,880
I certainly know what it means.

291
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,960
Ms. Zheng Ying,

292
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,420
it's your turn to perform.

293
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,940
Coming right away.

294
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,400
Just like us.

295
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,640
After we got together,

296
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,760
neither of us was hurt

297
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,600
and we both became better people.

298
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,960
That's the result of Pareto improvement.

299
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,600
Right?

300
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,120
Among all the roles you've played in your films,

301
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,650
which one is your favorite?

302
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,920
The next one.

303
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,330
How are you feeling?

304
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,280
The patient has post-operative complications.

305
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,600
Help! Help!

306
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,120
The patient's condition isn't looking good.

307
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,120
Call everyone for a meeting. Hurry!

308
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,360
Mr. Cheng.

309
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,320
When did this happen?

310
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,250
Half an hour ago.

311
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,520
Chairman Cheng's condition has started to deteriorate.

312
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,920
What should we do?

313
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,760
Mr. Cheng.

314
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,700
We've followed you for so many years.

315
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,890
Immediately publish an obituary on the intranet under my name.

316
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,760
Don't let this information leak outside.

317
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,220
Gather all shareholders.

318
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,690
Call a board meeting immediately.

319
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,520
Also contact Chairman Cheng's personal lawyer.

320
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,120
Check his will.

321
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,640
See how many women he's made provisions for.

322
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,280
Go.

323
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,600
Okay.

324
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,600
Ladies and gentlemen,

325
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,680
from today onwards,

326
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,800
I will officially take over

327
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,130
as the chairman of Yiping Sunshine Group.

328
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,880
Moyang,

329
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,720
there are some things

330
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,220
I never wanted you to know.

331
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,420
Your mother was an alcoholic.

332
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,520
I tried to help her quit drinking,

333
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,600
but it was of no use.

334
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,880
I kept this from you

335
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,160
to preserve the image of your mother in your heart.

336
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:20,920
However,

337
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,320
How many times have I told you?

338
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,320
Why don't you change?

339
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,800
Why don't you quit drinking?

340
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,520
Why can't I drink?

341
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,080
And you?

342
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,080
Why should I let you control me?

343
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,720
Go die with Mom.

344
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,640
What are you doing?

345
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,520
Are you crazy?

346
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,440
I don't want to live anymore.

347
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:46,840
Let go!

348
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,400
Let

349
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,040
go of me!

350
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,120
I'm taking my son with me.

351
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,880
No way.

352
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,440
Until you successfully quit drinking,

353
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,360
my son can't go with you.

354
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,320
Mom! Don't go!

355
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,280
Moyang.

356
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,280
Moyang.

357
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:00,800
You.

358
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,520
If you want to leave, go ahead,

359
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,720
but my son stays here.

360
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,370
Have you ever thought about

361
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,850
what kind of person you want to become?

362
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,140
Definitely not a man like you.

363
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,880
I'm sorry.

364
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,760
I just heard about

365
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,320
your uncle's passing.

366
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,840
Are you okay?

367
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,520
I'm such a jerk.

368
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,980
If I had found that letter a few days earlier,

369
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,410
it would have made all the difference.

370
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,280
