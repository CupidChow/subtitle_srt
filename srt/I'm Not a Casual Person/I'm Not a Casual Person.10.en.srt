1
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,880
Thanks.

2
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,170
You mentioned last time that you have a child.

3
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,139
I never heard about you getting married.

4
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,600
Last time I went to your place,

5
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,680
I didn't see

6
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,370
any photos of your husband.

7
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,260
Let's play another round.

8
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,320
You're awake.

9
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,560
Hi, Ni.

10
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,840
I have a question.

11
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,720
Where is your father?

12
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,960
I don't have a father.

13
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,530
How old are you then?

14
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,640
2345.

15
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,000
5 years old.

16
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,079
5 years old.

17
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,040
Mr. Shen, are you afraid you can't compete with me?

18
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,170
So you deliberately bought a new suit?

19
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,160
Mr. Cheng, this overconfidence of yours

20
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,490
When will you get it checked at a hospital?

21
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,450
I saw it first, give it to me.

22
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,480
It's in my hands now.

23
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,040
Let go. I saw it first.

24
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,120
Let go.

25
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,079
You let go first.

26
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:44,600
Release it.

27
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,800
You release it first.

28
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,600
Dear Mom and Dad,

29
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,400
on my way home from school today,

30
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,040
I took advantage of my strength

31
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,840
and beat up a curly-haired kid.

32
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,280
Mom and Dad once told me...

33
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,200
Is that all?

34
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,000
You must have more. Hand it over.

35
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,640
Give it to me.

36
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,680
You have to let me copy your homework today.

37
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,040
Who are you? Mind your own business.

38
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,840
So what? I'm going to interfere today.

39
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,250
Guys, let's beat her up.

40
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,040
Stop fighting, all of you!

41
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,360
What's going on here? Did you hear me?

42
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,200
What's happening?

43
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,520
No, what's going on here?

44
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,120
The kids are just playing around.

45
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,450
What happened to Yaozu?

46
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,960
Are you hurt anywhere?

47
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,800
Stop crying.

48
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,480
Always causing trouble all day long.

49
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,120
Just wait until I get you home.

50
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,240
That's enough.

51
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,520
Isn't it normal for kids to roughhouse?

52
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,600
Let's go home now.

53
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,520
Come on, let's go home.

54
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,580
Don't cry anymore.

55
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,080
What's wrong, sweetie?

56
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,140
Where are you hurt?

57
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,680
Trying to trick Daddy, huh?

58
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,880
Little liar.

59
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,410
Let's go.

60
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,960
Be good, Yaozu. Don't cry.

61
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,410
Where are your parents?

62
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,480
Stop crying.

63
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,850
No more tears, okay?

64
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,080
Come, the dumplings are ready.

65
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,720
Come on now.

66
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,520
Come.

67
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:22,760
Come.

68
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,880
Kids, eat while they're hot.

69
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,010
Eat your dumplings.

70
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,920
Eat slowly. Don't choke.

71
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,800
Here.

72
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,800
Mom, that's mine!

73
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,080
I haven't eaten yet.

74
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,080
Isn't this big plate enough for you?

75
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,480
Curly, save some for me!

76
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,680
Don't be polite about this simple meal.

77
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,520
Come, eat more.

78
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:08,880
Here.

79
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:09,800
Thank you, sir.

80
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,080
The crispy meat at your doorstep is delicious.

81
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,810
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.

82
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,520
Eat.

83
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,000
Here.

84
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Thank you, ma'am.

85
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,380
Zheng Yaozu said someone was looking for me.

86
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,120
So it's you.

87
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,320
Of course.

88
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,960
What did you want to see me about?

89
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,040
Don't you find this place familiar?

90
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,960
Yes, it does feel familiar.

91
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,620
Have you remembered anything

92
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,960
about the diary?

93
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,560
Today after school,

94
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,720
I, the great hero, saw injustice,

95
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,200
struck with mighty fists,

96
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,960
and saved a skinny kid.

97
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,000
Is this it?

98
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,640
What's your name?

99
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,100
My name is Lei Feng.

100
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,920
I remember now.

101
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,960
I knew you would remember me.

102
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,720
Why would I remember you?

103
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,960
You're too much, Zhengying.

104
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,890
You're too much.

105
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,800
Let me take a photo of you too.

106
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,400
I don't like having my photo taken.

107
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,520
Just do it.

108
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,840
You may be skinny, but you're very good-looking.

109
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,520
And let me tell you something.

110
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,920
If you don't want to be bullied,

111
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,720
you need to find a way to become stronger than them.

112
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,760
Ready.

113
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,840
I wonder where that skinny kid

114
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,040
is now.

115
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,490
Zheng Xiaohong.

116
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,810
What are you doing here?

117
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,370
Why are you smiling?

118
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,679
I always feel that when I'm with you,

119
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,480
I can't help but be infected by your energy.

120
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,600
Are you saying

121
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,919
that I have some kind of magic power?

122
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:42,880
Hmm.

123
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,080
If this author is so hard to find,

124
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,840
why are you so determined to buy the copyright?

125
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,860
Don't you want to achieve something?

126
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,600
Of course I do, but I want to rely on myself.

127
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,520
If every film depends on you,

128
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,480
then it's your achievement, not mine.

129
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,680
I want achievements.

130
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,250
You're the best candidate to help me succeed.

131
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,050
Because you have something others don't -

132
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,180
a quality of resilience that grows stronger in adversity.

133
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,920
My choosing you isn't so much about helping you,

134
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,120
but rather about fulfilling myself through you.

135
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,920
Your motivational speech is nice,

136
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,240
but I feel your explanation is a bit far-fetched.

137
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,100
Why not just admit you're into me?

138
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,640
Whether you like him or not,

139
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,480
you'll find out if you give it a try.

140
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,640
Xiaohong, you're not a coward.

141
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,600
Good evening.

142
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,250
Where have you been so late?

143
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,730
Where's Zheng Ying?

144
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,600
Aren't you two together?

145
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,640
No, don't move.

146
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,120
Why are your lips so red and swollen?

147
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,960
Were you two sneaking out

148
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,120
to eat delicious food without me?

149
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,200
Really now.

150
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,330
Don't move. I'm not finished talking.

151
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,200
Hey!

152
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,120
So what if it's his birthday?

153
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,440
My absence is the best gift I can give him.

154
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,600
Are you sure he'll go?

155
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,010
I found out that Liu Xiaomeng hasn't gone out.

156
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,440
She's been staying at home the whole time.

157
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,280
Every morning there's a woman

158
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,120
who delivers some daily necessities to her.

159
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,520
Come pick me up right now.

160
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,800
Get the contract ready.

161
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,800
I'll be back soon.

162
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,440
Shen Yifan.

163
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,520
You're definitely going to lose this time.

164
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,480
Was I being too impulsive?

165
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,960
But I've already kissed him. What else can I do now?

166
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,320
Does that make me a creep?

167
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,960
But I...

168
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,760
I only kiss someone I like.

169
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,320
Hey.

170
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,240
What's wrong?

171
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,280
Youyi.

172
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,240
If you realize you've made a mistake,

173
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,280
how would you fix it?

174
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,840
I wonder if this girl installed cameras to monitor me.

175
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,440
Since you know you were wrong,

176
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,080
you must make amends, right?

177
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,080
How do I make amends?

178
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,360
Seize every opportunity, understand?

179
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,960
Take the initiative, got it?

180
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,760
Be persistent, understand?

181
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,760
Nothing can stop

182
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,820
my determination to be a good father.

183
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,280
Take the initiative.

184
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,900
Taking every opportunity

185
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,460
and being thick-skinned.

186
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,400
Yingying.

187
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,440
Mom.

188
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,090
Why are you hiding here?

189
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,440
It's just a temporary separation.

190
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,440
Why are you so sad?

191
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,400
Separation?

192
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,160
You're not upset because Xiaocheng left,

193
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,080
are you?

194
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,720
He left.

195
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,880
So you're sad because Xiao Shen is leaving?

196
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,720
W-what?

197
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,120
Who's leaving?

198
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,440
Shen Yifan?

199
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,680
When?

200
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,960
See? I knew it was about Xiao Shen.

201
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,600
Sweetie, I think this matter

202
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,290
needs more consideration.

203
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,280
No need to think about it.

204
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,160
Don't listen to him.

205
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,280
Don't think about it. Don't think about it.

206
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,880
What's there to think about?

207
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,880
I'm moving the project forward.

208
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,340
Compare the two screenwriting teams first.

209
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,680
I've already sent over the project proposal.

210
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,410
Please take another look at it.

211
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,930
I have something to say.

212
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,850
I have something to say too.

213
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,600
It was last night, that's right.

214
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,360
Last night?

215
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,180
Wu Yu found out that Liu Xiaomeng was at home the whole time.

216
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,780
You must know that.

217
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,140
Let's focus on why we're here.

218
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,200
To buy the rights.

219
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,080
Exactly.

220
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,530
So what's the most important thing right now?

221
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,320
Finding the author.

222
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,420
Then what are you waiting for?

223
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,760
Go now. Go now.

224
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,500
I wonder if the nanny isn't coming today.

225
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,200
That's impossible.

226
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,680
According to what Mr. Shen has learned,

227
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,920
this nanny has been coming here

228
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,180
every day for three years, rain or shine.

229
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,880
She must have been delayed by something.

230
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,760
Let's wait a bit longer.

231
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,020
You really trust your Mr. Shen that much?

232
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
Of course.

233
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,440
My Mr. Shen is never wrong.

234
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,720
Do you know your Mr. Shen well?

235
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,240
How many girlfriends has he had?

236
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,680
What's his type?

237
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,160
Intellectual?

238
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,400
Cute?

239
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,400
Or glamorous?

240
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,280
Why are you asking all this?

241
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,480
To pursue him, of course.

242
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,000
What?

243
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,040
Why are you getting so worked up?

244
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,570
It's not like I'm after you.

245
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,240
Who says I'm worked up?

246
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,200
I'm warning you. Don't get any inappropriate ideas about him.

247
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,280
How is that inappropriate?

248
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,240
He's single, I'm single.

249
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,840
We're perfect for each other.

250
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,200
What?

251
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,320
Being single doesn't make you compatible.

252
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,320
My young master,

253
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,680
the second son of the Shen family,

254
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,010
investment genius and walking money god,

255
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,440
and then look at you.

256
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,370
How are you compatible?

257
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,040
In matters of love,

258
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,920
talking about status and wealth is shallow.

259
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,160
Forget status and wealth.

260
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,680
Let's talk about his ideal type.

261
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,920
My Mr. Shen prefers someone

262
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,560
intellectual, elegant, wise, and knowledgeable,

263
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,020
someone who can discuss economics with him.

264
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,240
Can you do that?

265
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,160
I'm an actress.

266
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,480
I can play any type.

267
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,040
Your Mr. Shen? I've set my sights on him.

268
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,040
You!

269
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,640
Thank you for your help.

270
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,599
Ma'am,

271
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,520
this fall is quite serious.

272
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,119
You should go to the hospital to get it checked.

273
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:14,839
Okay.

274
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,609
I'll go this afternoon.

275
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,359
I'm here now.

276
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,579
Please give me the groceries.

277
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,319
Let us help you carry these things inside.

278
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,640
To be honest,

279
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,720
this is my employer's house.

280
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,520
I can't invite you in.

281
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,880
That's fine.

282
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,320
Thank you.

283
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,880
We'll be going then.

284
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,880
Okay,

285
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,520
thank you so much.

286
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,320
How could I forget my keys?

287
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,960
Meng Meng?

288
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,440
Meng Meng?

289
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,520
It's me.

290
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,680
I forgot my keys.

291
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:18,800
Hello.

292
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,760
Are you the writer Liu Xiaomeng?

293
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,880
Auntie, did you bring these people here?

294
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,760
No, no.

295
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,000
I was just outside.

296
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,760
Yes.

297
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,600
We just noticed that you have difficulty walking.

298
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,040
So you're here to buy the copyright.

299
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,300
Don't waste your time.

300
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,300
I won't sell it.

301
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,000
You should leave now.

302
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Please go.

303
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,000
Mr. Shen, I'm sorry.

304
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,000
I failed to find out

305
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,880
the crucial information about her being paralyzed for three years,

306
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,240
and rushed to visit her, messing everything up.

307
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,580
Should we look for another intellectual property?

308
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,080
No need.

309
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,000
At least now

310
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,080
we've met her in person.

311
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,600
But we've only left a bad impression.

312
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,320
Precisely because of that bad impression,

313
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,050
we need to visit and apologize.

314
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,940
I believe you can do it.

315
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,120
You always have this energy that people can't refuse.

316
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,840
So,

317
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,820
make the most of tomorrow's opportunity

318
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,440
and become

319
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,600
her only choice.

320
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,840
Does this energy work on you too?

321
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,320
Let's go back.

322
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,800
Tomorrow, we continue the mission.

323
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,440
Why aren't you going back to rest?

324
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,720
You go first.

325
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,400
I need to discuss with him

326
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,480
about tomorrow's operation.

327
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,200
Me too.

328
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,680
First come, first served.

329
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,560
Are you two elementary school kids?

330
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:04,960
Wu Yu,

331
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,130
you go first.

332
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,040
Shen, Boss Shen.

333
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,500
Am I your assistant picked from a trash heap?

334
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,000
Bye-bye to you.

335
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,920
Any other questions?

336
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,680
You can ask.

337
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,960
Actually,

338
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,400
it's nothing important.

339
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,680
I just read a few economics books recently.

340
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,880
There are some concepts I don't quite understand.

341
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,610
I wanted to ask for your advice.

342
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,720
Go ahead.

343
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,800
Mr. Shen often says

344
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,530
economics can explain everything in this world.

345
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,640
I wonder in your eyes,

346
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,120
how does economics explain love?

347
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,680
The meaning of love

348
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,240
is finding the most suitable person for you

349
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,340
and spending the rest of your life together.

350
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,920
The purpose of economics

351
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,700
is to achieve optimal resource allocation.

352
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,840
So from this perspective,

353
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
the two do have something in common.

354
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,160
I see.

355
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,320
So, Mr. Shen,

356
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,640
what kind of person

357
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,200
would be the optimal match

358
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,120
for you in terms of love?

359
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,520
What do you think?

360
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,920
How about me?

361
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:19,800
Last night,

362
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,460
Zheng Ying.

363
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,560
I will have to leave eventually.

364
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,160
And it might happen soon.

365
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,160
I have one and only one goal:

366
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,000
to make you a star.

367
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,660
This opportunity is crucial for you.

368
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,520
I hope you can stay focused.

369
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,960
Now go get some rest.

370
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,200
Please leave.

371
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,560
Shen Yifan,

372
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,560
don't you have any feelings for me at all?

373
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,360
Please leave.

374
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,480
Mr. Shen, you need to control yourself.

375
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,040
Go to bed. Zheng Ying has inappropriate intentions toward you.

376
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,800
Go to bed.

377
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,760
The doctor said you can't get excited or overthink things.

378
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,760
You absolutely cannot faint again.

379
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,690
If I can't give you lasting happiness,

380
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,480
isn't it better to let go sooner?

381
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,600
That would be a mercy for you.

382
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,280
Don't mention sensitive topics.

383
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,480
Don't look around.

384
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,080
Stay quiet and be discreet.

385
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,760
Got it?

386
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,280
I'm not an idiot.

387
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,960
Hello, sir.

388
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,800
Excuse me, do you know...

389
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,920
I'm just a neighbor.

390
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,850
Just helping to take out the trash.

391
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,400
What a good neighbor.

392
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,240
Great author,

393
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,600
are you home?

394
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,920
I heard from the agent that

395
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,040
the lady needs to rest these days due to a leg injury,

396
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,760
so right now

397
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,960
she's probably home alone.

398
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,680
She's home alone?

399
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,850
Then she'll be the one opening the door for us.

400
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,560
Uncle.

401
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,840
Um, I heard that

402
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,200
the CEO Wang from Boya Creative Publishing

403
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:48,800
is going to attend

404
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,600
Grandfather's birthday party?

405
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,520
Could you introduce me to him?

406
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,680
But just...

407
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:55,880
Yes,

408
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,280
keep it secret from Grandfather,

409
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,600
absolutely confidential.

410
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,120
You know I don't like using his connections.

411
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:04,920
Okay.

412
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,570
I'll wait for your news, Uncle.

413
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,330
Goodbye.

414
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,240
Mr. Cheng,

415
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,920
Shen Yifan has already met with author Liu Xiaomang

416
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,760
in person.

417
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,020
No good. It's too late.

418
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,960
Prepare a gift for me.

419
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,640
I need to go there personally.

420
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,440
Okay.

421
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,240
Great author,

422
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,040
want some barbecue?

423
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,520
Mang Mang,

424
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,810
would you like some fried chicken?

425
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,480
Do you really have to be like this?

426
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,640
Acting like a desperate simp?

427
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,920
It's embarrassing.

428
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,680
You're so naive, young man.

429
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,680
Mengmeng.

430
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,680
Want some rice noodles?

431
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,760
With a fried egg?

432
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,120
Hello.

433
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,540
Hello, this is property management.

434
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,800
We've received complaints

435
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,720
that there's loud arguing in your apartment,

436
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,760
the noise has exceeded 70 decibels,

437
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,960
which is disturbing the neighbors.

438
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,400
Is there any problem here?

439
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,240
I've already said I...

440
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,200
Excuse me, may I use your bathroom?

441
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,160
She might have an upset stomach.

442
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,840
We came here

443
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,880
mainly to apologize for yesterday's rudeness.

444
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,880
We hope you...

445
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,840
I've said I won't sell the rights.

446
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,080
The female lead in my novel is perfect.

447
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,160
No one can do her justice.

448
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,080
I won't ruin her for a few bucks.

449
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,040
Yes.

450
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,280
The female lead in your work is indeed perfect.

451
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,520
But an actor's greatest charm

452
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,800
is their adaptability.

453
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,200
Like the person just now.

454
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,200
She wants to play my female lead?

455
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,040
Are you kidding me?

456
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,160
She knows martial arts just like your character,

457
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,280
and she's loyal and knows boundaries.

458
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,680
I think she fits the role in many ways.

459
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,480
Mengmeng.

460
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,800
You're out of toilet paper,

461
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,200
could you bring me a roll?

462
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,600
Knows boundaries...

463
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:00,920
Mengmeng.

464
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,640
Let me introduce myself.

465
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,840
My name is Zheng Ying.

466
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,760
I'm an actress.

467
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,520
You type so fast!

468
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,180
No wonder you're a writer.

469
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,000
These decorations are so unique.

470
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,640
All mountains.

471
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,280
You have so many books.

472
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,600
Must be thousands of them.

473
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,320
You could open a library.

474
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,680
Martial arts novels.

475
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,400
Comics too.

476
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,120
We have similar interests.

477
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,880
You actually have volume 10 of this comic!

478
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,640
I couldn't find it anywhere.

479
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,760
Let me take a look.

480
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,280
We should leave now.

481
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,880
Let's not disturb the writer's work.

482
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,210
You go ahead. I haven't finished reading.

483
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,360
You...

484
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,200
I...

485
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,060
I'll wait for you outside.

486
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,680
You're Zheng Ying, right?

487
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,280
Let me tell you something.

488
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,960
You are not the perfect lead I have in mind.

489
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,200
Don't waste your time here.

490
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,360
Please immediately...

491
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,040
leave.
