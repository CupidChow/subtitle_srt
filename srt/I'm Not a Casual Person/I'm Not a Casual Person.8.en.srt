1
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,280
It's that simple.

2
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,850
What did you expect?

3
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,330
You don't have to rehearse with me.

4
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,039
Then help me analyze

5
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,440
why Ni Shang dislikes me.

6
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,180
Yu Youyi is the only connection between you two.

7
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,200
She sees you with him every day.

8
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,600
That's a possibility.

9
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,080
No.

10
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,000
She doesn't seem like the jealous type.

11
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,800
There must be some other reason.

12
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,040
I really like Ni Shang.

13
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,800
I've seen almost all her movies.

14
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,079
Don't you think Ni Shang is beautiful?

15
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,480
Well, I don't like her.

16
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,800
She's so fake.

17
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,720
Maybe she's

18
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,800
very obedient to the investors.

19
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,840
That's so true.

20
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,920
She appears

21
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,560
cold and restrained.

22
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,960
As an actress,

23
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,040
being talked about is very common.

24
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,040
I know.

25
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,410
But I really can't take it anymore.

26
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,200
Go ahead.

27
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,400
Really?

28
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,210
I'm here for you.

29
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,840
You don't need to hold back anymore.

30
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,079
I didn't say anything

31
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:52,720
folks.

32
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,240
Are you discussing Ni Shang?

33
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,500
Who is this person?

34
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,120
Who gave you the confidence

35
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,920
to do something to a film queen?

36
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,680
Besides, she's a real person.

37
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,800
Don't you have even

38
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,760
the basic respect for others?

39
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,280
Excuse me, who are you?

40
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,960
What's it to you if we're chatting here?

41
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,360
Exactly.

42
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,120
Get lost.

43
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,360
Right, nothing better to do.

44
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,480
What? Should we talk about you instead of her?

45
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,600
If we're talking about status, you're certainly not as high as hers.

46
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,800
But looks-wise, you're not bad either.

47
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,520
I bet the price

48
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,040
wasn't cheap either.

49
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,800
Isn't that right?

50
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,360
If you can't speak properly, shut up.

51
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,720
Otherwise, go back to your mother's womb

52
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,760
and learn how to be a decent human before coming out again.

53
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,800
Who do you think you are?

54
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,130
What do you mean 'who'? Stay on the ground.

55
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,810
Let's go.

56
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:42,960
Don't leave!

57
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
Stop right there!

58
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,600
By means of degrading women

59
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,320
To show off your power.

60
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,220
Don't you think it's beneath you?

61
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,520
You're that gossip account that enjoys defaming others, right?

62
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,720
Expect to hear from my lawyers.

63
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,020
That slap of yours looked pretty fierce.

64
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,120
No need to get friendly with me.

65
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,160
We're not close.

66
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,400
I wasn't trying to get friendly either.

67
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,440
Look.

68
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,040
Is that Ni Shang?

69
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,960
An award-winning actress like you standing by the roadside.

70
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,680
What if you cause a traffic jam?

71
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,280
Just making trouble for the traffic officers.

72
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,159
Get her out of here quickly.

73
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:32,960
Okay.

74
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,159
I'll call Wu Yu

75
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,220
to come pick you up.

76
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,580
Take care of yourself.

77
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,400
Your artist is just like you,

78
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,720
always eager to help others.

79
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,170
As long as you don't think she's meddling.

80
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,640
Well,

81
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,960
That's nice.

82
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,810
We finally have our own car.

83
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,360
Do you know you've caused Mr. Shen big trouble again?

84
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,120
Why did you have to meddle?

85
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,840
Today's business

86
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,090
was something your boss Mr. Shen got involved in with me.

87
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,930
Isn't that right, Mr. Shen?

88
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,440
Yes.

89
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,050
Ni Shang clearly dislikes you.

90
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,540
Why did you still help her?

91
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,760
Because

92
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,080
I'm a woman too.

93
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,000
Just because of that?

94
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,370
Although I'm not as famous as Ni Shang,

95
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,200
as a female actress,

96
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,360
I also constantly receive

97
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,840
malicious attacks.

98
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,700
I really don't understand

99
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,720
why whenever people talk about actresses,

100
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,240
they always discuss

101
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,400
their figures,

102
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,840
looks and gossip.

103
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,120
Ni Shang is already an award-winning actress.

104
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,040
Her professional abilities

105
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,120
have already been professionally recognized.

106
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,440
Why does she still have to be

107
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,300
judged like that by those people?

108
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,480
It's not because she's an award-winning actress

109
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,740
that she shouldn't face such criticism.

110
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,000
It's because no one

111
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,240
should face such accusations and disrespect.

112
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,840
But those people just now

113
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,920
don't represent everyone.

114
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,240
You won't lose confidence

115
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,440
because of what happened today, right?

116
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,400
Right.

117
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,180
As long as we work hard enough,

118
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,280
someday

119
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,120
prejudice may not disappear,

120
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,560
but attitudes can change.

121
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,040
Being with you,

122
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,100
it seems like life becomes more vibrant.

123
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,040
Recently, I

124
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,880
Mr. Cheng.

125
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,040
You've had too much to drink.

126
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,560
I'm in a good mood today.

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,930
I'm going to drink myself to death.

128
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,690
You sent the qipao, didn't you?

129
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,760
I misunderstood.

130
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,400
Let me make something clear to you now.

131
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,930
I'm not that kind of person.

132
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,560
Scene 25, take one. Action.

133
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,480
Where is Guoguo?

134
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,000
Where have you hidden Guoguo?

135
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,120
Please tell me.

136
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,000
Say something!

137
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,360
Talk to me!

138
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,600
He's where he should be.

139
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,160
Where he belongs.

140
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,680
Good. That's a wrap.

141
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,500
It's approved.

142
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,080
Shouldn't you be hitting me?

143
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,440
Enough.

144
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,240
I thought martial artists were all straightforward.

145
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,600
Didn't you tell me not to get familiar with you?

146
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,520
From what I know,

147
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,240
you're not one to follow instructions.

148
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,040
I clearly lost your child,

149
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,760
you're angry with me,

150
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,140
but why are you hitting yourself?

151
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,880
I am a mother.

152
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,640
Protecting my child is my instinct.

153
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,180
I failed to do that.

154
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,840
So compared to you,

155
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,160
I'm more angry at myself.

156
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,880
But I didn't catch your reaction.

157
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,560
Why did the director say that take was good?

158
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,720
We wanted your genuine reaction.

159
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,500
Do you know why you can't play this role well?

160
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm really sorry.

161
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,640
Xiao Wan's schedule is full again.

162
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,080
Okay.

163
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,140
Alright, let's work together next time.

164
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,000
Hey, bro.

165
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,900
We've already agreed on this.

166
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,840
Our Xiao Wan is a great actor and very cooperative.

167
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,040
Please make sure to keep the role for us.

168
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,000
You're just a kid without a father.

169
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,240
Who says that? Of course I have a father.

170
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,240
What's your father's name?

171
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,720
Where is he?

172
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,800
Why doesn't he come to see you?

173
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,680
What's wrong, baby?

174
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,760
Dad, you're finally here!

175
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,960
Yes, daddy's here.

176
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,920
See? My dad is here.

177
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,760
Let's go.

178
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,930
Not bad acting. You've got potential.

179
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,580
You acted well too.

180
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,560
No, no. I haven't been held by my father yet.

181
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,520
Please act a little longer.

182
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,560
As an actor,

183
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,180
merely breaking down,

184
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,410
understanding,

185
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,840
and knowing your character

186
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,900
is far from enough.

187
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,320
You must always keep all your senses open

188
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,280
to feel the energy from your fellow actors.

189
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,160
No actor

190
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,210
can act while ignoring their scene partners.

191
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,930
That day in the park,

192
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,720
why did you help me

193
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,920
when you clearly dislike me?

194
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,160
I dislike you

195
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,560
because you always act so superior,

196
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,560
looking down on everyone with that arrogant attitude.

197
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,560
But I admit,

198
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,720
with your talent and status,

199
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,760
you have the right to be proud.

200
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,480
However,

201
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,820
when the day comes that I surpass you with my acting,

202
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,500
I'll be even prouder than you.

203
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,160
With your acting skills?

204
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,200
Nishang, let me tell you.

205
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,040
Although I'm not your equal now,

206
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,800
someday

207
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,680
I'll stand on the same award stage as you,

208
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,440
and take

209
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,420
the Best Actress trophy from your hands.

210
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,520
Let me tell you,

211
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,220
I've never been anyone's murder weapon,

212
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,600
much less a disposable pawn.

213
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,200
My life

214
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,440
will always remain in my own hands.

215
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,520
Look at me.

216
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,160
I'm the one who controls the rules of the game now.

217
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,090
Are you going to work with me or not?

218
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,640
Stop.

219
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,920
One take.

220
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,840
That's a wrap!

221
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,280
Thank you, director.

222
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,000
Good work.

223
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,480
I got it in one take.

224
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,880
I saw that.

225
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,440
Good job.

226
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,360
Nishang.

227
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,320
Should we be friends?

228
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,240
No.

229
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,040
No?

230
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,120
You're missing out on

231
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,580
the chance to be friends with a future award-winning actress.

232
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,800
With your current acting skills,

233
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,440
you want to be an award-winning actress?

234
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,520
I doubt it.

235
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,640
What's wrong with my acting?

236
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,320
I'm improving, aren't I?

237
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,200
You may look down on me now,

238
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,330
but someday I'll be out of your league.

239
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,800
Let me tell you,

240
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,360
acting with complete freedom

241
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,640
feels like this.

242
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,760
It's amazing.

243
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,840
Mr. Shen.

244
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,160
I think she's

245
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,820
quite an interesting person.

246
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,160
Interesting?

247
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,280
She seems

248
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,080
a bit naive,

249
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,000
but actually understands life better than anyone.

250
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,860
She's so full of energy every day.

251
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,080
Just one person,

252
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,760
yet she lights up the entire crew with her presence.

253
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,480
Yes,

254
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,520
how I wish I could stay close to that vibrant energy

255
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,780
and feel her vitality.

256
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,330
Perhaps that way I could live a little longer.

257
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,400
Last time you only told me the sixth floor

258
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,860
but didn't tell me which room you live in.

259
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,690
Why are you still sleeping?

260
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,400
Um,

261
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,080
this is not my child.

262
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,020
Why are you explaining this to me?

263
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,240
Baby.

264
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,600
Baby.

265
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,560
Come on, wake up.

266
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,320
Get down.

267
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,600
Come.

268
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,760
This is my son.

269
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,840
Thank you for bringing him back.

270
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,120
Let's go home.

271
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,640
Hello.

272
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,200
Excuse me,

273
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,760
where am I?

274
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,720
Hello.

275
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,160
Excuse me,

276
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,560
where am I?

277
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,000
This is, of course, where people

278
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,360
stay after they die.

279
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,600
Are you asleep?

280
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:42,880
What's up?

281
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,600
Aren't we shooting the scene tomorrow

282
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,120
where I kill my father and then commit suicide?

283
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,080
I can't sleep because I'm memorizing my lines.

284
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,440
What's wrong?

285
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,000
Ni Shang was right.

286
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,080
I need to fully immerse myself in this character

287
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,520
to perform it well.

288
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,320
When I think about this character now,

289
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,560
it feels like I've actually lived

290
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,000
her brief life.

291
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,680
Her life was indeed short.

292
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,840
I feel so sad for her.

293
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,520
Have you ever

294
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,760
felt tired of living?

295
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,440
Of course not.

296
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,400
Though sometimes I feel like I can't go on,

297
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,930
but I'm like a cockroach that can't be killed.

298
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,360
But I'm trying to understand the character I'm playing.

299
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,640
Perhaps

300
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,480
death was truly a release for her.

301
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,840
Because a life where you kill people every day

302
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,480
with no future in sight is terrifying.

303
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,300
What about you?

304
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,760
Is there anything you're afraid of?

305
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,570
I think a future that you can see

306
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,060
is even more frightening.

307
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,520
He's fallen asleep.

308
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,640
Mr. Shen.

309
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,160
I'm finishing shooting tomorrow.

310
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,090
This is my first time wrapping up as the lead actress.

311
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,730
I want a bouquet of flowers.

312
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,640
A super big one.

313
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,860
Did you hear me?

314
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,640
Starting from today,

315
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,120
I'm going to use my real name again.

316
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,000
And return to my true self.

317
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,600
Everything is over.

318
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,280
Everything

319
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,600
is starting all over again.

320
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,480
Cut!

321
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,660
Ms. Zheng Ying has finished filming.

322
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,480
Congratulations, Ms. Zheng.

323
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,440
Thank you.

324
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,720
Congratulations, Ms. Zheng Ying:

325
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,760
Good job.

326
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,880
I knew it was

327
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,760
Why is it you?

328
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,280
Where's Shen Yifan?

329
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,650
I don't know.

330
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,480
He called me saying he had an emergency and hung up.

331
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,100
Why are you disappointed?

332
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,530
Hide that disappointed look on your face.

333
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,000
These flowers are from my agent.

334
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,920
They're beautiful.

335
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,080
That's better.

336
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,610
So what's the plan after I finish filming?

337
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,180
Get some good rest.

338
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,200
Let's go.

339
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,920
Holiday.

340
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,120
I'm here!

341
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,660
Your delivery.

342
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,440
Thank you.

343
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,400
You have no idea how stupid I just was.

344
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,240
[Confirm]

345
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,160
He's not responding to any of my messages.

346
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,920
Is Shen Yifan playing hide and seek with me?

347
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,760
Hello? Is this Shen Yifan?

348
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,040
Mom.

349
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,200
No.

350
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,240
I'm not being impatient.

351
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,200
It's like this person suddenly disappeared.

352
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,760
You know what?

353
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,520
After not seeing him for a few days,

354
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,240
I actually miss him a little.

355
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,500
Why would I miss him for no reason?

356
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,820
Have I gotten used to being exploited by him?

357
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,520
That's terrifying.

358
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,960
Mr. Shen, please take a look.

359
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,280
Mr. Shen is really getting proper rest.

360
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,760
Are you satisfied now?

361
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,160
Mr. Shen,

362
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,320
I've already helped you deceive the senior Mr. Shen.

363
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,380
Isn't that enough?

364
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,800
Your fainting really worried the senior Mr. Shen.

365
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
He insisted that you must rest properly

366
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,400
and wouldn't let me give you your phone.

367
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,920
Since you listen to him so well,

368
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,780
why don't you just go work for him?

369
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,680
Have you arranged the company matters?

370
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,040
According to your instructions,

371
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,320
Miss Zheng is currently on vacation.

372
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,280
You may leave.

373
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,200
Mr. Shen, you were right.

374
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,000
He still took the phone away.

375
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,130
I couldn't stop him.

376
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,920
But don't worry.

377
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,400
I only gave him the phone.

378
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,720
Not the charger.

379
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,240
What nonsense.

380
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,320
I'm busy.

381
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,080
This food of yours

382
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,880
looks absolutely terrible.

383
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,600
During the break,

384
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,400
the acting class was meant to continue anyway.

385
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,500
They say seeing the sunset brings good luck.

386
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,040
I'm going on vacation.

387
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,080
Hope you feel some of that good luck too.

388
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,260
You can be discharged now.

389
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,360
Good.

390
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,200
Thank you.

391
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,320
I told you before,

392
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,080
you should stay at our family villa.

393
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,280
It's perfect for you.

394
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,200
I've spoken with the doctor.

395
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,760
You already did that, didn't you?

396
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,600
Of course. How else could I let you use your phone

397
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,760
and allow you to leave the hospital?

398
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,200
The doctor said

399
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,080
although you fainted this time,

400
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,940
your condition hasn't worsened.

401
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,320
He also said

402
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,370
it might be related to your improved mood lately.

403
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,000
Do you think seeing you back in the country

404
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,460
would put me in a good mood?

405
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,740
That's not important.

406
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,000
What matters is,

407
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,480
I really want to know

408
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,940
who this person is that makes you happy just by seeing them.

409
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,300
The butterfly effect.

410
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,640
Brother.

411
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,400
You should smile more often too.

412
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,520
Life is always changing.

413
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,080
Life will never change.

414
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,400
If that's the case,

415
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,880
why are you still insisting on helping her?

416
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,660
Because she's part of my plan.

417
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,560
I knew it.

418
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,880
Saying it was love at first sight

419
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,140
was just an excuse to stay in the country.

420
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,960
But now?

421
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,800
Is she still just someone

422
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,720
you want to repay?

423
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:19,840
Of course.

424
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,400
Hey, Youyi.

425
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:50,960
Hello?

426
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:51,880
Hello?

427
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,880
Shen Yifan,

428
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,000
help me, please!

429
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,100
Wait for me.

430
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,520
Send me her address right away.

431
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,180
