1
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,759
Your current condition is very unstable.

2
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,360
Please minimize emotional fluctuations.

3
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,800
Limit how often you go out.

4
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,460
Avoid sudden deterioration of your condition.

5
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
The doctor says

6
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,820
we need to increase your medication dosage.

7
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,700
I am a businessman.

8
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,220
Finding good projects

9
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,880
and good actors to work with

10
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,120
is my job.

11
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,840
Anything beyond that,

12
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,490
I couldn't care less about.

13
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,520
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,440
I really want to tell you that

15
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,760
I like you.

16
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,240
I've said before,

17
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,760
as long as you don't give up hope,

18
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,690
there's still hope for the future.

19
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,160
Shen Yifan,

20
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,720
just you wait and see.

21
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,680
I have someone I like.

22
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,420
Miss Zheng truly has a passionate personality.

23
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,500
Are you still in Switzerland?

24
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,000
Help me find someone.

25
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,480
Sweetie.

26
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,720
Mommy's back.

27
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,600
Mom, Dad and I have been waiting for you.

28
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,240
Dad?

29
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,760
Well...

30
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,210
I just happened to run into him, so I kept him company for a while.

31
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,760
Come here, sweetie.

32
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,980
What are you doing?

33
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,260
There's no such coincidence.

34
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,520
Mom, don't be angry.

35
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,320
I wanted Dad to play with me.

36
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,570
If you want to play, I can play with you.

37
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,000
And you can't just call someone Dad.

38
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,810
Understand?

39
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,600
But Mom, I really like Dad.

40
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,480
Don't overthink it.

41
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,410
I was just keeping the kid company.

42
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,560
Thank you for your kindness.

43
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,050
I appreciate it.

44
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,360
I'll be going then.

45
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,040
Mr. Shen.

46
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,560
Your readings are much better today.

47
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,159
Staying away from that annoying Zheng Ying was the right choice.

48
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,040
But I don't feel good.

49
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,160
Mr. Shen.

50
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,560
Are you alright?

51
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,020
What's on the schedule today?

52
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,810
The variety show we discussed before starts filming today.

53
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,610
I'll take her to the set.

54
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,480
Mr. Shen.

55
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,720
You don't need to go.

56
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,520
Why not?

57
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,360
Zheng Ying said

58
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,440
you don't need to see her off.

59
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,560
What else did she say?

60
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,440
We're just business partners.

61
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,900
Why are you still so involved in my business?

62
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,680
By the way,

63
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,280
that line is really good.

64
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,080
This line

65
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,840
was specially added by our scriptwriter

66
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,280
and it's the key moment

67
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,400
in today's filming.

68
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,060
We're aiming to trend online.

69
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:43,610
Good.

70
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,080
You two go over your lines again.

71
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,440
We'll start shooting soon.

72
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:46,880
Okay.

73
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,000
These game-based variety shows are

74
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,200
extremely popular now.

75
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,930
We must do a good job recording.

76
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,920
Recording...

77
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,440
Hey!

78
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,600
What's wrong with you?

79
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,600
At yesterday's film festival,

80
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,560
you were the center of attention as a new actress.

81
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,720
How come

82
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,720
after trending for just a few hours,

83
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,650
you're already acting like a diva?

84
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Diva...

85
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,890
Weren't you supposed to be the hunter?

86
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,000
But you look more like the prey to me.

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,680
Prey...

88
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,100
If you keep this up,

89
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,320
I'm going to complain to Director Shen.

90
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,610
This is basically her state right now.

91
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,960
But the crew is very satisfied.

92
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,200
They say she's very cooperative.

93
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,520
Whatever the crew asks, she films it.

94
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,760
Nonsense.

95
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,400
Should we help her?

96
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,280
No need.

97
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,530
She needs time to calm down.

98
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,400
They're playing games today.

99
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,960
Losers get thrown into the water.

100
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,720
She volunteered to go into the water

101
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,780
and wouldn't let Wan Yuchen help her.

102
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,290
How ridiculous.

103
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,600
Should we go check on her?

104
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,250
What's there to see?

105
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,400
Have you finished your work?

106
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,720
Mr. Shen.

107
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,520
Wan Yuchen said she was doing an escape room game

108
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,320
and volunteered to chase after a non-player character,

109
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,480
but then a prop fell and injured her.

110
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,720
What?

111
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,970
She got injured.

112
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,840
This photo of yours

113
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:38,000
looks so fake.

114
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,159
How about this? Real enough for you?

115
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,090
Take it quickly.

116
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,400
I really don't understand why I'm not sleeping at this hour

117
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,930
and accompanying you with all this nonsense.

118
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,360
Hiking up mountains, going into water.

119
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,720
And now pretending to be injured?

120
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,680
All this effort to play the victim,

121
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,810
who exactly are you trying to impress?

122
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,760
Is it that person?

123
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,720
Shut your mouth

124
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,040
and stop gossiping about me.

125
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,840
Otherwise...

126
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,200
Here.

127
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,800
You know who I'll send this to.

128
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,640
It's been hours

129
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,400
and he still hasn't come.

130
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,560
Does he think I'm not injured badly enough?

131
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,560
This cold-hearted man.

132
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,800
Master Zhou says

133
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,280
a martial artist shouldn't mind this little pain.

134
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,120
Self-harm

135
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,780
is absolutely unacceptable.

136
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,840
I'd better call and ask.

137
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,560
Hello,

138
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,360
Shen Yifan.

139
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,680
Where are you now?

140
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,320
I...

141
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,760
I'm in my room at the film set.

142
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,640
Wait for me.

143
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,970
I'll be right there.

144
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,200
I knew it.

145
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,820
He would definitely come.

146
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,200
You're here.

147
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,480
Come here.

148
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,650
What kind of person are you?

149
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,720
I'm injured

150
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,320
and you won't even help me up.

151
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,180
I guess I'll walk over by myself then.

152
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,520
You haven't been to the set for days.

153
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,940
Why did you come today?

154
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,850
Didn't you say you were injured

155
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,410
and asked me to come see you?

156
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,600
Yes.

157
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,920
I'm injured. It really hurts.

158
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,140
Someone who's injured wouldn't be wearing high heels.

159
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,450
What do you want from me?

160
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,080
Nothing.

161
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,120
I just haven't seen you for days

162
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,580
and I miss you a little.

163
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,960
At the film festival opening ceremony,

164
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,400
I made myself very clear.

165
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,920
I know.

166
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,360
Your position

167
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,400
is perfectly clear to me.

168
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,920
But,

169
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,400
just as I can't

170
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,040
force you to like me,

171
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,880
you can't stop me from liking you either.

172
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,200
I think you're doing the right thing.

173
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,760
Just keep going like this.

174
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,560
If you persist a little longer,

175
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,080
you'll complete your plan

176
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,280
and we can leave.

177
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,760
What if I can't hold on anymore?

178
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,690
I find that the harder I try,

179
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,300
the more I can't let her go.

180
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,480
I truly like you.

181
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,560
You may be perfect,

182
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,400
but I'm pretty great too.

183
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,840
So,

184
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,560
you really need to think about this carefully.

185
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,220
What if you end up missing out on someone like me,

186
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,560
who's smart and beautiful?

187
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,360
You won't even have a chance to regret it later.

188
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,480
I don't want to have regrets.

189
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,620
I don't want to miss out on her.

190
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,610
I want to throw caution to the wind just this once.

191
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,800
Since you're being so stubborn,

192
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,340
then I'll... listen to me.

193
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,840
So no matter what,

194
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,970
I can't stop you from liking me, right?

195
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,720
Fine.

196
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,440
Then listen to me.

197
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,440
I'm willing to use all my resources to build you up.

198
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,160
And I'm in a hurry to make you famous

199
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,560
because I have a congenital heart disease.

200
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,360
Before long,

201
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,440
I'll be dead.

202
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,980
Are you scared now?

203
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,560
This is who I am.

204
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,570
Do you still like me?

205
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,000
Do you dare to like me now?

206
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,480
After all this nonsense,

207
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,880
I'm getting hungry.

208
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,250
Want to go get something to eat?

209
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,840
He's sick

210
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,970
with only a few months left to live.

211
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,320
Shen Yifan,

212
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,680
how dare you make up such a lie!

213
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,880
[Yan A·222U5]

214
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,880
Do you think you're a screenwriter making up stories?

215
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,440
Even if you were writing fiction,

216
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,000
I haven't seen such

217
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,930
clichéd plots in nearly ten years.

218
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,080
Shen Yifan,

219
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,280
you big liar!

220
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,520
Liar!

221
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,440
How's that investigation I asked you to do?

222
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,240
About Shen Yifan you asked me to look into,

223
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,080
he's practically a legend in the investment world.

224
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,080
I heard he was a child prodigy,

225
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,960
with an extremely high IQ.

226
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,720
Mr. Zhou,

227
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,400
let's skip these details about Mr. Shen.

228
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,320
Focus on other aspects.

229
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,160
Other aspects?

230
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,960
Like any weaknesses, for example.

231
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,120
There aren't any.

232
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,080
There must be.

233
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,840
Keep digging.

234
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,560
That 'Drunken Jade Mountain' project,

235
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,960
the writing team we found is quite efficient.

236
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,160
I didn't expect them to deliver the adaptation plan so quickly.

237
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,400
Send it to Yiping Sunshine for approval as soon as possible,

238
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,440
then keep an eye on the writing team

239
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,720
to produce an outline quickly.

240
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,920
No problem.

241
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,520
If things continue to go this smoothly,

242
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,040
I believe it won't be long

243
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,440
before we see the script

244
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,560
and start filming.

245
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,200
In that case,

246
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,060
we'll be one big step closer to completing our plan.

247
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,920
There are too many unpredictable factors.

248
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,520
Let's push forward quickly.

249
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,300
How's the variety show coming along?

250
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,200
Why would anyone ship us together?

251
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,720
A couple pairing can be unpopular,

252
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,520
but this is just bizarre.

253
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,240
Director,

254
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,760
this is truly a heaven-sent opportunity.

255
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,359
Look.

256
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,079
If we can capture more footage

257
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,760
of their interactions,

258
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,359
we'll have our trending topic.

259
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,319
With a hot topic,

260
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,319
our show's popularity

261
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,250
will skyrocket.

262
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,839
Mr. Shen clearly stated

263
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,480
not to hype up romantic relationships.

264
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,880
We just won't do it openly, problem solved.

265
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,440
What if they really shoot it this way?

266
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,599
What will we do?

267
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,000
Now, you two need to figure out a way

268
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,800
to eat the peanuts in your plates.

269
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,330
Both of you need to eat them.

270
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,520
Look.

271
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,320
I got it! I ate it!

272
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,520
Yuchen,

273
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,480
Zhengying seems a bit cold now.

274
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,600
Shouldn't you take off your jacket

275
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,600
and give it to her?

276
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,720
I'm not cold at all.

277
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,200
I'm actually very hot.

278
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,600
Alright, alright.

279
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,680
That's a wrap!

280
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,240
Let me ask you something.

281
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,840
If a man tells you

282
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,440
that he has a serious illness,

283
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,570
what does that mean?

284
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,360
He's a jerk.

285
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,160
No.

286
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,420
Then he's a player.

287
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,400
When a man wants to leave a woman

288
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,600
but doesn't want to say he doesn't like her anymore,

289
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,920
he often uses three excuses.

290
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,120
Family disapproval.

291
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,240
Business failure.

292
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:04,960
And

293
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,120
having cancer.

294
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:06,920
So,

295
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,660
you also think he's lying?

296
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,320
If I encounter this situation,

297
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,960
what should I do?

298
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,360
Just like what we did today,

299
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,720
quietly expose his lies.

300
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,570
Could the information online be inaccurate?

301
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,800
Come in.

302
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,280
Hello, doctor.

303
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,080
What seems to be the problem?

304
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,680
I'm not sick.

305
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,120
I'm just here to ask something for someone else.

306
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,480
Regarding the feedback on the adaptation proposal.

307
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,920
That's all I have for now.

308
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,680
Please make these revisions when you get back.

309
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,520
If he really has heart disease,

310
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,880
he should be taking some medication for it, right?

311
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,760
I knew it.

312
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,520
Heart disease? Yeah, right.

313
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,120
He's definitely lying to me.

314
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,680
Doctor, what else?

315
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,760
If a person's neck

316
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,800
has a visible vein running from the collarbone

317
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,200
up toward the earlobe,

318
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,420
about as thick as a little finger,

319
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,640
it could indicate right heart failure.

320
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,740
What exactly are you trying to do?

321
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,560
My neck doesn't feel right.

322
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,420
I think I slept on it wrong.

323
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,400
That neck.

324
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,360
Some heart disease patients

325
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,760
may develop enlargement

326
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,220
of their fingers and toes,

327
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,600
with nails that bulge like drumsticks.

328
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,520
I've been learning the I Ching from Wan Yuchen lately.

329
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,650
I can read palms now.

330
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,920
Want me to read yours?

331
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,220
Great, you agreed.

332
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,440
Is this palm reading

333
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,440
or are you just taking advantage of me?

334
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,370
I'm definitely taking advantage.

335
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,400
Of course I'm reading your palm.

336
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,240
All done.

337
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,220
Nothing wrong.

338
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,520
You still haven't told me

339
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,890
why you've really come back this time.

340
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,900
What could I possibly be up to?

341
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,480
What kind of trouble were you expecting?

342
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,320
Well,

343
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,380
if there's nothing else, I'll head back to the film set.

344
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:45,720
Hello?

345
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,960
Yes, it's me.

346
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,920
The production team.

347
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,160
I knew he wasn't really sick.

348
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
Seriously.

349
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,960
Then why did he lie to me?

350
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,280
Mr. Cheng.

351
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,400
What is it?

352
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,240
Zheng Ying.

353
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,720
I regret to tell you some bad news.

354
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,320
Your boss, Shen Yifan,

355
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,240
has a serious heart condition.

356
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,320
I don't think he's right for you.

357
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,920
What?

358
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,960
To make me believe he's really sick,

359
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,200
now you're also lying to me with him.

360
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:36,840
Hey.

361
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,560
If I want to stay by her side,

362
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,290
I need to figure something out.

363
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,480
Linda.

364
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,080
Mr. Cheng, what is it?

365
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,200
Notify the home gym

366
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,520
I'm starting to work out today.

367
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,410
Have the trainer ready.

368
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,720
Go ahead.

369
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,260
Zheng Ying.

370
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:07,960
You left the production team

371
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,240
without notifying Yu Youyi or me,

372
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,480
on your own.

373
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,960
And the production team called saying

374
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,080
you're not following the script at all.

375
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,640
Why?

376
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,560
Because I hate lying

377
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,820
and I hate being lied to even more.

378
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,240
What was my purpose in taking this show?

379
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,160
Wasn't it to distinguish myself from being just an actress

380
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,520
and show my true self?

381
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,560
You're too naive.

382
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,200
No reality show

383
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,760
can be completely authentic.

384
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,720
And no one

385
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,640
can be completely themselves

386
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,880
in front of cameras.

387
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,360
Fans can edit and ship however they want,

388
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,640
that's their freedom.

389
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,680
But I absolutely will not

390
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,080
cater to some show effect

391
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,800
by deliberately misleading them.

392
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,400
After all,

393
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,880
fake is fake,

394
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,340
and lies will always be exposed eventually.

395
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,900
I know everything now,

396
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,280
so you don't need to deceive me

397
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,040
by pretending to be a heart patient

398
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,480
and getting others to help you lie to me.

399
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,340
Is it really that serious?

400
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,040
Shen Yifan, I just want to ask you,

401
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,100
why did you lie to me about being sick?

402
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,920
What was the real reason?

403
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,120
Shen Yifan.

404
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,880
You never liked me,

405
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,280
did you?

406
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,760
Shen Yifan.

407
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,920
Wasn't there even one moment when you had feelings for me?

408
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,040
Just say there was.

409
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,880
No.

410
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,480
How is that possible?

411
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,320
You clearly...

412
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:41,980
Zheng Ying,

413
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,050
I've never had romantic feelings for you.

414
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,920
I never, never,

415
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,640
never liked you that way.

416
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,000
If my feelings

417
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,100
make you this uncomfortable,

418
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,930
then I'd rather give up.

419
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,320
I was wrong before.

420
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,840
I shouldn't have kept pursuing you

421
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,930
after you clearly rejected me.

422
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,680
From now on,

423
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:27,920
we'll just be

424
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,250
in a normal boss-employee relationship.

425
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,360
I won't cross the line again.

426
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,320
But I should warn you,

427
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,960
I won't be able

428
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,420
to get over my feelings for you that quickly.

429
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,280
So,

430
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,680
I might still get drunk

431
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,010
and call you sometimes.

432
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,370
Just do what you did before -

433
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,040
ignore me completely.

434
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,000
Or be kind enough

435
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,240
to call Yu Youyi to pick me up.
