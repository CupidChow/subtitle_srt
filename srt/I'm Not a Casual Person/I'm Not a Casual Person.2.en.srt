1
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,280
Brother Youyi,

2
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,600
you're building me up just to let me down.

3
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,880
This group looks good.

4
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,520
Who are the main actors?

5
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,120
They have quite a following.

6
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,479
I forgot to tell you.

7
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,520
The female lead in this show

8
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,250
is Chen Qing.

9
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,820
Brother Youyi,

10
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,570
are you messing with me?

11
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,080
How could I?

12
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,120
She just stole your boyfriend, that's all.

13
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,520
So you won't act with her?

14
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,120
Can't you show some professional integrity as an actress?

15
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,920
Still eating?

16
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,560
I can act with her.

17
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,040
As long as I don't see you-know-who.

18
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,240
I forgot to tell you

19
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,440
the male lead in this show

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,079
is that guy.

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,800
Ugh!

22
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,240
What kind of world is this?

23
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,240
He even managed to get the lead role.

24
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,120
Wait a minute.

25
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,760
My ex-boyfriend is the male lead,

26
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,440
that homewrecker is the female lead,

27
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,280
and you want me to play the supporting role for them?

28
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,320
Yu Youyi,

29
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,520
and you still claim you're not messing with me?

30
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,440
Alright, alright.

31
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,520
Learn from your big brother here.

32
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,880
Be flexible.

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,880
Don't cause trouble.

34
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,080
I'll make it up to you.

35
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,800
Yu Youyi.

36
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,680
Mr. Shen.

37
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,120
We followed her all the way to the film set to help her.

38
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,450
Is it really necessary?

39
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,210
The information in her profile

40
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,480
is visible to us.

41
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,079
Which means

42
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,160
there's a lot more I can't see.

43
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,600
When we don't have equal access to information,

44
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,640
we shouldn't act rashly on our own.

45
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,880
We need to wait for her to reveal

46
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,140
what she really wants.

47
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,020
What I need to accomplish,

48
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,380
I will definitely achieve it.

49
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,840
Xiaoying.

50
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,960
Don't you recognize me?

51
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,040
I must have been blind

52
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,120
to ever know you.

53
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,360
How could I forget?

54
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,680
Xiaoying!

55
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,210
Long time no see.

56
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,400
Still so mischievous.

57
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,220
I'm not just mischievous,

58
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,560
I want to skin you alive.

59
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,040
Xiaoying,

60
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,380
don't be like this.

61
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,880
We're still good friends, right?

62
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,560
They say dogs are man's best friends,

63
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,080
but I wonder if a scumbag counts as a dog.

64
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,240
Zheng Ying.

65
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,760
You've been broken up for so long,

66
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,090
yet you still can't get over our Gong Jing.

67
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,600
Take a good look at yourself.

68
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,460
Are you worthy?

69
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,080
You two are the perfect match in the world.

70
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,000
You need to lock it down.

71
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,280
I'm the one who got you this role.

72
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,420
Be careful or I'll have you kicked off this production.

73
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,680
Whatever your intentions are,

74
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,760
I will finish filming properly.

75
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,100
Have you

76
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,160
talked to the front desk?

77
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,560
Your room is at the far end.

78
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,480
It's a suite.

79
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,240
Which floor are the actors staying on?

80
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,240
The lead actors are in the suite next door.

81
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,320
The other main cast

82
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,280
are on the 7th and 8th floors in the inner rooms.

83
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,410
It's quieter there.

84
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,700
What about her?

85
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,480
Yu Youyi.

86
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,159
So this is the great job you arranged for me.

87
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,159
Hello.

88
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,650
Are you Miss Zheng Ying?

89
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,000
Please.

90
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,560
You...

91
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,240
Are you sure?

92
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,680
Absolutely certain.

93
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,680
Did the production team approve this?

94
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,560
I hope I won't end up

95
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,040
paying for this myself.

96
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,240
Please don't worry.

97
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,720
This is the hotel's compensation

98
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,040
for the improper room arrangement.

99
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,040
It has nothing to do with the production team.

100
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,160
Enjoy your stay.

101
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,480
You too.

102
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,210
Well played, Chen Qing.

103
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,100
No wonder they asked me to play this role.

104
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,400
Very well.

105
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,720
You've successfully fired up my fighting spirit.

106
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,640
She rejected the role we offered her before.

107
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,240
She refused the factory too.

108
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,770
Mr. Shen.

109
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,120
Your wisdom in

110
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,080
adjusting the strategy timely is impressive.

111
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,840
By helping her secretly like this,

112
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,370
she's finally accepted it.

113
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,720
So now,

114
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,440
does this mean our plan is complete

115
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,440
and we can go home?

116
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,650
Whatever your intentions are,

117
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,800
I'll finish filming properly.

118
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:33,920
No.

119
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,170
I need to continue supporting her.

120
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,320
At the very least,

121
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,480
I want to ensure she completes this film smoothly.

122
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,040
Sir,

123
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,320
try some of these.

124
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,360
Thank you. It's nothing.

125
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,640
Director,

126
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,280
please try these.

127
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,800
I made them myself.

128
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,520
Really?

129
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,760
They're delicious.

130
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,480
Alright.

131
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,800
Try some.

132
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,880
Thanks.

133
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,280
How pathetic.

134
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,000
Everyone!

135
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,720
Ms. Chen Qing is treating everyone to macarons.

136
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,180
Please come and get yours.

137
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,040
Great.

138
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,680
There's one for everyone.

139
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,480
Thank you, Ms. Chen.

140
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,200
Thank you, Ms. Chen.

141
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,760
Things that don't belong to you,

142
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,520
you can admire them privately,

143
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,200
but don't actually think you deserve them.

144
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,520
Take it.

145
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,740
Whatever you get to eat

146
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,260
is only because I allow it.

147
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,760
Chen Qing's uncle is Xu Zhiyou,

148
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,640
the owner of Dashanren Media

149
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,650
and the main investor of this show.

150
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,280
If Zheng Ying wants to finish filming smoothly,

151
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,920
she'll have to put up with it.

152
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,140
While I'm here,

153
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,880
she doesn't need to tolerate anything.

154
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,640
Oh, how did it accidentally fall on the floor

155
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,960
and become trash?

156
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,360
You.

157
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,960
Oh, right.

158
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,400
Ms. Chen seems to love picking up trash.

159
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,920
Why don't you pick it up

160
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,050
and enjoy it slowly?

161
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,400
Hello?

162
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,080
Mr. Du,

163
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,280
our boss Shen

164
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,640
wants you to deliver 100 sets of skincare products to the film crew.

165
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,840
In Zheng Ying's name.

166
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,640
Remember,

167
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,300
it's in Zheng Ying's name.

168
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,480
Let's go.

169
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,320
This couldn't be Shen Yifan's car, could it?

170
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,480
[Quiet on set]

171
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,880
He wouldn't follow me here, would he?

172
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,360
Senior.

173
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,360
Hello, senior.

174
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,480
My name is Wan Yuchen.

175
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,800
I'm 22 years old.

176
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,610
I'm currently studying at Nanying Film Academy.

177
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,320
Anyway,

178
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,580
I hope you'll look after me in the future.

179
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,000
He's really

180
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,880
handsome and polite.

181
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,090
You too, senior.

182
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,900
You're gentle and beautiful.

183
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,560
What brings you here?

184
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,720
I heard you gave everyone in the team a set of implants.

185
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,880
I came to thank you.

186
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,080
Hello?

187
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,960
I came to visit you on set.

188
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,040
I'm in your room now.

189
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,200
Brother, you could have just come,

190
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,160
but why did you actually give everyone in our crew

191
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,760
a set of skincare products?

192
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,200
And under my name too.

193
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,680
No.

194
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,420
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't afford it.

195
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,760
Then who could it be?

196
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,760
Could it be...

197
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,850
Could it possibly be...

198
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,720
Shen Yifan?

199
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,360
I must be seeing things.

200
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,320
How could I possibly see him here?

201
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,000
First he changed your room,

202
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,240
then used your name

203
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,170
to send all those gifts to the crew.

204
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,560
What is he trying to do?

205
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,600
You know what,

206
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,280
his approach of quietly contributing

207
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,200
is actually more touching than his domineering tactics

208
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,260
from the other day.

209
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,320
So you're touched?

210
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,720
I wouldn't dare be moved.

211
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,360
I haven't even touched the skincare products.

212
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,880
Shen Yifan, oh Shen Yifan.

213
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,560
We've only met a few times.

214
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,360
Do you really need to like me that much?

215
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,480
It's so frustrating.

216
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,480
Why don't we just run away?

217
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,040
We have experience with that anyway.

218
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,880
No, no.

219
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,320
He chases, I flee.

220
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,520
I can't escape even if I grew wings.

221
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,720
Can you be serious?

222
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,160
This is no time for jokes.

223
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,600
What I mean is,

224
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,660
running away isn't the solution.

225
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,480
Based on our current situation,

226
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,680
we can only face the challenge head-on.

227
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,320
Miss Zheng, are you here today

228
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,440
to reject me again?

229
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,600
Although rejecting someone

230
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,560
as excellent and perfect as you breaks my heart,

231
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,480
I must.

232
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,760
But Mr. Shen,

233
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,000
one shouldn't accept rewards they haven't earned.

234
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,960
So I'm sorry,

235
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,730
I can't accept this.

236
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,840
I refuse to play by those unspoken rules,

237
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,570
no matter how handsome you are.

238
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,600
These things

239
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,120
are indeed a bit embarrassing to offer.

240
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,880
Miss Zheng,

241
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,080
if you have any concerns,

242
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,700
you can tell me in advance.

243
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,160
We can completely avoid

244
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,820
these unnecessary troubles.

245
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,560
How much clearer do I need to be?

246
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,600
You're

247
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,600
a high and mighty boss,

248
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,440
and I'm just a struggling small-time actress.

249
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,640
The two of us

250
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,560
simply don't belong in the same world.

251
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,620
Do you understand?

252
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,520
Indeed,

253
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,640
between the two of us,

254
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
we truly aren't from the same world.

255
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,880
But between us,

256
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,810
there was once a small connection.

257
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,040
So you can certainly accept my gesture.

258
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,530
Because what you did

259
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,330
completely deserves all this.

260
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,680
I went there to reject him!

261
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,280
Why is it that when I see his face...

262
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,800
It must be because after Gong Jing cheated on me,

263
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,730
I started to doubt myself a little,

264
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,420
feeling I wasn't good enough.

265
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,880
After what he said to me today,

266
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,760
I'm actually quite touched.

267
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,760
Before,

268
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,060
you rejected him over and over again.

269
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,560
It can't be just because of this.

270
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,600
And before that,

271
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,560
you hit him when you were acting together.

272
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,000
He's not a masochist.

273
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,560
And even before that,

274
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,160
you...

275
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,440
I get it.

276
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,360
I knew there was something familiar about him.

277
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,200
I always thought

278
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,560
he was just an investor who liked what he saw.

279
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,240
But actually,

280
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,480
he's a pure-hearted boy who was saved by my beauty

281
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,000
and now wants to repay the favor.

282
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,440
That's possible.

283
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,880
What 'beauty saving a hero'?

284
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,740
How come I never heard about this?

285
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,900
Why does she always reject me?

286
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,010
But it doesn't matter anymore.

287
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,480
What I need to ensure now

288
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,080
is that she finishes filming this movie smoothly.

289
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,010
Everything else

290
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,080
has nothing to do with me.

291
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,080
Stop!

292
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,640
Look, Zheng Ying,

293
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,560
can you stop acting so affected?

294
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,680
The way you're swaying,

295
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,080
everyone around wants to punch you.

296
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,280
I'm sorry, director.

297
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,680
I'll do better.

298
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,280
Stop!

299
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,400
Stop!

300
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,080
Stop!

301
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,360
Gong Jing, what are you laughing at?

302
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,160
I'll punch you if you don't stop.

303
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,640
Stop!

304
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,210
What are you acting?

305
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,680
Director.

306
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,440
Let's do this.

307
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,770
I'll rehearse with her.

308
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,200
Give us some time, okay?

309
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,480
Fine. Make it quick.

310
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,400
Xiaoying, it hurts, Xiaoying.

311
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,880
I'm warning you.

312
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,600
Don't call me Xiaoying again.

313
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,920
Alright, Xiaoying.

314
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,160
Be gentle, please.

315
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,960
Don't play the victim with me.

316
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,160
You think I still care about you?

317
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,420
Let me tell you, Gong Jing.

318
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,320
Just focus on acting from now on.

319
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,600
If you ever look at me again

320
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,160
with those sneaky eyes of yours,

321
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,320
I'll poke them out.

322
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,840
Even after breaking up, you're still trying to hook up with him.

323
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,560
I think you're taking your supporting role way too seriously.

324
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,220
Zheng Ying.

325
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,800
I thought

326
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,200
she came to learn acting skills from me.

327
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,480
I didn't expect this.

328
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,160
You know,

329
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,800
when it comes to acting,

330
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,200
she's always admired me.

331
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,400
My acting is poor.

332
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,020
But my temper is worse.

333
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,060
Want to test it?

334
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,080
I find you two quite amusing every day.

335
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,920
Putting on a little soap opera for me, aren't you?

336
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,560
Chen Qing.

337
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,280
You're just relying on your uncle

338
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,760
to act all high and mighty every day.

339
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,960
What's so great about that?

340
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,560
I can get those roles because of my uncle.

341
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,760
My family background is my talent, so what?

342
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,400
Darling, let's go.

343
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,000
Mr. Shen

344
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,200
Are you okay?

345
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,840
Ask the crew how much this costs.

346
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,620
Send the bill to her agent.

347
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,440
It's such a small matter.

348
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,160
No need to trouble my agent.

349
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,040
I'll pay for it myself.

350
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,640
I forgot my phone.

351
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,800
How embarrassing.

352
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,530
What's this?

353
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,360
Dried durian.

354
00:17:59,360 --> 00:17:59,960
Is it good?

355
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,520
It's delicious. Really good.

356
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,450
I made it myself.

357
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,720
Try some.

358
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,140
Then let's use this as compensation.

359
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,280
You said it yourself.

360
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,240
A promise is a promise.

361
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,560
I'll painfully part with this snack as compensation.

362
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,160
About the board I kicked and damaged,

363
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,800
please don't tell my agent.

364
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,580
I'll be forever grateful for your kindness.

365
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,210
Go negotiate with the crew.

366
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,260
Young Mr. Shen,

367
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,400
this snack from Zheng Ying

368
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,860
doesn't look quite right.

369
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,840
Mr. Shen Senior told you not to eat random food.

370
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,810
It's not bad.

371
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,800
What kind of lousy production is this?

372
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,400
Not a single normal person here.

373
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,260
Let me tell you,

374
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,320
the male lead is so effeminate.

375
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,920
And this female lead throws tantrums all the time,

376
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,760
like she's some royal concubine making a grand exit.

377
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,680
The worst of all

378
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,200
is that second female lead.

379
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,400
Yes, Zheng Ying.

380
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,760
No idea what her background is.

381
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,160
Looks-wise, she's a 9 out of 10.

382
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,800
Her IQ seems to be above 90 too.

383
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,800
But she just can't memorize

384
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,520
a single line with more than nine words.

385
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,680
However,

386
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,560
she does have one strength.

387
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,200
Consistency.

388
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,080
I mean,

389
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,240
in seduction scenes, she's completely expressionless.

390
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,320
In romantic scenes, expressionless.

391
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,800
In scheming scenes,

392
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,680
still expressionless.

393
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,440
And I, with my professional training,

394
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,900
have to put on a brave face with her every day.

395
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,540
I'm just so done with this.

396
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,960
I have something to do. Let's talk later.

397
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,000
Hello,

398
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,040
senior.

399
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,240
When did you get here?

400
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,760
Since you said

401
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,240
that the second female lead was the most troublesome.

402
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,240
Well,

403
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,560
look, senior.

404
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,320
You have a full forehead,

405
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,640
prominent nose bridge but not excessively so.

406
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,300
This is definitely the face of someone blessed with good fortune.

407
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,880
You just said more than nine words,

408
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,000
so I can't remember all that.

409
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,120
Senior.

410
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,240
You appear so peaceful in public,

411
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,840
but behind the scenes, you're trying to stab others in the back.

412
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,370
That really leaves quite an impression on me.

413
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,170
I'll reluctantly compensate you for the snacks,

414
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,200
but about the board I kicked and broke,

415
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,200
please don't tell my agent about it.

416
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,740
I'll be forever grateful for your kindness.

417
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,840
Set gossip,

418
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,040
51 items,

419
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,260
guaranteed fresh.

420
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,680
What are you trying to do?

421
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,640
What I want to do

422
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,040
depends on what you want to do, senior.

423
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,480
If you don't want to do anything,

424
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,000
then I don't want to do anything either.

425
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,240
Let's not do anything

426
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,200
and work together for a peaceful and harmonious film set.

427
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,420
How about that?

428
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,560
That's exactly what I was thinking.

429
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,490
Then it's a deal.

430
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:04,880
Mr. Shen.

431
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,050
Don't you think this film crew is quite interesting?

432
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,540
You can't buy unusual snacks.

433
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,400
Why don't you try normal ones?

434
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,160
Keep trying.

435
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,320
Director.

436
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,120
These new script changes...

437
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,400
Aren't they a bit ridiculous?

438
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,250
Did the screenwriter make these changes?

439
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,400
Xiaoying.

440
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,480
I understand.

441
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:34,880
This screenwriter...

442
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,200
Has taken all the negative traits

443
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,640
that people can and cannot imagine

444
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,770
and written them into your character.

445
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,600
If nothing unexpected happens,

446
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,920
once this show airs,

447
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,640
I'll be drowned in viewers' criticism

448
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,320
because of this extremely bizarre character.

449
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,440
I don't want to portray you like this either,

450
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,570
but what can I do when her uncle is rich?

451
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,140
What's wrong, Zheng Ying?

452
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,240
We are all professional actors here.

453
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,300
How can you complain about your role?

454
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,240
Is this really necessary for the character?

455
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,240
Chen Qing, aren't you going too far?

456
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,480
Besides, how can actors change the script as they please?

457
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,480
Well, I can.

458
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,720
Let me tell you something.

459
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,920
I can not only change the script,

460
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,320
but I can also cut scenes.

461
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,320
Director.

462
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,760
I've changed my mind.

463
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,920
I want all her scenes deleted.

464
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,560
I want her to leave right now,

465
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,820
get out of this production immediately.

466
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,440
I think

467
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,220
the one who should get out of this crew

468
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,200
is you.

469
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,720
Why are you here?

470
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,130
If I didn't come,

471
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,460
wouldn't you be bullied to death?

472
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,120
Director,

473
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,820
continue shooting

474
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,700
with the original script.

475
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,800
Mr. Shen, this is my own business.

476
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,660
Young Mr. Shen.

477
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,200
You don't seem to understand.

478
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,600
Changing the script

479
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,600
is something only investors can do.

480
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,600
How much did Chen Qing's uncle invest?

481
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,600
About one-third.

482
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,250
Find an opportunity

483
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,120
to establish a connection with Xu Zhiyou.

484
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:12,760
Mr. Shen,

485
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,640
what do you want with him?

486
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,320
He bullied my people,

487
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,160
interfered with my business,

488
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,960
so of course I need to have a talk with him.

489
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,890
Talk about life,

490
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,260
talk about dreams.

491
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,860
The current investor of this show

492
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,920
is me.

493
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,720
Mr. Shen.

494
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,400
Don't think you can do whatever you want just because you invested some money.

495
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,860
Your attitude toward me isn't appropriate.

496
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,340
Don't you want to work with my uncle anymore?

497
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,720
You can call your uncle

498
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,340
and ask him.

499
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,400
If I treat his niece with this attitude,

500
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,450
would he still want to work with me?

501
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,880
So handsome!

502
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,280
Is this a knight in shining armor scene?

503
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,600
No wonder Zheng Ying gets such good treatment on set.

504
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,560
Fresh gossip coming soon, guaranteed juicy.

505
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,520
80.

506
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,090
Shen Yifan, let go of me.

507
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,440
You're angry.

508
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,280
What else?

509
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,040
I told you not to say anything,

510
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,570
so why did you still do that?

511
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,340
If I hadn't helped you,

512
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,000
you would've been kicked out of the production by now, you know that?

513
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,400
I don't need your help.

514
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,280
Besides, what's the worst that could happen?

515
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,810
I'd just leave, that's all.

516
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,960
Do you really care so little about your career?

517
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,000
I do care,

518
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,680
but that's my business,

519
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,610
what does it have to do with you?

520
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,760
Asking for my help now

521
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,080
is your best option.

522
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,720
Zheng Ying, let me tell you,

523
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,360
capable

524
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,000
and insightful people

525
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,440
know how to utilize all resources around them.

526
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,960
They know how to maximize the benefits of resources

527
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,160
and achieve their greatest potential.

528
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,000
Shen Yifan, let me tell you something too.

529
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,200
I don't need you meddling in my affairs,

530
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,930
and I don't want any involvement with you.

531
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,680
I was just playing a villain role,

532
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,000
and I was fine with that.

533
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,880
But now?

534
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,400
Everyone thinks I'm just riding on someone's coattails.

535
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
Is this the result you wanted to see?

536
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,840
Are you trying to ruin me?

537
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,800
Of course not.

538
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,920
I just want what's best for you.

539
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,880
Then please take back your kindness

540
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,480
and stop interfering in other people's lives on your own accord.

541
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,540
If I hadn't helped you,

542
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,240
you would've been kicked out of the crew by now, you know that?

543
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,800
But that's my own business.

544
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,650
What does it have to do with you?

545
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,760
Was I being too harsh?

546
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,600
But now,

547
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,200
everyone thinks I'm just riding on your coattails.

548
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,860
Is this what you wanted to see?

549
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,600
Are you trying to ruin me?

550
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,000
Ungrateful.

551
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,840
Busybody.

552
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,400
Senior.

553
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,570
What's going on?

554
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,480
It's all because of our female lead from Gray Love,

555
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,280
the all-powerful Chen Qing.

556
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,480
She insisted the director organize this fan visit day

557
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,240
and invited a bunch of media.

558
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,400
I bet she's planning a livestream

559
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,080
to promote our project in advance.

560
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,080
She doesn't show up for major scenes or important shots.

561
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,400
Today the male lead isn't even here,

562
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,200
and it's just scenes with her and me.

563
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,320
What kind of promotion is this?

564
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,040
What's the point of this visit?

565
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,570
Let's go.

566
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,640
Isn't this the person who bullied our sister?

567
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,240
With us here,

568
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,560
no one can bully our Qingqing.

569
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,220
That's her.

570
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,500
Aren't you scared?

571
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,640
Their looks could kill.

572
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,680
What's there to be afraid of?

573
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,210
If looks could really kill,

574
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,970
then all my years of martial arts training would be for nothing.

575
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,240
Mr. Shen.

576
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,680
She's so ungrateful,

577
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,360
why should we help her anymore?

578
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,840
That list is 99% complete,

579
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,170
it's practically done.

580
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,560
Nothing in this world is 100% perfect.

581
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,840
For me,

582
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,480
life must be 100% perfect.

583
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,920
Time has limits,

584
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,000
but perfection doesn't.

585
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,360
Something's fishy about Chen Qing's situation.

586
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,840
Let's help her solve it quickly,

587
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,240
the sooner we finish, the sooner we go home.

588
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,280
I just want what's best for you.

589
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,000
Then please take back your kindness,

590
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,200
stop meddling in other people's lives on your own accord.

591
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,060
Don't be so presumptuous.

592
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,200
What are you doing here?

593
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,440
I'm here to tell you

594
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,020
that I regret letting you join this team.

595
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,480
It seems

596
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,290
I've made things too comfortable for you.

597
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,080
Director.

598
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,900
She's threatening me, isn't she?

599
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,560
This plot

600
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,560
is even more melodramatic than the show we're filming.

601
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,240
I suggest you be careful.

602
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,040
It's not the thief who steals that's worrying, but the one who keeps eyeing your stuff.

603
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,780
Why did you ask me to come here?

604
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,680
Whose is it?

605
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,320
It's been 7 months.

606
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,960
I didn't want to have a baby either,

607
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,000
but since someone couldn't get pregnant,

608
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,560
I had to be generous and have one for you.

609
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,240
What exactly do you want?

610
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,640
Do you know why I hate you so much

611
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,100
and still cast you as the second female lead?

612
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,440
You're being salty.

613
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,440
Because I'm not only going to steal your boyfriend,

614
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,040
but also make you completely leave the entertainment industry.
