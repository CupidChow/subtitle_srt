1
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,600
I want to see

2
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,800
what new insults people have today.

3
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,400
I watched your video

4
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,930
and I'm here to support you.

5
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,960
Stay true to yourself, protect yourself, and don't be afraid!

6
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,800
Beautiful, cute, and with good values, though not yet famous.

7
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,080
I'm here to apologize to you.

8
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,320
I insulted you before.

9
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,040
You have such good values.

10
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,920
You're absolutely right.

11
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,720
Just a random viewer who found you from your video.

12
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,759
I'll follow you from now on.

13
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,560
Keep going!

14
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,040
Those who spread those photos will be punished.

15
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,120
Stay true to yourself, protect yourself, and don't be afraid.

16
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,200
Take more photos in the future to annoy them.

17
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,000
Keep it up!

18
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,180
You have a great figure, you're beautiful and cute,

19
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,840
and have good values despite not being famous yet.

20
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,240
Following you!

21
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,820
What delicious food are you having tonight?

22
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,120
I...

23
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,210
I've gained so many followers.

24
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,280
Mr. Shen,

25
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,280
aren't you worried

26
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,079
With your fame

27
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,960
she might take advantage of your good reputation?

28
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,600
She could tell everyone

29
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,280
that she's your woman

30
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,010
and use you as a stepping stone.

31
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,200
This Chen Qing is really ridiculous.

32
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,160
She even dares to speak so boldly to you.

33
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,490
Now that Xu Zhiyou is no longer her backer,

34
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,520
she naturally needs to find a new one.

35
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,400
Too bad

36
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,600
she picked the wrong person.

37
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,330
But she did say one thing right.

38
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,700
What else could

39
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,280
make her famous overnight better than

40
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,210
claiming to be Shen Yifan's woman?

41
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,040
I'm sorry, it's not about the standards.

42
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,970
Mr. Shen never attends any events.

43
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,360
Could it be up ahead?

44
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,280
I think so. Let's go.

45
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,410
I can't believe I was recognized despite this disguise.

46
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,560
Then I'll proceed as you instructed

47
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,280
right away.

48
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,180
Come in.

49
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,120
Good morning, my golden goose.

50
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,040
According to our contract

51
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,920
This is the first batch of tribute for you.

52
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,720
Please accept it, God of Wealth.

53
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,840
This is your compensation.

54
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,000
Regarding my negative news,

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,920
hasn't it been mostly taken care of?

56
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,960
I'd like to ask about my upcoming work schedule,

57
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,280
God of Wealth.

58
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,520
We have an equal partnership.

59
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,760
From now on, don't call me

60
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,360
God of Wealth anymore.

61
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,480
Okay, Wea-

62
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,520
What should we do next?

63
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,800
A person's energy is limited.

64
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,240
A proper balance of work and rest

65
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,960
will help you with your upcoming work.

66
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,880
I've been criticized so much lately

67
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,680
for not having any roles. I've been resting for too long.

68
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,680
Besides,

69
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,280
your idea of relaxation for me

70
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,560
is just shopping and browsing stores.

71
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,100
Not just shopping,

72
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,680
but casual shopping.

73
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,960
If you don't like that,

74
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,400
we can also...

75
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,000
Who wouldn't like shopping while getting paid?

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,800
Let's go

77
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,320
and shop.

78
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,120
Is everything ready?

79
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,240
Don't worry,

80
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,600
here,

81
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,640
our people are all in position,

00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,600

[Shen Yifan takes Zheng Ying shopping]

84
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,770
Why can't I find anything I want to buy?

85
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,160
Never mind. Let's look around more.

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,200
I thought you liked all of these.

87
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,360
Why aren't you buying anything?

88
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,640
The point of window shopping isn't about buying things.

89
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,920
The focus is on browsing,

90
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,720
not buying. Got it?

[Shen Yifan takes Zheng Ying for a romantic meal]

93
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,159
We can photograph them eating,

94
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:49,320
but how do we capture the romance?

95
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,370
Are you okay, Mr. Cheng?

96
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,400
The elevator is here.

97
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,330
Come on, be careful. Let's go home.

98
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,600
Get in, get in.

99
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,600
Mr. Cheng!

100
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,880
Wait for me!

101
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:37,960
Hello?

102
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,120
Is this property management?

103
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,320
This is Cheng Moyang.

104
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,140
What's wrong with you people?

105
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,020
This is a high-end residence.

106
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,500
Not everyone should be allowed in, okay?

107
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,659
Tell the security to be more vigilant next time.

108
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,170
It's a high-end residence, yet anyone can buy in?

109
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,960
Mr. Cheng,

110
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,960
on your desk are the company's

111
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,090
recently contacted artists' photos.

112
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,640
Why are these still the same people?

113
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,920
Take a look at the one in the black qipao.

114
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,800
Her name is Zheng Ying.

115
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,730
She's just gained some popularity online recently.

116
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,039
Tonight,

117
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,960
isn't there an investment circle cocktail party?

118
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,600
Yes, they did invite us.

119
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,120
As usual, I declined right away.

120
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,120
Shen Yifan, who never attends events,

121
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,420
shows up with a female companion.

122
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,050
What would everyone think?

123
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,280
Hello, are you Miss Zheng Ying?

124
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,160
Yes, that's me.

125
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,360
Here's your package.

126
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,040
Thank you.

127
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,920
This is truly

128
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,640
an expensive-looking qipao,

129
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,700
even without checking the price tag.

130
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,280
And

131
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,080
the color

132
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,240
and style...

133
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,420
Why does it have this indescribable sense of intimacy?

134
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,440
What is Shen Yifan trying to say?

135
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,640
Mr. Shen will take you to an event tonight.

136
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,560
Get ready.

137
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,200
Could it be

138
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,400
he's finally introducing me to directors and producers?

139
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,040
Mr. Cheng,

140
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,850
the items have been delivered.

141
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,480
That's fine.

142
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,600
Among all those documents,

143
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,560
she's probably the only one who can make sense of them.

144
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,560
She probably didn't expect me to notice her,

145
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,020
let alone send her a qipao.

146
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,090
Quite a surprise, isn't it?

147
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,040
I'm here.

148
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,240
How do I look?

149
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,370
You're late.

150
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,440
It's because of this outfit you sent me.

151
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,520
It took me half an hour to squeeze into it.

152
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,810
I just realized I forgot to touch up my makeup.

153
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,130
Good thing I brought it with me.

154
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,400
You can read those documents

155
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,860
with just one hand, right?

156
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,160
Then hold this for me,

157
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,690
so I can do my makeup faster.

158
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,280
Done.

159
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,320
So women

160
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
really can do makeup in a moving car.

161
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,720
Of course.

162
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,520
I couldn't do it at first either.

163
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,800
The car shakes so much

164
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,160
I couldn't hold anything steady.

165
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,480
Later, when filming, I often had to move between scenes.

166
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,040
My roles were too small for the crew to prioritize my makeup,

167
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,080
so I had to gradually train myself.

168
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,240
Now I can even

169
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,360
do my eyebrows and lipstick at the same time in a car.

170
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,360
Impressive, right?

171
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,040
Seems like these past few years haven't been easy for her.

172
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,240
But why can she always be so optimistic?

173
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,880
Mr. Cheng.

174
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,960
If the chairman knows you're really here,

175
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,320
he'll be delighted.

176
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,800
How did he end up coming here?

177
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,760
That's so rare.

178
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,080
The atmosphere today seems much livelier than before.

179
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,560
Isn't that because my presence

180
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,020
has brought glory to this humble gathering?

181
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,880
Yes, absolutely.

182
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,160
That's right.

183
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,320
Being able to see him today

184
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,760
is truly wonderful.

185
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,480
Alright then.

186
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,640
I'll give you all a chance to get to know me.

187
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,240
Yes.

188
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,400
Mr. Shen.

189
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,480
is someone who

190
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,040
you can never see on ordinary days.

191
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,520
Look at Shen Yifan, Mr. Shen,

192
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,440
a genius prodigy, a legend in the investment world.

193
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,000
Who is Mr. Shen?

194
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,240
A face more striking than any celebrity's.

195
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,840
What do they call it online?

196
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,720
Goddess Nuwa's masterpiece,

197
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,440
right?

198
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,560
But even though that's what they say,

199
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,440
does he really have no flaws at all?

200
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,760
If you want to talk about his flaws,

201
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,440
it's that he never attends business functions or socializes.

202
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,160
And

203
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,770
importantly, he's never had any rumors or gossip about him.

204
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,640
Yes.

205
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,570
Mr. Shen is here.

206
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,880
These people don't look like

207
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,720
producers or directors at all.

208
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,400
I hope there aren't any reporters around

209
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,200
who might photograph us together

210
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,480
and start some gossip.

211
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,690
Don't worry.

212
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,170
No one will take sneaky photos.

213
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,320
Mr. Shen, you never attend any events.

214
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,360
May I ask what brings you

215
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,520
here this time?

216
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,480
What?

217
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,520
Are we not

218
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,400
welcome?

219
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,520
You two?

220
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,240
Let me formally introduce you. This is Zheng Ying.

221
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,320
She's an actress.

222
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,840
May I ask what your relationship is?

223
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,280
Shen Yifan.

224
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,800
Do you enjoy playing games with me?

225
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,880
I'm not playing games with you.

226
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,000
The contract states

227
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,440
that artists have the right to know about everything.

228
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,160
Shen Yifan, I need to know

229
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,930
what exactly you're doing.

230
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,360
I'm making you famous.

231
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,120
So this is how you plan to make me famous?

232
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,200
Using my status and position to highlight you.

233
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,160
This is the best strategy to make you famous right now.

234
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,360
The best strategy?

235
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,160
You mean the fastest way.

236
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,160
I came to you because of your expertise.

237
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,960
I thought you would discover my strengths

238
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,960
and help me plan my career properly.

239
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,680
I never expected you'd use this method.

240
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,720
Anyone could do that, couldn't they?

241
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,400
I just wanted to be more efficient.

242
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,800
But let me tell you something, Shen Yifan.

243
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,200
I want to succeed through my own efforts,

244
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,760
climbing step by step,

245
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,760
not by being linked to someone in gossip

246
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,890
or getting attention through some made-up background.

247
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,320
She's wearing the clothes I gave her.

248
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,720
It fits her perfectly. She looks stunning.

249
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,600
But why is she here?

250
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,320
Did she hear I would be here

251
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,120
and came specifically to see me?

252
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,600
I...

253
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,410
What's her game?

254
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,840
Deliberately pretending to ignore me

255
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,080
to get my attention.

256
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,720
Playing hard to get.

257
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,160
She's quite the schemer.

258
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,360
Interesting.

259
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,840
Before you actually let me audition,

260
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,160
I won't cooperate.

261
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,880
All the photos taken by reporters

262
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,560
have been completely destroyed.

263
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,200
But she still won't answer her phone.

264
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,280
This is outrageous.

265
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,720
What is she trying to do?

266
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,180
She's using a strike to blackmail me.

267
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:56,960
Ridiculous.

268
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,640
How could we be blackmailed by her?

269
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,840
This standoff won't solve anything.

270
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,130
It's just wasting time.

271
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,720
We can't continue like this.

272
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,440
Mr. Shen, you're not thinking of compromising,

273
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,890
are you? That's not like you at all.

274
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,400
Maybe I shouldn't quibble with my creditor.

275
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,960
One shouldn't give up money just for dignity.

276
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,440
But I really don't want to become famous through hype.

277
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,080
I need to live up to those who support me.

278
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,920
Even though there aren't many.

279
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,720
Brother.

280
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,900
Don't say that.

281
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,080
Considering that every time I look into your eyes,

282
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,140
I always soften up.

283
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,080
Today,

284
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,180
I absolutely won't look at your eyes.

285
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,800
Alright,

286
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,800
we can officially start our conversation now.

287
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,800
About you telling the doctor to give up treatment,

288
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,520
I won't pursue this matter with you today.

289
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,400
But tell me,

290
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,960
did you sign a contract with Zheng Ying

291
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,020
to make her famous?

292
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,660
Let's go. We're almost there.

293
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,280
Ling.

294
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:17,720
It's that room.

295
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,200
I never submitted my profile for this production.

296
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,960
Besides,

297
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,320
they should contact my agent Youyi first for auditions.

298
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,600
Why are we coming here?

299
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,120
And they specifically asked me to wear these clothes.

300
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,520
With our relationship, would I ever lie to you?

301
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,720
I need to take this call. You go in first.

302
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,680
Go on now.

303
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,080
I've brought her as requested.

304
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,880
You must cast me in your next production. Bye-bye.

305
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,240
Are you trying to make her famous

306
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,280
by staying up late

307
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,600
researching the domestic film market?

308
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,130
As long as she's not famous,

309
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,600
you'll have to stay here?

310
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,400
Why?

311
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,600
Tell me why.

312
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,720
Tell me why you're helping her like this.

313
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,720
Tell me, brother.

314
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,140
Do you believe in love at first sight?

315
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,240
Come.

316
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,160
Sit here.

317
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,480
Move closer to me.

318
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,000
Who are you? Why would I move closer to you?

319
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,240
Fine.

320
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,040
I want to see what you're really up to.

321
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,200
So?

322
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,330
Do you like this outfit?

323
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,200
You gave me this qipao.

324
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,560
I know that someone who won't live long

325
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,490
doesn't deserve to have feelings.

326
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,040
But I just can't control myself.

327
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,680
Before I'm gone,

328
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,280
I want to do everything for her.

329
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,320
Before I leave,

330
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,920
I want to solve all her problems.

331
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,320
Before I'm gone...

332
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,720
Bro.

333
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,080
Mr. Shen.

334
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:13,920
Mr. Shen.

335
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,480
My poor little brother.

336
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,120
Mr. Shen.

337
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,040
Mr. Shen.

338
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,240
Young Mr. Shen.

339
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,520
Deceiving the senior Mr. Shen like this,

340
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,040
isn't that a bit wrong?

341
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,920
When you two conspired to deceive me

342
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,840
and didn't tell me he was coming,

343
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,080
why didn't you think that was wrong?

344
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,000
Hey.

345
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,720
Mr. Shen,

346
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,170
something's happened.

347
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:10,960
What?

348
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,520
Next time before hitting someone,

349
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,580
I should take off my high heels first.

350
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,450
Why are you here?

351
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,160
As a performer,

352
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,760
not only are you uncooperative with my work,

353
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,490
but now you're hitting people.

354
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,240
Why don't you ask me why I hit him?

355
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,960
Whatever the reason, you shouldn't have done that.

356
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,560
You're not cooperating with my work,

357
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,600
wasting my time,

358
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,960
and affecting my efficiency.

359
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,440
You're gambling with your own future

360
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,970
and making a joke of my time.

361
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,800
Efficiency, always efficiency.

362
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,400
Shen Yifan, let me tell you something.

363
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,840
Efficiency doesn't mean I have no principles or bottom line.

364
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,970
Efficiency doesn't mean I have to tolerate everything.

365
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,320
She caused such a big problem and still acts like

366
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,000
she's in the right. No wonder you're angry.

367
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,960
So what should we do next?

368
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,860
Let's start with what interests her.

369
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,410
That way she'll cooperate.

370
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,400
What interests her...

371
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,600
That would be acting.

372
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,520
Are we really going to use acting

373
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,200
to start from scratch, step by step?

374
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,330
When will we be able to make her famous?

375
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,520
Did you get the video?

376
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,690
This is the restaurant's surveillance footage.

377
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,440
So that's how it happened.

378
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,440
You don't need to be so moved by today's arrangements.

379
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,080
What are you doing?

380
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,440
Do you know who I am?

381
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,560
I'm warning you.

382
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,180
I'm the chairman of Yiping Sunshine Future.

383
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,490
Driving such a nice car,

384
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,760
why are you littering?

385
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,760
Don't do it again.

386
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,120
Are you sure you brought me here for an audition?

387
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,020
Where is your Mr. Shen?

388
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,560
Whether it's an audition or not,

389
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,480
just go in and see for yourself.

390
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,200
Why didn't our Mr. Shen come?

391
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,600
Don't you have any idea?

392
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,040
Hello, Director.

393
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,960
Our actress is here.

394
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,400
Good.

395
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,810
That's more like it.

396
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,200
Thank you for your hard work.

397
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,060
How's it going?

398
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,400
You know, Shen Yifan

399
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,860
has fought for so many opportunities for me.

400
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,800
Why can't I seize even one of them?

401
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,720
What? Thinking of giving up?

402
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,600
No way.

403
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,680
I'm not someone who gives up easily.

404
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,410
I just regret not being ambitious enough before.

405
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,000
Come in.

406
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,160
Hello, Director.

407
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,480
Good day, Director.

408
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:16,920
Hello.

409
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,560
Mr. Shen asked us to come see you.

410
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,720
Mr. Liang told me

411
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,440
that Mr. Shen is recommending an actress today.

412
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,280
This is a role I've reserved

413
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,760
based on the actress's image.

414
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,200
It's the second female lead.

415
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,000
A gentle and elegant lady from a good family.

416
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,440
It's quite a good character.

417
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,120
Take a look.

418
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,240
Thank you.

419
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,490
Alright, Mr. Liang.

420
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,680
I understand.

421
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,080
Mr. Shen says

422
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,920
you should audition for Lingzi's role.

423
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,640
Lingzi?

424
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,200
Isn't Lingzi just a featured role?

425
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,600
What if I hurt someone? Do I have to pay compensation?

426
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,280
Don't worry.

427
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,440
We'll be careful. You won't get hurt.

428
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,720
I'm more concerned about hurting you guys.

429
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,480
So young yet so cocky.

430
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,730
Let's see what you've got then.

431
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,240
This role requires a professional martial arts performer.

432
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,880
An ordinary person can't handle it.

433
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,400
Why did Director Shen let her audition for this role?

434
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,130
Perhaps he has a unique vision.

435
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,600
Shen Yifan asked me to try this role.

436
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,160
Did he discover my martial arts skills

437
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,320
and want me to try a different acting path?

438
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:49,840
Good.

439
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,760
Lingzi, you got the part.
