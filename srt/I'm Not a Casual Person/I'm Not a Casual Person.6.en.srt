1
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
Skinny.

2
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,640
Come on, let's go out and play.

3
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,479
Play? What's the point?

4
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,680
It's a waste of time.

5
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,160
How can playing be a waste of time?

6
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,560
I'm going to jump down to you!

7
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,560
Don't jump! You'll break your legs.

8
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,440
Here I come!

9
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,480
Next time, stand back.

10
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,840
It would be terrible if I landed on you.

11
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,800
You have no idea.

12
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,920
When I was little, I climbed over a wall

13
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,600
and fell right on top of a little boy.

14
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,200
He ended up in the hospital.

15
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,570
You still remember him?

16
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,400
I just remember he was this fragile kid.

17
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,760
No fun. Couldn't play with him at all.

18
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,000
I forgot you're also quite fragile.

19
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,240
So awkward.

20
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,000
Didn't you say

21
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,160
you wanted to become Master Zhou's student?

22
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,160
How's that going?

23
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,850
Master Zhou has clearly stated he won't take any more students.

24
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,840
But no matter how difficult it is or how long it takes,

25
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,970
I'm determined to become his student.

26
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,480
After all, I'm a woman destined to become a martial arts actress.

27
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,640
This kind of thing only increases your transaction costs.

28
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,480
Costs?

29
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,080
What costs?

30
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,120
It includes

31
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,520
time,

32
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,320
energy,

33
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,450
and your communication costs.

34
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,360
Not everything can be measured by

35
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,960
time,

36
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,640
transactions,

37
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,920
and costs.

38
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,960
Time is life.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,400
If you don't manage your time well, you're wasting your life.

40
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:32,880
Shen Yifan.

41
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,240
In your twenty-something years of life,

42
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,970
is there anything you particularly enjoy doing?

43
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,600
You look great today,

44
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,380
but next time we should shoot your left profile.

45
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,240
I heard that award-winning actress Ni Shang

46
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,100
is also shooting a commercial in this studio today.

47
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,120
It's none of your business. Why are you being so nosy?

48
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,960
Ni Shang is here.

49
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,720
Ni Shang!

50
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,560
Look!

51
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,000
Wait for me!

52
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,560
Hello, Ni Shang. I'm Wan Yuchen.

53
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,560
Hello.

54
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,400
Ms. Ni, please take a look at this.

55
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,000
Latte.

56
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,240
Go ahead.

57
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,040
Latte.

58
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,520
No, thanks.

59
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,280
It's healthy. Pretty good.

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,680
Ni Shang,

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I heard you and Brother Youyi

62
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,200
graduated from the same school.

63
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,460
Do you know each other?

64
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,410
I don't know him.

65
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,040
Really?

66
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,450
Then why did I hear that?

67
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,520
Don't we have a commercial to shoot?

68
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,200
Let's go.

69
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,120
Big news! Shocking news!

70
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,920
Gossip about Brother Youyi and international film star Ni Shang.

71
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,920
Interested?

72
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,860
Who are you trying to fool?

73
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,640
One's a toad and one's a swan.

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,130
What gossip could they possibly have?

75
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,400
I've known Brother Youyi for years.

76
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,560
You come to me with gossip about him?

77
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,850
Is your brain shrinking or something?

78
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,440
What?

79
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,480
I'm not here to sell you anything.

80
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,880
I want to work with you.

81
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,480
Together we can dig up something much bigger.

82
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,200
Cooperate my ass.

83
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,200
I have principles.

84
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,480
How could I possibly betray our friend?

85
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,040
What about a 60-40 split?

86
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,880
You get 60, I get 40.

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,240
Even 90-10 wouldn't work.

88
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,160
Besides,

89
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,320
you want me to believe there's chemistry between them?

90
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,120
That's as likely as Shen Yifan having a crush on me.

91
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,060
I'm hanging up.

92
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,700
Is everyone ready?

93
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,540
Be good now.

94
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,290
You can't do intense exercise.

95
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,260
Come on.

96
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,120
Get ready.

97
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,080
On your mark.

98
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,720
Go!

99
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,960
Would you give everything

100
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,000
for what you love?

101
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,360
Of course.

102
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,640
Don't waste your effort.

103
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,840
Just master the moves you need for filming.

104
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,420
I've already mastered those.

105
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,240
I'm practicing this just to challenge myself.

106
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,760
Such a show-off.

107
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,409
Master Zhou.

108
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,080
Are you here for Zheng Ying?

109
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,880
That's right.

110
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,220
She admires you very much.

111
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,720
And she loves martial arts.

112
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,320
Passion and persistence are two different things.

113
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,720
I don't want to waste my time

114
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,180
and energy on these impulsive celebrities.

115
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,880
You're talking about

116
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,700
Liu Mu, aren't you?

117
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,720
We have a good relationship.

118
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,080
He mentions me every time he's on a show.

119
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,960
At least he knows to be grateful.

120
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Perhaps that's exactly the problem.

121
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,760
Why would someone who earns a living

122
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,480
by their own merit use your name

123
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,210
to deceive people everywhere?

124
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,440
How could someone who respects their teacher

125
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,280
not contact you for years

126
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,600
and only thank you

127
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,970
in front of cameras?

128
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,160
I can completely resolve

129
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,400
the Liu Mu situation for you.

130
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,680
So in exchange,

131
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,980
I must agree to take her as my student?

132
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,400
Of course I hope you'll accept her as your student.

133
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,460
But I don't want it to be because of me.

134
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,919
The master-student relationship

135
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,120
depends on destiny.

136
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,840
If I forced you through obligation,

137
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,700
I would not only demean you

138
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,130
but also insult her.

139
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,080
Taking on a student

140
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,000
is entirely up to you.

141
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,400
I don't need your help,

142
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,360
and I won't take her as my student.

143
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,000
Goodbye.

144
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,360
Mr. Shen, since he refuses to take her as a student,

145
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,960
we shouldn't help him either.

146
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,400
I believe he will definitely accept Zheng Ying as his student.

147
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,200
As long as she works hard enough.

148
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,520
Mr. Zhou, I...

149
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,120
Despite your cold exterior,

150
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,680
like a stubborn old man,

151
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,260
One day, I'll make you accept me as your apprentice.

152
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,410
Still making Faustian bargains, aren't you?

153
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,840
What exactly are you trying to say?

154
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,240
Mr. Shen means that

155
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,160
your desire for this master-apprentice relationship

156
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,000
is blind worship

157
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,120
and obsession.

158
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,360
You've already lost

159
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,600
your ability to judge the value of other things.

160
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,360
Moreover,

161
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,520
just because you didn't get

162
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,800
Mr. Zhou's approval,

163
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,540
you tried to belittle him.

164
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,960
You've been dismissing my efforts.

165
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,720
Isn't that belittling me too?

166
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,450
It's not about belittling you.

167
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,420
It's that your level of effort

168
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,500
is far from enough.

169
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,440
Just you wait and see.

170
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,040
Don't worry.

171
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,240
We're already searching worldwide

172
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,320
for a suitable heart donor.

173
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,320
So please don't give up, okay?

174
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,360
Don't give up.

175
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,660
Let me say it again.

176
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,040
Come back as soon as possible

177
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,960
and rest properly

178
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,760
to be ready for surgery anytime.

179
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,250
Will you do that?

180
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,640
The probability of successfully finding a heart donor

181
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,160
is less than one in 100,000.

182
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,520
The success rate of heart transplant surgery is less than 30%.

183
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,880
Facts have proven there's no point in persisting anymore.

184
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,320
You don't need to waste your efforts either.

185
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,050
All Shen corporation projects

186
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,730
will be handed over to you soon.

187
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,000
Shen Yifan.

188
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,340
You promised you'd only return to China for six months.

189
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,040
Shen Yifan.

190
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,330
In your twenty-some years of life,

191
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,160
is there anything you particularly enjoy doing?

192
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,680
Would you be willing

193
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,080
to give everything for something you love?

194
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,880
Of course.

195
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,410
What about you, Shen Yifan?

196
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,920
You've sprained your ankle.

197
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,120
You've been overtraining. That's a big mistake.

198
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,720
Here,

199
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,160
let me take care of it.

200
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,640
It's nothing.

201
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,320
I can still train.

202
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,420
You won't even listen to your master.

203
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,400
You promised.

204
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,620
You have to keep your word.

205
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:31,890
Let's go.

206
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,330
Take it slow.

207
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,720
It's not serious.

208
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,400
Your leg strength is insufficient.

209
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,720
Then I'll keep working on my legs.

210
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,880
There will be a day when it's enough,

211
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,080
right, Master?

212
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,360
Take it easy these days.

213
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,090
Stop practicing martial arts.

214
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,240
Help stabilize her injury and take good care of her.

215
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,800
Okay.

216
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,520
Thank you, Master.

217
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,080
Master Zhou, thank you.

218
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,080
What for?

219
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,280
Don't you find it annoying to be pursued

220
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,600
by someone as persistent as a cockroach?

221
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,340
How about that?

222
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,420
You won't dare look down on me anymore, will you?

223
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,920
You're right.

224
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,160
Actually, all along,

225
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,040
the one making the Faustian bargain

226
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:38,960
was me.

227
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,000
What's wrong?

228
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,170
This is the first time you've ever agreed with me.

229
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,360
It feels strange.

230
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,900
Was my attitude toward you

231
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,930
that bad before?

232
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,840
Be more confident.

233
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,360
Drop the question mark.

234
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,960
Aren't you afraid

235
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,770
that all your efforts might be in vain?

236
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,520
If I don't try, wouldn't that be even more pointless?

237
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,360
A guaranteed failure.

238
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,960
So,

239
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,410
hard work doesn't guarantee success,

240
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,720
but without effort,

241
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,640
there's definitely no hope.

242
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,760
Even though I've fallen down,

243
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,820
I've gained a crutch to help me up.

244
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,820
And I even got a mentor now.

245
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,330
If you're being naughty

246
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,320
and make your foot injury worse,

247
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,840
affecting our filming schedule,

248
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,760
I really can't guarantee

249
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,290
that Master Zhou will keep you as his student.

250
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,600
Please don't worry, boss.

251
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,360
I'll recover as soon as possible

252
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,800
and dedicate myself to the sacred cause of filmmaking.

253
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,840
You know,

254
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,600
you really are suited for acting.

255
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,120
Your dramatic flair comes so naturally.

256
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,840
It's just that your acting skills

257
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,240
aren't really that good.

258
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,080
I know.

259
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,120
I'll definitely study acting properly

260
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,280
and improve my skills.

261
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,360
I'll also take good care of my foot

262
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,120
and be fully recovered before filming starts.

263
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:07,720
Hello?

264
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,280
Take her to the hospital.

265
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,280
So it's the centennial celebration.

266
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,200
No wonder Sister Nishang's debut film

267
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,000
is being screened again in the academy's theater.

268
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,720
By the way, Youyi,

269
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,560
didn't you graduate from this school too?

270
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,760
Are you going back for the celebration?

271
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,840
I don't have time for that.

272
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,580
Youyi, I need to go out for something.

273
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,360
I just learned your name today.

274
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,240
But I've heard about you for a long time.

275
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,620
The campus beauty.

276
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,330
What else have you heard

277
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,960
about me?

278
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,560
That you're extremely beautiful

279
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,880
but a bit aloof.

280
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,840
And you have many pursuers.

281
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,650
Indeed, quite a few.

282
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,520
But the one I fancy

283
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,160
is only you.

284
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,520
Senior.

285
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,920
I have something to do. I need to go.

286
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,640
You two enjoy your meal, okay?

287
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,240
Okay, bye.

288
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,839
Nishang, over here.

289
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:05,599
I'm here.

290
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,560
Alright. The movie has ended.

291
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,680
Now, let's welcome our lead actress.

292
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,280
Senior Ni Shang to the stage.

293
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,680
Hello everyone. I'm actress Ni Shang.

294
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,120
Senior Ni Shang, please share with us

295
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,400
how you felt while filming this movie.

296
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,480
Actually, when I was filming this movie,

297
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,480
I was just 18 years old.

298
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,490
It was quite a coincidence.

299
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,560
The plot of this movie

300
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,520
was very similar to my own experiences,

301
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,250
so the entire filming process.

302
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,960
I've let down my master

303
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,640
and all those who have supported me.

304
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,840
I've failed them.

305
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,440
I, Liu Mu, am no longer Master Zhou's disciple.

306
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,880
I will never again use Master Zhou's name

307
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,200
to deceive anyone.

308
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,720
I'm sorry.

309
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,320
We were master and disciple once.

310
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,280
Let it be.

311
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,480
You once said,

312
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,960
even those who journey together for a thousand miles

313
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,490
must eventually part ways.

314
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,400
Master Zhou,

315
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,060
please don't take it too hard.

316
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,650
Master Zhou,

317
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,480
may I ask you for a favor?

318
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,480
You don't need to say it. I understand.

319
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,880
Zheng Ying's foot injury hasn't healed yet.

320
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,080
We'll start filming Ni Shang's scenes first,

321
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,160
and wait until her foot is completely healed before she joins the crew.

322
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,840
Thank you for your understanding.

323
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,970
I just don't want to owe you any favors.

324
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,840
Besides,

325
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,530
Zheng Ying is a good kid.

326
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,120
You're a big star now.

327
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,120
If you get photographed like this,

328
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,180
it won't look good.

329
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,800
Are you saying this as my senior,

330
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,520
or as my ex-boyfriend?

331
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,960
Mr. Yu,

332
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,500
it's getting late.

333
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,600
I should go now.

334
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,280
Mr. Cheng.

335
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,200
Shen Yifan.

336
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,320
You schemed against me and my company,

337
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,650
causing me huge losses.

338
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,640
This isn't over between us.

339
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,840
Mr. Cheng, are you now

340
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,700
reduced to drinking with people to secure funding?

341
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,610
That is quite pathetic.

342
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,800
Sorry.

343
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,240
Let me tell you,

344
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,360
I'll not only make you pay,

345
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,720
I'll also take Zheng Ying away from you.

346
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,200
Well, that depends on whether

347
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,000
you actually have what it takes.

348
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,880
Mr. Cheng,

349
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,560
I heard

350
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,960
Zheng Ying injured her foot

351
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,280
and she's in the hospital now.

352
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,880
What's that got to do with me?

353
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,960
Didn't you say you wanted to pursue her?

354
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,800
Chase her.

355
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,160
I'm just giving her

356
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,640
a chance to get close to me.

357
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,640
Pursuing her.

358
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,690
But you did remind me of something.

359
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,720
A wounded woman at times like this

360
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,680
needs more care and attention.

361
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,280
Especially when this care

362
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,520
comes from me, whom she's been thinking about.

363
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,280
Wu Yu.

364
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,760
Could you please stop staring at me like that?

365
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,080
This is ridiculous.

366
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,040
Mr. Shen said

367
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,400
to prevent you from hurting yourself again and delaying work,

368
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,200
so until your foot heals,

369
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,520
I'm specifically assigned to take care of

370
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,320
your foot.

371
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,080
This one.

372
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,080
What are you doing?

373
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,000
My foot

374
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,200
has its own thoughts.

375
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,880
It says it's thirsty.

376
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,200
My foot says

377
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,240
its owner wants some snacks.

378
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,440
My foot says

379
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,920
this is too low. Could you adjust it higher?

380
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,400
Do you have any requests

381
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,260
that you could tell me all at once?

382
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,960
It's my foot that has requests, not me.

383
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,300
That's enough.

384
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,320
What's wrong?

385
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,040
Is it too hard for you?

386
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,820
But taking care of her is the task you assigned to me.

387
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,160
I will complete it.

388
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,480
Up.

389
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:17,920
Pack.

390
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,920
What are you doing here?

391
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,370
I know my appearance is surprising to you,

392
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,250
but I suggest you start getting used to it now.

393
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,580
Because I'll be showing up often.

394
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,170
This place is too small.

395
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,960
I need to get you a bigger one.

396
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,660
What is all this stuff?

397
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,760
There's not even a bathroom.

398
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,720
What is he doing here?

399
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,400
Why do you have all these things in your hospital room?

400
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,200
Get rid of it all.

401
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,660
What are these things?

402
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,920
He came after you.

403
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,680
After me?

404
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,680
You mean to kill me, right?

405
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,200
And you don't mind?

406
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,800
You're just going to stand there and watch?

407
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,780
Of course I won't just stand by and watch.

408
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,840
That's more like it.

409
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,890
Are we really going to ignore this?

410
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,300
Although she's my artist,

411
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,320
I'm only responsible for her film and TV contracts.

412
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,520
She'll definitely become more famous in the future.

413
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,400
These situations will only increase, not decrease.

414
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,860
Mr. Cheng poses no threat.

415
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,220
Consider it practice for her.

416
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,640
Nice one, Shen Yifan.

417
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,970
So this is what you meant by not standing by and watching.

418
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,360
Eat.

419
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,620
Master Zhou says I need to strictly control my diet lately.

420
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,880
No seafood allowed.

421
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,520
No spicy food either.

422
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,170
And nothing with high oil or salt content.

423
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,360
These are all for you.

424
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,920
Yu Youyi says I'm building my public image lately.

425
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,400
No bags, no skincare products.

426
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,720
No gifts over 2,000 yuan.

427
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,520
I'm sorry.

428
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,980
I can't accept your gifts.

429
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,380
Light and refreshing.

430
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,610
Affordable and practical.

431
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,540
How about that?

432
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,000
Now you have no reason to refuse, right?

433
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,120
These two sitting together

434
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,720
look strangely harmonious.

435
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,250
Let's go.

436
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,800
What do you mean?

437
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,320
Sorry, Mr. Cheng,

438
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,360
I'm taking my person with me.

439
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,120
Wu Yu,

440
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,080
go get the car.

441
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,160
Your rescue method is quite direct.

442
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,760
Your way of rejecting people

443
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,040
is quite tactful.
