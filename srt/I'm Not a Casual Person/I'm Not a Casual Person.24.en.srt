1
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,360
Hello.

2
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,170
Let me reintroduce myself.

3
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,240
I'm the chairman of Yiping Sunshine,

4
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,040
Cheng Moyang.

5
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,520
So,

6
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,420
what brings Chairman Cheng to my company today?

7
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,920
Although I've always admired Miss Zheng Ying

8
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,720
and never given up pursuing you,

9
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,840
it's work hours now,

10
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
so I'm naturally here for business.

11
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,120
This book is exceptionally well-written.

12
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,380
I think the author is an absolute genius.

13
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,400
I've noticed this novel before.

14
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,720
It's indeed well-written.

15
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,240
Being able to write a love story without being sappy

16
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,920
is quite rare.

17
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,360
Yes,

18
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,320
and when reading it,

19
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,280
I had this strange sense of familiarity.

20
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,000
As if it happened around me.

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,840
Exactly.

22
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,280
When I saw the characters,

23
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,560
I felt like I was seeing myself.

24
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,280
You know,

25
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,200
I also had a feeling

26
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,360
of being watched.

27
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,600
So with a resource like this,

28
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,120
if we just leave it alone,

29
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,520
wouldn't that be a waste?

30
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,040
It would certainly be a crime.

31
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,840
What if we buy the rights?

32
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,040
We could have a script ready in three months.

33
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,320
We could film it in four months,

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,000
barring any issues.

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,930
It could be released within a year.

36
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,480
What do you think?

37
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,480
I think

38
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,320
these rights aren't something you can just buy outright.

39
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,120
Shouldn't we try contacting the author first?

40
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,300
So I'm here contacting you now, aren't I?

41
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,120
How did you know?

42
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,600
So you're not planning to come back?

43
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,260
She's always wanted to create a good story herself.

44
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,320
Actually, her writing is quite good,

45
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,520
and she has particularly innovative ideas.

46
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,720
She's currently online

47
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,780
serializing a novel about our story.

48
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,730
The content is really good.

49
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,440
It's excellent original IP.

50
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,400
You could reach out to her

51
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,800
and develop it together.

52
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,320
Although I really like Zhengying,

53
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,320
when it comes to projects,

54
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,760
I still need to think it through carefully.

55
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,760
After all, you know

56
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,320
developing a project requires significant funding.

57
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,000
I had Wu Yu establish a fund

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,360
that only invests in projects she's involved with.

59
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,560
The money in it

60
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,520
is enough to buy all the projects she likes.

61
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,880
Got it.

62
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,160
Her personality is somewhat impulsive.

63
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,820
When you're friends with her,

64
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,120
please be more patient with her.

65
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,100
She gets into character quickly,

66
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,370
but takes time to snap out of it.

67
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,700
You need to be aware of this issue.

68
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,320
She always practices martial arts right after meals without resting.

69
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,980
Please remind her about this.

70
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,130
She listens to you the most.

71
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,720
I don't like Shen Yifan.

72
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,600
But he desperately wants

73
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,760
to pave your entire life's path for you.

74
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,640
For this,

75
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,440
I admire him.

76
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,000
He was very restrained when he approached me.

77
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,159
His tone was casual.

78
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,480
But the more effort he put into restraining himself,

79
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,540
the more I realized

80
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,100
how overwhelming his love for you is.

81
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,280
Shen Yifan.

82
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,360
Why did you leave notes for everyone else

83
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,800
but not for me?

84
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,960
Why?

85
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,840
Let me take a photo of you too.

86
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,400
I don't like having my photo taken.

87
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,840
Who doesn't like having their photo taken?

88
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,159
Skinny, hurry up.

89
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,280
Come on!

90
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,640
Ready?

91
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,520
All set!

92
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,040
Long time no see,

93
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,920
Zheng Xiaohong.

94
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
The two of us

95
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,090
really don't belong to the same world.

96
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
But between you and me,

97
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
there was once a little connection.

98
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,960
You said.

99
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,680
Once I put on the headphones,

100
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,800
you would immediately

101
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,460
take care of everything else.

102
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,640
Oh my God!

103
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,960
The famous star Zheng Ying.

104
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,720
Is that really Zheng Ying?

105
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,440
Yes, it's her. The famous star Zheng Ying.

106
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,040
No way.

107
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,200
Could it be someone impersonating Zheng Ying?

108
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,000
That's right.

109
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,200
I am Zheng Ying.

110
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,370
I'm the one who starred in 'Duel of Beauties'.

111
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,100
And 'Drunken Jade Mountain'.

112
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,920
Zheng Ying, an actress who has trended many times online.

113
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,640
Zheng Ying, I'm a huge fan of yours.

114
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,160
Could you sign an autograph for me?

115
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,560
Didn't you say that whenever I'm in danger,

116
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,300
you would immediately appear and take control?

117
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,680
I'm in danger right now.

118
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,440
Where are you?

119
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,760
Where are you?

120
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,520
Shen Yifan,

121
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
show yourself!

122
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,280
Shen Yifan!

123
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,400
Shen Yifan!

124
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,600
What are you doing?

125
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,960
Shen Yifan,

126
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,240
is that you?

127
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,040
I'm back.

128
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,200
When I ask you something,

129
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,720
you need to answer honestly.

130
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,520
Understand?

131
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,320
I understand.

132
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,360
Leniency for those who confess,

133
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,960
severity for those who resist.

134
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,000
I know the rules.

135
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,970
After you arrived in Switzerland,

136
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,400
what happened?

137
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,860
When I got to Switzerland,

138
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,480
I scheduled surgery,

139
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,760
then had the operation,

140
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,040
followed by post-op treatment,

141
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,800
recovery,

142
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,880
rehabilitation,

143
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,080
MACYMCC, that's all.

144
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,320
That's it?

145
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,760
Of course.

146
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,040
Then why did you send me

147
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,440
those kinds of messages?

148
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,920
I was just...

149
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,240
Maybe because

150
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,640
I was too bored

151
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,170
and wanted to joke with you.

152
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,640
Should you send messages like that so casually?

153
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,760
Is that kind of information something to joke about?

154
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,440
Shen Yifan.

155
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,120
I can't handle being startled.

156
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,920
What's wrong?

157
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,040
Are you having heart problems?

158
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,840
Let me see.

159
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,360
I'm fine.

160
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,420
I was just kidding.

161
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,760
Shen Yifan!

162
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,640
How dare you trick me!

163
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm sorry!

164
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,400
How dare you lie to me?

165
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,520
Lying to me? I'll teach you a lesson!

166
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,320
I'm really sorry.

167
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,080
You're so annoying.

168
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,480
You're driving me crazy.

169
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,200
Are you sure you want to be like this?

170
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,400
Just do your own thing.

171
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,930
I'm not getting in your way.

172
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,920
What are we eating today?

173
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,680
Today?

174
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,040
All your favorites.

175
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,800
There's a casual project meeting today.

176
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,800
Aren't you going?

177
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,760
Today...

178
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,480
I'm not working.

179
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,440
So what are we going to do?

180
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,810
I have more important things to do.

181
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,840
So this is what you call important?

182
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,240
Just wasting time

183
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,370
and fooling around.

184
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,200
I used to be in such a hurry.

185
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,400
Always focused on efficiency

186
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,930
and never wasting a minute.

187
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,530
But now it's different.

188
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,160
Now I have plenty of time

189
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,400
to enjoy life.

190
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,360
Besides,

191
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
having fun

192
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,480
can hardly be called a waste of time.

193
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,800
Why aren't you working today?

194
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,260
What are you doing?

195
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,300
[Naming future children]

196
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,760
What are you doing?

197
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,360
Knitting a hat for a dog.

198
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,800
Shen Yifan,

199
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,120
we don't even have a dog.

200
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,960
It's almost midnight.

201
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,680
You used to go to bed at midnight sharp.

202
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,340
It's almost midnight.

203
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,880
Shouldn't we get some

204
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
spicy hot pot?

205
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,200
Let's go.

206
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,960
How about that? Pretty impressive, right?

207
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,480
Finally.

208
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,890
I've finally freed myself.

209
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,800
Wan Yuchen.

210
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,040
Yuchen.

211
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,560
Wan Yuchen.

212
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,640
Ni Shang.

213
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,840
Are you ready?

214
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,040
This is my first time

215
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,100
walking the red carpet as a director.

216
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,480
I mean,

217
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,320
are you ready to be Ni Hao's real father?

218
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,890
I've been ready for a long time.

219
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,960
Ni Shang.

220
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,880
Come on! Come on!

221
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,760
Zheng Ying.

222
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,700
I invited them here

223
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,440
to witness your moment of glory.

224
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,040
I won't waste my time

225
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,240
caring about those

226
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,000
who are far behind me.

227
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,680
Such people

228
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,900
don't even qualify as opponents.

229
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,160
Let's go.

230
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,440
Mr. Cheng.

231
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,960
I don't need your help with this.

232
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,120
Let's go.

233
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,000
You look beautiful today.

234
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,160
Next up

235
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,560
is definitely a moment worth remembering.

236
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,880
Please welcome award-winning actress Ni Shang

237
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,880
to present

238
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,680
the Most Popular Actress Award.

239
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,240
The winner of the Most Popular Actress Award is

240
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,839
the actress who played Shan Lan in 'Drunken Jade Mountain,'

241
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,760
Zheng Ying.

242
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,359
Congratulations.

243
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,280
You did it.

244
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,500
You took the trophy from my hands.

245
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,920
I'm not someone who makes empty promises.

246
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,640
Come on.

247
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,480
Hello everyone.

248
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,040
I'm actress Zheng Ying.

249
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,880
I'm honored to receive this award

250
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,140
for my role as Shan Lan.

251
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,400
First,

252
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,680
I want to thank my mentor,

253
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,000
Zhou Zheng.

254
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,960
He once led an era

255
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,280
and gave me a role model to aspire to.

256
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,280
He was also

257
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,800
my inspiration

258
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,850
to become a martial arts actor.

259
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,040
Next,

260
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,280
I want to thank

261
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,280
my agent who has always protected me

262
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,960
and my friends who have always been by my side.

263
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,320
They taught me

264
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,080
Only by standing tall through our own efforts

265
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,440
can we earn achievements and respect.

266
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,520
This award

267
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,980
doesn't just belong to me,

268
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,600
but to everyone in the production team.

269
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,560
Thank you all

270
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,260
for making this possible.

271
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,720
I would like to offer

272
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,320
my deepest respect to everyone.

273
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,840
And I hope all my colleagues in the industry

274
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,960
will pursue their dreams with joy throughout life,

275
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,800
without fear

276
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,090
and without regret.

277
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,280
Finally,

278
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,330
I want to thank one more person.

279
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,240
You left letters for everyone,

280
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,280
except for me.

281
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,800
But

282
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,360
I choose to forgive you generously.

283
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,880
Because I know

284
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,170
you've been quietly warming my heart.

285
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,480
Protecting me.

286
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,520
You wished

287
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,580
to bring the whole world to me just to fulfill my dreams.

288
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,320
It turns out our fate

289
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,980
began more than ten years ago.

290
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,200
It had already started.

291
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,120
That afternoon,

292
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,120
the sunlight was gentle,

293
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,920
you were so adorable.

294
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,960
Our little bodies held each other's hands.

295
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,490
Little did we know we were making a lifelong promise.

296
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,400
Shen Yifan,

297
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,600
perhaps

298
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,580
you were an unexpected encounter in my life,

299
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,200
but you are my

300
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,800
forever.

301
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,160
My only joy.

302
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,000
You said you hoped that someday

303
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,960
you would return safe and sound.

304
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,640
To see me standing tall

305
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,240
in the brilliant spotlight.

306
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,760
Soaring high.

307
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,940
No one could bully me anymore.

308
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,480
Shen Yifan.

309
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,200
Can you see how I'm shining now?

310
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,440
If only

311
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,680
you were here too.

312
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,920
Yes.

313
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,880
I've finally fulfilled your wish

314
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,240
and seen the most beautiful scenery.

315
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,280
It's just a pity

316
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,160
that the person who should be enjoying this splendor with me isn't here.

317
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,680
I'm someone who doesn't like to leave any regrets.

318
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,800
But this time,

319
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,520
I seem to have failed.

320
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,000
We've found a heart donor.

321
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,060
What are you waiting for? Go quickly.

322
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,640
Mr. Shen has a strong will

323
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,640
and is recovering well.

324
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,320
But he still needs proper care

325
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,650
to recover even better.

326
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,440
I understand.

327
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,960
Thank you, doctor.

328
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,320
Mr. Shen,

329
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,880
you can't leave me behind and go back to China alone.

330
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,360
No matter what you say, I'm coming with you.

331
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,320
I'm not leaving you behind.

332
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,040
I'll go first

333
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,170
and come back for you once I'm settled.

334
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,980
How soon is 'soon'?

335
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,720
You just had surgery.

336
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,000
You need to rest properly.

337
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,760
Shen Yifan,

338
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,760
let me tell you,

339
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,760
without my...

340
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,800
I won't go, I won't go.

341
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,480
Okay?

342
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,280
I'm not going.

343
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,000
Without my permission,

344
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,930
don't come back.

345
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,480
Live well back home

346
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,560
and enjoy everything to the fullest.

347
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,760
Most importantly,

348
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,490
don't let Zheng Ying bully you.

349
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,560
What are you standing there for?

350
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,520
Before I change my mind,

351
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,680
get in the car quickly.

352
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,280
I'll take you to the airport.
