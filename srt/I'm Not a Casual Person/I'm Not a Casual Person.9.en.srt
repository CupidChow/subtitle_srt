1
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,520
Go away!

2
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,520
Stay back!

3
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,759
Miss, open the door!

4
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,759
Miss, are you alright?

5
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,759
Miss, do you need help? Are you okay?

6
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,160
Miss, please open the door.

7
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,760
Open the door quickly, miss!

8
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,360
Zheng Ying, it's me.

9
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,000
Shen Yifan.

10
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,880
You finally came.

11
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,940
What's wrong with you?

12
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,940
What are you doing?

13
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,760
This is hilarious.

14
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,440
So funny.

15
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,680
Look at this.

16
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,140
Why do you look familiar to me?

17
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,920
You're trending.

18
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,920
I never thought

19
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,560
my first trending topic after wrapping up filming

20
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,920
would be about this.

21
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,640
It's so embarrassing.

22
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,640
Doctor,

23
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,640
why was I dancing outside and seeing zombies?

24
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,720
What's going on?

25
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,240
The dancing, we suspect it's related to your blood test results

26
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,240
showing homemade alcohol poisoning.

27
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,500
As for seeing zombies,

28
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,760
could it be because you've been

29
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,960
watching those kinds of movies lately?

30
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,300
I can't believe I drank fake alcohol.

31
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,760
How embarrassing.

32
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,560
Why is he here?

33
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,280
He absolutely cannot know the real reason.

34
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:49,960
Yes.

35
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,400
I'll never eat carelessly again.

36
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,240
It was poisonous mushrooms causing hallucinations.

37
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,840
Thank you, doctor.

38
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,720
Get some rest.

39
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,000
I've explained everything

40
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,320
to her again as I told you.

41
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,520
But you need to keep a closer eye on your girlfriend.

42
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,240
Even with a high tolerance, she shouldn't drink like this.

43
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,880
Yes. Thank you, doctor.

44
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,260
Such an embarrassing thing is trending now.

45
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,920
He can't find out the reason why.

46
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,320
Look at you.

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,130
Why is there a mosquito flying in here?

48
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,280
I don't believe this.

49
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,880
Finally caught you.

50
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,080
Why is there a little bee now?

51
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,800
The doctor said I still have toxins in my body.

52
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,400
I'm prone to hallucinations

53
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,400
Don't know when I'll get better.

54
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,240
Why is StellaLou here?

55
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,400
Where's LinaBell?

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,880
Let me ask you.

57
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,720
What is this?

58
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,240
Isn't this a ladder?

59
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,800
Why is there a ladder in the hospital room?

60
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,060
How do you know you're in a hospital room?

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,130
What hospital room?

62
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,680
Isn't this the deep forest?

63
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,320
How could this be?

64
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,400
Stop chasing me!

65
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,560
I'm home now.

66
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,020
Mr. Shen, the discharge paperwork is ready.

67
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,240
That act was exhausting.

68
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,520
At least I managed to get through it.

69
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,920
You think

70
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,440
you can fool our boss?

71
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,280
What a big mushroom!

72
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,600
Play with me, big mushroom.

73
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,420
He must be dealing with the trending topics.

74
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,840
He must be very angry.

75
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,520
What are you standing there for?

76
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,980
Hurry up and apologize to Mr. Shen properly.

77
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,320
That's it for now.

78
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,720
What's wrong?

79
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,240
Does it hurt a lot?

80
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,240
What do you think?

81
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,600
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,240
I didn't mean to. At that time, I...

83
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,560
So you were hallucinating then?

84
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,280
I wasn't hallucinating from eating poisonous mushrooms.

85
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,280
I lied to you.

86
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,880
So?

87
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,480
How do you plan to make it up to me?

88
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,880
Double the snacks, no vacation.

89
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,600
Controlled diet, not a drop of alcohol.

90
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,960
Aren't these things that an actor

91
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,290
should be doing anyway?

92
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,680
Then tell me, what should I do for you to forgive me?

93
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,000
Does it hurt badly?

94
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Wait here. I'll go get some medicine.

95
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,080
No need.

96
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,200
How can that be okay?

97
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Wait for me, I'll be back soon.

98
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,040
No need.

99
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,480
Why do you have a medical kit in your car?

100
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,800
Because I have an artist who often films action scenes,

101
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,530
so I keep these supplies handy.

102
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,600
When I hit you,

103
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,320
why didn't you dodge?

104
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,960
Why did you just take that punch?

105
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,160
Next time I'll dodge.

106
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,799
Let's talk about today's shows.

107
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,480
Not only are they painful to watch,

108
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,210
but we actors are embarrassed to perform in them.

109
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,920
Choosing scripts nowadays,

110
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,930
it's not about picking between good and bad anymore.

111
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,160
It's about jumping between bad and worse.

112
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,000
You get it?

113
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,600
So what if I don't like it?

114
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,240
So what if I can't adapt?

115
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,060
I try to adapt and act with my eyes closed.

116
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,370
I'll talk to you later. Hanging up.

117
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,360
Why is Brother Youyi here?

118
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,800
So this is where film star Ni Shang

119
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,600
lives after returning to China.

120
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,530
How did you get my phone number?

121
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,400
I found it in my mom's wallet.

122
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,970
So what's the emergency you called about?

123
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,880
I'm bored. I called you to play with me.

124
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
Where's your mom?

125
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,000
What's wrong? Is she sick?

126
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,600
After finishing each film,

127
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,660
she always locks herself away like this for a long time.

128
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,890
What are you looking at?

129
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,920
I...

130
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,520
Just enjoying the view outside.

131
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,320
The weather is really nice today.

132
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,400
Are you bored?

133
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,480
Why don't we have a meeting then?

134
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,680
To discuss your next career move.

135
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,680
What should I film next?

136
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,800
After finishing 'Duel of Beauties',

137
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,460
we've received many scripts.

138
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,200
But the quality varies.

139
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,760
I think

140
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,480
we should wait for something truly good rather than settle.

141
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,480
Well, there must be

142
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,560
some quality scripts suitable for me, right?

143
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,360
There are,

144
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,200
but they're all supporting roles.

145
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,800
That doesn't fit with my plans for your career.

146
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,000
You've been building up to something.

147
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,120
You must have a good script

148
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,930
ready for me. Let me have it!

149
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,320
I don't have a script,

150
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,970
but I do have a novel.

151
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,160
I know this book.

152
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,520
Famous author Liu Xiaomeng.

153
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,300
More than a dozen of her works have been adapted for screen.

154
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,960
This one has the best reviews.

155
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,560
It even won a literary award.

156
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,440
The content flows well and the story is clear.

157
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,440
The characters are fresh

158
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,040
and perfect for adaptation.

159
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,920
So you mean

160
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,780
you want to develop this novel

161
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,120
for me to star in?

162
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,520
Yes.

163
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,890
But the current issue is

164
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,180
we need to find her.

165
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,680
And

166
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,500
secure the rights.

167
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,120
I, Cheng Moyang,

168
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,520
could never be like this because of a woman.

169
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,040
Please.

170
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,160
Mr. Cheng,

171
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,330
long time no see.

172
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,170
What are you doing here?

173
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,360
I came today

174
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,360
to tell you some good news

175
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,330
that I'm sure you'll praise me for.

176
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,240
Get to the point.

177
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,400
Mr. Cheng.

178
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,840
I heard Shen Yifan is also in contact with this author.

179
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,120
I also heard that Zheng Ying, in order to get these rights,

180
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,080
agreed to star in this film

181
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,880
and turned down all other roles.

182
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,480
If we can secure this,

183
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,560
they'll see how powerful you are,

184
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,080
and it would be the perfect revenge for you.

185
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,570
As long as Cheng Moyang gets these rights,

186
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,880
then for the female lead,

187
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,080
who else could play it but me?

188
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,120
Get out.

189
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,720
Get out.

190
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:45,760
Come with me.

191
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,400
Let go.

192
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:46,920
Come with me.

193
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,960
Let me go.

194
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,480
You still take a long time to snap out of character after acting?

195
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,010
But hiding in your room isn't a good solution.

196
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,560
Don't worry.

197
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,290
I've told everyone to stay away. No one will come.

198
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,560
Treat me as the character you played.

199
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,090
After you hit me, you can say goodbye to it all.

200
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,100
Aren't you curious

201
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,560
why I changed my name?

202
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,040
Is it because you wanted a different life?

203
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,240
Or are you desperate to distance yourself from your past?

204
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,840
Hello.

205
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,700
I heard you want to buy the copyright for 'Drunken Jade Mountain'.

206
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,240
Mr. Shen and his team have already approached the IP owners.

207
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,680
You should stay out of it.

208
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,080
Why?

209
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,200
You don't need to know the reason.

210
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,000
In short,

211
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,480
don't compete for any projects related to Shen Yifan.

212
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,800
I know you're never satisfied with anything I do.

213
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,640
So please stop interfering in my affairs from now on.

214
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,240
Okay?

215
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,720
Your affairs?

216
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,640
Have you ever done anything worthwhile in your entire life?

217
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,770
You don't even know what you want to do.

218
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,120
Long time no see, Mr. Shen.

219
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,120
It seems Mr. Cheng is also after the copyright this time.

220
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,640
Never mind what I'm after.

221
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,720
I'm determined to get it anyway.

222
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,370
I've heard your tough talk too many times, Mr. Cheng.

223
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,800
I hope this time

224
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,640
you can actually deliver on your words.

225
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,880
What do we do now?

226
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,200
Since Liu Xiaomang became a full-time writer,

227
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,640
she has maintained a daily output of 10,000 words

228
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,440
without ever missing an update.

229
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,520
And she rarely

230
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,080
appears in the public eye.

231
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,610
This person's personality

232
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,410
is rather peculiar.

233
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,440
So, are we just going back to the company like this?

234
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,420
Let's stay here for today.

235
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,920
If we're lucky,

236
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,380
we might get to meet her in person.

237
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,760
Stay here?

238
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,880
Isn't your home nearby?

239
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,360
You can go home first.

240
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,840
Have I been here before?

241
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,440
Why does it feel so familiar?

242
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,280
Mr. Cheng.

243
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,920
I'm going back to my own home.

244
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,320
Why are you following me?

245
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,280
I have plenty of time.

246
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,220
I can go wherever I want. It's none of your business.

247
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,840
Mr. Shen.

248
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,560
What about you?

249
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,280
Here I can communicate with you about work anytime.

250
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,340
It saves time on work communication.

251
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,240
The two bosses can rest here for now.

252
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,320
Alright.

253
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,240
Bringing back two at once.

254
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,920
That's my daughter.

255
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,360
Honey, I think the one across is better.

256
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,600
He has a prosperous look,

257
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,560
handsome and dashing.

258
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,720
I prefer the gentle one on the sofa.

259
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,760
He complements our daughter perfectly.

260
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,920
You don't understand.

261
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,120
The one across is better.

262
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,440
You don't understand how good the one on the sofa is.

263
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:43,960
You just don't get it.

264
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,480
You,

265
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,000
tell us. Son, what do you think?

266
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,130
Which one is better?

267
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,280
I think both are good.

268
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,400
Only children make choices.

269
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,840
My sister is an adult now.

270
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,240
She should have both.

271
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,220
Wouldn't that be perfect?

272
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,360
Hello, sir. I'm Cheng Moyang.

273
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,360
From Yiping Sunshine Film Company.

274
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,760
You must have heard of it?

275
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,570
My goodness.

276
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,760
So young and accomplished,

277
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,920
with unlimited potential.

278
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,850
You're too kind.

279
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,160
Have some water.

280
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:16,880
Thank you.

281
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,840
Young man,

282
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,680
right now,

283
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,080
your financial situation isn't great,

284
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,240
but that's okay.

285
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,360
Don't feel inferior or discouraged.

286
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,680
Although these clothes...

287
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,280
With your current circumstances,

288
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,140
you're admittedly not quite worthy of my daughter.

289
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,360
But that's fine.

290
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,360
I know my daughter best.

291
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,760
She's not someone who despises the poor and loves the rich.

292
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,760
Rest assured.

293
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,890
Just changed my clothes and

294
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,240
what's going on here?

295
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,530
Zheng Xiaohong,

296
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,680
you're quite something.

297
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,920
Do you have any siblings?

298
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,680
What do your parents do?

299
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,200
It's okay, you can tell me.

300
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,840
Mom.

301
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,740
What are you asking all these questions for?

302
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,420
Already being protective, I see.

303
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,920
That's good.

304
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:21,960
Mom.

305
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,180
Who are you looking at?

306
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,890
You like him, don't you?

307
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,000
Gossiping is a sin.

308
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,130
Spreading rumors is shameful, madam.

309
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,120
You're my daughter.

310
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,000
Don't I know you well enough?

311
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,320
Don't say such things.

312
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,160
He's just my investor.

313
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,520
He's my boss, okay?

314
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,650
So what if he's an investor?

315
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,320
Who says a boss can't become a husband?

316
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,040
As long as you like him,

317
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,400
you should be brave and go after him.

318
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,800
Mom supports you.

319
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,440
Silly child. Come here.

320
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,280
Mom.

321
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,480
Stop it, Mom.

322
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,010
Hurry up.

323
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,120
What are you doing?

324
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,520
I'm sorry about that.

325
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,040
My mom is just like that.

326
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,320
She's very nosy

327
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,180
and has no filter when she speaks.

328
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,040
Don't take it personally.

329
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,720
It's okay.

330
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,970
I don't take it personally.

331
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,120
That's good.

332
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,180
Come with me to a place.

333
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,520
Hello, welcome.

334
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,080
Hi.

335
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,160
Doctor.

336
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,400
Young Mr. Shen suddenly wants to buy clothes.

337
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,320
And he wants the most expensive and flashy ones.

338
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,720
This isn't normal at all.

339
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,520
Tell me.

340
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,440
Can heart disease spread to brain cells?

341
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,400
Is Mr. Shen's condition getting worse?

342
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,330
Should we take him to the hospital?

343
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,240
Mr. Shen,

344
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,160
why did you suddenly decide to buy clothes?

345
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,600
What's wrong?

346
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,730
Am I not allowed to buy clothes?

347
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,920
What do you think of this outfit?

348
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,760
If you're buying clothes, just buy clothes.

349
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,440
Why did you drag me along?

350
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,880
Well,

351
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,400
doesn't your mother think I'm poor?

352
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,240
I want to buy something she'd approve of,

353
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,560
so she'll think her daughter

354
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,760
has a decent boss

355
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,480
and isn't so hard done by.

356
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,440
I told you my mom was just talking nonsense.

357
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,330
She was just treating you as...

358
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,520
As what?

359
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,040
I think that one looks good.

360
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,320
Excuse me,

361
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,980
I'll take this one.

362
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,650
Don't you want to try on such an expensive outfit?

363
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,080
Fine, I'll try it on.

364
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,300
Miss, your boyfriend is so handsome.

365
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,400
He doesn't know anyway.

366
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,640
I'm just helping him ward off admirers.

367
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:53,880
Right?

368
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,840
I also think my boyfriend is very handsome.

369
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,200
How long have you been together?

370
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,760
About 10 years or so.

371
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,000
We've known each other since childhood.

372
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Childhood sweethearts.

373
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,640
Green

374
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,280
