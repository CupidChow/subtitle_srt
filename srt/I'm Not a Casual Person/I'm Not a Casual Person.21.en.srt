1
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,759
I disagree.

2
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,680
Mr. Cheng's abilities

3
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,560
are obvious to everyone.

4
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,400
Do you dare hand the company over to him?

5
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,759
That's right.

6
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,960
I don't agree either.

7
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,280
None of us agree.

8
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,360
But Mr. Cheng

9
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,090
is Chairman Cheng's only heir.

10
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,560
If you don't respect him,

11
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,680
at least respect his father.

12
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,000
This is business.

13
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,810
It concerns all our interests.

14
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,370
No one's face matters here.

15
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,320
Mr. Cheng,

16
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,680
ask yourself honestly:

17
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,180
do you deserve this position?

18
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,060
Ladies and gentlemen.

19
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,210
I admit my previous behavior was irresponsible.

20
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,600
But that doesn't mean I'll continue to be this way.

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,260
The Cheng Group is everyone's hard work.

22
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,960
With all of your support,

23
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,160
I will definitely manage the Cheng Group well.

24
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,880
That's enough, young Mr. Cheng.

25
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,880
Words are useless.

26
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,079
As for me,

27
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,440
I don't believe you.

28
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,480
Let's do this, everyone.

29
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,680
If you want to stay,

30
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,680
stay a bit longer.

31
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,800
I'll take my leave now.

32
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,520
Let's go.

33
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,410
Let's go.

34
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,730
Director Cheng.

35
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,440
Director Cheng.

36
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,160
The meeting isn't over yet.

37
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,520
Where are you all going?

38
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,079
Dad.

39
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,520
What's the rush?

40
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,240
Sit down.

41
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,000
This seat is yours.

42
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,620
No one can take it away.

43
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,980
My son will take over my position.

44
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,100
Is there a problem?

45
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,800
Hey.

46
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,840
I've worked with Shen Yifan's PR team

47
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,480
to develop five contingency plans.

48
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,120
No matter what they release today,

49
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,240
we have ways to counter it.

50
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,000
Got it.

51
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,160
Even if the sky falls,

52
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,700
I, Yu Youyi, will be there to support her.

53
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,180
Holy crap! They really posted it.

54
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,040
Wait, wait.

55
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,560
Something's not right.

56
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,560
What's not right?

57
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,519
Bro,

58
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,320
that's not Zheng Ying and Mr. Shen.

59
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:18,880
What?

60
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,970
Who else could it be?

61
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,640
It's Ni Hao.

62
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,040
He climbed up the stairs with his camera to take photos today.

63
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,000
Then I accidentally fell down.

64
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,520
This...

65
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,320
How did this

66
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,480
gossip end up involving me?

67
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,000
That's ridiculous!

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,440
How could Ni Shang fall for him?

69
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,360
Isn't he the director who caused his junior's death?

70
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,400
Can't my sister have

71
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,880
better taste in men?

72
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,280
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,280
You got dragged into this again.

74
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,000
At least they didn't photograph Ni Hao.

75
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,720
Now all attention

76
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,300
will be focused on you.

77
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,160
So it's better not to let Ni Hao

78
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,420
live with you anymore.

79
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,120
Sister, can you let me stay with you?

80
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,320
I'm sorry, but no.

81
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,280
I'm used to sleeping alone.

82
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,160
Besides,

83
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,620
I need to wake up early for filming tomorrow.

84
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,560
It's understandable when children lie.

85
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,760
But when adults do, it's unforgivable.

86
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Isn't tomorrow the filming of Ni Shang and Wan Yuchen's

87
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,760
big capture scene?

88
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,690
You have a day off tomorrow.

89
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,159
Why are you lying to the child?

90
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:37,920
You're shameless.

91
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,200
I'm shameless?

92
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,920
You're the one pushing your own mess onto me.

93
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,640
Making me worry and fear,

94
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,900
even causing issues between me and Shen.

95
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,320
Anyway,

96
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,280
you're the shameless one.

97
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,720
Sister, I'm cold.

98
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,880
You clever little thing.

99
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,760
Come on in.

100
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,440
Good night, Dad.

101
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,560
I'll leave the child with you.

102
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,360
I'm going now.

103
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,280
Wait.

104
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,020
Let's have a moment of honesty before you go.

105
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,050
A talented graduate from the Film Academy's cinematography department.

106
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,810
Documentaries winning numerous awards abroad.

107
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,290
The most promising new-generation documentary director.

108
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,880
That was before.

109
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,920
No wonder the comic leak mentioned

110
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,180
a mysterious man with a double identity.

111
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,560
So you went from documentary director

112
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,620
to suddenly becoming a talent agent.

113
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,360
Tell me,

114
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
being by my side,

115
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,800
are you on some secret mission?

116
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,000
I just...

117
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,960
I ran out of creativity

118
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,720
and changed careers to make a living.

119
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,480
What's with that look?

120
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,480
This is my 'I don't believe a word you're saying' face.

121
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,120
Dad,

122
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,000
you know how to film?

123
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,200
Why did you stop?

124
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,000
Is he asleep?

125
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,440
We weren't the ones who leaked it.

126
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,120
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,210
No, wait.

128
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,890
Why should I apologize?

129
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,880
Even if we weren't the ones who leaked it,

130
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,000
it doesn't change the fact

131
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,200
that he wants to deny our relationship.

132
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,560
Time to sleep.

133
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,240
Zhuo Hao.

134
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,560
Set up the tripod over there first.

135
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,320
Later this evening,

136
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,800
we'll shoot a sunset time-lapse.

137
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,640
I'll shoot here for a while.

138
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,200
Okay.

139
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,320
Senior.

140
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,200
Haozi.

141
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,360
My son.

142
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,200
Give me back my Zhuo Hao.

143
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,320
Give him back to me.

144
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,640
My son.

145
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,960
Return Zhuo Hao to me.

146
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,040
Give me back my son.

147
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,170
Let's go.

148
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,330
Come with me.

149
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,320
You can't watch anymore.

150
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,240
Zhuo Hao is gone.

151
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,770
Let's go.

152
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,460
Morning, Nishang.

153
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,450
Morning.

154
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,600
Um,

155
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,120
is Youyi

156
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,380
not here today?

157
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,320
He's your agent.

158
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,280
Why are you asking me?

159
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,280
You're right.

160
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,720
I guess he's not here.

161
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,040
These netizens

162
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,240
are something else.

163
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,640
They all think they're

164
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,100
archaeological experts.

165
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,480
They dig up all those

166
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,210
ancient, irrelevant matters.

167
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,130
Don't insult archaeologists.

168
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,120
Archaeologists restore history,

169
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,380
while some internet users fabricate it.

170
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,120
So,

171
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,240
those rumors claiming Brother Friendship killed

172
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
his fellow disciple out of jealousy

173
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,000
are completely false.

174
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,840
Right?

175
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,370
Do you believe that?

176
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,760
Of course I don't.

177
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,160
But

178
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,040
many people online already believe it.

179
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,460
He hasn't wronged anyone.

180
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,480
Please stop these malicious attacks.

181
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,240
Oh my!

182
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,760
This is huge drama!

183
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,760
Miss Zheng Ying,

184
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,160
your breakfast is ready.

185
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,100
This is for you.

186
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,120
10 o'clock at the park campsite.

187
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,400
Be there or be square.

188
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,440
You think I'll just go because you say so?

189
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,300
That would make me look pathetic.

190
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,240
Ni Hao kept insisting on coming,

191
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,900
so I had to bring her along.

192
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,660
Sorry for the trouble.

193
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,460
Come on,

194
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,760
isn't this fun?

195
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,000
Sister, the trees here are so tall!

196
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,800
And there's a stream over there.

197
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,160
Yes,

198
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,560
and there's also a big pond over there

199
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,880
with lots and lots of fish.

200
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,520
Sister, I'm so glad you decided to come after all,

201
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,920
or I would have missed seeing all this.

202
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,520
Well, you wanted to come,

203
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,400
so I had to agree.

204
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,480
How about Uncle Wu Yu takes you to see the fish?

205
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,000
Okay.

206
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,520
Let's go.

207
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,160
Come with me to see the fish.

208
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,600
Off we go.

209
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,520
Let's go.

210
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,720
Let's keep some distance.

211
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,160
If someone takes photos of us,

212
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,560
it would be such a hassle.

213
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,660
What are you doing?

214
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,880
Making amends.

215
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,300
Providing personal service.

216
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,760
Who needs it?

217
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,480
Whether you want it or not, I'm doing it.

218
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,440
You don't have to be literally this close.

219
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,370
How can it be personal service if I'm not close to you?

220
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,360
We're out of coffee.

221
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,600
Coming.

222
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,080
Coming.

223
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,520
What's wrong?

224
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,960
Doesn't taste good?

225
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,680
It's fine.

226
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,880
Just a bit hot.

227
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,580
Are you still mad at me?

228
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,240
It'll take three pork trotters,

229
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,360
ten chicken feet,

230
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,720
and a hundred bags of snacks

231
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,980
to make me feel better.

232
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,480
No problem.

233
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,880
Luckily I came prepared.

234
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,720
Just wait.

235
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,680
How are you? Are you okay?

236
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,240
I'm fine.

237
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,650
You should rest. I can handle this.

238
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,480
I'm actually really good at barbecuing.

239
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,880
My grandfather is from Jinzhou, after all.

240
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,850
No need. Let me do it.

241
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,920
Go wash your face in the bathroom first,

242
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,450
then we can grill together.

243
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,940
Alright. Wait for me then.

244
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,480
Wait for me, okay?

245
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,360
Got it.

246
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,200
What's wrong, Ni Hao?

247
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,720
Weren't you looking at the fish?

248
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,780
Why are you crying?

249
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,440
Did Wu Yu bully you?

250
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,240
How would I dare to bully him?

251
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,970
I took Ni Hao to play over there,

252
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,460
and some kid seems to have broken his camera.

253
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,480
Where's my little boss Shen?

254
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,050
He went to the bathroom.

255
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,680
Then I'll leave him with you for now.

256
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,160
I'll go find my boss Shen.

257
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,560
Be good.

258
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,680
I took so many photos.

259
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,600
Are they all gone now?

260
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,080
I wanted to show them to my parents.

261
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,490
Let me look for them.

262
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,240
Look.

263
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,560
Are these all the ones you took?

264
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,200
Yes.

265
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,210
If I go public with this.

266
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,720
Then for her entire life,

267
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,200
she'll be labeled as Shen Yifan's woman.

268
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,960
That label.

269
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,480
She won't be allowed to have any happiness.

270
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,970
Otherwise people will say,

271
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,490
'Shen Yifan is dead,

272
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,980
how can you still be smiling?'

273
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,730
She especially can't have any romantic relationships.

274
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,260
She would have to live under everyone's scrutiny and supervision

275
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,210
for the rest of her life.

276
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,600
I found her

277
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,780
because I wanted to help her succeed,

278
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,960
to help her become the best version of herself.

279
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,800
I couldn't be with her while I was alive,

280
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,520
and I certainly can't

281
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,680
become her shackle after death.

282
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,400
Sister, why are you crying?

283
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm here.

284
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,760
What's wrong?

285
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,760
It's nothing.

286
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,280
The smoke is irritating my eyes.

287
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,040
Let's stop grilling.

288
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,480
He bought the charcoal,

289
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,810
let him do the grilling.

290
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:40,890
Let's go.

291
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,210
Let's go.

292
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,050
Let's go. I'll hold your hand on this side.

293
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,400
Slow down. Slow down.

294
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,960
Are you cold?

295
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,080
What's wrong?

296
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,680
Mr. Shen.

297
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,640
We were photographed today.

298
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,100
We weren't that intimate.

299
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,640
We can still deny it.

300
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,200
Right?

301
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,500
I'll handle it.

302
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,100
Don't worry too much about it.

303
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,480
My agent said

304
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,240
I'm at a rising point in my career.

305
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,680
Maintaining a single status

306
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,480
would be better for me anyway.

307
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,520
I understand.

308
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,920
[Symbols]

309
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,260
Does it have to be this way?

310
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,000
Employee.

311
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,690
You're home.

312
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,640
Thank you for driving me home, boss.

313
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:57,960
Well, I...

314
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,360
Didn't you say

315
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,560
we should keep our distance?

316
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,960
Who said I wanted to keep distance from you?

317
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:09,880
What?

318
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,580
Do you want to keep your distance from me?

319
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:13,960
No.

320
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:32,880
By the way,

321
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,680
when are you going back to Switzerland?

322
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,450
Tomorrow night, 8 o'clock flight.

323
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:49,960
Hey,

324
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,280
Youyi.

325
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,340
Do I have any scenes tomorrow?

326
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,200
Nothing during the day.

327
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,800
There's a night shoot in the evening.

328
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,860
You don't need to rush back to the set.

329
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,040
What?

330
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,580
Are you going to see me off?

331
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,760
Shen Yifan,

332
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,760
let's go on a date

333
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,320
tomorrow.

334
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,460
Where's Cheng Moyang?

335
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,140
Where's Cheng Moyang?

336
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,120
Looking for me?

337
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,120
I want a drink.

338
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,240
I never thought Director Cheng, who's been so high and mighty all his life,

339
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,570
would one day have to beg me for something.

340
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,570
You little brat!

341
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,120
I'm not dead yet,

342
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,980
and you dare...

343
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,050
Director Cheng,

344
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,530
if you want to hit me or curse me,

345
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,680
you'll have to stand up first,

346
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:20,600
right?

347
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,560
I...

348
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,080
Mr. Cheng, what should we do?

349
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,400
The chairman insists on refusing treatment.

350
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,560
You're a doctor and I'm a doctor.

351
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,840
Why are you asking me what to do?

352
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,640
I don't care what methods you use.

353
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,720
Just cure him.

354
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,780
Do you understand?

355
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,740
What's wrong with you?

356
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,600
If you're afraid to make your relationship public,

357
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,360
why be together in the first place?

358
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,400
And if you've chosen to be together,

359
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,130
why are you afraid to go public?

360
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,080
You think because you're sick,

361
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,640
you can do whatever you want?

362
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,100
Making others pay for your mistakes, right?

363
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,880
You're not a real man.

364
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,600
Mr. Shen.

365
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,580
Since we have a date tomorrow,

366
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,080
to save time,

367
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,580
should we prepare something in advance?

368
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,880
It's just one day,

369
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,080
so what if we waste it,

370
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,800
let's do whatever she wants.

371
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,360
We only have one day,

372
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,560
what should we do?

373
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,280
Matching outfits?

374
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,480
It's too late to order those now.

375
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,520
Revolving restaurant?

376
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,080
Revolving restaurant...

377
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,940
They only have tables after 9 p.m.

378
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,120
Experience a lifetime in one day.

379
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,680
Yifan,

380
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,960
there are so many things I want to do with you in this lifetime,

381
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,080
but we might not have enough time.

382
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,440
So let's use this one day

383
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,100
to live out our entire life together.

384
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,640
Mr. Shen, you're awake.

385
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,240
As you instructed,

386
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,440
I haven't scheduled any work for today.

387
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,080
So this is what it feels like

388
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,400
to idle away time.

389
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,050
Why are you here?

390
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,840
Shen Yifan.

391
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,010
Why did you misplace your wedding ring again?

392
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,400
As a married person,

393
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,080
didn't I tell you

394
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,440
that wedding rings

395
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,720
must never be lost?

396
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,400
Alright,

397
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,200
Mrs. Shen,

398
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,500
I was wrong.

399
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,040
Since your attitude is good,

400
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,480
I'll forgive you this time.

401
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,200
But don't let it happen again.

402
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,700
It won't happen again.

403
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,400

404
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,800
