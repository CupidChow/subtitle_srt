1
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,180
Let's move.

2
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,900
Is that necessary?

3
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,800
The video of your confrontation with Chengdong

4
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,080
has already topped three trending topics.

5
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,280
Plus his apology video

6
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,410
topped another two.

7
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,479
You're making history here.

8
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's go, superstar.

9
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,479
Zheng Ying is coming out!

10
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,280
Miss Zheng,

11
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,060
could you say a few words to us?

12
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,320
Excuse us,

13
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,920
thank you.

14
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,080
Miss Zheng!

15
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,160
Stop taking sneaky photos from that tree!

16
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,290
Stop taking photos!

17
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,780
What are you doing?

18
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,960
Do you know how much one of your

19
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,490
leaked set photos is worth?

20
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,210
Good. Look to your right, Miss.

21
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,680
Good.

22
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:50,880
Let's take a break, Miss.

23
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,560
Thank you.

24
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,130
Have some water.

25
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,080
Thank you for your hard work today.

26
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,640
Thank you.

27
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,280
It's my duty.

28
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,810
This way.

29
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,920
Mr. Shen.

30
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,570
Are you feeling better?

31
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,600
How is she doing?

32
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,820
Don't worry, Mr. Shen.

33
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,640
The news about Chengdong's alcohol dependency

34
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,840
has been made public.

35
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,920
He has already apologized.

36
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
This turn of events

37
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,680
has earned Zheng Ying a lot of public support.

38
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,520
She's getting numerous invitations now.

39
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,160
Tomorrow,

40
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,200
she'll be attending

41
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,330
a famous charity gala in the industry.

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,880
Mr. Shen.

43
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,000
She can manage on her own now.

44
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,410
She really doesn't need my help after all.

45
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,200
Yes, Mr. Shen.

46
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,200
Zheng Ying is now

47
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,079
a very mature and popular star.

48
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,200
Our initial mission

49
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,530
has been accomplished.

50
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,320
Mr. Shen,

51
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,240
you'll definitely get better.

52
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,300
The doctor said...

53
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,480
It's okay.

54
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,600
Don't worry.

55
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,960
I won't give up.

56
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,280
Just as she hoped,

57
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,040
I must hold on until I can get the heart transplant.

58
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,770
Mr. Shen Senior said

59
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,800
he'll find a way.

60
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,570
He's probably busy.

61
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,900
After all, he's a big shot.

62
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,880
The line of people wanting to see him

63
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,880
could stretch all the way to France.

64
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,040
I know.

65
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,560
That's why

66
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,290
I haven't bothered him either.

67
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,400
Are you ready?

68
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,240
I'm ready.

69
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,180
It's so beautiful.

70
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,159
You insisted on taking extra painkillers

71
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,720
just to see her once?

72
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,160
If only you were here

73
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,200
for occasions like this.

74
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,120
I'm too busy.

75
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,050
Maybe next time.

76
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,650
Alright.

77
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,080
Next, we have the popular actress

78
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,160
Zheng Ying coming to the stage

79
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,200
to light up

80
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,660
the guiding lamp of tonight's charity gala.

81
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,760
Zheng Ying.

82
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,290
Don't be impulsive.

83
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,400
Times have changed.

84
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,720
Once your relationship with Shen Yifan becomes public,

85
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,760
you'll be labeled as

86
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,820
someone who didn't earn her success.

87
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,940
All your hard work will be wasted.

88
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,780
Go to the hospital.

89
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,320
Why doesn't he say anything?

90
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,440
Mr. Shen is in this ward.

91
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,040
I'll do as you say.

92
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,520
Okay.

93
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,320
Goodbye.

94
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,920
What's wrong?

95
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,410
Why are you in the hospital?

96
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,800
I've

97
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,050
caught a cold recently.

98
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,220
Wu Yu made a big fuss and insisted I be hospitalized.

99
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,290
The reason I didn't come see you

100
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,290
I was also afraid of infecting you.

101
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,880
Then why didn't you answer my calls?

102
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,210
Why didn't I answer?

103
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,530
I had an important meeting.

104
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,860
But I was afraid of missing your call.

105
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,480
So I left my phone with him.

106
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,410
Who knew he wouldn't answer it.

107
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,160
The phone died.

108
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,640
It turned off.

109
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,000
Your salary for this month...

110
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,320
Don't even think about getting it.

111
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,250
Go charge it now.

112
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,840
Hurry up.

113
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,200
Go now.

114
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,080
Don't be angry.

115
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,280
Look,

116
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,570
I've docked his pay for a month.

117
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,090
Don't be upset anymore.

118
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,280
Have an apple.

119
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,160
These days,

120
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,520
I've been really worried about you.

121
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,040
I'm sorry.

122
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,840
Promise me,

123
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,040
don't hide anything from me in the future.

124
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,520
Tell me immediately.

125
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,480
Okay?

126
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,000
Okay.

127
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,520
I'm Rebecca's colleague

128
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,780
here to do a routine check-up on Mr. Shen.

129
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,040
You might need to wait a moment.

130
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,320
After the injection,

131
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,810
has Mr. Shen shown any adverse reactions?

132
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,440
None so far.

133
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,280
Well,

134
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,010
it's still in clinical trials.

135
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,010
There are many uncertainties.

136
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,290
We need to monitor him constantly.

137
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,000
Doctor,

138
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,800
That medicine, can we still...

139
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,730
This medication

140
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,600
is quite controversial now.

141
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,730
Sacrificing what little life remains

142
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,000
to regain

143
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,720
temporary mobility -

144
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,920
this aspect

145
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,520
has been criticized by many.

146
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,600
Besides,

147
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,320
Mr. Shen's physical condition

148
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,380
is extremely poor.

149
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,840
Even if you could get the medication

150
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,280
from the Swiss pharmaceutical institute,

151
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,080
I won't administer any more injections.

152
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,760
Otherwise,

153
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,020
I'm afraid he might...

154
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,600
I understand.

155
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,720
Thank you.

156
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,800
I'm perfectly fine.

157
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,260
What are you doing?

158
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,930
It's been half an hour and they're still not here.

159
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,560
If the paparazzi catch this,

160
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,220
it would cause a huge scandal.

161
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,600
Hey.

162
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,250
What are you doing here?

163
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,130
You're sick.

164
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,480
It's Ni Hao.

165
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,240
He was carrying his camera today

166
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,880
and climbing up the stairs to take photos.

167
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,360
Then he accidentally fell down.

168
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,280
Where is he now?

169
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,600
Dad.

170
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,120
How could you be so careless?

171
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,650
Does your wound still hurt?

172
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,640
I'm a big boy.

173
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,640
This little injury is nothing.

174
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,560
Dad.

175
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,640
Look.

176
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,000
I took these.

177
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,360
I captured the entire

178
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,960
sunset process.

179
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,440
They're really good.

180
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,800
But next time you take photos,

181
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,320
don't go to dangerous places, okay?

182
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,800
Understand?

183
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,440
Dad.

184
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,880
Are they really that good?

185
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,160
Of course.

186
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,120
I can already see

187
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,160
a rising star

188
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,480
in photography.

189
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,380
When I become a photographer,

190
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,160
I'll teach you how to take photos.

191
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,960
Will you be

192
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,490
my photography assistant?

193
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,560
I'm making a renowned documentary director

194
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,240
serve as my assistant.

195
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,280
That's ridiculous.

196
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,480
Senior,

197
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,840
stop teasing me.

198
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,480
My win over you last time

199
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,680
was just a fluke.

200
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,400
I know where I fall short.

201
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,880
I want to learn more from you.

202
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,240
I don't think that's a good idea.

203
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,400
People are saying that we

204
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,240
don't get along.

205
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,240
That's exactly why

206
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,800
I should be your assistant.

207
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,400
But I need someone

208
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,720
who can endure hardship

209
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,980
and doesn't talk much.

210
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,000
What a coincidence!

211
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,880
I happen to be someone who talks very little

212
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,340
and can handle tough work.

213
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,720
This is a photo I took of my mom.

214
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,450
She looks so beautiful.

215
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,560
Haven't you

216
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,280
moved on yet?

217
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,880
What's up, Ying?

218
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,800
Still want me to pretend I'm Shen Yifan today?

219
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,560
Of course.

220
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,160
I'm staying loyal to the end.

221
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,060
The moonlight tonight

222
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,570
is truly beautiful.

223
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,400
What are you doing?

224
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,680
No matter how beautiful the moonlight is,

225
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,480
it can't compare to your beauty.

226
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,690
Do you say this to every girl, General?

227
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,880
I only say this to you.

228
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,850
I don't believe you.

229
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,080
It suits you well.

230
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,840
A return gift.

231
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,890
Were you waiting for me?

232
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,420
You've got some nerve.

233
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,010
Just passing by.

234
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,120
But I was waiting for you.

235
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,040
What?

236
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,160
Will you be my wife?

237
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,120
Wife?

238
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,920
The fate between us

239
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,820
was destined from our first meeting.

240
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,680
I cannot let you down.

241
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,040
This dagger

242
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,440
has accompanied me on many battlefields for years.

243
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,840
Today I present it to you.

244
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,920
As a token

245
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,320
of our love.

246
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,280
The role I played this time

247
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,560
was quite challenging,

248
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,160
especially the action scenes.

249
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,220
Speaking of which,

250
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,920
I must express my gratitude.

251
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,920
Mr. Zheng's help.

252
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,680
No, no.

253
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,520
Actually,

254
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,960
Yuchen is really dedicated.

255
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,080
She does almost all the action scenes herself.

256
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,760
Her talent

257
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,520
shouldn't be underestimated.

258
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,280
Well, Xiaoying,

259
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:12,880
what do you think about

260
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,720
the cartoon exposé from the 'Weekly Entertainment Blast' blogger?

261
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,720
What's your opinion?

262
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,960
Many netizens are guessing it's about you.

263
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,760
Do you have any response to this?

264
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,810
Entertainment Weekly Gossip.

265
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,560
It's about me.

266
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,000
I told you already

267
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,840
to be extra careful.

268
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,000
Don't lose your mind the moment you see each other.

269
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
How did you still get photographed?

270
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,040
Female celebrity

271
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
with mystery man.

272
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,920
This is way too vague.

273
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,500
Maybe they're not even talking about me.

274
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,040
A popular actress

275
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,690
with a double identity.

276
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,440
Plus the poster of Zuiyu Tuishan.

277
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,980
If it's not you,

278
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,600
then who else could it be?

279
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,040
Well,

280
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,920
can we pay

281
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,599
to make it go away?

282
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,800
You think I don't want to?

283
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,480
The problem is this Weekly Entertainment Exposé

284
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,200
is completely incorruptible.

285
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,040
In his hands,

286
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,240
there's no scandal that can be managed.

287
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,480
Even if Shen Yifan showed up, it wouldn't help.

288
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,760
What should we do then?

289
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,800
We have no idea

290
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,400
what cards they're holding.

291
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,920
If we deny it,

292
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,720
we could easily be proven wrong.

293
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:29,880
So,

294
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,930
do you want to go public?

295
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,760
Yes.

296
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,220
Then I'll inform Yu Youyi.

297
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,160
But I can't.

298
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,760
You can't.

299
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,240
It's been less than six hours since the news broke.

300
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,960
The Rulanshi ad that was a sure thing

301
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,520
has now gone to someone else.

302
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,520
And those endorsements with contracts about to expire

303
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,720
have also informed us

304
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,600
they're putting things on hold.

305
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,660
If you reveal your relationship now,

306
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,460
do you know how much you stand to lose?

307
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,160
All my hard work and achievements

308
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,580
will no longer be associated with me.

309
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,840
But,

310
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,600
I think this is all temporary.

311
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,610
Good acting speaks for itself.

312
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,800
My work

313
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,240
will prove my efforts.

314
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,180
Brother Youyi,

315
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,760
I believe

316
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,220
my relationship isn't a burden to my career.

317
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,320
Besides,

318
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,580
Shen Yifan has been helping me all along.

319
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,400
I don't want to deny

320
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,280
my relationship with him for profit.

321
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,880
That wouldn't be fair to him.

322
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,380
What about Shen Yifan?

323
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,460
Do you think he wants to go public too?

324
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,440
He

325
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,280
is definitely willing too.

326
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,210
If he's willing,

327
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,680
then why hasn't he

328
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,210
given you any response yet?

329
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,840
Maybe

330
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,720
he's busy

331
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,980
and hasn't seen it yet.

332
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,700
I'll go ask him.

333
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,860
No matter what,

334
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,180
you must focus on your career.

335
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,120
We men

336
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,730
are unreliable.

337
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,280
But what if

338
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,280
they release solid evidence in the next few days?

339
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,680
Even solid evidence can be denied.

340
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,280
Why?

341
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,000
Shen Yiyang,

342
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,440
are you not planning

343
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,440
to get that medicine for me anymore?

344
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,560
The doctor

345
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,080
doesn't recommend continuing it either.

346
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,680
Is he already

347
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,840
arranging for me to return to Switzerland soon?

348
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,400
Mr. Shen,

349
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,160
Mr. Shen has already established

350
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,240
contact with the research institute.

351
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,640
Everything is prepared.

352
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,040
If we go back now,

353
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,170
there's still hope.

354
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,000
Madam.

355
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,090
Madam, the General is missing.

356
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,000
Mingjing.

357
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,980
Why are you treating me like this?

358
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,160
Who is this lady warrior?

359
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,960
Throwing yourself at me

360
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,130
for what reason?

361
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,800
Of course

362
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,360
to kidnap an innocent man.

363
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,520
Today you'll comply whether you want to

364
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,920
or not.

365
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,020
If that's the case,

366
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,180
I'll just go along with it.

367
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,810
Are you feeling better?

368
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,850
That's why I could come see you.

369
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,040
Are you tired?

370
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,200
Excuse me, sorry to interrupt.

371
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,320
Yu Youyi called.

372
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,850
She's asking Zheng Ying to change her makeup.

373
00:21:59,320 --> 00:21:59,920
It's okay.

374
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,180
I'll wait for you at the hotel.

375
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,480
Go ahead.

376
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm going.

377
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,410
I don't mind the sun.

378
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,440
Don't let anyone photograph you meeting Mr. Shen privately.

379
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,080
Trouble.

380
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,400
Trouble.

381
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,360
I'm just trouble to him.

382
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,800
New materials.

383
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,840
[Reason: developed feelings over time, she filmed with him]

384
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,770
The two developed feelings while working together.

385
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,520
The actress has worked on films with the actor.

386
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,680
The two were seen

387
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,960
being intimate on set.

388
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,060
They might as well publish your ID numbers next.

389
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,760
May I ask how

390
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,760
you plan to respond?

391
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,060
Let's not respond for now.

392
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,560
This is already the second wave.

393
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,640
Rumor has it that after tonight,

394
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,920
they'll release actual video footage.

395
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,160
What are we

396
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,360
going to do then?

397
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,900
The PR department is already on standby.

398
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,560
They'll craft an appropriate response

399
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,760
based on whatever video gets released.

400
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,130
That's good.

401
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,040
After all,

402
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,570
Xiaoying is at a critical point in her career.

403
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,480
Maintaining a single status

404
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,940
is always the safe choice.

405
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,400
Alright then.

406
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,740
I'll head back now.

407
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,840
Get some rest.

408
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,860
I'm also involved in this.

409
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,960
Aren't you going to ask how I want to respond?

410
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,680
I know.

411
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,420
Denying our relationship

412
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,880
might upset you.

413
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,240
But right now,

414
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,960
it's the most appropriate solution.

415
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,800
Otherwise, there will be many complications later.

416
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,680
Trouble.

417
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,200
So,

418
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,640
am I really just a burden to you?

419
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,360
No,

420
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,920
I'm just worried about your future.

421
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,200
Afraid I'll be trouble?

422
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,400
But I don't care.

423
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,880
I believe I can handle things well.

424
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,220
Besides, you're right by my side.

425
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,680
Even if I can't handle it,

426
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,450
you'll have my back, won't you?

427
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,760
You're so capable.

428
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,480
These little troubles are nothing to you,

429
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,360
right?

430
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,640
Why aren't you saying anything?

431
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,600
Is this relationship with me

432
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,000
really so embarrassing to you?

433
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,720
I'm going back first.

434
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,160
Get some rest.

435
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,050
You're hiding something, aren't you?

436
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,000
Tell me.

437
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,100
Good night.

438
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,360
Mr. Shen.

439
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,880
I made her angry.

440
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,120
Mr. Shen.

441
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,420
Please stop torturing yourself.

442
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,680
Didn't you say you would

443
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,080
for this girl who brightens others' lives,

444
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,620
be more proactive about your treatment?

445
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,720
Then why can't you make your relationship public?

446
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,840
If I make it public,

447
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,440
then for her entire life,

448
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,240
she will always be labeled

449
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,040
as 'Shen Yifan's woman.'

450
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,520
She won't be allowed to have any happiness,

451
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,040
or people will say,

452
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,480
'Shen Yifan is dead,

453
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,480
how can you still smile?'

454
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,240
She won't be allowed to have any romantic relationships.

455
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,460
She would have to live her entire life

456
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,730
under everyone's scrutiny and judgment.

457
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,160
I found her

458
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,210
to help her succeed,

459
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,440
to help her become the best version of herself.

460
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,130
I can't be with her while I'm alive,

461
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,160
and I certainly can't

462
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,330
become her burden after death.

463
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,880
Uncle, why are you crying?

464
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,840
We're not crying.

465
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,880
You're just acting, right?

466
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,010
If this were really just a play,

467
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,280
that would be wonderful.
