1
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,720
Do you know why I hate you so much

2
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,520
and still let you play the supporting female role?

3
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,660
Too much salt in your diet?

4
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,360
Because I'm not only going to steal your boyfriend,

5
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,160
but also make you completely get out of the entertainment industry.

6
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,880
Come on, lady.

7
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,200
Ms. Chen! Ms. Chen!

8
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,840
Ms. Chen, are you okay?

9
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,640
Are you hurt? Where did you fall?

10
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,900
Call an ambulance!

11
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,960
Call an ambulance!

12
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,800
Hurry!

13
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,160
Call 120 quickly!

14
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,880
What happened? Did anyone see what happened?

15
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,680
I don't know, but Qingqing is hurt.

16
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,000
Oh my god, Qingqing!

17
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,160
I'm fine.

18
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,640
Zheng Ying didn't do it on purpose.

19
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,400
Please don't blame her.

20
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,120
Oh my god, she did it deliberately!

21
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,440
What a cruel woman!

22
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,800
She's jealous of our Qingqing's beauty and popularity.

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,079
Our sweet Qingqing is so kind and innocent

24
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,680
and still speaks well of her.

25
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,400
Qingqing is just too nice.

26
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,360
But we can't let her be bullied like this

27
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,800
Don't let that woman get away with it!

28
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,680
- Let's go.

29
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,660
- Let's go.
- Go.

30
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,840
You can't do this.

31
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,760
You can't do this.

32
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,720
Catch her!

33
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,320
You can't do this!

34
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:42,850
Let's go!

35
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,880
Stop them!

36
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
Something this serious happened

37
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,640
and you're still eating snacks?

38
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,500
You're really not worried at all.

39
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,800
Isn't she fine?

40
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,360
I didn't touch her,

41
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,400
nor did I get near her.

42
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,360
The truth will come to light.

43
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,680
Justice is in people's hearts.

44
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,880
What do I have to fear?

45
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,240
Look.

46
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,640
But what everyone sees is Chen Qing inciting keyboard warriors

47
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,170
to fabricate the truth in the name of justice.

48
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,530
These are all photos from my acting roles.

49
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,360
May I ask your opinion on the recent

50
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,600
pushing incident that's trending online?

51
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,040
Pushing someone is wrong no matter where it happens.

52
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,720
This kind of behavior is illegal, isn't it?

53
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,600
I've known Chen Qing for a long time.

54
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,280
She's a very sweet and gentle girl.

55
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,320
And according to my friend

56
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,680
who witnessed this on set,

57
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,160
this incident is actually true.

58
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,000
Get out of the production!

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,560
Get out of the production!

60
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,000
Leave the entertainment industry!

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,360
Get out completely!

62
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,960
I found it.

63
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,600
Chen Qing hired people to manipulate public opinion.

64
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,200
But you're personally delivering yourself to her doorstep.

65
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,320
What do you mean I'm delivering myself?

66
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,920
I'm opening a door for her.

67
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,720
Mr. Shen.

68
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,640
What?

69
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,040
Well...

70
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,900
I've heard about your recent situation.

71
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,240
Do you need help?

72
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,440
Right now,

73
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,280
asking me for help

74
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,880
is your best solution.

75
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,220
So why are you still...

76
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,600
I do need help.

77
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,360
I know with your abilities,

78
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,620
you could definitely solve my problems.

79
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,480
But I'll say it again.

80
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,520
My own problems,

81
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,200
I'll handle them myself.

82
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,180
Should we go after him?

83
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,440
No need.

84
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,520
That was such a good opportunity.

85
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,250
Why didn't you ask for his help?

86
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,120
Are you afraid

87
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,920
the crew will gossip about you two again?

88
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,040
Gossip is just gossip. It's not true.

89
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,280
I can solve my own problems.

90
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,640
Didn't Zheng Banqiao once say,

91
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,680
Eat your own food, sweat your own sweat,

92
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,680
rely on heaven, earth, and ancestors,

93
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,960
and you're no real man.

94
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,050
Did Zheng Banqiao really say that?

95
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,960
Of course he did.

96
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,880
Alright.

97
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,000
I guess I wasn't wrong about you.

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,460
I'll go borrow some money.

99
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,060
What do you need money for?

100
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,040
To hire internet trolls.

101
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,640
We need to suppress the public opinion, right?

102
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,900
I never expected Wan Yuchen to speak up for justice.

103
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,840
I have an idea.

104
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,680
What idea?

105
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,680
Wan Yuchen likes acting,

106
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,440
and loves criticizing even more.

107
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,840
But what he loves most

108
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,400
is gossip.

109
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,970
He was filming from across the camera.

110
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,600
Facing Chen Qing directly.

111
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,460
He must have captured something.

112
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,720
Quick.

113
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,480
Tell us your story.

114
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,680
I'm really not a gossip.

115
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,240
I really don't know anything.

116
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,760
Please stop asking me.

117
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,920
Then what about that post you made

118
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,920
saying I was framed?

119
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,320
Did you see something?

120
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,720
Otherwise, you two-faced person,

121
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,520
why are you suddenly so righteous and brave?

122
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,050
Aren't you afraid your agent will shelve you?

123
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,140
I don't give a damn.

124
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,680
My contract expires in six months.

125
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,810
Is he going to shelve me for six months?

126
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,120
I...

127
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,640
I posted that

128
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,480
just to get some attention.

129
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,380
So you really didn't see anything

130
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,560
or hear anything?

131
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,960
Sister,

132
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,400
I really am not a gossip.

133
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,400
I just happened to pass by there.

134
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,980
Don't think I'm scamming you by taking your 300.

135
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,130
These are the female lead and second lead of our show.

136
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,320
Whenever these two are together,

137
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,780
it's always spectacular.

138
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,920
Will there be juicy gossip tomorrow?

139
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,600
If you want to know,

140
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,720
join group 25.

141
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,640
Do you know why I hate you so much

142
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,450
yet still want you to play the second female lead?

143
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,800
I'll get right on it.

144
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,200
Great!

145
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,380
I'll never complain about your gossip habit again.

146
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,080
How many times do I have to tell you?

147
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,560
I just happened to be passing by.

148
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,320
My shoelace just happened to come undone.

149
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,000
I just happened to squat down to tie it.

150
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,520
I just happened to overhear your conversation.

151
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,050
And I just happened to record it with my phone.

152
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,920
Your 'just happened'

153
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,480
just happened to save me.

154
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,050
How perfectly convenient!

155
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,360
What's wrong?

156
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,660
Where does it hurt?

157
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,680
I'm feeling upset right now.

158
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,960
I originally wanted to use some tricks to drive her away.

159
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,960
But now

160
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,039
there are even more people sympathizing with her online.

161
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,880
Why don't we

162
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,640
just let it go?

163
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,600
She's just a D-list celebrity.

164
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,440
You're on a different level, right?

165
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,840
Don't stoop to her level.

166
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,320
What?

167
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,580
Are you feeling sorry for her now?

168
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,880
You can proceed now.

169
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,240
Solving problems with your own abilities

170
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,400
feels good, doesn't it?

171
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,730
Of course it feels good.

172
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,320
After this video was released,

173
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,520
netizens said they misunderstood you before,

174
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,920
and they've all turned from haters to fans.

175
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,400
Look, you really can't tell

176
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,360
that it's her.

177
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,920
What's wrong?

178
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,260
#Guan Naiying#

179
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,680
I...

180
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,330
I'll go wait backstage. See you later.

181
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,000
Using such despicable means.

182
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,560
Get out of the entertainment industry! Get out of our crew!

183
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,880
Tell the crisis PR department

184
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,680
to respond within half an hour.

185
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,600
What is she doing?

186
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,600
Why hasn't she come to me yet?

187
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,960
What's going on?

188
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:16,920
Wait.

189
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,600
I spent so much money,

190
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,130
why can't I see our clarification statement?

191
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,600
Sorry, Mr. Yu,

192
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,040
there are too many negative posts.

193
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,760
They're all ranking ahead of us.

194
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,800
We can't improve our metrics at all.

195
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,840
I...

196
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,060
This show took me five years to write.

197
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,960
Just the preparation alone took two years.

198
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,920
We finally started shooting,

199
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,580
and I need to see it completed.

200
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,600
So...

201
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,680
As for your character,

202
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,680
I can only make her have an accident.

203
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,240
You'll have to wrap up early.

204
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,600
Mr. Shen,

205
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,060
we've already mobilized the crisis PR team.

206
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,600
But too many people are maliciously spreading rumors online.

207
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,660
Public opinion online is still completely one-sided.

208
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,280
You can tell she's not a good girl.

209
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,080
What decent girl would take photos like these?

210
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,040
The rumors about our Qingqing on set a few days ago

211
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,440
might actually be true.

212
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,560
My goodness, what kind of person is she?

213
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,160
Taking photos like these.

214
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,760
The entertainment circle is such a mess, look.

215
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,440
Mom?

216
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,960
What's wrong?

217
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,920
Nothing.

218
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,040
Mom was just checking what you're doing.

219
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,960
Look at you.

220
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,180
You've lost weight in just a few days.

221
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,880
I

222
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,240
just had dinner with some friends from the industry.

223
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,200
I'm planning to see a movie later.

224
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,840
Watching a movie is good.

225
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
Relax a bit.

226
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,650
My daughter did nothing wrong.

227
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,720
You're all girls around the same age.

228
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,800
Please stop criticizing her, okay?

229
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,760
What time is the movie?

230
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,000
Tell Mom about it.

231
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,080
Mom,

232
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,250
my signal is bad here. I'll hang up now.

233
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,130
Let me tell you something, Shen Yifan.

234
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,720
I don't need you interfering in my affairs.

235
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,840
I don't want anything to do with you.

236
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,200
Everyone thinks I'm just riding on someone's coattails.

237
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
Is this what you wanted to see?

238
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,760
Are you trying to ruin me?

239
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,120
But I'll say it again.

240
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,120
My own problems,

241
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,920
I'll handle them myself.

242
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,000
She still

243
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,260
refuses to accept my help.

244
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,680
Zheng Ying left immediately after finishing her scenes.

245
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,040
Didn't even say goodbye.

246
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,700
Can't reach her agent either.

247
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,760
Find a way.

248
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,640
I can't just stand by and do nothing.

249
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,680
Mr. Shen.

250
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,580
Please just let her be.

251
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,010
We need to catch our flight.

252
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,080
Is this matter

253
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,200
destined to remain a regret?

254
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,400
I'll take your photo too.

255
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,040
I don't like having my picture taken.

256
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,680
Who doesn't like having their photo taken?

257
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,880
Come on, skinny.

258
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,280
Hurry up.

259
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,240
Ready now.

260
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,920
If you don't smile,

261
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,580
I won't play with you anymore.

262
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,330
Sweetheart.

263
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,600
When someone bullies you,

264
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
the best response

265
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,200
isn't to hit back or yell back.

266
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,960
It's to make yourself stronger,

267
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,200
far surpassing them.

268
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,960
Do you understand?

269
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,240
Yes, Mom.

270
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,400
I understand.

271
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,400
I'll definitely make myself stronger,

272
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,600
so I can protect you.

273
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,400
Alright, let's go.

274
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,440
Do you know why I hate you so much

275
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,800
yet still had you cast as the second female lead?

276
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,280
Because I not only want to steal your boyfriend,

277
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,560
but also want to kick you out of the entertainment industry for good.

278
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,240
Don't let that woman get away!

279
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,160
As for your character,

280
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,090
I can only make her have an accident

281
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,760
so you'll wrap up early.

282
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,600
I spent so much money,

283
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,660
why can't I see our clarification statement anywhere?

284
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,080
My daughter did nothing wrong.

285
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,800
You're all girls of similar age.

286
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,000
Please stop criticizing her, will you?

287
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,960
Okay, I got it.

288
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,400
The flight has been canceled due to weather conditions.

289
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,200
Looks like we can't leave today.

290
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,200
If it weren't for my help,

291
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,640
you would've been kicked out of the production team by now, you know that?

292
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,840
Coming to me for help now

293
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,160
is your best option.

294
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,760
People with ability,

295
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,840
people with vision,

296
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,000
are those who know how to utilize all resources around them.

297
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,120
Becoming stronger with his help is still becoming stronger.

298
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,520
I need to protect myself.

299
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,820
I can't let my parents worry about me.

300
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,980
You want me to help you?

301
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,560
Not help.

302
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,920
It's cooperation.

303
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,760
The kind that doesn't involve feelings.

304
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,020
Purely professional.

305
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,440
This is indeed a chance to leave no regrets.

306
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,610
I can cooperate.

307
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,720
But all cooperation has standards.

308
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,320
For example,

309
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,640
what would count as successfully helping you?

310
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,600
I need to get through this crisis smoothly.

311
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,840
And also,

312
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:34,720
I...

313
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,740
I want to be famous.

314
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,080
Not super famous,

315
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,320
just more famous than Chen Qing and Gong Jing.

316
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,450
Then they won't dare bully me anymore.

317
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,840
You really are Little Red Zheng,

318
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,040
even your wish is just to be a little bit famous.

319
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,700
The premise of cooperation is

320
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,440
both parties have something of equal value to exchange.

321
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,800
I can make you famous,

322
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,320
but what can you offer me?

323
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,800
I...

324
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,900
My body isn't good,

325
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,260
and my emotions are worse.

326
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,100
I don't have money either.

327
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,840
Oh right,

328
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,440
you don't need money anyway.

329
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,200
Let me think what else I'm good at.

330
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,560
I can't give you anything right now.

331
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,080
But I can make snacks,

332
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,000
homemade with no additives.

333
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,200
If you can imagine it,

334
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,560
I can make it.

335
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,360
As long as you cooperate with me.

336
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,560
I promise from now on,

337
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,200
365 days a year,

338
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,640
24 hours a day,

339
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,640
anytime, anywhere,

340
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,200
whenever you need me,

341
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,280
I'll bring snacks

342
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,210
and appear by your side right away.

343
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,560
One year?

344
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,600
If you think one year isn't enough,

345
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,400
then...

346
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,170
Three years.

347
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,160
Five years, ten years.

348
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,800
Enough.

349
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,760
What's wrong?

350
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,840
I mean,

351
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,320
time isn't an issue for me.

352
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,650
As long as you have time.

353
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,920
I don't.

354
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,520
What?

355
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,440
I mean,

356
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,200
it's a deal.

357
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,240
You agreed.

358
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,980
I believe you're worth it.

359
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,920
Deal.

360
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,880
How do you plan to help me?

361
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,920
Hello, Mr. Shen.

362
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,720
Is this his PR team?

363
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,080
They seem so powerful.

364
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,200
Mr. Shen, the media coverage has been quite objective this time.

365
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,440
But some marketing accounts are maliciously spreading rumors.

366
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:50,970
Mr. Shen.

367
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,000
We've released the facts to all major platforms.

368
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,800
We've arranged to delete all photos related to Zheng Ying.

369
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,280
Including chat records and reposts.

370
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:56,720
Mr. Shen.

371
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,240
We've compiled a list of all accounts with over 500 reposts.

372
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,200
The statistics are complete.

373
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,600
And have been handed over to the legal team.

374
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,400
Yes, Mr. Shen.

375
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,600
We've already sent legal notices

376
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,400
And filed police reports for some on the list.

377
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,880
PR battles are public opinion battles.

378
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,400
Brother,

379
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,240
if we only send legal notices.

380
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,040
He's so cool.

381
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,640
It can intimidate some people,

382
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,900
but it won't change the public's impression of Zheng Ying.

383
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,370
So what should we do?

384
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,780
Use both carrot and stick.

385
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,100
Here's the script.

386
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,160
Take a look at it.

387
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,600
Just follow this when you speak.

388
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,170
If you encounter any problems,

389
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,080
you can quietly call me through your earpiece.

390
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,680
I'll take over immediately.

391
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,640
They're coming.

392
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,440
Miss Zheng,

393
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,360
what's your opinion on

394
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,520
the recent trending topic online?

395
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,240
Is it true?

396
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,720
She's never experienced this kind of situation before.

397
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,120
Let me handle it instead.

398
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,660
Everyone please calm down, okay?

399
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,640
I know you all want to ask questions.

400
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,320
Just a moment. One at a time, please.

401
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,040
I promise to answer all your questions.

402
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,280
Free of charge.

404
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,920
Could you move your microphone back a bit?

405
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,400
It's almost in my mouth.

406
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,600
And media friends over here.

407
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,840
Could you move your camera a bit to the right?

408
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,680
This angle makes me look better.

409
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,040
Don't worry.

410
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,720
Everyone will have a chance to ask questions.

411
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,040
Alright.

412
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,120
Miss Zheng.

413
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,920
Regarding those online articles about you,

414
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,250
what are your thoughts?

415
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,480
My thoughts are

416
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,680
whoever wrote that article isn't a very good writer.

417
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,720
After reading the whole thing,

418
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,160
I couldn't even tell what they were trying to say.

419
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,880
So I'd like to remind everyone,

420
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,040
when you pay someone to write promotional articles,

421
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,040
make sure to find someone who knows how to stir emotions.

422
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,440
Just stirring up trouble isn't enough. It needs to be moving.

423
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,400
As expected from Mr. Yu's artist.

424
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,040
Of course.

425
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,850
I discovered her after all.

426
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,140
Miss Zheng.

427
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,560
Regarding the matters mentioned in that article,

428
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,240
are they true?

429
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,440
Which parts are true and which are false?

430
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,520
When you said I'm beautiful,

431
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,800
I think that's true.

432
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,520
May I ask what reason

433
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,520
made you take those kinds of photos?

434
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,680
Maybe it's because I have a good figure.

435
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,240
You've been joking around for so long.

436
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,840

Now,

450
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,100
bow and apologize.

00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:00,940
Zheng Ying,

452
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:02,960
hurry up.

453
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,920
Okay.

454
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,560
So I'll directly address

455

several concerns everyone has.

have never during work

00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,960
hurt any colleague.

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,080
I, Zheng Ying,

460
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,000
have never used improper means

during the honeymoon phase of my relationship,

465
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,200
wanted to capture beautiful moments with my partner.

466
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,640
Those are the photos everyone has seen.

467
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,740

Did I do something wrong?

472
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,400
What exactly did I do wrong?

dare to stand here today

00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,800
is to tell everyone

476
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,200
that I did nothing wrong.

477
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,720
There's nothing wrong with taking photos showing my figure.

478

There's nothing wrong with me being in a relationship.

Even if the relationship failed,

480
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,420
I still did nothing wrong.

481
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,360
What's wrong is the person who betrayed my feelings,

482
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,800
broke my trust,

483
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,320

Wasn't my performance excellent?

489
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,960

I... I forgot.

495
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,920
The first clause states that

Do you realize you've already breached the contract?

The foundation of a contract

500
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,760
is based on mutual trust.

By acting this way,

502
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,260
should I understand that you don't trust me?

503
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,980
Please give me one reason.

504
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,680
Otherwise, someone like you who breaches contracts

00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,960

00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,490

I didn't follow the script earlier

Later...

00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,540
later I felt the script wasn't right.

As for the specific content,

just go with what she said.

522
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,080
Well...

00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,240
Mr. Shen,

524
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,800
I think you lost

525
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,930
that argument just now.

526
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,480
Nonsense.

527
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,810
I just want everyone to know

528
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,340
that I'm not wrong.

529
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,930
There's nothing wrong with showing off my figure in photos.

530
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,080
You're quite impressive.

532
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,160
Please trust me.

00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,880
I want to talk to you in person

534
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,010
to apologize to you.

535
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,640
There's no trust between us.

536
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,080
No feelings either.

537
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,260
So there's nothing to talk about.

538
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,160
Also,

539
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,480
you don't need to apologize to me

540
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,000
because I will never forgive you.

541
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,760
Go ahead.

542
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,360
Our cooperation is based on trust, isn't it?

543
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,930
Isn't trust supposed to be mutual?

544
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,080
So in your eyes,

545
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,900
I really did something wrong.

546
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,850
I need to apologize, right?

547
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,400
This time,

548
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,840
it seems I was wrong.

549
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,280
You know,

550
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,080
Someone as uncontrollable as her

551
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,680
could cause all kinds of trouble in the future.

552
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,960
Is she really trustworthy?

553
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,880
You're right.

554
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,280
To avoid problems,

555
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,820
I need to complete the contract as soon as possible.

556
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,770
Stay away from her as soon as possible.

557
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,680
Mr. Shen.

558
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,480
If you don't like working in their office,

559
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,840
we can switch to our own place right away.

560
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,360
No need.

561
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,440
My goal is to make her famous.

562
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,300
Being close to her saves time.
