1
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,440
You're Zheng Ying, right?

2
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:40,960
Let me tell you something.

3
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,800
You're not the perfect leading lady I had in mind.

4
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,000
Don't waste your time here.

5
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,800
Please leave

6
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,960
immediately.

7
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,320
I know.

8
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,320
But I have orders from my boss.

9
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,560
I have no choice.

10
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,600
I'm just an employee.

11
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,320
I know my behavior is inappropriate.

12
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,540
I don't feel good about it either.

13
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,500
Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?

14
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,479
No need.

15
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,280
Just leave.

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,200
Are you sure?

17
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,040
I feel guilty.

18
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,000
And if I leave right now,

19
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,520
my boss will...

20
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,560
Can I go down later?

21
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,160
In return,

22
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,760
I can help you clean up.

23
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,560
After all, your housekeeper won't be back

24
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,620
for a few more days.

25
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,360
No need.

26
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,290
Just stay quiet for a while.

27
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,079
Really?

28
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,800
Thank you so much.

29
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,120
However,

30
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,079
I'll definitely stay quiet while cleaning.

31
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Don't feel burdened.

32
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,800
I'm sincerely grateful.

33
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,600
Meng Meng.

34
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,240
Do you have any detergent?

35
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,700
Could you find some for me?

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,760
Meng Meng.

37
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,200
Do you have any garbage bags?

38
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,360
Hand me one, please.

39
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,440
Meng Meng.

40
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,600
Could you come over and organize these papers?

41
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,200
I'm afraid I'll mess them up.

42
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,440
Meng Meng, come help me quickly.

43
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,920
I can't hold on anymore.

44
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
Liu Xiaomeng.

45
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,040
Liu Xiaomeng.

46
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,420
Is this what you call being quiet?

47
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,440
And do you think in my condition,

48
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,240
I can help you?

49
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,360
What's inconvenient about it?

50
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,840
Don't think that just because you're in a wheelchair,

51
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,760
you don't have to do anything, okay?

52
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,800
The only difference between you and me is

53
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,660
I'm standing and you're sitting.

54
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,440
But...

55
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,520
You still have to do your part.

56
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,360
Here, take this.

57
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,040
Oh, my back!

58
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:45,240
What's in here? It's so heavy.

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,640
I...

60
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,200
Can I open it and take a look?

61
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,040
How about a trade?

62
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,440
I made all of these myself.

63
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,600
Everyone who's tried them says they're good.

64
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
How unique!

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,280
Oh my goodness!

66
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,520
I can't believe you do such extreme

67
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,000
and challenging sports.

68
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,040
That's so cool!

69
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,560
I thought my athletic abilities

70
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,680
were unmatched.

71
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,900
Turns out you're just as impressive.

72
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,440
But now I

73
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,820
can't do anything.

74
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,980
Even standing up and walking is a luxury I can't afford.

75
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,200
You're not helpless.

76
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,960
You've just changed battlegrounds to continue your fight.

77
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,820
You have no idea

78
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,440
how many people love reading your writing.

79
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,160
Looking at these photos and medals,

80
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,720
I finally understand

81
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,000
why the female characters in your stories

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,320
are so brave,

83
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,400
passionate,

84
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,480
and can all leap across rooftops.

85
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,440
Because their mother

86
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,570
is exactly that kind of person.

87
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,760
Have you read

88
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,040
all those novels?

89
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,440
Not just read them,

90
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,280
I can recite them by heart, okay?

91
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,880
The female lead is absolutely the ultimate heroine.

92
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,360
Brave and clever, able to adapt to any situation.

93
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,400
And her ultimate move.

94
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,940
Let me show you.

95
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,160
Before we went in, I repeatedly warned her

96
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,600
not to step on the writer's landmines.

97
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,700
But what did she do?

98
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,050
She went crazy dancing as soon as we got in.

99
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,300
Why did you do that?

100
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,800
I just wanted to get closer to him.

101
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,440
That's suicidal bonding!

102
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,940
I don't know what's wrong with me.

103
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,720
My mind is all confused.

104
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,440
I seem to lack motivation.

105
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
What kind of motivation do you lack?

106
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,159
If I had motivation,

107
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:46,560
I'm sure I could solve everything.

108
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,370
Are you sure?

109
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,680
I'm sure.

110
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,720
Do you want to hear it?

111
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,040
Go ahead.

112
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,040
Meng Meng asked me to write a character analysis of the female lead

113
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,240
and if it's suitable, she's willing to sell us the copyright.

114
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,480
How did you manage that?

115
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,040
Anyone who has read her novels would know

116
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,360
that her female protagonists are always very strong-willed

117
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,800
and adventurous.

118
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,200
This precisely indicates

119
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,080
that the author herself is that kind of person.

120
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,940
Think about it,

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,400
would such a proud person

122
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,500
ever allow others to look down on her?

123
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,200
So,

124
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,320
the more cautious you are around her,

125
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,080
the more she feels you're pitying her

126
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,040
and reminding her that she's disabled.

127
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,280
So you deliberately acted that way when you entered

128
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,960
just to make her feel you weren't pitying her?

129
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,920
Exactly.

130
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,280
What she needs most isn't sympathy,

131
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,920
but equal treatment.

132
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,159
Well done.

133
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
Power delivered.

134
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,680
Let's go on a date.

135
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,480
Speak properly.

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,200
Stop being deliberately cute.

137
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,260
Shen Yifan, your hand just trembled.

138
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,080
Don't you dare flirt with our boss Shen, understand?

139
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,280
Stop fooling around.

140
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,460
Zheng Ying did well today.

141
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,680
Keep up the good work tomorrow.

142
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,280
Try to secure the copyright.

143
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,039
Thank you.

144
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,039
Are you going to reward me with a date?

145
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,080
Okay, I accept.

146
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,000
No.

147
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,679
Mr. Shen,

148
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,919
admitting you like me

149
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,720
isn't something to be shy about.

150
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,320
Shen Yifan,

151
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,880
I can hear your heart beating for me.

152
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,340
I need to use the restroom.

153
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,680
Shen Yifan,

154
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,200
won't you admit it?

155
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,120
Turn to the first page.

156
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,560
Please turn to page 13.

157
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,760
13 is my lucky number.

158
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,840
Remember that.

159
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,240
You fool, just admit it.

160
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,160
You have feelings for me.

161
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,120
Mr. Shen, what are you smiling about?

162
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,050
Go back to sleep.

163
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,460
Every day we're alive,

164
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,780
we should enjoy it to the fullest.

165
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,370
I can do that too.

166
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,080
Really?

167
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,820
Zheng Xiaohong

168
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,760
The publishing industry is in a slump right now.

169
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,620
I understand your difficulties.

170
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,960
However,

171
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,040
I currently

172
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,700
have no plans to enter the publishing industry.

173
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,560
So,

174
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,290
I'm afraid I can't help you.

175
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,960
We can collaborate in the future when there's an opportunity.

176
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,880
Absolutely.

177
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,520
Mr. Wang,

178
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,720
hello.

179
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,840
Hello.

180
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,260
I have some ideas about entering the publishing industry.

181
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,000
Liu Xiaomeng is a writer signed with your company,

182
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,520
right?

183
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,760
So the copyright for 'Drunken Jade Mountain'

184
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,090
should also be with you.

185
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,320
I see.

186
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,200
Then I need to talk with the editor

187
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,600
responsible for novels.

188
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,000
As long as we can work things out with Liu Xiaomeng,

189
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,040
we can establish

190
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,500
a long-term stable strategic partnership.

191
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,920
No problem, Mr. Cheng.

192
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,960
Wait for my news.

193
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,760
Mr. Cheng, I'll be leaving now.

194
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,960
I'll visit again another day.

195
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,280
Alright, take care.

196
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,730
Take care, Mr. Wang.

197
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,720
Stop right there!

198
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,920
Did you consult me before buying these rights?

199
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,480
When you abandoned my mother,

200
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,640
did you consult me?

201
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,820
Is this your character analysis?

202
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,400
I know my understanding isn't profound enough.

203
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,760
I'll continue to study where I'm wrong.

204
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,320
This is the proposal written by your boss.

205
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:18,800
Yes.

206
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,600
My understanding of the characters might not be perfect.

207
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,720
But his proposal

208
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,120
is absolutely flawless.

209
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,000
I can guarantee it with my integrity.

210
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,860
You have no idea how amazing he is.

211
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,080
In the investment world,

212
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,080
he's practically a legend.

213
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,280
You like him.

214
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,920
Is it that obvious?

215
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,280
It's written all over your face.

216
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,280
Then why does he act like nothing's happening?

217
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,480
Your brave approach to love

218
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,880
is quite similar to the female lead Shanlan.

219
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,720
Indeed.

220
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,800
We're both the type who love and hate boldly,

221
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,130
carefree women who live without regrets.

222
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,760
But she's genuinely carefree.

223
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,680
You're just thick-skinned.

224
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
So,

225
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,160
how did you create

226
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,290
this other version of me in your story?

227
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,000
Could you

228
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,400
get my vitamins for me?

229
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,920
They're in the next room.

230
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:08,680
Sure.

231
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,100
So you know about this nice neighbor.

232
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,440
You don't happen to like him, do you?

233
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,480
Don't deny it.

234
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,240
It's written all over your face.

235
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,040
Yes,

236
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,120
I do like him.

237
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,440
I even spy on him.

238
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,200
What's the point of just looking?

239
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,680
You can see but not touch.

240
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,400
I...

241
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,720
What are you doing?

242
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,760
You created

243
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,880
such a powerful female lead like Shanlan.

244
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,800
Be brave.

245
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,280
Ask him out.

246
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,160
Ask him out for what?

247
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,560
A date, of course.

248
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,600
What else could it be?

249
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,880
Your character understanding is inadequate.

250
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,520
Go back.

251
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,040
Wait, don't.

252
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,560
How about we make a deal?

253
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,960
What do you have to offer?

254
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,560
A man.

255
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,680
Good Chinese Neighbor.

256
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,250
Would you like to have a meal together?

257
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,880
Tomorrow at 11,

258
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,680
Xinghu Plaza, Pan Art Garden Restaurant.

259
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,080
I think we'd better not.

260
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,680
They've been throwing garbage at your place for so long,

261
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,520
isn't it normal to treat them to a meal?

262
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,040
I...

263
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,320
I could just buy some gifts for them instead.

264
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,880
Is the point to thank them?

265
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,160
The point is to get closer under the pretext of gratitude.

266
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,960
No way.

267
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,480
I still need to take it back.

268
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,760
What are you afraid of?

269
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,440
Show Shanlan's confidence and courage!

270
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,680
See you there.

271
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,520
Look,

272
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,120
he wants to see you too.

273
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,000
But maybe after meeting me,

274
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,920
he won't even want to take out the trash for me anymore.

275
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,160
Are you very concerned about your condition?

276
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,280
It's just reality.

277
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,640
I can't walk.

278
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,890
I can't take care of myself.

279
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,560
Someone like me,

280
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,340
who would accept that?

281
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,240
What about you?

282
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,160
Have you accepted yourself?

283
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,480
You haven't left

284
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,040
this room for three years.

285
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:23,960
Meng Meng.

286
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,520
Why can't you be like Shanlan,

287
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,160
not controlled by emotions,

288
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,440
living freely?

289
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,880
Think about your courage and determination when rock climbing.

290
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,540
Challenging yourself isn't unfamiliar to you.

291
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,160
Go.

292
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,240
Not for others,

293
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,000
but just

294
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,480
to help yourself stand up again.

295
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,960
You're right.

296
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,060
I'm doing this for myself.

297
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,240
The roads have become wider,

298
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,200
there are more shops,

299
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,160
everything has changed.

300
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,720
Yes,

301
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,520
everything is moving forward.

302
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,960
Only I

303
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,850
have stayed in the same place for too long.

304
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,240
It's not too late to catch up now.

305
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,250
Not too late.

306
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,600
Thank you, Zhengying.

307
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,130
If you want to thank someone, thank yourself.

308
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,040
Hello.

309
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,480
My dog got out earlier

310
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,880
and tore your garbage bag.

311
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,740
I cleaned it up.

312
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,840
Here.

313
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,420
Miss Ni, are you getting rid of all these things?

314
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,970
Throw them away.

315
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,600
Mr. Shen, are you sure

316
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,530
Zheng Ying will play the lead role?

317
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,520
You can rest assured about that.

318
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,440
Long time no see.

319
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,080
That's basically the situation.

320
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,960
Mr. Cheng is now our company's

321
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,040
second largest shareholder.

322
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,040
And because we previously signed

323
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,960
a right of first refusal agreement.

324
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,720
So,

325
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,320
if you as the author want to sell

326
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,240
the rights to 'Drunken Jade Mountain',

327
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,240
you must offer it to Mr. Cheng first.

328
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,880
Sigh.

329
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,440
This isn't good news.

330
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,720
That girl is Mangmang's editor.

331
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,400
Mr. Shen.

332
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,240
I'm sorry,

333
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,980
but I've already secured the rights.

334
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,490
Do you two have more to discuss?

335
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,440
I'll leave you to it then.

336
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,930
Until we meet again.

337
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,880
Mr. Shen,

338
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,480
I'd like to speak with Zheng Ying alone.

339
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,000
Alright.

340
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,960
I'm sorry,

341
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,680
they have the first right to handle my work.

342
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,760
It's okay.

343
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,620
This isn't your fault.

344
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,720
Even if I can't play your female lead,

345
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,320
I'll still support you.

346
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,120
No.

347
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,650
You are the female lead.

348
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,200
I'm sorry,

349
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,840
I only accept Zheng Ying as the female lead.

350
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,200
If it's someone else,

351
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,660
I'd rather not sell it.

352
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,800
It's clearly stated in this contract

353
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,520
that I have

354
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,010
the right to refuse.

355
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,880
Looks like we think alike.

356
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,160
In my eyes,

357
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,930
besides Zheng Ying,

358
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,610
no one else can play my female lead.

359
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,380
Did he really say that?

360
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,620
This person's behavior is getting stranger and stranger.

361
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,720
He's just

362
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,520
another person with words carved on his forehead.

363
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:27,880
Forget it.

364
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,760
Just focus on the one you like.

365
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,320
So is there any progress with your nice neighbor?

366
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,360
No matter what happens in the future,

367
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,200
I think I'll face it with acceptance.

368
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,130
Because courage

369
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,210
doesn't leave room for regret.

370
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,820
I sincerely wish you well.

371
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,640
Be brave to pursue what you love,

372
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,840
and leave no regrets.

373
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,200
I will.

374
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,330
Didn't expect to see you again so soon.

375
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,210
What do you mean by that?

376
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,680
If I remember correctly,

377
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,540
Mr. Cheng's capital chain

378
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,290
should still be broken, right?

379
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,520
Such a large intellectual property,

380
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,720
can you handle it all?

381
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,250
Do you have channels for overseas distribution?

382
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,840
That may be true,

383
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,480
but I have many potential partners.

384
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,440
I don't necessarily have to choose you, Shen Yifan.

385
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,700
Our goals are aligned.

386
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,810
Why can't we work together?

387
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,720
Synergy effect.

388
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,400
You must have heard of it, Mr. Cheng?

389
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,800
I'm sorry,

390
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,600
I'm not as knowledgeable as you.

391
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,520
One plus one is greater than two.

392
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,180
You should at least know what that means, right?

393
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,040
If you really want this project to succeed,

394
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,960
just wait here.

395
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,650
Wu Yu will bring the contract soon.

396
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,280
No way.

397
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,060
I insist on waiting in the car.

398
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,640
He actually agreed to cooperate.

399
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,400
It's like he's become a completely different person.

400
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,640
Unbelievable.

401
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,280
What transformation?

402
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,090
It's just driven by profit.

403
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,440
That makes sense.

404
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,560
But

405
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,420
we've secured the copyright now,

406
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,840
shouldn't we celebrate?

407
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,330
I'll arrange it.

408
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,520
Let me do it.

409
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,160
Wu Yu, pull over up ahead.

410
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,720
I'll set up the time and place

411
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,320
and text you all the details.

412
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,440
Since we're celebrating, let's put it on the company account.

413
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,900
Remember to get a receipt.

414
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,800
How generous!

415
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,680
What is she up to?

416
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,240
What's wrong?

417
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,080
Mr. Shen, look.

418
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,290
A candlelit dinner for two.

419
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,940
Is she trying to confess her feelings to you?

420
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,400
Are you rewarding me with a date?

421
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,640
Fine, I accept.

422
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:46,640
No.

423
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,080
Mr. Shen,

424
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,320
admitting you like me

425
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,120
isn't something to be shy about.

426
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,720
Shen Yifan,

427
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,960
I can hear your heart beating for me.

428
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,280
Mr. Shen,

429
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,520
the doctor said you need to keep your emotions stable.

430
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,120
If you'll have to leave eventually,

431
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,780
why bother flirting with her?

432
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,540
Didn't you say that yourself?

433
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,560
If you can't even flirt with her,

434
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,400
why torment yourself?

435
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,040
Don't you want more time with her,

436
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,320
and with us too?

437
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,880
Your condition is very unstable.

438
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,520
You should avoid emotional fluctuations

439
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,920
to prevent your condition from worsening.

440
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,800
'Drunken Jade Mountain' project needs to move forward immediately.

441
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,080
The meeting with CEO Ma

442
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,600
has been rescheduled for tonight.

443
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,320
Tonight?

444
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,280
But...

445
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,240
8 PM,

446
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,570
Starry Sky Restaurant. Don't stand me up.

447
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,840
Why don't you go book the tickets now?

448
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,720
Okay.

449
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,200
Mr. Shen.

450
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,020
We can head to the airport now.

451
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,220
Do you still need this?

452
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,260
No, I don't.
