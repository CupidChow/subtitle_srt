1
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,360
Hello?

2
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,840
What's wrong?

3
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,360
Why are you calling me now?

4
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,520
I miss you.

5
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,200
Come on, look over here.

6
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,040
I miss you too.

7
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,200
Okay.

8
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,200
Let's change to the next set of poses.

9
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,259
The next set, okay?

10
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,600
Good.

11
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,250
What are you smiling at?

12
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,040
When you left

13
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,400
you asked if I had any regrets.

14
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,640
I said no,

15
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,880
but I lied to you, Shen Yifan.

16
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,760
Actually,

17
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,810
I do have one regret.

18
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,120
Fighting over a ring.

19
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,880
Attending our child's parent-teacher conference.

20
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,810
Our child's graduation ceremony.

21
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,720
Isn't something still missing?

22
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,680
Our happy life together.

23
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,520
Where should it begin?

24
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,720
So,

25
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,600
you'd better come back soon to make up for this regret.

26
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,880
Otherwise,

27
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,850
I won't let you off the hook.

28
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,240
Shen Yifan.

29
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,160
I miss you.

30
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,360
Shen Yifan.

31
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,440
I miss you.

32
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,320
Shen Yifan.

33
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,200
Shen Yifan.

34
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,480
Excuse me.

35
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,840
Could you please... Sorry.

36
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,440
Could you please come back safely to see me soon?

37
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,880
I really, really miss you so much.

38
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,440
Shen Yifan.

39
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,520
I miss you so much.

40
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,600
Shen Yifan.

41
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,600
[Renovating Wenmu Tomb]

42
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,400
Lawyer Liu.

43
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,320
Mr. Shen.

44
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,480
Actually, you could wait a bit longer for Xinyuan.

45
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,440
There's no need to rush with the will.

46
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,770
There's no time to wait.

47
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,600
I don't have much time left.

48
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,399
Let's begin.

49
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,160
Regarding the will,

50
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,300
let me confirm with you once more.

51
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,040
All assets under your name,

52
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,700
half will go to Ms. Zheng Ying,

53
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,560
and half to Mr. Shen Yiyang.

54
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,650
Is that correct?

55
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes.

56
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,440
One house and one car

57
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,000
will be left to Mr. Wu Yu.

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,720
Is that so?

59
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,200
Yes.

60
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,320
Additionally, after your death,

61
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,580
regarding the funeral arrangements...

62
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:45,880
Lawyer Liu.

63
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,880
Thank you.

64
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,120
Without my signature,

65
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,480
who gave you permission to refuse treatment?

66
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,010
I knew you wouldn't sign it.

67
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,260
Good that you know.

68
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,650
So I asked the hospital.

69
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,140
The doctor said

70
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,650
patients can sign for themselves.

71
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,960
Why?

72
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,440
Why would you do this?

73
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
All your life,

74
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,640
you've been a coward.

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,880
You've never signed anything.

76
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,410
Mom and Dad's car accident,

77
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,760
you didn't sign the death certificate.

78
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,640
Moving house,

79
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,440
going abroad,

80
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,400
you didn't sign for those either.

81
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,530
Starting a company,

82
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,810
signing contracts,

83
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,770
you never signed those either.

84
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,600
So this time,

85
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,610
I don't plan to let you sign either.

86
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,159
Don't think that by

87
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,720
playing the emotional card with me

88
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,120
I'll let you off the hook.

89
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,120
You...

90
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,280
If you leave like this,

91
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,720
I will never forgive you.

92
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,440
I'm someone who doesn't like to leave any regrets.

93
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,240
But this time,

94
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,220
it seems I'm going to fail.

95
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,090
The number you have dialed is powered off.

96
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,640
Pick up the phone.

97
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,800
Please pick up.

98
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,570
Who else can I contact to reach him?

99
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,880
Doctor.

100
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:24,920
Yes,

101
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,700
find the doctor's number.

102
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,760
Ying.

103
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,240
What's wrong?

104
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,500
The set is ready. Let's go over there.

105
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,440
Okay.

106
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,560
Okay. Right away.

107
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,800
This angle works well.

108
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,880
What's wrong with her?

109
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,210
She doesn't seem right.

110
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,880
This scene

111
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,880
is about her witnessing her beloved man

112
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,940
Mingjing's death.

113
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,320
Having these emotions

114
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,520
is perfectly normal.

115
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,440
Mingjing.

116
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,000
Who are you?

117
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,440
I am his brother,

118
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,440
Mingshu.

119
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,320
What did you do to him?

120
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,600
I didn't do much,

121
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,600
just before impersonating him,

122
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,100
I pretended to be you to lure and kill him.

123
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,640
He thought you were injured

124
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,140
and followed you here,

125
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,520
falling into my trap.

126
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,880
You've already been poisoned by my soul-breaking powder.

127
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,880
Today is the day you both die.

128
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,800
Shanlan.

129
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,680
I finally understand how precious time is.

130
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,240
Now I

131
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,560
just want to

132
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,620
spend the rest of my life with you.

133
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,640
Mingjing,

134
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,800
don't leave me.

135
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,480
Mingjing,

136
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,640
don't leave me.

137
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,040
Don't leave me.

138
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,400
I still want to

139
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,620
spend the rest of my life with you.

140
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,400
Stop.

141
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,640
Ying.

142
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,120
It's okay. Get up.

143
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,400
Ying.

144
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,650
What's wrong, Ying?

145
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,400
Someone come!

146
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,160
Help!

147
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,920
Ms. Zheng.

148
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,600
What happened?

149
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,280
Ms. Zheng?

150
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
This time,

151
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,080
why did it take you so long to come back?

152
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,120
I see you're doing

153
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,520
quite well here.

154
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,680
What about Cheng Moyang?

155
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,200
He's waited for you his entire life.

156
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,280
You should give him a chance.

157
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,320
Just give him a chance.

158
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,440
You're not coming back,

159
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,160
are you?

160
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,680
No, I'm not.

161
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,660
Take care of yourself.

162
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,920
You

163
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,840
are so selfish.

164
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,960
When you were alive,

165
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,560
you left me once.

166
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,840
And now you're dead,

167
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,480
you're leaving me again.

168
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,680
Why don't you answer me?

169
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,680
What's wrong with you?

170
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,120
Shen Yifan,

171
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,340
you told me not to wait for you.

172
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,120
That's what you said.

173
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,820
Brother Youyi.

174
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,320
It's been a whole day.

175
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,200
Why is there no movement at all?

176
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,080
How about

177
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,320
we open it?

178
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,370
Let's wait a bit longer.

179
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,440
We can't wait anymore.

180
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,040
If we wait any longer, they'll get suspicious.

181
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,400
Brother Youyi.

182
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,060
What's my schedule for today?

183
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,200
Um,

184
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,840
here's today's schedule

185
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,610
and the preface written by the screenwriter.

186
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,010
Aren't you going to the set?

187
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,280
Yes,

188
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,570
I'm going right now.

189
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,040
Youyi,

190
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,080
why is Zheng Ying suddenly acting like this?

191
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,500
There's no reason.

192
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,220
She's truly my artist,

193
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,040
so strong.

194
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,480
What about Shen Yifan?

195
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,080
From now on,

196
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,080
don't mention Shen Yifan's name again,

197
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,960
or else I'll...

198
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,400
But what if...

199
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,560
Not even once.

200
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,960
I'm sorry.

201
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,970
It's okay. Let's try again.

202
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,300
Come on, one more time.

203
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,930
Senior, I've been away from the Three Halls for several months now.

204
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,920
Do you want to slow down?

205
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,080
Who are you looking down on?

206
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,080
Don't waste time.

207
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,840
Speed it up.

208
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,460
All of you come at once.

209
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
I'm in a hurry.

210
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,240
Cut!

211
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,400
Not bad.

212
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,130
Prepare for the next scene.

213
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,800
It feels like Zheng Ying has become a completely different person.

214
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
Lately,

215
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,359
the phrase she says most often is

216
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,200
'don't waste time.'

217
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,700
Doesn't that sound familiar?

218
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,490
Isn't that what Shen...

219
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,200
what that person used to say?

220
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,740
She's deliberately turned herself into his image.

221
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,120
This director today

222
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,720
is so incompetent.

223
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,680
Didn't even review the commercial script before coming.

224
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,010
Has no idea how to shoot.

225
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,160
Alright.

226
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,000
'Drunken Jade Mountain' is about to wrap up.

227
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,600
After shooting tomorrow's commercial,

228
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,200
why don't we

229
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,800
have the company arrange a few days off for you?

230
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,360
These are scripts selected by the company.

231
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,220
The fastest one

232
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,040
will start production within a week.

233
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,700
Satisfied?

234
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,440
Now that's

235
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,480
the attitude of a manager

236
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,410
who wants to exploit their artist.

237
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,440
Are you

238
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,360
really planning to use heavy workloads

239
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,440
to numb yourself?

240
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,610
Why would I need to numb myself?

241
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,440
If you miss him, actually...

242
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,680
Why would I miss him?

243
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,160
I'm very happy now.

244
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,680
I didn't even say who 'he' is,

245
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,960
yet you're already defending yourself,

246
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,560
claiming you don't miss him.

247
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,680
What I mean is,

248
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,840
right now I only want to

249
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,440
work,

250
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,120
act,

251
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,780
win awards.

252
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,570
I don't want anything else.

253
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,840
What's wrong?

254
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,840
How was it?

255
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,300
Did I do well in that scene?

256
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,120
Let's go home.

257
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,020
Is it a power outage or did the circuit breaker trip?

258
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,880
Where's my phone?

259
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,680
Are we out of medicine at home?

260
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,920
This injury-prone artist at home

261
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,580
needs to take better care of herself.

262
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,420
You think just leaving a medicine box is enough?

263
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,040
If that director keeps acting like this,

264
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,200
I'm really going to get angry.

265
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,560
Don't say I'm being a diva then.

266
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,620
Hello, Miss Zheng.

267
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,720
My name is Liu Zhang.

268
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,520
Starting today,

269
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,720
I'll be the director of our commercial.

270
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,360
Director Liu,

271
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:09,880
hello.

272
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,340
Thanks for your hard work.

273
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,650
What's going on?

274
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,520
I was just complaining about the director yesterday

275
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,180
and today he's been replaced.

276
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,480
Did you make a wish

277
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,440
with Aladdin's lamp last night?

278
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,120
The thing is,

279
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,440
he even called me over

280
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,320
like he was a genie

281
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,180
asking what wish I wanted.

282
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,770
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

283
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,720
Hello, Mrs. Zhao.

284
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,880
Zheng,

285
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,320
your lease is about to expire.

286
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,200
Yes, I'm planning to renew it.

287
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,600
I'm getting married again soon.

288
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,040
So I'm planning to move back here

289
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,960
You'll need to find a new place to live.

290
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,360
No.

291
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,800
You've been married five times before

292
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,800
and never said you wanted to move back in.

293
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,320
Besides, I just fixed the electric meter yesterday.

294
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,720
You people in your line of work make money so easily.

295
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,240
Buying a house should be a piece of cake for you, right?

296
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,240
Move out quickly.

297
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,320
That's true.

298
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,560
I can buy my own house.

299
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,860
[80.00ml|Nanguo Garden 2BR 1BA]

300
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,840
When will I ever

301
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,960
have my own place?

302
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,040
Someday

303
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,120
I'll live there.

304
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,090
At your current acting fee,

305
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,120
if you work hard for 10 years without eating or drinking,

306
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,720
you might be able to afford

307
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,360
a bathroom there.

308
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,240
Don't underestimate me.

309
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,080
Although I haven't started filming 'Twin Beauties' yet,

310
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,240
someday

311
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,240
I will become

312
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,520
a popular actress.

313
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,060
A top-tier performer.

314
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,520
By then,

315
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,840
I'll buy this apartment outright.

316
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,040
I've got it all planned out.

317
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,320
I want floor-to-ceiling windows in the living room.

318
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,240
And

319
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,800
I want a large open kitchen.

320
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,280
Also,

321
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,280
a study just for novels.

322
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,480
From my bedroom,

323
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,000
there'll be a beautiful view.

324
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,800
Hey, Youyi.

325
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,480
I need to rent a new apartment.

326
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,420
No problem.

327
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,600
Moving tomorrow.

328
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,840
Brother.

329
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,080
You bought this place?

330
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,640
As your manager,

331
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,040
buying you an apartment is a simple matter.

332
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,450
Go see if you like it.

333
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,800
So, do you like it?

334
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,500
Did you decorate this too?

335
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,040
Of course.

336
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,400
As your manager,

337
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,600
aren't I thoughtful?

338
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,340
What about this photo?

339
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,080
Only he and I knew about this photo.

340
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,640
Where did you get it?

341
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,600
This kind of thing

342
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,800
is easy to find out with a few questions.

343
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,480
Youyi.

344
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,560
He arranged all this, didn't he?

345
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,360
Who? I arranged everything myself.

346
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,640
When did you meet him?

347
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,280
What else did he arrange?

348
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,360
How is he doing now?

349
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,360
Where is he now?

350
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,320
Youyi.

351
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,600
What do you know? Please tell me.

352
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,240
As soon as she says she wants to change apartments,

353
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,570
do exactly as I told you.

354
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,280
What else did he say?

355
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,560
He also said

356
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,000
that you should treat this as your home

357
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,600
and wait for him to come back.

358
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,020
So he thinks he can just buy me off with an apartment?

359
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,680
Dream on.

360
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,640
Actually, this apartment isn't good at all.

361
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,560
It's too big.

362
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,810
It must be exhausting to clean.

363
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,490
Didn't he arrange for a cleaning lady?

364
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,960
And look at this sofa,

365
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,480
the coffee table, the wallpaper -

366
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,740
they're all too plain.

367
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,760
And this lamp,

368
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,690
why is it so ugly?

369
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:07,500
Cast
