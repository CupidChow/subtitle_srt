1
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,600
Zheng

2
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,200
Mr. Shen

3
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,480
This way, please.

4
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,160
How are we supposed to continue filming now?

5
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,890
Mr. Shen, please have a seat. I really don't know.

6
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,880
Regarding your production team's previous actions,

7
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,840
I need a formal written apology

8
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,320
delivered to my artist.

9
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,400
Rest assured, Mr. Shen,

10
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,400
we promise this won't happen again.

11
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,000
The urgent matter now

12
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,040
is to resolve

13
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,960
this issue that's preventing us from continuing the shoot.

14
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,320
Look at all these people waiting,

15
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,240
exactly.

16
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,920
First, you need to understand her true personality.

17
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,180
Only by finding her authentic character

18
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,780
can you create better content for your show.

19
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,500
For example, here,

20
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,600
when Zheng Ying discovers her partner Wan Yuchen

21
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,000
lying in the room sleeping,

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,880
while Wan Yuchen lies to her

23
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,160
claiming he's working on a task.

24
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,440
At this moment, Zheng Ying must be extremely angry.

25
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,370
And needs to vent her frustration.

26
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,880
How dare you, Shen Yifan,

27
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,320
not trying to stop me when I said I was giving up!

28
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,120
Why? Why? Why?

29
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,960
After venting,

30
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,920
what she'll want to do most

31
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,580
is definitely have a big meal.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,320
You're eating so much now,

33
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,250
will you still eat dinner tonight?

34
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,760
At night,

35
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,040
when she's alone,

36
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,170
she'll certainly feel regretful.

37
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,540
She might even cry.

38
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,200
At that moment,

39
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,250
you should stop filming

40
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,920
and turn off the cameras.

41
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,840
Why did I say I was giving up?

42
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,480
What's the point of trying to look cool?

43
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,040
This way there's no hope at all.

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,880
What on earth did I say?

45
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,200
Mr. Shen.

46
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,320
Young Mr. Shen is in too much pain to lie down.

47
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,640
He can only sleep sitting up.

48
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,640
Please think of something quickly.

49
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,930
Don't worry.

50
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,360
This place belongs to my friend.

51
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,560
I've already spoken to them.

52
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,760
No one will come here.

53
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,280
Do you need something from me?

54
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,000
Over these years, I've heard many things about you.

55
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,130
I know you've been struggling abroad.

56
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,100
Especially...

57
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,820
Why didn't you contact me?

58
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,320
Why would I contact you?

59
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,280
Our separation was my fault.

60
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,440
But Ni Hao is still my son.

61
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,240
Wait.

62
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,720
Are you saying

63
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,040
that Ni Hao is your son?

64
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,490
You're still keeping this from me?

65
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,480
I let you down before.

66
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,840
But at least give me a chance to make amends.

67
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,760
Yes,

68
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,080
I'm not doing as well as you now.

69
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,120
You're a star,

70
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,760
while I'm just a manager.

71
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,680
But... enough.

72
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,040
Ni Hao is my son.

73
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,200
He has nothing to do with you.

74
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,440
Xu Zhao.

75
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,520
I have something important to tell you.

76
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,680
Can you stop bothering me?

77
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,580
Don't secretly buy him toys anymore.

78
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,860
Or take him out to play.

79
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,280
Also, about tonight's film festival closing ceremony.

80
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,040
Would you like to attend?

81
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,720
They invited Shen Yifan to attend

82
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,720
the opening ceremony of that film festival.

83
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,600
And they want me for the closing ceremony?

84
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,080
Yes.

85
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,680
Besides the regular activities at today's closing ceremony,

86
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,720
there's also a new award ceremony added.

87
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,520
It includes the Most Anticipated Newcomer Award.

88
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,800
Zheng Ying was nominated for her role as the assassin in 'Dual Beauties' Battle'

89
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,159
for this award.

90
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,800
Good.

91
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,960
We can go check it out.

92
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,960
Go get ready.

93
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,440
I heard from Brother Youyi that

94
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,640
you've been nominated for the Most Anticipated Newcomer Award.

95
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,960
We should celebrate this properly.

96
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,560
Is this hat too small,

97
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,600
or is your head too big?

98
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,000
It looks weird somehow.

99
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,840
What nonsense are you talking about?

100
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,840
What's wrong with what I'm wearing?

101
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,520
Dr. Mai mentioned you to me before.

102
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:24,920
Yes.

103
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,440
Alright, see you later.

104
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,120
Bye-bye.

105
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,559
What's wrong? This looks fine.

106
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,720
Why aren't you wearing it?

107
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,840
Bad luck.

108
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,640
Why is there such a sour smell in the air?

109
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,880
Who spilled the vinegar jar?

110
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,120
Time is precious. Focus on your work.

111
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,580
And stop flirting around.

112
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,720
From an anonymous colleague.

113
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,400
Sit there.

114
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,360
Why is there so much?

115
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,290
This is your first award after all.

116
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,060
You should take it seriously.

117
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,440
And prepare well.

118
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,490
I heard you were nominated too.

119
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,400
Even if you're just a placeholder,

120
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,160
you should at least tidy yourself up.

121
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,640
This award is about acting skills,

122
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,840
not about who dresses better.

123
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,720
Hey, Mr. Liu.

124
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,410
She's coming with full confidence to receive the award.

125
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,080
You can't let her down.

126
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,120
Don't worry about it.

127
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,410
I've arranged everything.

128
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,680
Great.

129
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,160
Mr. Shen,

130
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,840
your attending physician, Dr. Mai, is my senior colleague.

131
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,240
He asked me to find you.

132
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,760
Please return to Switzerland as soon as possible.

133
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,160
I know.

134
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,200
He's reminded me several times already.

135
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,360
But you haven't gone back.

136
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,800
Dr. Mai says there might be a heart donor available soon.

137
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,260
You need to go back and prepare immediately.

138
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,360
This is

139
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,620
my first time attending such a big event.

140
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,120
What's wrong? Nervous?

141
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,560
It's just an award.

142
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,320
You'll have plenty more chances to win awards in the future.

143
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,920
Relax, superstar.

144
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,620
Have you memorized your acceptance speech?

145
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:46,920
Here.

146
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,320
So beautiful!

147
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,520
Zheng Ying.

148
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,400
Mr. Cheng,

149
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,120
aren't we being a bit too showy?

150
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,400
I think it's perfect.

151
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,240
She won an award, so she should get

152
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,080
the attention and interviews from reporters, right?

153
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,160
Oh, and make sure you remember.

154
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,440
Don't worry, Mr. Cheng.

155
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,100
As soon as her award news breaks, it'll immediately trend online.

156
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,080
Mr. Shen,

157
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,200
your ejection fraction

158
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,200
has decreased to 35%.

159
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,760
You can't delay any longer.

160
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,360
I know.

161
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,680
Mr. Shen.

162
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,800
Zheng Ying didn't win the award.

163
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,520
This Best Newcomer Award

164
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,800
is yours this time.

165
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,320
Here, Mr. Liu.

166
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,040
Come.

167
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,160
Rest assured.

168
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,760
The help you've given me this time,

169
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,890
my uncle will definitely remember it.

170
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:54,920
I'm sorry.

171
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,610
I have an urgent matter.

172
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,840
It must be her doing.

173
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,520
I can't believe she won the award.

174
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,360
Should we still interview her?

175
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,560
Her winning this award is hardly convincing, right?

176
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,240
Yes.

177
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,810
We absolutely must.

178
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,240
We agreed to interview the winner.

179
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,040
You all know the real situation.

180
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,170
Do you really want to see someone like her win?

181
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,160
Miss Chen, regarding your previous work,

182
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,920
is it true that 'Good Pomelo' received a rating of 2.1?

183
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,400
Miss Chen,

184
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,320
do you think you deserve this award?

185
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Everyone says this award is rigged.

186
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,520
What do you think about that, Miss Chen?

187
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,560
I'm not comfortable answering this question.

188
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,400
Please ask my agent.

189
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,320
Why are you here?

190
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,720
I came to stand up for you.

191
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,020
I think you truly deserve this award.

192
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,900
Are you really okay with this?

193
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,520
Committee Chairman.

194
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,690
That's how we judge the awards.

195
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,200
You're here about Zheng Ying, aren't you?

196
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,520
Our award selection is completely fair.

197
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,520
Fair?

198
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,040
A new actor's hard work for so long

199
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,080
was easily dismissed by you.

200
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,220
And you talk to me about fairness?

201
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,480
What if

202
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,500
your deal with Chen Qing becomes public?

203
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,930
Would everyone still think it's fair?

204
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,720
We're all in the same industry.

205
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,600
No need to be so ruthless.

206
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,520
She's just a minor actress.

207
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,520
Mr. Shen deserves better.

208
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,280
Do you know

209
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,980
how hard these young actors work?

210
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,280
I will report this

211
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,730
to the committee under my name.

212
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,170
I believe the committee

213
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,360
will make a truly fair judgment.

214
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,560
And remember this:

215
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,920
As long as I'm around, don't even think about hurting her.

216
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,120
Otherwise,

217
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,160
I'll make you understand what regret truly means.

218
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,720
Otherwise,

219
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,240
I'll make you die

220
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,080
a very ugly death.

221
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,440
To be honest,

222
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,850
I'm not willing to accept this.

223
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,440
But someone once told me

224
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,560
that no effort is ever wasted.

225
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,440
All the hardships you've endured

226
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,840
are the stepping stones beneath your feet.

227
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,080
One day they will lift you up high.

228
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,530
Those who looked down on you before

229
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,040
will have to crane their necks to look at you.

230
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,440
I will work even harder in the days to come.

231
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,760
I believe

232
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
what's meant to be mine will be mine,

233
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,360
sooner or later.

234
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,490
You spoke well just now.

235
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,840
Thank you.

236
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,500
I don't accept verbal thanks.

237
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,760
I've booked a really nice restaurant.

238
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,000
Have dinner with me.

239
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,250
It's your chance to thank me properly.

240
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,600
I need to go back to the set for recording.

241
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,560
So dinner is off.

242
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,440
Alright.

243
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,760
What would you like to eat? My treat.

244
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,520
Great.

245
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,340
I won't hold back then.

246
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,760
Shen Yifan.

247
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,600
What's wrong?

248
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,960
Don't be afraid. I'll take you to the hospital right away.

249
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,600
Doctor!

250
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,800
Help!

251
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,080
Doctor!

252
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,400
Doctor! Help!

253
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,480
Doctor!

254
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,420
Family members please wait outside.

255
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,720
So

256
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,720
everything you said was true.

257
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,440
Is your heart condition really so serious

258
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,240
that you could die from any emotional excitement?

259
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,720
Why is this happening?

260
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,840
No.

261
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,800
I won't let you die.

262
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,300
And I won't let you push me away again.

263
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,880
You're finally awake.

264
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,140
You scared me to death.

265
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,040
It's not like you haven't seen this before.

266
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,840
What's there to be so scared about?

267
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,700
What nonsense.

268
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,840
No matter how many times this happens,

269
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,500
it's still terrifying, okay?

270
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,970
You have no idea.

271
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,960
If you really didn't wake up,

272
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,200
then I would...

273
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,140
Then...

274
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,240
you could inherit the Shen family fortune, right?

275
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,440
I'd give you all the Shen family assets.

276
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,840
You earned it all anyway.

277
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,570
You better stay alive, you hear me?

278
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,480
I'm serious.

279
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,560
I'm warning you,

280
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,760
don't pull any of that

281
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,480
self-righteous 'graceful exit' nonsense.

282
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,760
You're my only family in this world.

283
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,800
Do you understand?

284
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,080
I know, I know.

285
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,250
Please go out first.

286
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,480
Go on.

287
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,120
Alright.

288
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,240
Get some good rest.

289
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,960
My brother's collapse this time,

290
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,220
I heard it was because of that Zheng Ying.

291
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,920
Where is she?

292
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,840
After she brought Mr. Shen back,

293
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,200
she disappeared.

294
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,920
What's wrong?

295
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,240
Are you asking for someone else again today?

296
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:17,680
No.

297
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,880
This time I want to seriously consult

298
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,080
about heart disease.

299
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,080
I can certainly give you a serious consultation.

300
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,840
But could you take a photo with me first?

301
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,640
My daughter is a big fan of yours.

302
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,280
Come on.

303
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,000
One, two, three.

304
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,560
About heart disease,

305
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,640
it's like this.

306
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,840
There are congenital and acquired types.

307
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,840
Everyone's symptoms

308
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,700
are different.

309
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,960
It varies from person to person.

310
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,280
She's trending again. She's really popular lately.

311
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:46,960
Yeah.

312
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,800
These days,

313
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,960
artists who dare to openly express their ambitions

314
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,200
are quite rare.

315
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,320
I also heard

316
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,680
that this press interview

317
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,920
was apparently arranged by Cheng Moyang from Yiping Sunshine,

318
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,980
Mr. Cheng himself.

319
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,640
Look, someone took this photo at the event.

320
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,440
Let me see.

321
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,360
They really look good together.

322
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,010
I'm shipping them already.

323
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,160
Right?

324
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,120
They really are a perfect match.

325
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,250
So lovely together.

326
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,520
It seems that everyone knows

327
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,000
we're a perfect match,

328
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,840
right?

329
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,960
I'm here to tell you some good news.

330
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,600
I've arranged a medical consultation with specialists for you.

331
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,600
Why would you do that?

332
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,140
You're Zheng Ying's boss,

333
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,840
so it's appropriate for me to take care of you

334
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,720
for her sake.

335
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,360
I don't need that.

336
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,520
Sit down.

337
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,120
You don't need to feel burdened.

338
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,400
Just accept it.

339
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,960
But I have one condition.

340
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,680
Since you don't like her

341
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,440
and have rejected her,

342
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,320
keep your distance from her.

343
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,640
Understand?

344
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,400
Zheng Ying.

345
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,890
I've never had romantic feelings for you.

346
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,640
I have never,

347
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,440
ever liked you that way.

348
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,680
Why are you here?

349
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,440
My boss is sick.

350
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,400
As an employee,

351
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,160
it's only right for me to take care

352
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,290
of my boss, isn't it?

353
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,960
Lie down.

354
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,000
Eat.

355
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,160
You should be filming your variety show right now,

356
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,840
not here peeling apples for me.

357
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,960
Don't get angry.

358
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,730
It's bad for your heart.

359
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,840
Zheng Ying.

360
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,240
Didn't you promise me

361
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,050
that from now on,

362
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,290
we would just be boss and employee?

363
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,450
Didn't you promise not to cross the line anymore?

364
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,220
I know everything now.

365
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,200
I know you're sick.

366
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,040
So what?

367
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,760
Before long,

368
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,880
I'll be a dead man.

369
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,900
You're scared.

370
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,960
This is who I am.

371
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,010
Do you still like me?

372
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,330
Do you dare to still like me?

373
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,720
I like you.

374
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,160
I dare to like you.

375
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,620
What about you?

376
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,840
Look me in the eyes.
