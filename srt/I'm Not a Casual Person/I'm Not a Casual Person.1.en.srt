1
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,280
The prestigious Chinese Venture Capital Summit

2
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,039
will soon be held at Linsha Lake.

3
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:43,479
According to reports, Shen Yifan, CEO of Shen Group,

4
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,840
will also attend the summit.

5
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,800
This 23-year-old investment prodigy

6
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,479
has gained attention in recent years for his outstanding investment and acquisition deals

7
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,920
and has become quite notable in the industry.

8
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,039
However, he has never appeared in public before.

9
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,960
What investment philosophy will Shen Yifan,

10
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,680
who is attending the summit for the first time,

11
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,479
present? Let's wait and see.

12
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,840
The return on investment is too low.

13
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,840
Making a model that costs millions...

14
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,600
It would be better to reduce the price by 100 per square meter,

15
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,200
which would help the business more.

16
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,440
The biggest factor limiting metaverse development

17
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,479
is the hardware.

18
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,520
Even with 8K resolution, VR headsets

19
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,600
still can't match reality.

20
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,720
Well said.

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,040
Mr. Shen, didn't you promise me

22
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,170
that you would come?

23
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,940
Where exactly are you now?

24
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,480
At the boarding gate.

25
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,720
Mr. Shen, are you at the airport?

26
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,040
Hello?

27
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,680
I am Xiao Chu.

28
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,610
Thank you for saving my life, miss.

29
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,320
May I ask your name?

30
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,400
I stand by who I am.

31
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
I am

32
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,280
Who dares

33
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,200
to disturb my sweet dreams?

34
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,200
Zheng Ying, you little bastard,

35
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,860
open the door or I'll kill you!

36
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,160
His name is Yu Youyi.

37
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,800
He's my agent.

38
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,040
Didn't you say you have an important audition today?

39
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,520
Why do you have puffy eyes from oversleeping again?

40
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,800
And I'm someone who dreams of being a hero,

41
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,060
but in reality can only be meek and timid.

42
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,040
A D-list actress.

43
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,160
Eating all day long.

44
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,440
And drinking too.

45
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,720
This is my daily life:

46
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,960
reading novels and eating snacks,

47
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,600
and

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,800
getting scolded by my demon agent.

49
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,839
Youyi,

50
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,200
I'm an artist,

51
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,360
not some immortal,

52
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,760
how can I not eat or drink?

53
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,760
Don't you agree?

54
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,520
Other actresses work so hard,

55
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,650
why are you so content being a slacker?

56
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,360
You need to step up your game.

57
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,520
Because she's a gentle and lovely

58
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,780
elegant lady who enjoys a peaceful life.

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,880
Mr. Shen.

60
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,120
Why did you leave me behind and return to China?

61
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,960
To save costs.

62
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,640
I could have paid my own way.

63
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,720
Time costs.

64
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,600
But I'm worried about you going back alone.

65
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,120
I'm already on my way back.

66
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,450
I'll return after I finish one last thing.

67
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,000
Hello, Mr. Photographer.

68
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,400
Hello.

69
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,120
Hello, sir.

70
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,560
Hi.

71
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,540
Hello, sir.

72
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,880
Thank you for your hard work.

73
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,800
Okay.

74
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,200
You don't need to smile like that with me.

75
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,800
I don't want to smile either,

76
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,240
but my face is frozen.

77
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,610
Did you memorize your lines today?

78
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,640
There are no small roles, only small actors.

79
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,320
Characters have life.

80
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,240
You need to enter the character's life,

81
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,900
feel the character's soul and resonate with it.

82
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,100
Only then can you portray a beautiful woman with depth.

83
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,640
Brother,

84
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,880
in this show,

85
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,650
I only have three scenes total.

86
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,120
One seducing the eldest young master,

87
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,600
one seducing the second young master,

88
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,330
and one seducing the youngest.

89
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,440
And I only have one line:

90
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,220
'Young master, do you think I'm pretty?'

91
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,680
Tell me, where's the soul in that?

92
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,970
You still need to put your heart into figuring it out.

93
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,280
Brother,

94
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:41,600
do you think I can only play these kinds of roles?

95
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,920
Can't I try other types of roles?

96
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,840
Other types?

97
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,159
With those skinny arms and legs of yours,

98
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,760
you want to do action scenes?

99
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,400
How do you know it won't work if I haven't tried?

100
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,400
Mr. Shen,

101
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,800
please get out of the car.

102
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Today you'll know exactly why you're dying.

103
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,240
Do you know who we are?

104
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,280
People who would do this kind of thing

105
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,010
probably wouldn't reveal their names so easily.

106
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,320
Now, the main content of this scene

107
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,200
is you being rejected by the rich young master,

108
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,240
B01 running away heartbroken. Memory card

109
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,600
B010 C027 recording.

110
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,200
It doesn't matter if you're actually heartbroken or not,

111
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,200
just make sure you run beautifully.

112
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,960
Let's start shooting when the actors are ready.

113
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,680
Okay.

114
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,240
The actors are ready.

115
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,400
Action!

116
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,090
Just keep running until you get back to the hotel.

117
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,400
Mr. Liu sent you here, didn't he?

118
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,330
How did you know?

119
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,420
I've already explained about the withdrawal of funds.

120
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,400
He wants to make dirty money.

121
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,240
And is trying to deceive me for a new round of investment.

122
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,040
It's absolutely preposterous.

123
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,960
I'm in a hurry.

124
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,650
Take me to where I need to go.

125
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,740
How much is Mr. Liu paying you?

126
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,330
I'll pay double.

127
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,080
Triple.

128
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,200
Our boss said.

129
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,400
The losses caused by your withdrawal of funds

130
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,480
can't be measured in money.

131
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,240
Ten times.

132
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,000
Even ten times isn't enough.

133
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,720
Kidnapping and extortion.

134
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,400
That's quite bold.

135
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,360
Hello?

136
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,920
Is this 110?

137
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,520
There's been a kidnapping here.

138
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,600
Now

139
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,850
I've tied up the kidnapper.

140
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,680
This is Luoxi Manor,

141
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,960
the filming location of 'Arrogant Young Master Falls for Me'.

142
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,480
You all

143
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,080
Zheng Ying

144
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,080
Zheng Ying

145
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,200
Oh no.

146
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,810
She's also surnamed Zheng.

147
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,370
Just like the heroine I'm looking for.

148
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,620
Durian-flavored dried sweet potatoes.

149
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,680
What a weird flavor.

150
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,290
Come on, let's clean up.

151
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,520
We're done for today.

152
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,650
I don't care what method you use today.

153
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,360
Fine.

154
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,360
I don't want to hear your excuses.

155
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,920
If you don't bring him here today,

156
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,200
you can just stay at his place.

157
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,060
Did you hear me?

158
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,720
How do I look today?

159
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,560
Do I fit the role I'm auditioning for?

160
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,160
Listen to me.

161
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
This opportunity

162
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,680
took me ages to get from the director.

163
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,640
The director has seen your profile.

164
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,720
Your look is fine.

165
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,240
It's your acting skills.

166
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,520
I practically begged the director.

167
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,800
You must make the most of this chance.

168
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,560
Got it?

169
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,400
Yes, I got it.

170
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,640
I've poured my heart out so many times.

171
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,960
Hurry!

172
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,920
Quick!

173
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,820
Mr. Shen, you're here.

174
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,240
Take it easy.

175
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,980
Please come in.

176
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,640
Hurry up!

177
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,120
Thank you for coming, Mr. Shen.

178
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,480
You've suddenly returned from abroad.

179
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,640
Without any notice.

180
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,760
We could have picked you up at the airport.

181
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,720
I provided the funding.

182
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,840
That's why the platform trusted you with the S+ project.

183
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,100
Yet you leaked my personal information.

184
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,320
Is this how you repay me?

185
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,240
No, I...

186
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,080
I didn't do it.

187
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,840
Bye-bye.

188
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,600
I'm sorry. The company has important guests today.

189
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,860
Everyone else, please use the back door.

190
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,240
In 3 minutes,

191
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,880
I want to see this year's financial report.

192
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,000
This...

193
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,080
What's wrong? Is there a problem?

194
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,800
No problem, Mr. Shen.

195
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,160
It's just... Mr. Shen...

196
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,560
I just remembered we have another meeting.

197
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,560
Would you mind waiting here for a moment?

198
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,040
I'm only giving you 10 minutes.

199
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,160
10 minutes...

200
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,120
Yes, Mr. Shen.

201
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,560
Hurry up! We only have 10 minutes.

202
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,690
I told you to prepare it in advance.

203
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,560
Is the audition here?

204
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,700
Why isn't anyone here?

205
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,800
This show must not be popular.

206
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,520
The male actor says,

207
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,720
'Why hasn't your boss arrived yet?'

208
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,320
Why hasn't your boss shown up yet?

209
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,040
This is completely wasting my time.

210
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,640
He must be another actor here for the audition.

211
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,600
Perfect. We can rehearse together.

212
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,920
The boss isn't here.

213
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,880
I'm here to keep you company.

214
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,800
It's you.

215
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,200
That's right.

216
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,620
I'm the executive assistant.

217
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,730
Little Sweetie.

218
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,760
Isn't that Zheng Ying?

219
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,980
What is she doing here?

220
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,040
Here, you need to... quick!

221
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,200
Quick... what?

222
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,080
Don't go.

223
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,810
I came all the way back from Switzerland just for you.

224
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,920
What exactly do you want?

225
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,040
Don't worry. I'll be gentle.

226
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,040
This...

227
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,680
This...

228
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,280
This button.

229
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,360
Forget the button. Get out of my way.

230
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,840
It's okay.

231
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,120
About this little seduction scene...

232
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,400
I also designed a move

233
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,960
where I can pull the tie.

234
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,920
Like this.

235
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,200
Let me go.

236
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,640
Or maybe I'll undo this button too.

237
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,360
Excuse me, where do I line up for the audition?

238
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,760
Has it started yet?

239
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,440
You're on the wrong floor. It's one floor down.

240
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,700
It's already started.

241
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,000
Thanks.

242
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,520
So the audition is on the floor below.

243
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,410
Let's hurry down there.

244
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,160
I'll go ahead first.

245
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,490
See you at the audition.

246
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,680
I wonder if I'll still get to act with you later.

247
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,140
I'm leaving now. Bye-bye.

248
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,840
What terrible taste this person has.

249
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,770
How can anyone swallow this stuff?

250
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,540
Have you heard?

251
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,180
Young Master Shen is here.

252
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,240
Could it be that legendary investment tycoon?

253
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,240
Shen Yifan?

254
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:13,930
Mr. Shen.

255
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,320
Our Black and White Entertainment's profit this year

256
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,840
can exceed 160 percent.

257
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,560
160 percent?

258
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,960
Your profits must have fallen from the sky.

259
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,100
This number is quite auspicious though.

260
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,660
Let's set it as your company's profit target for this year.

261
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,740
How about that?

262
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,140
Can you achieve it?

263
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,020
You really think you can do it?

264
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,760
Don't think that because I'm abroad,

265
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,160
I don't know about the current winter in the film industry

266
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,000
and how difficult things really are.

267
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,660
If you can't do it, just say so.

268
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,340
You hold a large amount of quality intellectual property.

269
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,490
As long as you stay grounded

270
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,620
and focus on solid creative work,

271
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,800
you'll definitely produce projects that audiences love.

272
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,130
I do pursue efficiency,

273
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,080
but I also respect established facts

274
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,400
and industry patterns.

275
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,240
Yes.

276
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,560
Mr. Shen is right.

277
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,880
Mr. Shen's words are excellent.

278
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,640
We'll definitely work hard.

279
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,680
He's really handsome.

280
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,640
Look, I just took a sneaky photo.

281
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,839
So handsome!

282
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,520
This perfect jawline.

283
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,200
It's amazing.

284
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,119
So handsome.

285
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Looking like a magpie. What's handsome about that?

286
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,760
Could he be...

287
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,120
He came back from Switzerland just to find you.

288
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,020
What exactly are you trying to do?

289
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,880
This... this button.

290
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,720
I don't want the button anymore.

291
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,200
It can't be such a coincidence.

292
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,200
Shen Yifan

293
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,880
He's not a CEO, but he creates many CEOs.

294
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,360
If he wants to promote you,

295
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,720
even if you're just a piece of glass,

296
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,880
he can turn you into a diamond.

297
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,920
If he wants to crush you,

298
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,320
even if you're a diamond,

299
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,600
you'll be reduced to shattered glass.

300
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,960
However, Mr. Shen,

301
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,320
to be honest,

302
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,960
the company's performance this year

303
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,920
isn't very good.

304
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,240
Besides the industry climate,

305
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,240
the main reason

306
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,640
is that Cheng Corporation's 'One Screen Sunshine'

307
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,700
has taken too many resources from us.

308
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,160
Mr. Shen, you have no idea,

309
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,520
they're so domineering.

310
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,240
Let me tell you,

311
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,760
as long as companies like theirs exist...

312
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,360
Mr. Liang,

313
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,740
remember this:

314
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,520
Any project backed by Shen Group

315
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,420
can achieve anything.

316
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,000
Yes, yes, yes.

317
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,440
Right.

318
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,760
I'm done for.

319
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,280
He really is an investor.

320
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,200
How can an investor be more handsome than an actor?

321
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,400
I'm totally dead now.

322
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,440
Mr. Liang.

323
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,640
That girl,

324
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,080
do you have her information?

325
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,980
The girl you just asked about,

326
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,360
she came to our company today for an interview.

327
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,360
She's an actress.

328
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:10,960
Her name is

329
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,880
Zheng Ying.

330
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,370
By the way, Mr. Shen,

331
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,880
the actresses we select

332
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,800
are all completely natural.

333
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,680
Beautiful since childhood.

334
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,120
Rest assured.

335
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,600
It's her.

336
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,320
It really is her.

337
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,760
What's with his eyes

338
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,290
looking at me like I'm prey?

339
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,080
Stay calm.

340
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,800
Maybe it's nothing.

341
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,320
Long time no see,

342
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,210
Zheng Xiaohong.

343
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,400
How do you even know my former name?

344
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,560
Seems like you're not letting me off the hook.

345
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,880
Mr. Shen,

346
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,720
what can I do for you?

347
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,240
Zheng Xiaohong, 25 years old,

348
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,720
Sagittarius.

349
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,800
Oh my god,

350
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,600
how did you dig up all my background?

351
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,520
Chenyang No. 2 Elementary School.

352
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,000
I just pulled off two of his buttons.

353
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,440
Does he have to hold such a grudge?

354
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,770
Lives on Xingfu Street.

355
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,040
Wanli Neighborhood.

356
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,120
I hope I'm not going to be shelved. 36th floor,

357
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,800
right?

358
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,920
Oh my god,

359
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,690
this is terrifying.

360
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,490
I need to eat a rainbow candy to calm my nerves.

361
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,370
Why are you here?

362
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,460
Young Mr. Shen,

363
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,320
when your father heard about your kidnapping,

364
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,400
he was furious.

365
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,440
So he sent me to come quickly

366
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,850
to stay with you.

367
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,040
You treated him like a supporting actor

368
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,370
and even had him help you with your scenes.

369
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,370
But not only did he act with you,

370
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,860
you also got him...

371
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,520
You just texted me

372
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,120
saying you found her so quickly.

373
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,720
Congratulations, Mr. Shen.

374
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,000
What should we do next?

375
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,440
The thing is, he asked me to go over,

376
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,400
like some kind of Aladdin's lamp,

377
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,840
asking what my wish was.

378
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,850
Isn't that strange?

379
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,560
What does he really want?

380
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,560
She's been an actress for five years

381
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,480
without a single memorable role.

382
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,160
Right now,

383
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,540
she definitely wants a good role.

384
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
I get it.

385
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,970
He must want to sleep with me for a role.

386
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,010
That's impossible.

387
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,540
Have you forgotten about that incident?

388
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,360
Here, have some water.

389
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,560
Thank you, Director.

390
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,120
If you come with me,

391
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,850
you can choose any role in the film.

392
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,800
I can make it happen for you.

393
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,480
Director,

394
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,360
are you trying to sleep with me for a role?

395
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,560
You could say that.

396
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,600
See this? I'm recording.

397
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,060
You can keep your 'luck' to yourself.

398
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,160
That sleazy Director Wang

399
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,880
can't compare to Shen Yifan.

400
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,080
Sleep with you?

401
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,890
Why would he need to do that?

402
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,080
As long as I can get her a good role,

403
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,420
it should count as helping her fulfill her wish.

404
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,200
So the first rule of the casting couch

405
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,680
is promising resources.

406
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,240
Who do you think you're looking down on?

407
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,770
I'm not that kind of person.

408
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,360
Watch your attitude.

409
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,800
Director Wang is just a small-time director in the industry.

410
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,800
But Shen Yifan

411
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,680
is a big shot in the investment circle.

412
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,840
If you offend Director Wang,

413
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,400
you'll just be without work for half a year at most.

414
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,160
But if you offend Shen Yifan,

415
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,840
you'll be blacklisted.

416
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,400
I

417
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,610
still prefer shooting campus dramas.

418
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,640
This is a workplace drama, so...

419
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,540
This is a campus drama.

420
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,560
Actually, I

421
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,560
quite enjoy filming period dramas.

422
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,240
These are all period dramas.

423
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,200
Take your pick.

424
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,800
I'm always in period dramas,

425
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,170
but I should try something different.

426
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,120
Mystery.

427
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,000
Sci-fi.

428
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:21,880
Fantasy.

429
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,410
Romance.

430
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,860
Whatever you like.

431
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,960
Do you have something

432
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,200
that's not quite sci-fi,

433
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,400
but has some mystery,

434
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,600
fantasy with workplace elements,

435
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,160
workplace with some romance,

436
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,090
and romance with a touch of comedy?

437
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,200
It's such a shame.

438
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,200
That's exactly what I want to act in.

439
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,360
Mr. Shen,

440
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,960
I appreciate your kindness,

441
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,160
but it's really unfortunate.

442
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,560
If there's nothing else, I'll be going now.

443
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,640
Mr. Shen.

444
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,000
Since she doesn't want it,

445
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,280
why don't we just go home?

446
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,240
You can go home.

447
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,250
I was looking to replace my assistant anyway.

448
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,440
Aren't you hungry eating so little?

449
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,440
I heard we need to rush the shooting today.

450
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,680
We'll be filming until late,

451
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,840
so there might not be any midnight snacks.

452
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,040
It's fine. I'm not hungry. I'm on a diet.

453
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,880
Hey there.

454
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,520
Want some snacks?

455
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,440
Durian-flavored chips.

456
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,880
If you don't like durian,

457
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,760
I also have chili pepper flavor,

458
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,730
and black garlic flavor to try.

459
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,320
No, thanks.

460
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,400
I don't have such strong taste preferences yet.

461
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,880
Life is about being brave enough to try new things,

462
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,600
that's how you discover pleasant surprises.

463
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,760
These are all made by

464
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,880
a friend of mine.

465
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,140
She made them herself.

466
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,090
They're low-fat. You definitely won't gain much weight eating these.

467
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,600
Mr. Shen

468
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,820
please take a look at this.

469
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,480
So she doesn't want to get a good role.

470
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,090
She wants to earn money with her own hands.

471
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,840
No wonder she rejected so many projects.

472
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,440
So,

473
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,120
what should we do next?

474
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,050
Give a man a fish,

475
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:30,410
and you feed him for a day. Teach him to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.

476
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,330
Are you Miss Zheng Ying?

477
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,160
Hello.

478
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,760
We're from Juhao Snack Shop.

479
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,160
We saw you're selling snacks and we're very interested.

480
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,760
We'd like to cooperate with you.

481
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,640
If you agree,

482
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,040
Is this for real? This snack factory?

483
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,080
it's all yours.

484
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,560
Great!

485
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,820
She finally accepted.

486
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,160
Our mission is accomplished.

487
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,400
We can go home soon.

488
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,600
Which of my snacks caught your interest?

489
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,000
Fried coriander crisps.

490
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,840
I'm allergic to coriander,

491
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,280
so I've never made that.

492
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,410
He sent you here, didn't he?

493
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,800
I'm sorry, Mr. Shen.

494
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,680
It's my fault for not investigating properly.

495
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,360
I've seen people giving clothes, bags, gifts,

496
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,320
even leasing fish ponds.

497
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,520
But offering a business license is a first for me.

498
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,650
I thought he'd lose interest quickly,

499
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,240
but I didn't expect him to be so persistent.

500
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,760
This isn't persistence.

501
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,320
This is harassment.

502
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,960
What will he do next?

503
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,800
Will he bother my family?

504
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,320
Should I contact her family?

505
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,600
No.

506
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,760
Better not disturb them.

507
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,920
I should find out what she needs first.

508
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,840
Mr. Shen,

509
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,320
please don't rush. Let's take it slow.

510
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,480
Take it slow?

511
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,080
Do you think I have time for that?

512
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,290
So what do you want to do?

513
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,560
I want to teach him a good lesson.

514
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,480
And tell him

515
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,160
I'm not someone to be messed with.

516
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,920
Good idea.

517
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,420
But I advise you not to think that way.

518
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,040
What else?

519
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,530
Then there's only one option left.

520
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:26,920
Brother,

521
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,000
I want to join the film crew.

522
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,130
Whatever role it is,

523
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,160
I'll join the cast immediately.

524
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,050
Just tell me.

525
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,080
Fine. Your ejection fraction is only 40%.

526
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,360
So

527
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,880
how much time do I have left?

528
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,760
If you don't have surgery,

529
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,640
your condition could deteriorate suddenly

530
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,760
and might be life-threatening.

531
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,240
But surgery comes with risks too.

532
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,570
I promised my brother I'd have the surgery

533
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,730
on condition that he gives me six months to return home and fulfill my wish.

534
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,160
And my wish was to find you.

535
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,080
Zheng Xiaohong.

536
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,920
That person looks like a magpie

537
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,120
but acts like a crow.

538
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,940
[Japanese character]

539
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,280
[Chinese character]

540
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,280
Long time no see.

541
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,170
Zheng Xiaohong.

542
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,960
Zheng Xiaohong.

543
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,840
25 years old,

544
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,240
Sagittarius,

545
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,720
formerly attended

546
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,040
Chenyang City Second Elementary School,

547
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,370
lives on Xingfu Street,

548
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,880
Wanli Neighborhood,

549
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,280
Building 36.

550
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,720
Is that right?

551
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,700
This character is a bit weird.

552
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,920
Can you handle it?

553
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,800
It's fine. Didn't you say

554
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,840
actors shouldn't be picky about roles?

555
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,480
Besides,

556
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,920
I just need to avoid him now.

557
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,090
Let's go.

558
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,800
What?

559
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,920
