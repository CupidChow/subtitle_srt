1
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,759
Thank you for saving me today, General.

2
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,400
I am deeply grateful.

3
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,840
But I have no way to repay you.

4
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,800
Between husband and wife,

5
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,060
there's no need to talk about repayment.

6
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,320
I don't understand what you're saying, General.

7
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,580
You don't understand?

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,200
I think you understand perfectly well.

9
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,120
My

10
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,800
General's wife.

11
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,440
You jest, General.

12
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,260
Perhaps we'll meet again.

13
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,120
Who would have thought that the feared Red Lady Bandit

14
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,720
could be so innocent.

15
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,400
Interesting.

16
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,540
Very interesting.

17
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,440
Stop. That's good. We got it.

18
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,640
Everyone's in good form today.

19
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,400
Especially Zheng Ying.

20
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,260
She nailed every take in one shot.

21
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,600
At this rate, we'll wrap up early today.

22
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,560
No wonder.

23
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,980
So she's in a hurry to finish work.

24
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,100
There must be something behind this unusual behavior.

25
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,680
Who else but Mr. Shen

26
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,610
could make her act so differently?

27
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,400
The weather hasn't been good lately.

28
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,260
Drink this to soothe your throat.

29
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,090
I'm going to touch up my makeup.

30
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,400
Film crew gossip!

31
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,760
Agent and award-winning actress,

32
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,200
investor and starlet.

33
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,360
Guaranteed juicy gossip,

34
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,160
200 per story, non-negotiable.

35
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,760
DM if interested.

36
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,000
Mom,

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,280
kindergarten is having a parent-child event next week.

38
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,840
Can you come?

39
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,560
Sweetie.

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,880
But Mommy will be on set next week.

41
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,120
I probably can't get away.

42
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,280
I knew it.

43
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,600
Good thing I already asked Dad,

44
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,760
and he promised he would come.

45
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,560
Thank you.

46
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,200
Nihao told me yesterday

47
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,530
that you agreed to go with him to the parent-child event.

48
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,360
Yes.

49
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,800
I was worried you wouldn't have time and couldn't get away,

50
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,000
so I agreed to go.

51
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,680
Actually, you could tell the teacher you're his uncle

52
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,000
or something like that.

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,680
It's fine.

54
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,840
I think being a dad is pretty nice too.

55
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,440
No.

56
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,080
What I mean is,

57
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,400
I've got nothing else to do anyway.

58
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,330
Taking a photo with Zhengying!

59
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,600
I'm so happy we can work together.

60
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,320
But you completely outshine Zhengying.

61
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,650
I can't believe someone who looks like her

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,440
can act. You're much prettier than her.

63
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,880
Your acting is better too.

64
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,200
Sis, we're all set.

65
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,920
Thanks.

66
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,850
You're welcome.

67
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,120
Xiaoying.

68
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,320
We really like you.

69
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,850
Can we take a photo with you?

70
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,320
I'm sorry. I have something to do.

71
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,250
Maybe tomorrow.

72
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,120
What an attitude!

73
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,560
That's enough.

74
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
Your boyfriend already knows

75
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,840
what you look like.

76
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,680
How is that enough?

77
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,320
I've been staying up late these days.

78
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,160
No matter how I do my makeup, I can't restore my original look.

79
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,090
It wasn't that great to begin with.

80
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,920
What are you up to now?

81
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,960
Just got popular but acting like a big shot.

82
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,120
Bury her.

83
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,520
I'm in this production team,

84
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,160
I can testify that actress Z

85
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,560
is arrogant to extras

86
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,620
and refuses to take photos with them.

87
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,760
She's not even that pretty.

88
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,400
What right does she have to look down on extras?

89
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,960
How did she get famous?

90
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,360
The power of capital.

91
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,840
Wait.

92
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,000
Am I really that famous?

93
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,800
I've barely made a splash.

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,260
Do I really attract this much attention?

95
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,240
Fame brings gossip.

96
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,080
And some people just naturally attract haters.

97
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,010
You've had this quality even before you were famous.

98
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,760
Just stay calm.

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Enjoy your date

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,330
and leave the rest to me.

101
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,440
No.

102
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,220
What are you doing?

103
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,680
I heard the sound of someone taking photos.

104
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,840
[Paparazzi]

105
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,680
Mr. Shen.

106
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,010
I just saw someone taking secret photos outside.

107
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:39,920
There are always

108
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,960
entertainment reporters lurking around the set.

109
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,760
They might not be targeting her.

110
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,560
Actually, being photographed isn't a big deal.

111
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
It could generate some buzz for Zheng Ying.

112
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,680
Just like before.

113
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,080
Hyping up gossip

114
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,080
will only drag her down further.

115
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,560
What she needs now

116
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,820
is to take each step steadily and firmly.

117
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,440
Only then can she stand on solid ground.

118
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,720
Are you leaving soon?

119
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,200
Yes, I have a meeting out of town tomorrow.

120
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,720
What about the snacks I prepared for you?

121
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,880
Did you eat them?

122
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,680
Yes, I did.

123
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,640
Have you been going to bed and getting up early?

124
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,900
Are you getting at least 6 hours of sleep?

125
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,720
Yes.

126
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,040
Have you been taking your medicine on time?

127
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,800
Yes.

128
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,040
Well...

129
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,320
Are you feeling uncomfortable here?

130
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,280
No.

131
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,080
Trust me.

132
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,610
I'll always be like this in the future,

133
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,780
looking after you.

134
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,760
Actually,

135
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,200
I can look after you too.

136
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,520
I'm serious.

137
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,640
I know.

138
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,080
I want to become a brilliant person like you,

139
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,640
and then take care of you.

140
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,560
I believe in you.

141
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,360
Really?

142
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,480
Really.

143
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,280
Because

144
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,260
you're Zheng Ying.

145
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,840
Wu Yu,

146
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,100
turn on the heater.

147
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,680
I'm fine.

148
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,680
Of course you're fine.

149
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,360
I'm your little lucky star,

150
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,840
and the boyfriend of a lucky star

151
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,370
will naturally be blessed with good fortune.

152
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,000
So...

153
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,880
How about taking your lucky star back to the hotel first?

154
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,440
No,

155
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,680
I want to take you to the airport.

156
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,480
No refusing,

157
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,680
no lecturing me,

158
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,280
I insist on taking you there.

159
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,080
This way,

160
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,320
I can spend a little more time with you.

161
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,880
I'm worried about you going back alone.

162
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,080
Alright,

163
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,080
Yu Youyi is already on his way to pick me up.

164
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,520
Then...

165
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,560
you take me first.

166
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,320
What's wrong?

167
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,360
Okay, I got it.

168
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,080
What happened?

169
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,120
Wu Yu says there's air traffic control at the airport.

170
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,120
The flight will be delayed.

171
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,450
Let's wait a bit longer.

172
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,480
No way! Why wait?

173
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,440
You and Wu Yu

174
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,560
should both come back to the hotel with me.

175
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,280
Nothing's more important than getting some sleep.

176
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,240
Just follow my plan.

177
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,160
Tonight,

178
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,480
we'll stay at the hotel first,

179
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,080
and leave tomorrow morning.

180
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,040
Hello?

181
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Youyi,

182
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,370
you don't need to pick me up.

183
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,820
Shen Yifan will take me back to the hotel.

184
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,200
Hello?

185
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,160
Is this the hotel reception?

186
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,560
Please book a room for me.

187
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,480
Hello?

188
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,320
We're not going back today.

189
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,380
Going to the hotel.

190
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,370
Following the plan.

191
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:07,840
Let's go.

192
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,370
Let's go.

193
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,000
You take

194
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,360
the room in front.

195
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,720
He's

196
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,340
sharing a room with me.

197
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,640
Mr. Shen.

198
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,200
Do you have to listen to her?

199
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,560
He won't let me.

200
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,160
He's mine tonight.

201
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,960
You...

202
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,200
Get lost.

203
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,000
This...

204
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,000
Mr. Shen, you need to fight back!

205
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,520
I was just passing by.

206
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,160
I didn't come specifically to see you off.

207
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,320
But since I'm here, I wish you success

208
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,960
and a safe journey.

209
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,000
Most importantly,

210
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,960
come back safely.

211
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,620
Your emotions seem a bit lacking.

212
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,700
Do you need someone to play off of?

213
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,160
After all, someone did praise my acting skills.

214
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,280
So this scene

215
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,760
is about Shanlan seeing Mingjing off,

216
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,280
right?

217
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,000
Alright, let's do it.

218
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,720
I...

219
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,120
Farewell.

220
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,160
What about the

221
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,640
gift?

222
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,760
Do I

223
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,040
really need to bring a gift?

224
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,800
Then what gift do you want?

225
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,440
You know very well

226
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,160
what gift I want.

227
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,140
I don't think this part

228
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,880
is in the script.

229
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,800
Actors can improvise

230
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,480
based on the atmosphere.

231
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,120
Didn't you know that?

232
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,280
Time to sleep.

233
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,080
Good night.

234
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,040
Good night.

235
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,720
I'll go first.

236
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,080
The shooting is tough.

237
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,340
Take care of yourself.

238
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,240
Zheng Ying.

239
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,200
You need to be strong.

240
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,880
You're supposed to look after that man.

241
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,100
Keep working hard.

242
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,020
I really want to take a photo with her.

243
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,440
But I don't dare.

244
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,480
I'm ready to go.

245
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,180
Do you want to go take a photo with her?

246
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,660
I'm afraid they'll come over.

247
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,800
So what if they do?

248
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,300
You can refuse.

249
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,520
Last time I refused because I was busy

250
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,120
and got criticized all over social media.

251
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,160
They dug up ancient history

252
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,440
from my past.

253
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,540
Do you think I still have the right to refuse?

254
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,820
Do you really care about those comments?

255
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,760
Shouldn't normal people care?

256
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,700
When you're on the first floor

257
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,080
and someone insults you,

258
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,560
you hear it and get angry.

259
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,680
When you're on the tenth floor,

260
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,960
you might think they're just greeting you

261
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,360
because you can't hear them insulting you.

262
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,040
When you're on the hundredth floor and someone insults you,

263
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,040
you can neither hear nor see them.

264
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,720
People suffer

265
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,120
because they lack perspective.

266
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,560
Without enough elevation,

267
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,480
all you see are trivial matters.

268
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,480
Rather than wasting energy on those comments,

269
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,600
you should think about

270
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,130
how to climb to the hundredth floor yourself.

271
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,600
Indeed.

272
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,760
Making yourself stronger is the real solution.

273
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,840
Sister Nishang, I'm such a fan!

274
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,440
Can we take a photo together?

275
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,680
I'm sorry, work comes first.

276
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,880
I need to go shoot now.

277
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,840
Lesson learned.

278
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,400
Well, Mr. Nihao.

279
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,240
Our kindergarten

280
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,120
holds a talent show every semester.

281
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,600
This time the theme is photography.

282
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,400
Photography?

283
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,440
I understand you and his mother must be very busy,

284
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,640
but this time

285
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,160
it's Nihao's last chance

286
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,400
to participate before graduating.

287
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,040
I really hope you can attend.

288
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,040
Please don't leave your child

289
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,100
with regrets that can never be fixed.

290
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,600
I'm sorry, sir.

291
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,930
We really can't participate anymore.

292
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,840
You'll be in a scene with Senior Cheng soon.

293
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,720
Yes.

294
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,440
I heard this senior actor is very strict.

295
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,130
I'm so nervous I can't even remember my lines.

296
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,000
Actually,

297
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,240
it doesn't matter if you forget.

298
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,329
What do you mean?

299
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,520
There's a rumor.

300
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,720
50. Non-negotiable.

301
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,240
Hello, Mr. Cheng.

302
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,720
The rumors seem quite credible.

303
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,360
But I can't guarantee it's true.

304
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,640
I need to wait and see.

305
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,760
Anyway, better be extremely careful.

306
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,600
Lord Niu.

307
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,760
Today

308
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,920
is the day you die.

309
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,600
Cut!

310
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,800
Come on, let's do another take quickly.

311
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,280
You came in too early, you know?

312
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,760
I need to stand firm and give you a look,

313
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,800
then you hand it over.

314
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,600
You know what?

315
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,760
You've

316
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,620
completely thrown off my rhythm.

317
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,000
You clearly didn't remember your lines.

318
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,920
Yes, I'm sorry, Mr. Cheng.

319
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,160
Alright, let's go.

320
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,890
Let's go back and try again.

321
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,320
Three, two, one, action!

322
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,040
Such arrogance.

323
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,060
Guards!

324
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,520
Get them!

325
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,520
What is this?

326
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,160
When?

327
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,360
Stop!

328
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,960
Adjust it quickly.

329
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,850
You're blocking my shot. Do you know that?

330
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,600
How can you be so young

331
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,360
and so careless?

332
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,000
Quickly, get up.

333
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,660
Get up. Let's do another take.

334
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,920
Come on, get ready.

335
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,200
3, 2, 1, action!

336
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,360
You.

337
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,200
Stop.

338
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,440
Mr. Cheng,

339
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,640
are you feeling unwell?

340
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,060
What's wrong with you?

341
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,660
Do you even know how to act?

342
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,170
Can't you even follow basic blocking?

343
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,920
Someone's secretly filming from the tree.

344
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,880
Stop filming! Stop it now!

345
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,970
What's going on?

346
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,200
Not all elders deserve respect.

347
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,060
Since he has the advantage of seniority,

348
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,540
you can only endure it.

349
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,520
Just be yourself.

350
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,100
Everyone is watching.

351
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,040
He must be busy too.

352
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,480
I'd better review my script.

353
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,120
He finds fault even when there isn't any.

354
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,600
If I actually make a mistake,

355
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,130
he'll completely explode.

356
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,080
Wait, why are you here?

357
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,010
Selling melons?

358
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,920
That's really not necessary.

359
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,640
I've already experienced it firsthand.

360
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,480
No,

361
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,040
I'm here to buy melons.

362
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,840
Actress Z

363
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,320
never memorizes her lines,

364
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,480
veteran actors suffer tremendously,

365
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,320
and get caught in the crossfire.

366
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,720
What made this go viral

367
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,880
was a video from the paparazzi.

368
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,440
But it was edited,

369
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,970
showing only Cheng Dong scolding Zheng Ying.

370
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,720
Just now,

371
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,130
Chengdong's agent posted another Weibo.

372
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,320
No text,

373
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,840
just one picture.

374
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,760
It's a bitter gourd.

375
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,200
Zhengying's trending topic has now been pushed

376
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,720
to third place.

377
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,920
Didn't the paparazzi catch them?

378
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,960
Wasn't the video deleted?

379
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,160
How did it get leaked?

380
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,760
I bet it's Chengdong's agent behind this.

381
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,440
They just want to save face.

382
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,840
But most importantly, they want to ride the publicity wave.

383
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,240
With his current physical condition,

384
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,370
it's unlikely he can take on any roles.

385
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,320
Amateur tricks.

386
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,600
Pulling this stunt right under my nose.

387
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,280
You're clearly overestimating yourself.

388
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,000
Contact the PR department immediately.

389
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,680
What about

390
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,200
Shen Yifan's side? Any moves from them?

391
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,000
No movement.

392
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,450
No movement.

393
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,250
Aren't we going to help her?

394
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,480
The position she's in now,

395
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,840
the old rules no longer apply.

396
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,320
It's like the Basel dilemma.

397
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,120
Once you lose the protection of rules,

398
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,780
people will do anything to get a piece of the pie.

399
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,620
If she wants to go further,

400
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,490
she must learn to protect what's hers.

401
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,560
But

402
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,400
can she handle it?

403
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,530
What are you talking about?

404
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,280
She's Zheng Ying, after all.

405
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,370
Stop overthinking.

406
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,840
Quickly contact your person to fix this.

407
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,800
If you wait any longer,

408
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,880
you'll be trending all over social media.

409
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,840
Contact him, and then?

410
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,040
Put pressure on him.

411
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Make Chengdong come forward to clarify.

412
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,730
If all else fails, replace him.

413
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,640
But that won't really solve the problem.

414
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,640
Everyone will just think we're covering up the truth.

415
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,800
Acting skills and character

416
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,640
don't always go hand in hand.

417
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,160
He's using you to save face.

418
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,020
Building what?

419
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,560
A dedicated professional image.

420
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,800
He's really calculated this well.

421
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,400
For the first time, I feel

422
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,160
being famous

423
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,600
can also be a mistake.

424
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,280
I, Shan Lan, assassinate corrupt officials.

425
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,760
I seek not fame,

426
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,440
but to carry out justice on heaven's behalf.

427
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,300
To uphold the justice in my heart.

428
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,120
What does that mean?

429
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,160
It's my favorite line.

430
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,680
Are you

431
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,320
going to confront him head-on?

432
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,400
Why not?

433
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,080
I am Zheng Ying after all.

434
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,640
Mr. Niu,

435
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,170
you abduct innocent women,

436
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,720
withhold soldiers' pay,

437
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,240
frame loyal officials, and betray our country for your own glory.

438
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,240
A thousand deaths would not be enough for your crimes.

439
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,080
You've already killed eight officials

440
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,440
and there's a bounty on your head.

441
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,800
You can't escape.

442
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,320
Why not

443
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,000
join me instead?

444
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,080
I can certainly protect you

445
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,010
and you'll enjoy wealth and glory.

446
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,840
I've been prepared to die for a long time,

447
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,370
so why speak of protection?

448
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,120
Enemies surround us, people are starving,

449
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,920
the world is so miserable.

450
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,040
Mr. Niu,

451
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,840
why don't you go to hell

452
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,680
and enjoy all that glory

453
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,560
with your like-minded friends?

454
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,960
Stop.

455
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,160
Cut.

456
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,520
Good. Very good.

457
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,640
Ms. Zheng, let me take that.

458
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,480
Excellent! That was amazing!

459
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,640
Good.

460
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,840
Thank you.

461
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,800
That scene was really good.

462
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,160
Thank you.

463
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,360
Good work, Ms. Zheng.

464
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,770
The training results are good.

465
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,240
Mr. Cheng.

466
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,480
Mr. Cheng.

467
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,080
Mr. Cheng, are you okay?

468
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,800
Mr. Cheng.

469
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,400
I understand.

470
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,400
Gather the PR department

471
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,400
for a meeting.

472
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,440
You've already done a great job.

473
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,240
From now on,

474
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,760
leave it to me.

475
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,360
Is it a lot of trouble?

476
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,250
Anything related to you

477
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,600
is never a burden.

478
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,170
Do you remember what I said that night?

479
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,480
Since I want to become

480
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,360
someone who shines like you,

481
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,800
then this time,

482
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,720
I must get through it myself.

483
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,100
As for you, you don't need to do anything.

484
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,120
Just wait and see how I handle it.

485
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,640
Just watch me.

486
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,440
I believe you can definitely

487
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,340
become someone who shines brightly.
