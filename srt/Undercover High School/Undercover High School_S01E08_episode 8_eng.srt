00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,660
   
 Delete the entry log and get out of there! 

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,600
I will withdraw.

Agent.

9
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,150
Agent, how much longer?

10
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,470
   

11
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,690

14
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,850
Agent, are you okay?

15
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,120
Let's go.

16
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,480
Only Do didn't make a sound...

17
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,520
Why just that one?

18
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,310
Could it just be old and broken?

19
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,130
Keyword, you idiot. Keyword.

20
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,420
A key that moves without a sound.

21
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,850
That itself is evidence, not broken.

22
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,300
Right?

23
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,280
Hey, what's wrong?

24
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,140
- Sorry? 
 - Did something happen in the chairwoman's room?

25
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,430
No, I must be tired.

26
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,360
I'll get off here. Yeong Hun.

27
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh, yes.

28
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,450
Take care.

29
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,090
Bye.

30
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,460
What's up with him?

31
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,260
Something seems off.

32
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,480
Let's go.

33
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,930
Let's clean up quickly and go home!

34
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,400
- Ms. Ri An! 
 - Yes?

35
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,810
Why are you acting fragile?

36
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,580
- Don't you want to go home? 
 - Yes.

37
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,750
- Hurry up. 
 - Sorry doesn't cut it!

38
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,380
You should look where you're going.

39
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,010
So annoying.

40
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,710
- I apologize. 
 - D-Don't worry about it.

41
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:43,990
- I'll clean it and return it to you. 
 - Clean up!

42
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,450
Do you know how much these shoes cost?

43
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,390
Should I call the cops?

44
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,870
Kneel and apologize before I demand full compensation.

45
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,490
Please stand up.

46
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,090
Stand up.

47
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,000
What are you doing right now?

48
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,080
He's much older than you.

49
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,320
Apologize for treating him crassly.

50
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,000
Gosh, this is nuts.

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,160
- You think you're all that? 
 - Han Seung Jae.

52
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,260
Why don't you clean it up instead?

53
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,840
Why are lowlives stepping it up these days?

54
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,650
 Han Seung Jae. 

55
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,130
How dare you speak to your teacher that way?

56
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,940
Look at my shoes...

57
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,690
Cut it out.

58
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,780
I'm sorry, Teacher.

59
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,730
I apologize on his behalf.

60
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,450
I'm sorry to say this, but he's the one who deserves an apology.

61
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:52,160
Not from you but directly from Han Seung Jae.

62
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,490
Ms. Oh.

63
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,120
Watch how you speak to Seung Jae's father.

64
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,200
Sir, my apologies.

65
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,690
I'll have a firm word with Ms. Oh later.

66
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,950
Please don't be upset.

67
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,640
Yes. Let it go, Su Ah.

68
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,150
No need to push it on a day like today.

69
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,710
Your car is waiting outside.

70
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,030
Please go this way.

71
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,190
Mr. Lee.

72
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,300
- Let's go. 
 - Sure.

73
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,860
Gosh. You don't care about the full-time position?

74
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,070
I said not to mess with the student council kids.

75
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,980
He crossed the line with someone who is his elder.

76
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,190
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

77
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,160
Thank you so much.

78
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,670
Also, this...

79
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,310
It fell out of that student's pocket.

80
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,140
Thank you.

81
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,450
What is this?

82
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,920
Don't know.

83
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,340

86
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,280
Third, done.

87
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,750
Only the fourth remains.

88
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,920
   

89
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,740
   

90
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,040
   

91
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,810

96
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,850
   

97
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,930
 Do you know the source of the tip that the foundation aims to smuggle the safe out yet? 

98
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,980
I'll ask the director to verify the tip.

99
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:23,030
You just focus on the safe and the urban legends that are in front of you.

100
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,770
   

101
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,500
Team Leader.

102
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,380
Team Leader.

103
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,420
We've arrived.

104
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,920
Thank you.

105
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,110
- Take care. 
 - Take care.

106
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,100
What's up with the Team Leader now?

107
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,400
He must be down because Hae Seong is down.

108
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,510
They're family.

109
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,480
Let's go.

110
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,670
Sunbae.

111
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,260
Speaking of family,

112
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,150
what if we became...

113
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,120
I'm seeing someone.

114
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,770
Let's go.

115
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,310
Here we go.

116
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,370
   
   

117
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,270
   

118
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,800
Moves without a sound...

119
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,220
I'm not smart enough for this.

120
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,300
Might as well prepare for class.

121
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,230
   

122
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,590
"Now, the melody is gone,

123
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:02,240
and only the lyrics remain."

124
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,060
Only the lyrics remain...

125
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,620
Lyrics?

126
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,410
Our school's lyrics...

127
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,090

131
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:30,400
The soundless key was Do...

132
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,410
   

133
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,570
   

134
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,920
Deul...

135
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,580
Byeong...

136
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,850
   

137
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,380
What the hell does this mean?

138
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,350
   

139
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,960
The dead girl...

140
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,440
The dead female student's recital...

141
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,150
The Do in the female student's part?

142
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,550
   

143
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,490
   

144
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,950
"The bead shall

145
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,070
shine like gold

146
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,830
in the red sun..."

147
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,700
Gold...

148
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,520
I figured it out!

149
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,340
   

150
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,710
   

151
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,010
   

152
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:07,150
You won't pick up my calls, and I run into you here.

153
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,450
Hey.

154
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,970
Give me a moment.

155
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,190
Agent, I deserve a compliment.

156
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,460
I solved the third urban legend.

157
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,450
Look, here.

158
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,700
The answer was in the keyword.

159
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,190
The key that moves without a sound. The dead female student's piano recital.

160
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,560
The Do you played didn't make a sound.

161
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,020
When I checked the lyrics of the female student's partâ€“

162
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,610
Thanks. Good work.

163
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,160
What's with that reaction?

164
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,180
A student smoking?

165
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,000
Agent, did something happen?

166
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,900
Something's been off since the chairwoman's room...

167
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,770
Nothing is wrong.

168
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,260
What's with him...

169
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,970
Hey!

170
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,760
Pay attention when someone's worried about you.

171
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,530
Follow me. Let's grab a drink.

172
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,500
It was Seo Myeong Ju.

173
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,420
The one who put me on this mission.

174
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:40,970
Seo Myeong Ju used me as part of her search for the gold.

175
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,610
I was a mere pawn in a rigged game of chess.

176
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,550
And there's a rat inside the company.

177
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,670
There's no one I can trust.

178
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:06,680
I'm not sure if this will help, but...

179
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,870
I hope you don't feel alone.

180
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:20,180
It's too painful to suspect everyone around you.

181
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:28,070
Once you find the one untrustworthy person, you'll learn that everyone else is on your side.

182
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,170
Also,

183
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,370
I'm here, too.

184
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,230
You're drinking it up.

185
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,540
Cheers.

186
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,380
In your view, who do you suspect the most?

187
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,000
It must be someone who knows about this mission.

188
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:59,810
Don't worry. I'll help you find that bastard.

189
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,310
You'll have to be at school all day.

190
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:09,330
And it's too hard to start from NIS.

191
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,900
What if we surveil the chairwoman?

192
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,670
Location tracking, following, checking phone logs...

193
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,030
Can't NIS do all that?

194
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,220
To an extent.

195
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,270
How did you know you could do that?

196
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,130
I've watched a lot of spy movies...

197
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,150
Am I imagining this, or are you talking casually to me?

198
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,580
We're the same age.

199
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,900
Is that right?

200
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,700
When did we share our background?

201
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,480
In elementary school.

202
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,780
Oh, back then...

203
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,530
In elementary school?

204
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,810
To be exact, in second grade.

205
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,620
Why am I your arch-nemesis?

206
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,830
â™«  Why can't you see, my darling  â™«

207
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,510
 - You're similar to him.  
  - Whom? 

208
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,160
 Someone. My arch-nemesis. 

209
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,910
â™«  Please just focus on me, babe  â™«

210
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,020
â™«  You pretend like you don't know  â™«`

211
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:12,840
â™«  I pretend like I don't  â™«

212
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:19,630
â™«  I once said so that one time (what?)  â™«

213
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:23,460
Why did you change your name? I prefer Bong Ja.

214
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,490
And one more thing.

215
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,930
This is my house.

216
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,500
â™«  I didn't mean what I said  â™«

217
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:42,460
â™«  I was afraid my feelings for you would be revealed  â™«

218
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,210
So you're Shi Hyeon?

219
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,800
- You're Jeong Shi Hyeon? 
 - Yes.

220
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,690
You've lived nearby me this whole time, and

221
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,890
all this time I thought of you...

222
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,100
No...

223
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,780
No way!

224
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,920
Jeong... Jeong Hae Seong.

225
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,250
Why is your name Hae Seong? Did you change your name, too?

226
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,270
When I joined the company.

227
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:12,420
I can't use my real name during a mission.

228
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,140
Okay, so I'll keep calling you Hae Seong.

229
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,960
Don't you dare call me Bong Ja. I'll kill you.

230
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,810
I think Bong Ja is a prettier name.

231
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,480
Fine, Oh Su Ah.

232
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,140
Shock after shock.

233
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,990
Tell me right now anything else I should know.

234
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,190
Nothing else.

235
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,790
You're sure? Really, nothing else?

236
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,560
I'm sure.

237
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,630
It's late. Go home.

238
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,750
Bye...

239
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:46,010
â™«  Would we be different now?  â™«

240
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,250
â™«  If it's not too late  â™«

241
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,970
Hae Seong.

242
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:59,700
I was really disappointed when you transferred without a word in second grade.

243
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,020
But I got to know later.

244
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,920
That you left because your father went missing.

245
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,230
I read this somewhere.

246
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,600
Hope lives only in those who believe.

247
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,310
I'm sure you'll find your father.

248
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,820
I better.

249
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,800
Go to bed. Tomorrow will be another busy day.

250
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,990
   

251
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,260
   

252
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,780
   

253
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,560
 About this semester's grades. 

254
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,860
 You went way up. 

255
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,290
 You rock, Dad. How about the science contest? 

256
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,910
 Come on now. 

257
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,590
 Who do you think I am? 

258
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,560
 I took care of it. 

259
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:33,310
 You're up for many awards, not just essays. 

260
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,300
 Make sure you review it carefully. There's a lot. 

261
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,900
 But you... you must keep this secure. 

262
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,610
 Of course! 

263
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,880
 Up for awards... 

264
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,890
 What does that mean? 

265
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,350
What's wrong?

266
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,420
Is Seung Jae not here yet?

267
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,480
I saw him earlier, but he's not here.

268
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,430
Should I call him?

269
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,970
It's okay. I'll look for him.

270
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,470
 It was like that... 

271
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,130
 No! Gosh... 

272
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:19,610
 I've been meaning to tell you... 

273
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,380
 I've been so worried about that. 

274
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,300
 You look good in that! 

275
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,630
 Really? Thanks! 

276
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,460
 What? 

277
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,980
Mr. Jun Ho, do you know what this is?

278
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,750
- What is it? 
 - Seung Jae dropped it at the event.

279
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,980
I meant to give it to him this morning. I forgot.

280
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:41,870
I thought about it, and we should check before returning it.

281
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:44,780
No. We can't do that with something that isn't ours.

282
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,390
Kids get involved with online crime these days.

283
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:52,000
What if it ends up being something like that?

284
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,100
But still, I don't think Seung Jae would go that far.

285
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,780
Ms. Kim Ri An and Mr. Lee Jun Ho.

286
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,960
- Yes? 
 - The principal is looking for you.

287
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,010
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

288
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,760
What's the harm in checking? Just check.

289
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,360
You can give it to him once you check that it's nothing.

290
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,320
Darn it.

291
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,400
Damn...

292
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,570
Hey, Ye Na.

293
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,240
I've been looking for you, and here you are.

294
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,820
I'm sorry. I'm busy right now.

295
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,970
Let's talk later.

296
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,620
During the Night of Byeongmun,

297
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,720
I was here.

298
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,190
I overheard you and your dad talking.

299
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:11,560
I have lots of questions for you, Seung Jae.

300
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,610
Sure, I get it. I understand what you're saying.

301
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,850
Hey, Han Seung Jae.

302
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:23,140
I'm asking you.

303
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,910
Stop with the excuses and answer me.

304
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,220
Let me ask you for the final time.

305
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:39,030
How did you win the science essay contest that hasn't even opened yet?

306
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:42,750
What did your dad hand you, and why did he ask you to keep it safe?

307
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:46,230
Spill it, and don't leave anything out.

308
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,230
You asked me first.

309
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,130
   

310
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,800
     

311
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,450
     
   

312
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:19,920
   

313
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,250
   

314
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,410
 GPA tampering? 

315
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,890
Yeah.

316
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:38,340
Since the first semester of our first year. The chairwoman recommended other kids, too.

317
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,580
No way.

318
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,770
Why would my mom do that?

319
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,320
I couldn't say why.

320
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,610
I'm sure the adults have a reason.

321
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,900
I better go see my mom.

322
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,030
Lee Ye Na.

323
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,110
What are you going to say to the chairwoman?

324
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:06,220
"This is wrong. It needs to stop"?

325
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,370
Are you going to make suggestions?

326
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,600
Wow. You don't know how to read the room.

327
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,480
Forgive me for saying this, Class President,

328
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,330
but you benefitted the most from this, Ye Na.

329
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:26,540
All your piano recitals, artwork, first place in every contest...

330
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,990
None of that was your doing.

331
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:32,090
What do you mean?

332
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,840
You're chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju's daughter.

333
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:42,280
Your mom made them happen, you stupid girl.

334
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:50,250
Ms. Oh Su Ah has our link?

335
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,200
Ms. Oh Su Ah.

336
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,800
Hello.

337
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,410
Where are you hurrying off to?

338
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,870
I have to prepare for class.

339
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:15,050
You majored in Korean history, right?

340
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,630
Yes.

341
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,740
I love World History.

342
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:24,910
For instance, the Sino-Japanese War of 1894.

343
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:30,940
How did Japan crush the enormous Qing Dynasty

344
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,800
and start the era of their imperial dominance?

345
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,100
Military power? Firearms?

346
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,610
The intelligence of their commanders?

347
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,090
No.

348
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,340
Discipline.

349
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:47,600
Every single soldier followed their superiors' orders.

350
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,980
It was thanks to discipline.

351
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,600
If a Japanese soldier drank water outside of breaks, he was executed by gunfire right then and there.

352
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,950
Violating rules...

353
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,400
Messing with the environment...

354
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,650
In order to nip the bud

355
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,800
of any person who may become a problem.

356
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,260
Pow.

357
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,480
Listen to me...

358
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:23,670
if you want to be at this school for a long time.

359
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:35,440
Good luck preparing for class.

360
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,460
Chairwoman.

361
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:53,290
Forgive me, but didn't Japan's imperial dominance eventually collapse?

362
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,490
I'll get going.

363
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,520
Darn it.

364
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,480
I must be crazy.

365
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,640
Why did I go off at her with the facts?

366
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,730
Darn it.

367
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:34,480
What do I do?

368
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,400
I'm too scared to do this alone.

369
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,900
   

370
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,280
   

371
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,780
If this happens, the enrollment results will change.

372
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,250
How about poor kids who worked hard without knowing this?

373
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,870
We need to look into this.

374
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:11,430
It may be unhinged around here, but this can't be.

375
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,520
What in the world...

376
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,260
Can you help me by chance?

377
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,900
Sorry. I don't think I can.

378
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,710
As you know, the internal stuff at my institution...

379
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,800
I don't have the bandwidth.

380
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,260
I'm sorry.

381
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:54,230
   

382
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,600
   

383
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,400
You thought it was a boy and got excited, no?

384
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,550
I'm seriously telling you. Don't do this again.

385
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,610
Are you the villain of the library?

386
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:34,590
I'll be careful.

387
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,940
Thanks for this.

388
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,510
Why are you studying so hard?

389
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,490
Exams just ended.

390
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:50,050
It doesn't end when the exams end.

391
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:54,450
What matters is what goes on my transcript.

392
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:58,860
I also have to prepare for the contest. I'm busy.

393
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,350
Contest?

394
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:04,570
Yeah. The school math contest.

395
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:07,200
I may not look like it, but I'm the best at math.

396
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,870
I beat Ye Na in the midterms, thanks to math.

397
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,690
 If this happens, the enrollment results will change. 

398
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,110
 How about poor kids who worked hard without knowing this? 

399
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:19,120
What are you thinking?

400
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,910
Nothing.

401
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,580
The contest. Is it really important?

402
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,040
I think so.

403
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,180
It helps with SSP. 
    

404
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,000
Oppa, have I told you?

405
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,420
My dream is to become an NIS agent, like you and Dad.

406
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,830
You didn't know, did you?

407
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,200
That's why this contest is important to me.

408
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,530
It determines the tier I will be in to get into a college where I can pursue my dream.

409
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:55,120
Therefore, I must work even harder.

410
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,060
Did you argue with my dad?

411
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,830
He can't get in touch with you. He's worried.

412
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:04,720
I just have a lot on my mind.

413
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,790
Sure you do.

414
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:10,230
You worry about things you don't need to yet.

415
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,460
You overthink ahead of time.

416
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,980
Give anxiety a break.

417
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,670
Let's live simply.

418
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,610
I'm leaving.

419
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,710
Call my dad.

420
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,610
Damn!

421
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,820
 I met Oppa. 

422
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,810
 He hasn't called since he has a lot on his mind. 

423
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:58,420
How can he just flat-out refuse like that?

424
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:03,830
How can I do that big thing on my own?

425
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,130
   

426
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,320
   

427
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,610
   

428
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,600
   

429
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:44,070
 It's from Dong Min's grandmother. 

430
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,070
 I have no right to take this. 

431
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:48,390
 Make yourself worthy of it. 

432
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,600
   

433
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,290
   

434
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,870
   

435
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,460
   

436
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,800
So, Ms. Oh Su Ah took our documents.

437
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,390
Wow, how ridiculous.

438
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,280
I guess that's when she took it, Dad.

439
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,680
When she butted in at the event hall.

440
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,320
Be quiet.

441
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,130
You did nothing to help.

442
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,230
   

443
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,660
   

444
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,940
Why is there nothing?

445
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:09,960
My son made a mistake.

446
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,330
I'm sorry to cause concern, Chairwoman.

447
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,370
It was a small accident.

448
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:18,280
I deleted the link, so don't worry too much.

449
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,940
 Is there anyone besides Ms. Oh Su Ah 

450
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,090
 who knows about the link, Seung Jae? 

451
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:32,750
Just one. Ye Na.

452
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:36,270
She asked, so I answered.

453
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:39,050
That you made her grades happen.

454
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,780
Hey, youâ€“

455
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,020
Ye Na is not supposed to know.

456
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,100
Gosh, it's time for her to know.

457
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,500
She's been so arrogant thinking she got first place herself.

458
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,670
Go through that for another year?

459
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,460
My Ye Na was like that?

460
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:55,610
I'm sorry to say this, but honestly, it's annoying.

461
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:57,570
People talk about her a lot at school.

462
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:00,110
- That she's rude. 
 - Han Seung Jae!

463
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,700
Get out.

464
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,500
- You don't deserve to eat. 
 - Okay.

465
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,910
 I'm sorry, Chairwoman. 

466
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:24,780
This is all my bad parenting.

467
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,570
He's a young boy. It's okay.

468
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:28,970
Yes.

469
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,680
Oh, and one more thing...

470
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:38,970
I heard the Edu-City construction was postponed.

471
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,310
I think some folks involved are starting to talk.

472
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:45,840
There are rumors of insufficient funds.

473
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,780
 Maybe you should say something... 

474
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:55,100
Mr. Han, have I ever disappointed the parents?

475
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,240
No, no, never.

476
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,620
I just...

477
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:06,680
The communication between the parents and me wouldn't have been possible without trust.

478
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:14,820
The parents put in effort for my project, and I give their children benefits in return.

479
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,060
 Think about what kind of trust ties us. 

480
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,140
 What is best for our children? 

481
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,170
 That's all you should think about. 

482
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,640
 That is... 

483
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,070
my answer.

484
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,360
Got it. Let's do that. You're right.

485
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,490
Let me pour you a glass.

486
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,570
Anyway, is it okay to let Ms. Oh Su Ah be?

487
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:42,160
 We'll teach her a lesson she won't forget. 

488
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,780
Where are you?

489
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,040
Wait. I'll be there.

490
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,860
C-Chairwoman, this is the men's bathroom. You're in the wrongâ€“

491
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,570
Wh-What are you doing? What did I do?

492
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,720
 Get on your knees. 

493
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,790
 Get on your knees. 

494
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,640
 Yes, Ma'am. 

495
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:42,660
That rude mouth of yours is always a problem.

496
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:46,200
I-I-I'm sorry.

497
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,640
I didn't mean to tell Ye Na.

498
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,710
You don't know what you did wrong.

499
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,130
What?

500
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,310
Wh-Wh-What do you...

501
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:06,490
Han Seung Jae, when you see an adult from now on,

502
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,130
don't tell them something you shouldn't.

503
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,610
Yes.

504
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,930
Clean up and come out.

505
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,360
What are you doing?

506
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,440
Looking into the GPA tampering?

507
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,170
Did you put a camera on me or something?

508
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,940
Why are you doing so much?

509
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,130
I thought you wanted to be a full-time teacher.

510
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:14,710
So why are you foolishly risking danger when no one else is taking it on?

511
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:17,410
Because no one else is taking it on.

512
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:30,080
My first student that I told you about?

513
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,400
She left school.

514
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,860
 Do you have proof? 

515
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:38,450
 Proof that my daughter framed that orphan girl? 

516
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,530
 Chairwoman, please calm down. 

517
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,750
 Ms. Oh, what are you doing? Apologize. 

518
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,420
 It's fine. What kind of teacher... 

519
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,830
 Hurry up and apologize! 

520
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,710
 Chairwoman! Chairwoman! 

521
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,430
 She was framed for stealing a test paper, 

522
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:01,460
 and I told her I'd protect her. 

523
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,900
But I couldn't do anything.

524
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,640
A temp teacher acted out, not knowing her place.

525
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:13,010
I became determined then.

526
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,320
"I'm going to earn the right first."

527
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,960
Justice without power is incompetence.

528
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,020
I'm going to be full-time first, no matter what.

529
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,890
But now?

530
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:32,700
Thanks to someone, I remembered something I had forgotten.

531
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:43,170
Something more important than being full-time.

532
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:45,830
Why I chose this path in the first place.

533
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:49,700
To protect my own students.

534
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,700
I'm not asking you to help me. So, don't worry.

535
00:40:55,700 --> 00:41:02,660
- Just don't try to talk me out of it. 
 - Seo Myeong Ju knows that you're looking into the GPA tampering.

536
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,980
It doesn't matter.

537
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:10,350
I'm saying it's dangerous to do it at school.

538
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,550
Let's get out of here.

539
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,630
Let's do it together.

540
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,140
Is that okay?

541
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,610
Get your stuff. Let's go now.

542
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:24,230
Hey, hey! Wait for me!

543
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,080
One second! Wait!

544
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,890
Wait!

545
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,570
We should be safe here.

546
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,410
Let's get started.

547
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:46,670
This is 10 years' worth of student records and GPA evaluations per subject.

548
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,680
So we need proof of tampering in here?

549
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,200
Because the link itself is gone.

550
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,990
Let's start.

551
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:58,700
The suspicious parents have something in common.

552
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,280
Look at this.

553
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,600
Let's cross-check with the parents at the event.

554
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,910
 To our children's future. 

555
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:13,950
 Cheers! 

556
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:32,130
â™«  The name I wrote down every day in my diary  â™«

557
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:33,170
Are you hungry?

558
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:38,080
â™«  Filled up my heart like a magic spell  â™«

561
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,020

â™«  Flying above the clouds with both eyes closed  â™«

564
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,200

â™«  If you see my shadow pass by  â™«

572
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:26,310
â™«  Call my name  â™«

573
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:37,810

575
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:45,530

576
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:48,540
â™«  I was wandering looking for a path  â™«

577
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:53,020

578
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:56,360

00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:02,320

581
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,020

582
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,800
â™«  If you see my shadow pass by  â™«

583
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,570
â™«  Call my name loudly  â™«

584
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:18,270
â™«  A night filled with falling stars  â™«

585
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:20,960
â™«  into the dark sky  â™«

586
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,720
â™«  When I run and reach out my hand  â™«

587
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,050
â™«  Hug me like I'm about to break  â™«

588
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:28,430
You must be tired. Sleep more.

589
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:30,100
No, no.

590
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,700
How far did you get?

591
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:35,480
- I'm done with "Volunteering". 
 - Yeah?

592
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:37,560
I dozed off.

593
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,080
â™«  I'll be honest  â™«

594
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,290
â™«  I'll embrace you  â™«

595
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:47,650
   

596
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:48,950
   

597
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:52,630
It's like an onion. We have already found so much.

598
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:56,510
Thanks to you, I got something unexpected.

599
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:00,980
What Seo Myeong Ju earned with the tampering

600
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:02,380
was Edu-City.

601
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:06,240
This is the dark side of the chairwoman's project.

602
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:14,540
The rat inside the NIS helped knowing the gold would be used in this dirty business.

603
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:17,270
We have to stop this.

604
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:21,020
Disregarding the student victims, they're just satisfying their greed.

605
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,020
How can they do this to the school and the kids?

606
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,060
We need to stop it somehow.

607
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:45,000
Stop staring. You'll poke a hole in my head.

608
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:52,600
Sunbae, you said you went through a breakup this summer.

609
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:57,790
If I remember correctly, your eyes were swollen the whole month.

610
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:59,730
I'm seeing him again.

611
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,810
Got it?

612
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:03,040
Okay.

613
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,960
Sunbae! You weren't answering our calls or texts!

614
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,000
- We were worried! 
 - We were worried!

615
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,480
You two are in sync.

616
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,930
Where's the Team Leader?

617
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:12,550
He was here earlier.

618
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:15,240
Anyway, open this.

619
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,820
Follow me.

620
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:22,250
GPA tampering? All of a sudden?

621
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:24,700
It's not just simple GPA tampering.

622
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:31,630
Seo Myeong Ju tampered with their grades and got the power needed for Edu-City in return.

623
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:34,620
In all fields. Politics, finance, media, law.

624
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,020
It's a massive cartel.

625
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:40,220
Seo Myeong Ju's cartel works for Edu-City.

626
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:43,550
She's looking for the gold bars for this project.

627
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:49,300
The moment the Edu-City project succeeds, this country's education system will be shaken.

628
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,310
We must stop this project for Seo Myeong Ju toâ€”

629
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:59,530
What are you doing? You didn't call in for days.

630
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:02,400
Follow me out.

631
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:13,940
Are you out of your mind?

632
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,870
Did you forget about the mission?

633
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:18,630
Why do you care about GPA tampering?

634
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:22,070
She didn't just tamper with it on her own.

635
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:23,950
The root of Seo Myeong Ju's Edu-City project isâ€”

636
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:27,710
So what does that have to do with you?

637
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:33,670
It involves Yu Jeong, Ahjussi.

638
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:38,670
If we leave this alone, Yu Jeong will also get hurt.

639
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:42,800
So?

640
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,670
Yu Jeong, Seo Myeong Ju's business...

641
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:47,800
What do they have to do with you?

642
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:50,860
Are you serious?

643
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:55,490
Your duty, man... is to find King Gojong's gold bars.

644
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:58,710
Students and businesses are irrelevant here.

645
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:02,370
I'm not speaking as Yu Jeong's father.

646
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:07,510
I'm speaking as your boss and a Team Leader at NIS.

647
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:09,780
Get your hands off the school's business.

648
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,740
Agent Jeong Hae Seong,

649
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:14,810
look for the gold bars.

650
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:18,120
How long are you going to stay there?

651
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,500
Are you going to graduate at this rate?

652
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,500
- Why do you think I'm saying this? 
 - Ahjussi.

653
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,620
Why do I feel like...

654
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,260
you're so obsessed with the gold?

655
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,080
Because it will decide whether our team will exist.

656
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:47,260
It's important to you, too.

657
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,890
How far are you on the mission?

658
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:56,440
After going into the chairwoman's room last week, what's been going on in your head?

659
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,010
Hey.

660
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,680
Are you fighting?

661
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:04,620
Shouldn't you be at school right now?

662
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,450
Come to my office.

663
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,100
   

664
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:26,240
The project Seo Myeong Ju aims to accomplish with the gold is being supported by GPA tampering?

665
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:30,390
The tampering and gold point in the same direction.

666
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:33,120
It looks like a serious problem.

667
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:36,710
Let me think it over. Go back to the mission.

668
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:37,850
Got it.

669
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:41,500
Seok Ho, brief me on the mission progress in an hour.

670
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,240
Got it.

671
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,960
You can go now.

672
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,780
I was about to call you.

673
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:08,820
Jeong Hae Seong is overstepping these days.

674
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,630
That far?

675
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:18,600
How arrogant.

676
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:24,350
Newspapers, magazines, and movies

677
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:28,390
in the 1920s and 1930s quickly imported Western culture.

678
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:31,990
Big cities started the trends of pop culture.

679
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:35,140
Capitalistic consumer culture advanced.

680
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:38,700
Seoul was the center of its formation.

681
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:42,930
That's all for class today.

682
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,200
 We have an order to stop the mission. 

683
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,670
 Wrap it up within the week. 

684
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:59,350
Stop the mission?

685
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:04,890
I said I was looking into Seo Myeong Ju's tampering then I got a text like that.

686
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:06,910
You just went to the NIS recently.

687
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:08,180
Who knows about this?

688
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:11,260
My teammates and the director of the NIS.

689
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:15,600
Only the director or my team leader can give me this order.

690
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:24,290
You have to stay at school to keep an eye on Seo Myeong Ju.

691
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:28,340
She's the one who really stopped this mission.

692
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:32,060
She heard from the rat that I'm looking at tampering

693
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:34,650
and is trying to cut me off.

694
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:40,390
I have to stay at school for the mission and to catch the rat.

695
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:43,780
I'm going to bait Seo Myeong Ju.

696
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:45,470
How?

697
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,660
Using the gold bars as ransom.

698
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:54,460
If I said I knew where the gold bars were?

699
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:58,700
She can never kick me out.

700
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,200
   

701
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:04,700
Is the chairwoman coming today?

702
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,200
No wonder. The menu is luxurious.

703
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,430
I guess that's today.

704
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:11,100
Her biannual school lunch tour.

705
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,340
I'm passing on lunch.

706
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:14,410
I can't digest food if I make eye contact with her.

707
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:15,630
Same. Pass.

708
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:17,830
Same. I'm scared.

709
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:19,700
Then same.

710
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:22,890
Hae Seong, where are you going?

711
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:27,910
Lunch. I'm hungry.

712
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,750
Enjoy your food.

713
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:35,370
I will.

714
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:37,050
Go ahead.

715
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:39,680
Could you add avocado to the salad?

716
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,960
- Oh, avocado. 
 - Yes, and...

717
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,670
Hello, Chairwoman.

718
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:45,480
Oh, hello.

719
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,640
How can I help you?

720
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,750
I wanted to eat with you.

721
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:52,030
- Could I sit here? 
 - Jeong Hae Seong.

722
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:53,950
Can't you see we're already eating?

723
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:56,230
If you want to meet with her, go through...

724
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:57,770
Vice Principal.

725
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:59,680
Have a seat over here.

726
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,370
Thank you.

727
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:11,310
Thank you for the food.

728
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:13,680
Wow. Looks good.

729
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:20,270
So, what do you want to say?

730
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:21,290
What?

731
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:24,300
Isn't that why you're sitting across from me?

732
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,110
Actually...

733
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:31,450
I don't know if I can ask you this.

734
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:33,590
Ask me anything. Go ahead.

735
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,170
Okay, then...

736
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:42,030
I've wanted to know for a while.

737
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:47,320
Byeongmun High was famous at my old school.

738
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:51,140
Rumor says that the people who know know.

739
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:53,760
The biggest mystery of Byeongmun High.

740
00:53:56,260 --> 00:54:00,030
Why is Byeongmun High's food so good?

741
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:05,810
Food?

742
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:07,610
But I think I know why.

743
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:11,360
You come here yourself to take care of us.

744
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:14,680
Eat plenty.

745
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:18,050
If you actually come up with something to say,

746
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:19,660
come to the chairwoman's office.

747
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:23,100
Come on. How can a student go there?

748
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,510
But thank you for saying that.

749
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:32,120
Oh, Chairwoman.

750
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:36,180
Has our school gym ever been remodeled?

751
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:38,900
The gym?

752
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,000
It hasn't been remodeled. Why?

753
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:51,130
As you know, I'm a very curious person.

754
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:54,130
I hear a lot of funny stories around school.

755
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:57,190
You like urban legends.

756
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:07,590
But...

757
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:11,570
not many people know the gym story.

758
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:13,560
How did you know?

759
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:17,400
Thank you for the food.

760
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,590
I'm going to get going.

761
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:42,970
So, he will stick around school with the fourth urban legend as the excuse.

762
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:44,790
Principal.

763
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:48,490
Please rush my previous order.

764
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:50,740
Yes, Ma'am.

765
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:55,830
I'll figure out Seo Myeong Ju's movements today.

766
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:58,850
Okay. I'll look through more stuff at school.

767
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:01,200
 Okay. Be careful. 

768
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,360
   

769
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:24,300
   

770
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,290
 We found the connections, but it's not enough. 

771
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:32,090
 Evidence to prove that GPA tampering is happening. 

772
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:34,360
 Specific evidence. 

773
00:56:34,970 --> 00:56:37,760
 Let's think more about how we'll find them. 

774
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:50,440
What are you doing here? You're not at ballet?

775
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,600
I have something to ask you.

776
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,270
What is it?

777
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,610
What is it?

778
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:09,600
Tell me, Mom...

779
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:12,710
All the times I got first place...

780
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:15,300
Yes. I made it happen.

781
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,950
- Mom. 
 - You're my daughter.

782
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:25,380
My daughter has to be the best and as a mom, I have a duty to make her that way.

783
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:27,560
Then, what about me?

784
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,750
What about all the effort...

785
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,780
I put in so far with my life on the line?

786
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:36,240
That's why no one suspected you.

787
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,340
Ye Na...

788
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:44,920
Don't think. Just keep doing what you're doing.

789
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,660
I'll handle the rest.

790
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:51,320
You're different from kids like Yu Jeong.

791
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:56,000
You were chosen to be Seo Myeong Ju's daughter

792
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,440
and have an overflowing right to get the benefits.

793
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,940
Honestly, I want to give you more.

794
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:06,280
Speaking of, get rid of Yu Jeong.

795
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,460
A year was enough to toy with her.

796
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:11,430
Gosh, honestly...

797
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:12,870
I was very angry.

798
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:18,200
I mean how dare someone like her beat my daughter to first place?

799
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:21,990
Don't speak ill of Yu Jeong.

800
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:23,660
What?

801
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,110
I've never toyed with Yu Jeong.

802
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:29,950
Don't talk like that about my friend.

803
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:32,220
Did you just call her your friend?

804
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:13,500
 Ye Na. 

805
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:16,750
 Sorry. I'm going to sit here. 

806
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,580
 You got second place this time. 

807
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:22,550
 I beat you by one question. 

808
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,090
 Can I sit next to you? 

809
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:27,230
 Oh, yeah, sure. 

810
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:34,940
 What's your secret? You don't have tutors or study groups. 

811
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:39,110
 Focus on textbooks? 

812
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,370
 Is studying the easiest thing for you? 

813
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:47,060
 Yu Jeong, right? An Yu Jeong. 

814
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:50,250
 I'm so curious about you. 

815
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:52,110
 Let's be friends. 

816
01:00:56,010 --> 01:00:57,680
Lee Ye Na.

817
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,770
What are you doing here?

818
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,470
Here.

819
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:27,560
Oh, my, you're the Ye Na I've been hearing about.

820
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,140
I hear you're besties with my daughter.

821
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:34,440
Please keep taking good care of Yu Jeong.

822
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:38,320
I know she's kind of bitchy, but be patient.

823
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,260
Mom! Stop being weird. Go to your room.

824
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:44,220
I don't want to. I want to eat with Ye Na.

825
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:46,610
Ye Na, enjoy your meal.

826
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:49,220
Let me know if you need anything.

827
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:51,220
Thank you for the food.

828
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:54,830
Gosh! Her voice is so pretty!

829
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:57,550
Okay, sure.

830
01:01:58,290 --> 01:02:00,110
Oh, wait.

831
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:03,830
Enjoy.

832
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:26,000
You like this. No?

833
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:40,720
â™«  The early dawn, it reminds me of  â™«

834
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:44,000
â™«  Your smile, your voice  â™«

835
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,130
â™«  It shines within my heart  â™«

â™«  Deeper and deeper  â™«

837
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:52,460
I'm going.

01:02:53,580 --> 01:03:01,160
â™«  And just being together guides me to life  â™«

839
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:04,650
â™«  I'm in love with you  â™«

840
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:06,380
Yu Jeong.

841
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:09,860
I enjoyed dinner.

842
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:13,090
Thank you.

843
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:16,300
Got it. Go.

844
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:21,150
See you tomorrow.

845
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:25,670
â™«  Your soft hands make me dream of you  â™«

â™«  Your soft hands make me dream of you  â™«

850

853
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:12,170
   

854
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:18,430
   

855

858
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:34,380
It can't be.

859
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,120
   

860
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,940

862
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:06,250
Is he not home yet?

863
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:10,110
   

864
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,830

01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:32,030
 Min Ji. 

870
01:07:32,030 --> 01:07:33,670
 Min Ji. 

871
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:40,560
 Promise me, Ms. Oh. 

872
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:41,670
 Promise? 

873
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:45,700
 I wish we had more teachers 

874
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:48,960
 like you in the schools. 

875
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:53,030
 Promise me you'll become a full-time teacher. 

876
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:03,000
â™«  After a long day  â™«

877
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:11,000
â™«  I try holding on but fall down on myself  â™«

878
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,060
â™«  Like you're going to pass me by  â™«

879

â™«  The distant nights come to me  â™«

880
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:35,110
â™«  A smile that I couldn't understand  â™«

881
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:39,170
 The DNA results from the scene are here. 

882
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:43,600
 But why would someone who was at the scene go to your house, Sunbae? 

883
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,570
 Promise? After stabbing someone? 

884
01:08:46,570 --> 01:08:48,900
 Why didn't you tell me this whole time? 

885
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,870
 If you knew the truth... 

886
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:53,220
 Let me just ask one thing. Why me? 

887
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:56,210
 Why are you asking me that? 

888
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:58,220
 I'm sorry I couldn't protect you. 

889
01:08:58,220 --> 01:08:59,950
 How far did you think you could go? 

890
01:08:59,950 --> 01:09:02,300
 You are being so reckless. 

891
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:04,850
 Hae Seong brought Ms. Oh to the hospital. 

892
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:06,530
 Is Hae Seong not here because of Ms. Oh? 

893
01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:11,900
 If you're that sorry be nice to me. 

894
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:18,760
â™«  You help me feel love  â™«
