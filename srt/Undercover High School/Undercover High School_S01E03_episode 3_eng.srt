00:00:00,344 --> 00:00:04,254
   

2
00:00:04,854 --> 00:00:07,834

 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Undercover Love Team ðŸ’– @Viki.com 

4
00:00:21,974 --> 00:00:23,694
I'm going...

5
00:00:23,694 --> 00:00:25,614
I'm going to call the police.

6
00:00:25,614 --> 00:00:27,714
Don't call the police.

7
00:00:27,714 --> 00:00:29,214
This isn't a skeleton.

8
00:00:29,214 --> 00:00:30,834
It's a model.

9
00:01:07,994 --> 00:01:09,714
Who are you?

10
00:01:12,464 --> 00:01:15,314
I came in because the door was open.

11
00:01:15,314 --> 00:01:17,954
What are you boys doing here?

12
00:01:17,954 --> 00:01:20,014
Principal...

13
00:01:26,494 --> 00:01:28,644
This is a model of a skeleton.

14
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:32,274
Dong Min and I found it, trying to check out the urban legend.

15
00:01:32,274 --> 00:01:33,474
Urban legend?

16
00:01:33,474 --> 00:01:35,244
The one about the old building.

17
00:01:35,244 --> 00:01:37,644
The ghost that appears in the ballet studio...

18
00:01:43,584 --> 00:01:45,494
Who would do such a thing?

19
00:01:45,494 --> 00:01:48,094
Actually, when we came inâ€“

20
00:01:48,094 --> 00:01:50,044
I don't know.

21
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:52,084
I'm sorry we came in without permission.

22
00:01:52,084 --> 00:01:54,024
We will reflect on our mistakes.

23
00:01:58,834 --> 00:02:02,614
Be careful next time.

24
00:02:02,614 --> 00:02:04,044
Got it.

25
00:02:32,044 --> 00:02:34,024
Why didn't you let me tell him

26
00:02:34,024 --> 00:02:36,064
that there was another person besides us?

27
00:02:36,064 --> 00:02:37,904
We don't even know who it was.

28
00:02:37,904 --> 00:02:40,394
Telling him might just escalate this.

29
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:43,014
Who do you think it was?

30
00:02:44,604 --> 00:02:46,744
I guess we'll find out.

31
00:02:50,014 --> 00:02:52,974
The uniforms at Byeongmun High in the 1950s,

32
00:02:53,964 --> 00:02:58,114
the ballet studio, the ballet uniform, and the legless skeleton model.

33
00:02:58,114 --> 00:03:00,894
A scene that faithfully recreates the old story.

34
00:03:00,894 --> 00:03:04,014
The urban legend? Why?

35
00:03:04,014 --> 00:03:05,434
By whom?

36
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:08,354
This key was found with the skeleton model.

37
00:03:09,344 --> 00:03:11,684
The seal on the key...

38
00:03:15,534 --> 00:03:19,084
matches Seo Byeong Mun's seal exactly.

39
00:03:19,084 --> 00:03:23,184
The thing to pay attention to is the characters on the front of the key.

40
00:03:23,184 --> 00:03:26,324
It translates, "The start of the gold bars."

41
00:03:26,324 --> 00:03:29,824
But one of the characters is different.

42
00:03:29,824 --> 00:03:31,874
This character for "bar" means "legend."

43
00:03:31,874 --> 00:03:33,704
The same character is used in "urban legend."

44
00:03:33,704 --> 00:03:38,554
So you're saying the gold bars and the urban legend are related?

45
00:03:38,554 --> 00:03:40,124
So far, yes.

46
00:03:40,124 --> 00:03:43,804
The urban legend itself is a key to the gold.

47
00:03:43,804 --> 00:03:49,174
Seo Byeong Mun, after hiding the gold bars, set up the urban legend like a riddle?

48
00:03:49,174 --> 00:03:53,974
So you must solve the urban legend to get to the gold bars.

49
00:03:54,614 --> 00:03:57,814
There are more questions than answers right now.

50
00:03:57,814 --> 00:04:00,964
But two things are certain.

51
00:04:00,964 --> 00:04:02,474
First.

52
00:04:02,474 --> 00:04:06,334
We must get to the gold before Seo Myeong Ju.

53
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:07,494
Second.

54
00:04:07,494 --> 00:04:10,084
Now that we know the story relates to the gold,

55
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:13,304
we must focus on the school's urban legends.

56
00:04:13,304 --> 00:04:17,564
Including the one about the old building, Byeongmun High has four urban legends.

57
00:04:17,564 --> 00:04:20,404
Please allow me to investigate them.

58
00:04:20,404 --> 00:04:21,884
Go ahead.

59
00:04:21,884 --> 00:04:23,874
Figure out what the other urban legends are.

60
00:04:23,874 --> 00:04:25,284
Got it.

61
00:04:27,654 --> 00:04:30,254
   

62
00:04:31,764 --> 00:04:34,014
The ballet studio?

63
00:04:34,014 --> 00:04:35,054
Why there?

64
00:04:35,054 --> 00:04:37,674
They went to check out the urban legend.

65
00:04:37,674 --> 00:04:43,474
In that process, they discovered a model skeleton.

66
00:04:43,474 --> 00:04:45,234
Urban legend?

67
00:04:49,564 --> 00:04:51,750
My goodness, oh, no...

68
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,904
I didn't even imagine...

69
00:04:54,904 --> 00:04:56,984
The urbanâ€“

70
00:04:56,984 --> 00:04:59,674
How interesting!

71
00:05:07,114 --> 00:05:10,184
Anyway, he was an incredible person.

72
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,844
What a peculiar man.

73
00:05:13,984 --> 00:05:16,934
A school urban legend?

74
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:21,074
How should I wrap up this incident?

75
00:05:21,074 --> 00:05:22,784
For now...

76
00:05:24,144 --> 00:05:26,574
let's keep an eye on it.

77
00:05:27,264 --> 00:05:29,444
The students know the school best.

78
00:05:29,444 --> 00:05:35,334
Maybe this will resolve itself in an unexpected way.

79
00:05:37,084 --> 00:05:39,054
Why are you asking about the school's other legends?

80
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:42,274
Just because. I'm curious after what happened last night.

81
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:44,214
Tell me more.

82
00:05:44,214 --> 00:05:47,664
So you do like urban legends.

83
00:05:47,664 --> 00:05:51,004
I thought only kids like me liked them.

84
00:05:51,004 --> 00:05:52,854
What is a "kid like you"?

85
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:55,484
No fancy parents, no friends.

86
00:05:55,484 --> 00:05:59,064
A loner who writes weird online novels.

87
00:06:00,934 --> 00:06:02,564
Hey.

88
00:06:03,534 --> 00:06:05,344
Nothing is wrong with you.

89
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:09,624
Friends are useless anyway.

90
00:06:09,624 --> 00:06:10,974
Wait until you get out into the real world.

91
00:06:10,974 --> 00:06:12,534
Life is lonely.

92
00:06:12,534 --> 00:06:15,694
We all end up alone anyway.

93
00:06:15,694 --> 00:06:18,704
How would you know that?

94
00:06:18,704 --> 00:06:21,014
I just do.

95
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:22,504
So?

96
00:06:22,504 --> 00:06:24,534
What's the next urban legend?

97
00:06:33,274 --> 00:06:36,654
What's with the big sigh?

98
00:06:36,654 --> 00:06:40,044
What are you thinking about?

99
00:06:40,044 --> 00:06:42,444
Nothing. I just...

100
00:06:45,084 --> 00:06:47,574
What do you think of me?

101
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,414
Am I that clueless?

102
00:06:57,244 --> 00:06:59,694
I guess you're not all that quick.

103
00:06:59,694 --> 00:07:02,624
Why? Did something happen?

104
00:07:02,624 --> 00:07:04,744
Sort of.

105
00:07:07,734 --> 00:07:10,354
Hello, Dong Min's grandmother. How are you?

106
00:07:10,354 --> 00:07:13,174
Yes. I'm calling because...

107
00:07:13,174 --> 00:07:17,484
you know my ID that the school took?

108
00:07:17,484 --> 00:07:19,394
When can I get that back?

109
00:07:19,394 --> 00:07:21,174
Did the school take your ID?

110
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:24,344
 Dong Min's friend said yesterday... 

111
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:28,094
that the school was offering a scholarship and needed my ID.

112
00:07:28,094 --> 00:07:30,264
Which friend?

113
00:07:30,264 --> 00:07:31,504
Jeong Hae Seong.

114
00:07:31,504 --> 00:07:33,654
Jeong Hae Seong?

115
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:42,554
 Excluding the one about the old building, there are three other urban legends here. 

116
00:07:42,554 --> 00:07:45,964
 And one of them is this. 

117
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:48,814
It's a story about the grandfather clock.

118
00:07:49,714 --> 00:07:53,504
People think it doesn't chime because it's broken,

119
00:07:53,504 --> 00:07:56,614
but it does every once in a while.

120
00:07:56,614 --> 00:07:59,254
When you are alone at night

121
00:07:59,254 --> 00:08:01,704
and no one else is in school.

122
00:08:03,164 --> 00:08:06,674
It's the story the students fear most.

123
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:09,554
You can never stay at school by yourself.

124
00:08:09,554 --> 00:08:11,814
If the clock strikes,

125
00:08:11,814 --> 00:08:15,914
a pair of red eyes will come to get you.

126
00:08:15,914 --> 00:08:17,844
Red eyes?

127
00:08:19,104 --> 00:08:22,874
Between a valedictorian and salutatorian from...

128
00:08:23,624 --> 00:08:24,744
I got you.

129
00:08:24,744 --> 00:08:27,134
Are you scamming people now? Come with me.

130
00:08:27,134 --> 00:08:28,414
Ms. Oh, it hurts!

131
00:08:28,414 --> 00:08:30,734
Don't talk down to me!

132
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:38,284
Tell me straight.

133
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,874
Why did you take Dong Min's grandmother's ID?

134
00:08:40,874 --> 00:08:42,184
Her ID?

135
00:08:42,184 --> 00:08:43,884
 Forgetting about it doesn't cut it. 

136
00:08:43,884 --> 00:08:47,274
 How will you use my grandmother's ID? 

137
00:08:48,014 --> 00:08:50,794
Wow, you almost tricked me.

138
00:08:50,794 --> 00:08:53,464
This is a very serious issue.

139
00:08:53,464 --> 00:08:56,344
Come to the counseling office right after school.

140
00:08:56,344 --> 00:08:57,994
Me?

141
00:08:57,994 --> 00:09:00,164
Ms. Oh, I-I didn't...

142
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,424
I'm busy today!

143
00:09:06,764 --> 00:09:09,484
I'm aging years here.

144
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:13,374
Park Tae Su, that son of a bitch!

145
00:09:20,614 --> 00:09:23,004
Tae Su!

146
00:09:23,004 --> 00:09:25,914
Gosh, he'll get himself in big trouble.

147
00:09:26,894 --> 00:09:29,354
What do I do?

148
00:09:29,354 --> 00:09:31,474
Jeong Hae Seong...

149
00:09:32,194 --> 00:09:34,004
Jeong Hae Seong.

150
00:09:56,674 --> 00:10:02,764
   

151
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:11,854
 Hi. I'm your teacher starting today. 

152
00:10:11,854 --> 00:10:14,684
 My name is Oh Su Ah. 

153
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:20,424
 Looking forward to being with you. 

154
00:10:20,424 --> 00:10:22,694
 Yes. 

155
00:10:48,074 --> 00:10:49,854
Come in.

156
00:10:53,304 --> 00:10:54,924
Director.

157
00:11:01,384 --> 00:11:05,294
I requested an appraisal from the National Heritage.

158
00:11:05,294 --> 00:11:07,294
This is definitely a replica.

159
00:11:07,294 --> 00:11:11,574
Agent Jeong Hae Seong is already on the mission.

160
00:11:11,574 --> 00:11:15,154
I'm not sure how we should resolve this...

161
00:11:19,164 --> 00:11:20,864
   

162
00:11:26,414 --> 00:11:27,954
Go.

163
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,274
 Yes, Sunbae. 

164
00:12:18,274 --> 00:12:19,894
The analysis results are back.

165
00:12:19,894 --> 00:12:21,434
First, the pointe shoes.

166
00:12:21,434 --> 00:12:24,364
They were actually buried there in the 1950s.

167
00:12:24,364 --> 00:12:28,084
Like you said, I think Seo Byeong Mun put them there.

168
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:29,474
The guy who ran away from the old building?

169
00:12:29,474 --> 00:12:31,744
The blood analysis is also back.

170
00:12:31,744 --> 00:12:34,124
I think you should see this yourself.

171
00:12:34,124 --> 00:12:36,294
I'll send you his info and a photo.

172
00:12:36,294 --> 00:12:38,094
Okay, thanks.

173
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:47,664
   

174
00:12:47,664 --> 00:12:53,834
   

175
00:12:59,524 --> 00:13:01,454
   

176
00:13:06,574 --> 00:13:08,894
Why isn't he here yet?

177
00:13:16,174 --> 00:13:18,214
 Ms. Oh, I'm sorry. 
   

178
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,194
 I left the stove on at home... 

179
00:13:21,194 --> 00:13:23,334
I need a drink.

180
00:13:34,134 --> 00:13:36,594
Have some. You look exhausted.

181
00:13:36,594 --> 00:13:38,374
Aigoo, thank you!

182
00:13:38,374 --> 00:13:39,744
Thanks for this.

183
00:13:39,744 --> 00:13:42,474
It seems like you didn't sleep much last night.

184
00:13:42,474 --> 00:13:44,764
Because you were at the old building?

185
00:13:48,154 --> 00:13:50,204
The one who threw a hammer at me.

186
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,704
That was you, right?

187
00:13:51,704 --> 00:13:54,104
Young man, don't say such things.

188
00:13:54,104 --> 00:13:55,244
Why would I be there?

189
00:13:55,244 --> 00:13:57,994
I would get in big trouble with the principal.

190
00:13:57,994 --> 00:14:00,014
I saw those sweatpants yesterday.

191
00:14:06,154 --> 00:14:08,694
Want to place a bet?

192
00:14:08,694 --> 00:14:13,754
There's a scrape from a nail on your leg. Yes or no.

193
00:14:15,714 --> 00:14:18,204
An unused partition at the back of the building.

194
00:14:18,204 --> 00:14:20,704
That's how you come and go, right?

195
00:14:40,444 --> 00:14:42,944
I only have one question.

196
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:48,244
What were you doing there?

197
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:55,704
You knew a fake skeleton was there, right?

198
00:14:55,704 --> 00:14:56,804
Fake?

199
00:14:56,804 --> 00:14:59,224
- I guess you didn't. 
 - Gosh!

200
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,374
I-I thought it was real.

201
00:15:03,374 --> 00:15:06,164
When I first saw it, I was so scared...

202
00:15:06,164 --> 00:15:08,914
What kind of crazy bastardâ€”

203
00:15:15,004 --> 00:15:17,184
I first discovered the skeleton whenâ€”

204
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:23,524
I mean, I first discovered the fake when I was feeding the cat.

205
00:15:23,524 --> 00:15:26,204
 Gosh, look at you eating. 

206
00:15:29,434 --> 00:15:31,694
 Aigoo, so yummy. 

207
00:15:34,254 --> 00:15:35,914
 Kitty! 

208
00:15:38,284 --> 00:15:39,834
 Kitty! 

209
00:15:42,914 --> 00:15:44,774
 Kitty... 

210
00:15:45,984 --> 00:15:47,944
 Kitty. 

211
00:15:49,384 --> 00:15:52,194
I knew about the urban legends at the old building.

212
00:15:52,194 --> 00:15:55,814
Since I was bored, I thought I'd check it out...

213
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,500
   

214
00:16:47,664 --> 00:16:48,974
   

215
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:16,964
Y-Young man...

216
00:17:16,964 --> 00:17:18,774
What else could I have done?

217
00:17:18,774 --> 00:17:19,974
I was scared.

218
00:17:19,974 --> 00:17:23,174
I couldn't tell anyone for fear of being fired.

219
00:17:23,174 --> 00:17:27,194
I was there to hammer the nails yesterday and scared the hell out of me when I ran into you.

220
00:17:27,194 --> 00:17:31,634
I was so scared that... I threw the hammer...

221
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,504
That's what happened.

222
00:17:33,504 --> 00:17:36,214
When you first saw the model, did anything seem off?

223
00:17:36,214 --> 00:17:38,414
Anything, even something small?

224
00:17:38,414 --> 00:17:40,094
Not sure...

225
00:17:40,094 --> 00:17:43,124
I'm not sure about that...

226
00:17:44,404 --> 00:17:47,074
Wait! Are you the police, young man?

227
00:17:47,074 --> 00:17:49,244
Why do you ask?

228
00:17:50,844 --> 00:17:51,904
   

229
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,654
Never mind then.

230
00:17:54,654 --> 00:17:58,244
Get your tetanus shot. It might get bad otherwise.

231
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,094
   

232
00:18:04,094 --> 00:18:06,054
You won't tell the school, right?

233
00:18:06,054 --> 00:18:08,164
Make sure you keep it a secret.

234
00:18:14,064 --> 00:18:16,124
The security guard...

235
00:18:16,124 --> 00:18:18,914
Why did he go inside the old building?

236
00:18:18,914 --> 00:18:21,594
I didn't see anything suspicious yet.

237
00:18:21,594 --> 00:18:24,374
Then why did he run?

238
00:18:24,374 --> 00:18:27,374
It's a no-entry area. He didn't want to be misunderstood.

239
00:18:32,624 --> 00:18:34,354
But I'm curious.

240
00:18:34,354 --> 00:18:36,624
Why are we here?

241
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:40,704
It's so obvious. We're having a meeting.

242
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:43,820
So why are we meeting at a sandwich shop?

243
00:18:44,494 --> 00:18:45,614
Welcome.

244
00:18:45,614 --> 00:18:47,804
Can I get a sandwich and a cola?

245
00:18:47,804 --> 00:18:50,624
Got it. Have a seat.

246
00:18:51,284 --> 00:18:52,344
You got that, right?

247
00:18:52,344 --> 00:18:54,924
One sandwich and one cola.

248
00:18:54,924 --> 00:18:57,244
What is this?

249
00:18:59,654 --> 00:19:01,764
Listen up. I'll cut to the chase.

250
00:19:01,764 --> 00:19:05,774
- This will be our team's operational headquarters. 
 - What?

251
00:19:05,774 --> 00:19:11,034
If we're going to support you, we decided we should be near the scene, too.

252
00:19:11,034 --> 00:19:13,734
But still, are we in a movie or something?

253
00:19:13,734 --> 00:19:14,984
What happened to the actual owner?

254
00:19:14,984 --> 00:19:17,524
Vacationing in the US until mission completion.

255
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,704
I withdrew early from my retirement.

256
00:19:19,704 --> 00:19:22,514
I'm going to lose my mind.

257
00:19:22,514 --> 00:19:24,734
Does Yu Jeong know?

258
00:19:24,734 --> 00:19:28,124
We agreed on a 100K won increase in her allowance.

259
00:19:30,884 --> 00:19:32,434
What about the urban legends?

260
00:19:32,434 --> 00:19:33,874
Are things okay at school?

261
00:19:33,874 --> 00:19:35,934
I'm looking into things.

262
00:19:35,934 --> 00:19:39,564
- As for school... 
  - This is a very serious issue. 

263
00:19:39,564 --> 00:19:42,724
 Come to the counseling office right after school. 

264
00:19:43,924 --> 00:19:45,754
Not much going on.

265
00:19:50,394 --> 00:19:52,414
If you're going to make an excuse,

266
00:19:52,414 --> 00:19:54,614
at least give me a good one.

267
00:19:55,424 --> 00:19:57,334
The stove?

268
00:19:59,904 --> 00:20:02,104
The stove?

269
00:20:02,104 --> 00:20:04,824
What a clever bastard.

270
00:20:06,574 --> 00:20:09,234
If he dares to walk into school tomorrow...

271
00:20:09,234 --> 00:20:12,914
I'm going to destroy him!

272
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,404
Are you crazy, bastard?

273
00:20:35,404 --> 00:20:37,024
You want what?

274
00:20:37,024 --> 00:20:39,884
Give me back my grandmother's ID.

275
00:20:40,744 --> 00:20:42,634
Wow.

276
00:20:42,634 --> 00:20:44,494
I know you took it.

277
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:47,744
- Before I call the policeâ€“ 
 - Shit.

278
00:20:55,084 --> 00:20:57,634
Hey. Get up.

279
00:20:57,634 --> 00:20:59,234
Get up.

280
00:21:01,064 --> 00:21:02,834
You're a funny bastard, aren't you?

281
00:21:02,834 --> 00:21:05,380
Why are you being so rebellious these days?

282
00:21:06,524 --> 00:21:10,384
Dong Min, let's go back to how we were.

283
00:21:10,384 --> 00:21:12,184
Give it back.

284
00:21:12,184 --> 00:21:14,234
Just bullying me is enough.

285
00:21:14,234 --> 00:21:17,144
My grandma has nothing to do with this.

286
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:22,164
Damn it.

287
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,844
Fine. It's all good.

288
00:21:28,844 --> 00:21:31,454
I don't need it. Take it.

289
00:21:44,444 --> 00:21:46,514
It's no fun if we stop here.

290
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:50,474
Mr. Writer, you're right-handed. Right?

291
00:21:50,474 --> 00:21:53,234
Write with your left hand from now on.

292
00:21:53,234 --> 00:21:55,204
What are you doing?

293
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,934
Hello, Ms. Oh.

294
00:22:10,864 --> 00:22:13,054
I asked you.

295
00:22:13,054 --> 00:22:15,480
What are you doing here?

296
00:22:16,074 --> 00:22:18,364
I just got here, too.

297
00:22:19,024 --> 00:22:20,944
Dong Min, are you okay?

298
00:22:20,944 --> 00:22:22,624
What's wrong?

299
00:22:25,684 --> 00:22:28,204
I saw everything.

300
00:22:28,204 --> 00:22:29,984
Park Tae Su,

301
00:22:29,984 --> 00:22:32,174
go to the Counseling Office.

302
00:22:33,424 --> 00:22:36,234
I said go. Didn't you hear me?

303
00:22:36,234 --> 00:22:38,734
Do you want me to call your parents?

304
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,904
Wow, you are getting on my nerves.

305
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,734
Ms. Oh,

306
00:22:45,734 --> 00:22:47,684
just pretend you didn't see anything.

307
00:22:47,684 --> 00:22:50,204
You're a contractor. Act like one.

308
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,934
Geez.

309
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:03,674
I'll let this one go since you look pretty today.

310
00:23:04,844 --> 00:23:06,864
Don't do it again.

311
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,674
Dong Min,

312
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:26,274
has Tae Su been bullying you this whole time?

313
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:37,044
Your grandmother called.

314
00:23:38,134 --> 00:23:39,754
Did Tae Su take her IDâ€“

315
00:23:39,754 --> 00:23:41,674
No, Ms. Oh.

316
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,474
Tae Su and I were just playing.

317
00:23:47,474 --> 00:23:49,620
I'm okay.

318
00:23:50,314 --> 00:23:52,684
I'm sorry to cause trouble.

319
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,384
I'm sorry.

320
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,160
Geez!

321
00:24:20,914 --> 00:24:25,604
 Tell me straight. Why did you take Dong Min's grandmother's ID? 

322
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,774
Yes, Sunbae.

323
00:24:37,774 --> 00:24:39,674
Is anyone next to you?

324
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:45,534
Do you need me to do something on the side?

325
00:24:45,534 --> 00:24:47,944
I need you to look into something. Year 2, Class 1, Park Tae Suâ€“

326
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:52,494
 The mission stops the moment something like this happens again. 

327
00:24:52,494 --> 00:24:54,924
 I heard you joined the NIS after your dad. 

328
00:24:54,924 --> 00:24:57,354
 What will you say when you find him later? 

329
00:24:57,354 --> 00:25:00,254
 That you got fired during a mission? 

330
00:25:00,254 --> 00:25:01,780
 Hello? 

331
00:25:02,324 --> 00:25:04,734
Never mind. Forget it.

332
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,184
Grandma, get out of the way!

333
00:25:13,184 --> 00:25:15,874
Aigoo, I'm sorry. Sorry.

334
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,884
It's loud. Could you be quiet?

335
00:25:23,884 --> 00:25:28,454
Sorry. I don't want you to be late for your study group.

336
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,744
Please get out of the way.

337
00:25:32,744 --> 00:25:34,870
Aigoo, yes.

338
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,600
Gosh.

339
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,904
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

340
00:25:56,804 --> 00:25:58,674
Aigoo, thank you...

341
00:25:58,674 --> 00:26:00,574
He gets stranger by the day.

342
00:26:00,574 --> 00:26:02,854
It's dangerous here. Let's move quickly.

343
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:04,404
Let's go.

344
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,444
Thank you, young man.

345
00:26:24,444 --> 00:26:27,250
It was easy for me, thanks to you.

346
00:26:28,284 --> 00:26:29,674
Would you like something to drink?

347
00:26:29,674 --> 00:26:32,624
No, I'm okay. I'll be on my way, then.

348
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,924
Grandma!

349
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,694
Dong Min, you're home.

350
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,364
What happened?

351
00:26:43,364 --> 00:26:45,214
Why are you two together?

352
00:26:45,214 --> 00:26:47,474
Are you Dong Min's friend?

353
00:26:47,474 --> 00:26:50,024
Gosh, you're Dong Min's friend...

354
00:26:51,374 --> 00:26:53,334
One second.

355
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:01,894
Take this. It's for being my grandson's friend.

356
00:27:01,894 --> 00:27:03,884
Go and get something delicious.

357
00:27:03,884 --> 00:27:05,264
Grandma!

358
00:27:05,264 --> 00:27:07,734
What's 2,000 won supposed to buy?

359
00:27:07,734 --> 00:27:09,324
You can't even get a snack with that.

360
00:27:09,324 --> 00:27:11,284
Oh, really?

361
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:16,044
What should I do?

362
00:27:16,044 --> 00:27:18,284
I don't have any more money...

363
00:27:18,284 --> 00:27:20,524
This is plenty, Grandma.

364
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,124
Thank you.

365
00:27:24,124 --> 00:27:26,034
I'll get going now.

366
00:27:27,294 --> 00:27:28,504
See you tomorrow.

367
00:27:28,504 --> 00:27:30,534
Bye now.

368
00:27:32,014 --> 00:27:33,684
Hae Seong.

369
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:42,164
Thank you for helping my grandma.

370
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,754
I got some exercise.

371
00:27:45,754 --> 00:27:47,894
It's not a big deal.

372
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:52,474
I actually overheard you and Ms. Oh

373
00:27:52,474 --> 00:27:55,234
talking this afternoon.

374
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:02,284
I should have told her you didn't take the ID.

375
00:28:02,284 --> 00:28:05,854
But I didn't because I didn't know what to do.

376
00:28:05,854 --> 00:28:07,854
I'm sorry.

377
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:10,314
It's okay. No need to be sorry.

378
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,224
It was Tae Su, right?

379
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,764
Yes.

380
00:28:16,764 --> 00:28:20,374
But I'm not going to worry about Tae Su anymore.

381
00:28:20,374 --> 00:28:24,404
I got the ID back anyway.

382
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,964
If you say so.

383
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,854
Get inside. Grandma must be waiting for you.

384
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:48,184
- Your phone. 
 - My phone?

385
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,404
Give me your phone now.

386
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,594
It's my number. Save it.

387
00:28:59,594 --> 00:29:01,824
Call me if anything happens.

388
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:06,754
Doing this between boys is so weird.

389
00:29:06,754 --> 00:29:08,364
I'm really leaving now.

390
00:29:18,964 --> 00:29:23,484
   

391
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:37,064
Tae Su did that to Dong Min?

392
00:29:37,064 --> 00:29:38,914
I should tell the vice principal, right?

393
00:29:38,914 --> 00:29:42,794
Good god, don't even! You think he'll listen to you?

394
00:29:42,794 --> 00:29:46,474
That moron who's trying to become principal with a connection?

395
00:29:46,474 --> 00:29:48,824
Then, what about Dong Min?

396
00:29:58,614 --> 00:30:00,844
Just act like you don't know.

397
00:30:00,844 --> 00:30:02,234
What?

398
00:30:03,274 --> 00:30:07,264
Tae Su's father is a third-term assemblyman and a PTA board member.

399
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:10,004
You know what our school is like, Ms. Oh.

400
00:30:10,004 --> 00:30:12,554
Who your parents are determines your level.

401
00:30:12,554 --> 00:30:14,794
They only care about people who matter.

402
00:30:14,794 --> 00:30:17,734
Maybe we can write to the Department of Education?

403
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:20,574
Don't be so naive.

404
00:30:20,574 --> 00:30:23,604
And who are you to take care of anyone?

405
00:30:23,604 --> 00:30:27,284
Ms. Oh, don't you want to be a full-time teacher?

406
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,754
Let's turn a blind eye this time.

407
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,164
Think carefully.

408
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,234
This really sucks.

409
00:31:27,354 --> 00:31:28,994
 This is Dong Min. 

410
00:31:28,994 --> 00:31:33,314
 Tae Su was the only number on my phone. 

411
00:31:33,314 --> 00:31:35,064
 Thanks. 

412
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,274
Welcome.

413
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,274
I touched it first.

414
00:31:59,274 --> 00:32:00,654
I was a little faster.

415
00:32:00,654 --> 00:32:02,224
You must live nearby.

416
00:32:02,224 --> 00:32:03,614
Yes. You must live nearby, too.

417
00:32:03,614 --> 00:32:06,054
I don't really feel like telling you.

418
00:32:06,054 --> 00:32:08,544
I don't really want to know.

419
00:32:08,544 --> 00:32:11,500
Are you talking back to me on purpose?

420
00:32:12,144 --> 00:32:14,654
Hey, Jeong Hae Seong. Get it together.

421
00:32:14,654 --> 00:32:17,934
You're a student, and I'm a teacher!

422
00:32:19,134 --> 00:32:22,644
â™«  Loving you, I love you  â™«

423
00:32:22,644 --> 00:32:26,334
â™«  Don't forget even for a moment  â™«

424
00:32:26,334 --> 00:32:33,474
â™«  You're the only one I love  â™«

425
00:32:33,474 --> 00:32:36,860
â™«  Loving you, loving you  â™«

426
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:40,074
You took your hand off, so it's mine.

427
00:32:41,094 --> 00:32:42,884
Damn it!

428
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:51,554
The owner gave me a freebie. Buy-one-get-one-free deal. Thanks.

429
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,314
You knew about Tae Su and Dong Min, didn't you?

430
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:05,594
Why didn't you tell me even though you knew?

431
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,434
Because I'm not trustworthy?

432
00:33:09,434 --> 00:33:11,904
Dong Min asked me not to.

433
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,914
I'm sorry for the misunderstanding about Grandma's ID.

434
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,344
And for not noticing sooner what was going on.

435
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,644
And?

436
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:41,074
Now that you know everything, what will you do next?

437
00:33:57,454 --> 00:33:58,744
What's this?

438
00:33:58,744 --> 00:34:01,124
It's from Dong Min's grandmother.

439
00:34:01,124 --> 00:34:03,574
She wanted me to be friends with Dong Min.

440
00:34:05,364 --> 00:34:06,994
I have no right to take this.

441
00:34:06,994 --> 00:34:09,284
Make yourself worthy of it.

442
00:34:53,034 --> 00:34:55,414
You're similar to him.

443
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:58,534
- Who? 
 - Someone.

444
00:34:58,534 --> 00:35:01,144
My arch-nemesis.

445
00:35:01,904 --> 00:35:04,294
What made him your arch-nemesis?

446
00:35:06,264 --> 00:35:08,144
Eat up.

447
00:35:08,744 --> 00:35:10,304
Sure.

448
00:35:12,634 --> 00:35:14,464
Who's there?

449
00:35:14,464 --> 00:35:16,444
This is Gangnam Police.

450
00:35:16,444 --> 00:35:18,614
This is Ms. Choi Bok Soon's house, right?

451
00:35:18,614 --> 00:35:19,864
What's the matter?

452
00:35:19,864 --> 00:35:22,594
Is Ms. Choi Bok Soon here?

453
00:35:22,594 --> 00:35:24,234
I'm Choi Bok Soon.

454
00:35:24,234 --> 00:35:25,574
You said you're the police?

455
00:35:25,574 --> 00:35:28,804
We found your name while investigating an illegal gambling site

456
00:35:28,804 --> 00:35:30,844
as the owner of the gambling website.

457
00:35:30,844 --> 00:35:32,134
Take her into custody.

458
00:35:32,134 --> 00:35:33,314
Wait a second!

459
00:35:33,314 --> 00:35:35,004
There must be a misunderstanding.

460
00:35:35,004 --> 00:35:36,624
Take her.

461
00:35:36,624 --> 00:35:38,354
Me, out of the blue?

462
00:35:38,354 --> 00:35:39,534
Dong Min! Dong Min!

463
00:35:39,534 --> 00:35:41,974
Grandma! Grandma!

464
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:45,284
Dong Min! Why are they doing this to me?

465
00:35:45,284 --> 00:35:48,904
- Grandma! 
 - Stop this and go inside.

466
00:35:50,694 --> 00:35:52,794
Grandma...

467
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:57,034
It's late. Where do you live?

468
00:35:57,034 --> 00:35:58,134
In the residential area over there.

469
00:35:58,134 --> 00:36:01,684
 You live near the school in a rooftop room. 

470
00:36:02,294 --> 00:36:03,844
Residential?

471
00:36:05,944 --> 00:36:07,504
Past that area, in a rooftop room.

472
00:36:07,504 --> 00:36:09,064
It's close.

473
00:36:12,944 --> 00:36:14,704
Hey, Dong Min.

474
00:36:20,014 --> 00:36:21,504
What?

475
00:36:26,694 --> 00:36:28,594
Dong Min, what's going on?

476
00:36:29,644 --> 00:36:31,734
Ms. Oh...

477
00:36:48,384 --> 00:36:50,664
This is why gambling is scary.

478
00:36:50,664 --> 00:36:53,584
Why do people think they can win?

479
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:55,954
   

480
00:36:55,954 --> 00:36:57,534
   

481
00:36:57,534 --> 00:36:59,154
Damn it!

482
00:37:08,664 --> 00:37:09,834
Hey, Hyung.

483
00:37:09,834 --> 00:37:13,124
Can you load me up with another 20 million won?

484
00:37:18,124 --> 00:37:21,324
Just a second, Ms. Oh. Over here.

485
00:37:21,324 --> 00:37:23,174
Just a moment.

486
00:37:25,334 --> 00:37:29,264
The owner of the gambling website? What in the world?

487
00:37:34,344 --> 00:37:36,464
Park Tae Su must be involved.

488
00:37:36,464 --> 00:37:38,604
His grandmother's ID.

489
00:37:40,664 --> 00:37:42,944
She might get arrested at this rate.

490
00:37:42,944 --> 00:37:44,264
No way.

491
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:46,764
The police must know she's not the one.

492
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,414
That's not what the evidence says.

493
00:37:51,474 --> 00:37:54,214
This is beyond school bullying.

494
00:37:54,214 --> 00:37:58,424
This is a serious crime, and someone better step up.

495
00:38:10,524 --> 00:38:11,894
Me?

496
00:38:13,274 --> 00:38:15,004
This is not it.

497
00:38:15,004 --> 00:38:16,684
What do I do?

498
00:38:16,684 --> 00:38:19,474
Gosh, this is not it. This isn't it!

499
00:38:19,474 --> 00:38:21,094
What do I do?

500
00:38:23,854 --> 00:38:25,814
I should go on sick leave.

501
00:38:27,034 --> 00:38:30,074
Sick leave. Let's do that. Sick leave...

502
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:34,404
Ms. Ri An said she had a positive COVID test.

503
00:38:49,124 --> 00:38:52,874
   

504
00:38:52,874 --> 00:38:54,184
Chairwoman.

505
00:38:54,184 --> 00:38:58,254
You should look at the school bulletin board now.

506
00:39:07,024 --> 00:39:08,054
   

507
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,804
That crazy bastard.

508
00:39:09,804 --> 00:39:12,244
At this important moment...

509
00:39:13,944 --> 00:39:15,514
Hello?

510
00:39:16,584 --> 00:39:18,044
What?

511
00:39:22,724 --> 00:39:25,034
Hey, hey, hey! The bulletin board is on fire!

512
00:39:25,034 --> 00:39:26,534
Someone told on Tae Su!

513
00:39:26,534 --> 00:39:28,444
Look. Come here.

514
00:39:28,444 --> 00:39:31,424
Look at the bulletin board...

515
00:39:31,424 --> 00:39:34,054
Wow, Tae Su is doomed. Daebak.

516
00:39:34,054 --> 00:39:35,604
Goodbye, Tae Su.

517
00:39:35,604 --> 00:39:37,854
- Look what they did. 
 - Good job.

518
00:39:37,854 --> 00:39:40,454
Honestly, I get it. Seriously.

519
00:39:40,454 --> 00:39:42,404
- He deserves it. Really. 
 - Seriously.

520
00:39:42,404 --> 00:39:45,744
This is what they call karma.

521
00:39:46,734 --> 00:39:48,474
Who did this?

522
00:39:48,474 --> 00:39:50,424
Who posted this on the school bulletin board?

523
00:39:50,424 --> 00:39:52,354
Wh-What is this?

524
00:39:52,354 --> 00:39:55,764
Tae Su bullied Dong Min?

525
00:39:55,764 --> 00:39:57,794
What? Illegal gambling?

526
00:39:57,794 --> 00:40:02,524
Are they set on ruining our school?

527
00:40:04,104 --> 00:40:05,684
Wait.

528
00:40:07,244 --> 00:40:08,994
Could it be...

529
00:40:09,894 --> 00:40:12,214
one of you teachers?

530
00:40:16,694 --> 00:40:18,354
Ms. Oh?

531
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:23,764
Did you write this by chance?

532
00:40:31,884 --> 00:40:33,734
Who did this?

533
00:40:33,734 --> 00:40:35,374
Exactly who did this?

534
00:40:35,374 --> 00:40:40,324
Who set out to ruin the reputation of our great Byeongmun High School like a traitor?

535
00:40:41,324 --> 00:40:42,994
- Is it you? 
 - Not me.

536
00:40:42,994 --> 00:40:44,474
- It must be you. 
 - It's not me.

537
00:40:44,474 --> 00:40:46,904
- It must be you, Vice Principal. 
 - I-It's not me.

538
00:40:46,904 --> 00:40:48,634
Ms. Oh, calm down.

539
00:40:48,634 --> 00:40:51,784
No, I won't let this slide.

540
00:40:51,784 --> 00:40:54,294
Your business is my business.

541
00:40:54,294 --> 00:40:56,794
School business is my business, too.

542
00:40:56,794 --> 00:40:59,934
Who dared to cross our vice principal?

543
00:40:59,934 --> 00:41:03,204
I shall uncover and remove this traitor,

544
00:41:03,204 --> 00:41:05,344
and bring you his head.

545
00:41:05,344 --> 00:41:06,884
That won't be necessary.

546
00:41:06,884 --> 00:41:08,344
Calm down. Come here.

547
00:41:08,344 --> 00:41:09,844
I just...

548
00:41:09,844 --> 00:41:12,484
Please come to your seat. This way.

549
00:41:13,384 --> 00:41:15,894
I'm only calming down for your sake.

550
00:41:15,894 --> 00:41:17,214
Thank you.

551
00:41:17,214 --> 00:41:22,294
Anyway, we'll be meeting with Tae Su's and Dong Min's parents tomorrow.

552
00:41:22,294 --> 00:41:23,764
The chairwoman will speak with them.

553
00:41:23,764 --> 00:41:28,474
So, calm down, and why don't you make the calls?

554
00:41:29,084 --> 00:41:30,354
Is that how it worked out?

555
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:31,954
That's how it worked out.

556
00:41:31,954 --> 00:41:33,784
I understand.

557
00:41:35,314 --> 00:41:37,434
- I'll sit down now. 
 - Take a seat.

558
00:41:39,904 --> 00:41:43,244
Just wait till we catch you. Whoever you are.

559
00:41:43,244 --> 00:41:46,484
All right. Go back to work.

560
00:41:51,194 --> 00:41:53,694
You wrote it, didn't you?

561
00:41:53,694 --> 00:41:55,274
You could tell?

562
00:41:55,274 --> 00:41:57,764
A little bit. About 51 percent?

563
00:41:57,764 --> 00:41:59,014
Fifty-one percent...

564
00:41:59,014 --> 00:42:01,434
What if you get caught?

565
00:42:02,124 --> 00:42:04,514
I don't know anymore.

566
00:42:04,514 --> 00:42:08,334
I'll deal with tomorrow's problem tomorrow.

567
00:42:08,334 --> 00:42:10,274
Get back to work. Go.

568
00:42:14,074 --> 00:42:16,064
The traitor's head!

569
00:42:17,094 --> 00:42:19,044
I shall get him!

570
00:42:26,114 --> 00:42:28,184
Oh Su Ah...

571
00:42:37,064 --> 00:42:38,584
Thank you.

572
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,734
What a messy situation.

573
00:42:42,734 --> 00:42:45,184
The chairwoman has never met with parents herself.

574
00:42:45,184 --> 00:42:48,544
I knew this would happen to Park Tae Su someday.

575
00:42:48,544 --> 00:42:51,844
He caused it, so he'll deal with it.

576
00:42:51,844 --> 00:42:53,564
What will you do with Jeong Hae Seong?

577
00:42:53,564 --> 00:42:55,144
Right, the cafeteria.

578
00:42:55,144 --> 00:42:59,204
Tae Su might be trash, but he's still in the Student Council.

579
00:42:59,204 --> 00:43:02,984
We can't let him get away with humiliating him like that in front of the kids.

580
00:43:02,984 --> 00:43:06,154
Why not? I was actually stoked about it.

581
00:43:06,154 --> 00:43:08,644
Are you jealous because he's handsome?

582
00:43:08,644 --> 00:43:11,034
Why worry about someone like him?

583
00:43:11,034 --> 00:43:14,334
He seemed crazy. Just ignore him...

584
00:43:17,874 --> 00:43:20,424
Let's wait and see.

585
00:43:20,424 --> 00:43:23,384
It's fun to have him around at school.

586
00:43:23,384 --> 00:43:25,934
I'm curious about him, too.

587
00:43:32,174 --> 00:43:34,544
So bitter. Syrup, please.

588
00:43:34,544 --> 00:43:36,524
Okay, just a moment.

589
00:43:49,034 --> 00:43:51,004
Sorry, Yu Jeong. We're leaving.

590
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:52,804
I forgot about our study session.

591
00:43:52,804 --> 00:43:55,364
Oh, sure...

592
00:43:55,364 --> 00:43:57,134
What about you, Yu Jeong?

593
00:43:57,894 --> 00:44:00,094
I'll go a little later.

594
00:44:00,094 --> 00:44:02,594
Okay, then. See you at school.

595
00:44:28,574 --> 00:44:30,374
Don't worry too much.

596
00:44:30,374 --> 00:44:32,224
It'll all be okay.

597
00:44:32,224 --> 00:44:33,884
You didn't do anything wrong, Grandma.

598
00:44:33,884 --> 00:44:37,174
You'll be out once we clear things up.

599
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,314
Have you had dinner?

600
00:44:39,314 --> 00:44:41,414
Of course.

601
00:44:41,414 --> 00:44:45,214
So, you make sure not to miss a meal, either.

602
00:44:45,214 --> 00:44:48,744
I'll get you out. Just be patient.

603
00:44:49,284 --> 00:44:51,304
You can do it, right?

604
00:45:57,370 --> 00:46:01,604
Young man, what are you doing there at this hour?

605
00:46:02,534 --> 00:46:04,934
You can't go in there.

606
00:46:06,004 --> 00:46:07,284
I'm sorry.

607
00:46:07,284 --> 00:46:09,724
- I leftâ€“ 
 - Hello.

608
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:12,694
Wow.

609
00:46:14,784 --> 00:46:16,524
We've never met.

610
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:18,704
I'm Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju.

611
00:46:19,364 --> 00:46:21,614
- I'm Jeong Hae Seong. 
 - I know.

612
00:46:21,614 --> 00:46:24,044
The principal told me.

613
00:46:24,044 --> 00:46:31,334
I heard you and Dong Min found the skeleton model, Hae Seong.

614
00:46:31,334 --> 00:46:32,804
Yes.

615
00:46:33,944 --> 00:46:36,614
You must be interested in school urban legends.

616
00:46:36,614 --> 00:46:38,634
Seeing that you broke school rules

617
00:46:38,634 --> 00:46:42,904
to enter the old building, and trespass this place...

618
00:46:43,754 --> 00:46:46,554
I'm sorry. I have a lot of curiosity.

619
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,024
You're curious?

620
00:46:48,024 --> 00:46:50,924
Wow, I love that.

621
00:46:50,924 --> 00:46:52,664
I just...

622
00:46:53,724 --> 00:47:00,734
Well, having curiosity is an amazing human trait.

623
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,704
You know what, though?

624
00:47:06,024 --> 00:47:10,134
Kids these days aren't curious.

625
00:47:14,484 --> 00:47:18,224
Well, this is nice.

626
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:23,564
If you need any help or want a counseling session,

627
00:47:23,564 --> 00:47:25,564
come to the chairwoman's office.

628
00:47:25,564 --> 00:47:28,014
I'm on the students' side.

629
00:47:29,494 --> 00:47:32,164
Thank you for your words. Okay, then.

630
00:48:18,174 --> 00:48:20,124
Dong Min.

631
00:48:35,934 --> 00:48:39,284
Thank you for coming. I know how busy you are.

632
00:48:40,664 --> 00:48:42,574
Dong Min.

633
00:48:43,174 --> 00:48:44,504
Where's your grandmother?

634
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:46,404
She's still under police investigation.

635
00:48:46,404 --> 00:48:49,354
I'm here as his guardian.

636
00:48:49,354 --> 00:48:54,854
We had to come all this way because of an anonymous shit post?

637
00:48:54,854 --> 00:48:57,284
Did you catch the one who posted it?

638
00:48:57,284 --> 00:48:58,644
We haven't looked into it.

639
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:01,864
We can clear up right now if it's a rumor or fact.

640
00:49:01,864 --> 00:49:03,814
But this isn't right.

641
00:49:03,814 --> 00:49:06,344
Tae Su's mother, please calm down.

642
00:49:06,344 --> 00:49:08,034
Let's listen to the kids.

643
00:49:08,034 --> 00:49:11,004
Yes, Honey. Hold on.

644
00:49:11,004 --> 00:49:13,744
I'm sure the chairwoman will take care of us.

645
00:49:13,744 --> 00:49:15,754
What's with you?

646
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,964
You're Lee Dong Min?

647
00:49:18,964 --> 00:49:21,574
I read the post on the bulletin board.

648
00:49:21,574 --> 00:49:23,764
Beatings, the ID incident...

649
00:49:23,764 --> 00:49:26,244
It was one false accusation after another.

650
00:49:26,244 --> 00:49:28,384
Why don't you tell us?

651
00:49:29,254 --> 00:49:32,434
Don't worry about us. Be honest.

652
00:49:32,434 --> 00:49:34,194
Yes.

653
00:49:34,194 --> 00:49:36,694
Dong Min, please speak up.

654
00:49:36,694 --> 00:49:38,764
I feel so wronged.

655
00:49:38,764 --> 00:49:40,714
We've been friendly this whole time.

656
00:49:40,714 --> 00:49:43,564
Where did that post come from?

657
00:49:44,894 --> 00:49:47,764
Please tell the truth.

658
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,894
Dong Min.

659
00:50:02,104 --> 00:50:04,694
The post on the bulletin board...

660
00:50:06,874 --> 00:50:08,734
is fake.

661
00:50:09,354 --> 00:50:10,974
Dong Min.

662
00:50:16,094 --> 00:50:17,964
Tae Su...

663
00:50:18,704 --> 00:50:21,204
never beat me.

664
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:27,404
The person who beat me was...

665
00:50:29,444 --> 00:50:31,704
Jeong Hae Seong.

666
00:50:50,444 --> 00:50:52,204
Dong Min.

667
00:50:53,584 --> 00:50:57,684
Why didn't you tell the truth earlier?

668
00:51:00,544 --> 00:51:03,684
Will you at least tell me?

669
00:51:03,684 --> 00:51:07,404
Why did you name Hae Seong earlier, out of the blue?

670
00:51:11,804 --> 00:51:13,604
 Don't you dare talk tomorrow. 

671
00:51:13,604 --> 00:51:16,064
 I'll rip your mouth open. 

672
00:51:19,464 --> 00:51:20,944
 Oh, one more thing. 

673
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:23,784
 Who's been your bully this whole time? 

674
00:51:23,784 --> 00:51:25,434
 It's Jeong Hae Seong. Okay? 

675
00:51:25,434 --> 00:51:28,114
 N-No, I can't do that. 

676
00:51:28,114 --> 00:51:29,424
 Oh, yeah? 

677
00:51:29,424 --> 00:51:30,754
 Well, that's too bad, then. 

678
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:34,854
 In that case, your grandma might die in jail. 

679
00:51:35,754 --> 00:51:39,990
I'm asking because I want to help you.

680
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,314
Dong Min?

681
00:51:44,154 --> 00:51:46,024
It's okay.

682
00:51:46,924 --> 00:51:49,864
You don't need to help me.

683
00:51:49,864 --> 00:51:52,064
Just stay back.

684
00:51:53,434 --> 00:51:57,944
Please don't do anything.

685
00:52:04,314 --> 00:52:06,324
I can't believe it's turning out this way.

686
00:52:06,324 --> 00:52:09,464
Tae Su screwed over Jeong Hae Seong, right?

687
00:52:09,464 --> 00:52:11,964
So what will happen to our Hae Seong?

688
00:52:11,964 --> 00:52:14,614
Is he going to get kicked out?

689
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:18,114
It was fun to come to school for once.

690
00:52:18,114 --> 00:52:21,384
He can't avoid suspension for sure, right?

691
00:52:21,384 --> 00:52:22,974
Yeah, based on the current state of things.

692
00:52:22,974 --> 00:52:25,634
But it's Mom's call.

693
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:34,220
Why are you staring at Hae Seong's seat like that?

694
00:52:34,914 --> 00:52:36,764
It's nothing.

695
00:53:17,154 --> 00:53:19,344
Goodbye.

696
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:34,474
Why did you do that?

697
00:53:35,134 --> 00:53:36,514
Sorry.

698
00:53:36,514 --> 00:53:38,434
I'll get going.

699
00:53:39,494 --> 00:53:41,544
Were you blackmailed?

700
00:53:51,624 --> 00:53:53,594
Yes.

701
00:53:53,594 --> 00:53:56,004
I was blackmailed.

702
00:53:56,004 --> 00:53:59,634
He said he'd keep my grandma

703
00:53:59,634 --> 00:54:02,914
locked up forever if I didn't frame you.

704
00:54:02,914 --> 00:54:05,720
What was I supposed to do in that situation?

705
00:54:06,384 --> 00:54:11,614
I can't fight, I'm not a good student, and I'm a loser and an idiot.

706
00:54:12,424 --> 00:54:14,884
What am I supposed to do?

707
00:54:15,784 --> 00:54:18,404
You think I didn't think about it?

708
00:54:19,354 --> 00:54:23,754
"Should I call the police, talk to the teacher, or...

709
00:54:25,184 --> 00:54:29,780
just stab him to death?"

710
00:54:30,374 --> 00:54:33,944
I imagined killing that jerk numerous times a day.

711
00:54:34,524 --> 00:54:39,814
Being in jail sounded better than being in school.

712
00:54:41,374 --> 00:54:46,644
But if that happens to me, what about my grandma?

713
00:54:51,864 --> 00:54:54,674
You know what makes me most angry?

714
00:54:55,574 --> 00:54:58,354
That real life isn't a fairytale.

715
00:54:59,454 --> 00:55:04,994
Because of my trauma from that jerk, I'll forever live as a bottom-of-the-barrel loser.

716
00:55:04,994 --> 00:55:09,454
But he'll forget that he even bullied me and live happily.

717
00:55:11,724 --> 00:55:14,434
Life is unfair.

718
00:55:15,414 --> 00:55:16,984
I hope you get through this.

719
00:55:16,984 --> 00:55:21,494
Don't you dare say that when you haven't been through it.

720
00:55:22,684 --> 00:55:27,794
You have no idea how I feel.

721
00:55:29,404 --> 00:55:31,454
That might be true.

722
00:55:31,454 --> 00:55:33,494
I'm leaving now that I know.

723
00:55:37,764 --> 00:55:39,554
Jeong Hae Seong.

724
00:55:42,624 --> 00:55:45,544
Why aren't you yelling at me?

725
00:55:45,544 --> 00:55:48,034
Because it's not your fault.

726
00:55:48,034 --> 00:55:50,114
All of it. Whatever it may be.

727
00:56:07,104 --> 00:56:09,644
The kid I mentioned the other day.

728
00:56:09,644 --> 00:56:13,024
Do a full background check on him.

729
00:56:16,594 --> 00:56:20,044
   

730
00:56:21,664 --> 00:56:24,974
What? Jeong Hae Song?

731
00:56:24,974 --> 00:56:28,494
- What is this? 
 - I can't believe it.

732
00:56:28,494 --> 00:56:30,604
The transfer student?

733
00:56:30,604 --> 00:56:32,164
   

734
00:56:32,164 --> 00:56:34,014
   

735
00:56:36,594 --> 00:56:37,934
- Ku Sang Tae? 
  - Yes. 

736
00:56:37,934 --> 00:56:41,974
He runs an illegal gambling site using stolen IDs.

737
00:56:41,974 --> 00:56:45,624
This is the main red flag in Park Tae Su's file.

738
00:56:45,624 --> 00:56:48,764
An alleged owner has recently been arrested.

739
00:56:48,764 --> 00:56:50,744
Her name is Choi Bok Soon.

740
00:56:50,744 --> 00:56:53,604
 There's a student named Lee Dong Min at your school. 

741
00:56:53,604 --> 00:56:56,254
It's his grandmother.

742
00:56:56,254 --> 00:56:59,544
 Do you want me to send you info on Ku Sang Tae now? 

743
00:56:59,544 --> 00:57:01,134
Right away.

744
00:57:12,344 --> 00:57:14,354
Hello? Where are you?

745
00:57:17,104 --> 00:57:20,264
- Has it started? 
 - You talk like it's someone else's business...

746
00:57:20,264 --> 00:57:21,834
Get here right now!

747
00:57:21,834 --> 00:57:23,824
Ms. Oh, Jeong Hae Seong isn't here yet?

748
00:57:23,824 --> 00:57:24,994
Yes, he's on his way.

749
00:57:24,994 --> 00:57:27,364
Gosh, seriously.

750
00:57:27,364 --> 00:57:30,124
You heard, right? I'll give you ten seconds. Get your butt here now.

751
00:57:30,124 --> 00:57:32,214
Buy me some time. I'll be late.

752
00:57:32,214 --> 00:57:34,324
How can you say such nonsense without flinching?

753
00:57:34,324 --> 00:57:36,714
You'll get expelled if you don't show up now.

754
00:57:36,714 --> 00:57:38,654
I'm counting on you.

755
00:57:41,574 --> 00:57:45,354
Gosh, really! I'm going crazy here!

756
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,050
   

757
00:58:11,864 --> 00:58:13,784
   

758
00:58:22,144 --> 00:58:26,644
I'm sorry. We have been waiting for a while.

759
00:58:26,644 --> 00:58:29,454
Ms. Oh Su Ah?

760
00:58:29,454 --> 00:58:31,274
Yes, that's...

761
00:58:32,854 --> 00:58:34,854
Hae Seong says he's on his way.

762
00:58:34,854 --> 00:58:37,794
We can't wait forever. Let's begin.

763
00:58:37,794 --> 00:58:42,114
Well, we can't start without the student, Mr. Park.

764
00:58:42,114 --> 00:58:45,994
He's probably not showing up because he's guilty.

765
00:58:45,994 --> 00:58:52,794
In that case, why don't we call in my Tae Su and that poor kid, and hear their stories?

766
00:58:52,794 --> 00:58:55,014
Let's move forward that way.

767
00:58:55,014 --> 00:58:59,034
Chairwoman, I have an assembly meeting to attend.

768
00:59:03,744 --> 00:59:05,654
Ms. Oh Su Ah.

769
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:11,154
Bring in those two students, Park Tae Su and Lee Dong Min.

770
00:59:11,954 --> 00:59:13,394
Okay.

771
00:59:16,994 --> 00:59:19,354
   

772
00:59:21,074 --> 00:59:23,604
Ten minutes or so...

773
00:59:44,364 --> 00:59:48,334
Yeong Hun, there's a saying that fits you right now.

774
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:52,734
"You know your own sins."

775
00:59:55,244 --> 00:59:57,674
Where's Hae Seong?

776
00:59:58,374 --> 01:00:00,804
Dong Min is telling the truth.

777
01:00:00,804 --> 01:00:05,144
Hae Seong beat me up for no reason in the cafeteria, too.

778
01:00:06,374 --> 01:00:10,194
Thank you, Dong Min, for your courage.

779
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:15,314
Lee Dong Min, let me ask you one last time.

780
01:00:15,314 --> 01:00:21,234
What you just shared about Jeong Hae Seong is entirely true, correct?

781
01:00:26,744 --> 01:00:32,684
Lee Dong Min, your earlier testimony is truthful. Correct?

782
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,304
Yes, it's all...

783
01:00:40,844 --> 01:00:43,484
Hae Seong's doing.

784
01:00:47,064 --> 01:00:49,084
Let's wrap up...

785
01:00:49,744 --> 01:00:51,394
Chairwoman.

786
01:00:51,394 --> 01:00:54,064
Yes. Let's do that.

787
01:00:54,064 --> 01:00:59,494
Regarding the school violence incident, the committee has determined the punishment

788
01:00:59,494 --> 01:01:03,194
for Jeong Hae Seong will be expelled...

789
01:01:03,194 --> 01:01:04,904
Wait!

790
01:01:04,904 --> 01:01:06,534
What?

791
01:01:08,374 --> 01:01:11,174
Do you have something to say?

792
01:01:11,174 --> 01:01:13,094
It's just that...

793
01:01:14,954 --> 01:01:18,044
Everything goes better on a full stomach.

794
01:01:18,044 --> 01:01:19,814
Yes.

795
01:01:19,814 --> 01:01:24,254
Well, what I meant by that is... so...

796
01:01:25,054 --> 01:01:26,984
Today's lunch is pork cutlets.

797
01:01:26,984 --> 01:01:29,124
I'm a huge fan of pork cutlets.

798
01:01:29,124 --> 01:01:30,634
Koreans run on rice power.

799
01:01:30,634 --> 01:01:32,734
It's time for lunch.

800
01:01:32,734 --> 01:01:34,014
Hae Seong will be here soon.

801
01:01:34,014 --> 01:01:35,894
Ms. Oh, sit down. What are you doing?

802
01:01:35,894 --> 01:01:38,104
Why are you bringing up lunch? Cut the nonsense. Sit down.

803
01:01:38,104 --> 01:01:40,314
P-Pork cutlets...

804
01:01:40,314 --> 01:01:41,620
I apologize.

805
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:46,580
Then... regarding the school violence incident, the committee has determined the punishment

806
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:50,574
for Jeong Hae Seong will be expelled...

807
01:01:51,584 --> 01:01:53,184
What is it now?

808
01:01:53,184 --> 01:01:54,884
Someone came to school on a motorcycle!

809
01:01:54,884 --> 01:01:56,734
A motorcycle? That's crazy.

810
01:01:56,734 --> 01:01:58,334
 Who's crazy? Who? 

811
01:01:58,334 --> 01:01:59,874
 Everyone. 

812
01:01:59,874 --> 01:02:01,434
 Sit down. 

813
01:02:01,434 --> 01:02:03,174
 Let me see. 

814
01:02:03,174 --> 01:02:05,514
 Sit down! 

815
01:02:16,424 --> 01:02:18,774
 Who's that? What is it? 

816
01:02:18,774 --> 01:02:20,154
Who's that?

817
01:02:20,154 --> 01:02:23,284
I have no idea who it is, but he's so cool.

818
01:02:24,524 --> 01:02:26,894
 Isn't that Jeong Hae Seong? 

819
01:02:26,894 --> 01:02:29,230
 Hae Seong! 

820
01:02:29,834 --> 01:02:32,284
 What's going on? 

821
01:02:33,734 --> 01:02:35,324
 Jeong Hae Seong! 

822
01:02:35,324 --> 01:02:37,024
 It's Hae Seong! 

823
01:02:38,344 --> 01:02:40,884
That crazy bastard.

824
01:02:40,884 --> 01:02:43,474
Move! What is it?

825
01:02:46,964 --> 01:02:48,774
A motorcycle...

826
01:02:49,324 --> 01:02:51,744
He's here. Jeong Hae Seong.

827
01:02:51,744 --> 01:02:53,734
It's Jeong Hae Seong.

828
01:02:55,904 --> 01:02:58,294
 So cool! 

829
01:02:58,294 --> 01:02:59,664
Huh?

830
01:03:01,874 --> 01:03:03,184
That crazy bastard...

831
01:03:03,184 --> 01:03:05,314
 Come rescue me! 

832
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:06,514
 Hae Seong! 

833
01:03:06,514 --> 01:03:09,474
Wow, our school is doing great.

834
01:03:09,474 --> 01:03:11,674
 Hey, look at that! 

835
01:03:15,304 --> 01:03:17,514
 Jeong Hae Seong! 

836
01:03:28,904 --> 01:03:30,104
That crazy...

837
01:03:30,104 --> 01:03:32,694
I'm sorry I'm late.

838
01:03:41,324 --> 01:03:44,360
Okay. Shall we begin?

839
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:58,774
   

840
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:03,204
I'm sorry.

841
01:04:04,884 --> 01:04:06,894
I'm so sorry.

842
01:04:08,054 --> 01:04:09,464
Please forgive him just this once...

843
01:04:09,464 --> 01:04:11,824
How can you say that after seeing his face?

844
01:04:11,824 --> 01:04:14,434
This is why orphans are no good.

845
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:18,894
My son said you're his guardian or whatever.

846
01:04:18,894 --> 01:04:21,644
I raised him wrong.

847
01:04:21,644 --> 01:04:24,174
Please have it in your heart to forgive him.

848
01:04:24,174 --> 01:04:26,554
No, we won't let this slide.

849
01:04:26,554 --> 01:04:29,714
Shi Hyeon, apologize.

850
01:04:29,714 --> 01:04:31,584
Why should I?

851
01:04:31,584 --> 01:04:36,534
- Jeong Shi Hyeon. 
 - These bastards mocked me and bullied me for being an orphan.

852
01:04:36,534 --> 01:04:40,204
- Why should I apologize? 
 - Look! Look at him talk.

853
01:04:40,204 --> 01:04:42,814
It's so clear he wasn't raised well.

854
01:04:42,814 --> 01:04:45,484
Sir, please expel this punk immediately.

855
01:04:45,484 --> 01:04:47,484
I'm dropping out.

856
01:04:49,554 --> 01:04:50,534
Hey...

857
01:04:50,534 --> 01:04:53,264
Hey, come back here!

858
01:05:08,264 --> 01:05:10,744
Are you really dropping out of school?

859
01:05:13,414 --> 01:05:16,254
Are you really quitting, man?

860
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:29,970
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Undercover Love Team ðŸ’– @Viki.com 

861
01:05:35,594 --> 01:05:38,524
Quit if you want.

862
01:05:38,524 --> 01:05:42,434
You can get your degree some other way.

863
01:05:42,434 --> 01:05:46,864
Study at home... and take the GED.

864
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:57,034
Is that okay?

865
01:06:01,084 --> 01:06:03,444
What's wrong with that?

866
01:06:03,444 --> 01:06:05,444
I'm on your side.

867
01:06:10,544 --> 01:06:12,274
And...

868
01:06:14,164 --> 01:06:15,864
I'm sorry.

869
01:06:17,054 --> 01:06:20,434
I wanted to fill in for your dad somehow,

870
01:06:21,854 --> 01:06:23,974
but it's not so easy.

871
01:06:28,354 --> 01:06:30,684
You're doing more than enough.

872
01:06:35,044 --> 01:06:37,224
And I'm always grateful.

873
01:06:46,114 --> 01:06:49,854
Hey, I'm hungry. Let's eat some ramen.

874
01:06:57,564 --> 01:06:59,320
Let's go.

875
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:10,700
   

876
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:17,424
â™«  It's chasing after me without stopping  â™«

877
01:07:17,424 --> 01:07:20,574
â™«  There is nowhere to hide  â™«

878
01:07:20,574 --> 01:07:24,034
â™«  It's getting hot  â™«

879
01:07:24,034 --> 01:07:27,914
â™«  Spectacularly, dramatically  â™«

880
01:07:27,914 --> 01:07:29,814
â™«  Is it a hopeless battle?  â™«

881
01:07:29,814 --> 01:07:31,904
â™«  Is it war without an enemy?  â™«

882
01:07:31,904 --> 01:07:37,254
 If you're asking me if I bullied Dong Min, I'll say no. 

883
01:07:37,254 --> 01:07:38,904
 I've never done that. 

884
01:07:38,904 --> 01:07:41,674
 My heart is beating fast. 

885
01:07:41,674 --> 01:07:43,034
 I'll be careful. 

886
01:07:43,034 --> 01:07:46,694
 No one knows the last school urban legend. 

887
01:07:46,694 --> 01:07:49,854
 A twin grandfather clock? There were two from the get-go. 

888
01:07:49,854 --> 01:07:51,594
 A Student Council member? 

889
01:07:51,594 --> 01:07:54,284
 Don't come. I'll tell everyone who you are. 

890
01:07:54,284 --> 01:07:57,814
 He's an unpredictable one.  

891
01:07:57,814 --> 01:07:58,954
 Watch him closely. 

892
01:07:58,954 --> 01:08:00,904
 Sunbae, we have a problem. 

893
01:08:00,904 --> 01:08:02,394
 What? 

894
01:08:02,394 --> 01:08:05,484
â™«  What you gonna do? â™«

895
01:08:05,484 --> 01:08:07,734
â™«  Hey, yo! â™«
