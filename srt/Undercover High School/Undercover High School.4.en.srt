(All places, organizations, characters,)

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,840
(incidents, and backstories in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:16,850
(Episode 4)

4
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,980
My goodness!

5
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,819
Who are you?

6
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,489
A high-school student.

7
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,870
Raise a hand if you're Gu Sang Tae.

8
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,280
Are you Gu Sang Tae?

9
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,379
Well...

10
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,180
That is me, but...

11
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,949
why is a teen looking for me?

12
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,189
Do you want a job?

13
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,560
You know Park Tae Soo, right?

14
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:06,860
Bring me everything on him.

15
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,060
Where are your manners?

16
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,758
Hey. How old are you?

17
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,159
Leave it.

18
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,469
Kids these days learn manners from fantasy novels.

19
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:18,699
Teach him a lesson and send him off.

20
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,469
- Yes, boss. - Okay.

21
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:22,740
You're dead meat.

22
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:24,379
Let's warm up.

23
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,789
- Let's go. - Who is this freak?

24
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:18,460
Hae Seong!

25
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:29,439
Hae Seong!

26
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,389
How did you know I was here?

27
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,560
Darn you.

28
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,959
He filled us in on the way.

29
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,769
There's no time. Get the files.

30
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:58,970
Got it.

31
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,810
And you.

32
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:05,110
Why didn't you tell us you could be disciplined for bullying?

33
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,350
I'd never have known if he hadn't told me.

34
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:10,980
Sorry.

35
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:14,420
I get you don't want to be a nuisance to others...

36
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,920
but learn to lean on us.

37
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,519
Share the load and rely on others.

38
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,160
We're a team!

39
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:22,689
Yes.

40
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,600
You're cool and all, but strangely, you're shy.

41
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,899
Shut your mouth.

42
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,430
I got it.

43
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,810
We'll clean this place up. You get going.

44
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:38,240
And...

45
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,579
you might need a witness.

46
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:43,110
Take this guy with you.

47
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,079
Okay.

48
00:04:57,629 --> 00:04:58,629
Stop!

49
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:29,759
Jeong Hae Seong!

50
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,759
Hae Seong!

51
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,398
Hae Seong! You look awesome!

52
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,500
Look over here!

53
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,399
Will you give me a ride?

54
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,699
Hae Seong!

55
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,870
Look at him.

56
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,680
I'm sorry I'm late.

57
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:01,019
Shall we begin?

58
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:02,689
Jeong Hae Seong.

59
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,230
What are you doing?

60
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:05,660
Not only are you late,

61
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,629
but you also brought a stranger to the session?

62
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:09,029
Who's he?

63
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,829
He's an important witness to this incident.

64
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,540
It took me a while to persuade him.

65
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,139
What do you mean by that? A witness?

66
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,410
Just a moment.

67
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:23,680
Now's the time for you to tell the truth.

68
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,019
Or you'll get beaten to death like before.

69
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,189
The actual operator of the illegal gambling site,

70
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,620
Mr. Gu Sang Tae.

71
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:36,329
- Yes. - Do you know someone present?

72
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:39,100
Yes, I do.

73
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Him.

74
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:50,970
What are you trying to pull?

75
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:54,579
Mister. Do you know me?

76
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,579
How do you know each other?

77
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,019
You punk.

78
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,420
He's a VIP member of my site.

79
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,029
He owes me a great deal of money.

80
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:11,759
In return for reducing the debt,

81
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:13,329
he brought new members...

82
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,269
and ID cards I could use.

83
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:18,600
The police arrested an old woman.

84
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,240
Blame him for that.

85
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:25,539
Father.

86
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,209
He's lying. Believe me.

87
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:29,550
Keep quiet.

88
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:33,779
So what does the man you brought here saying...

89
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:36,189
have anything to do with this session?

90
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:37,860
You seem to be mistaken.

91
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,620
We're not here about my son.

92
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,959
If you're asking if I was violent against Dong Min...

93
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
No.

94
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,399
I didn't do that.

95
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:52,500
Then who bullied Dong Min?

96
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,379
You all know the truth.

97
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:09,419
He threatened the students to register on the gambling site.

98
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,960
He stole their family members' IDs to carry out crimes.

99
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:15,429
Just because they're weaker.

100
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,429
Just because he thinks he can.

101
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,899
He beat up a student,

102
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,830
stomped on him,

103
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,470
spit in his food,

104
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,340
and locked him in a trash collector.

105
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:31,379
You punk.

106
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,120
I don't believe this.

107
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:43,549
Dong Min. You tell them.

108
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:50,029
Come on. Say something.

109
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,730
He bullied you, not me.

110
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,399
Dong Min.

111
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:00,099
In a session like this, the victim's statement...

112
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,840
is like court evidence.

113
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,309
So I need you to think carefully before you speak.

114
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,350
About what you said earlier.

115
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,779
Do you have anything to add?

116
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,090
Very well.

117
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:22,659
Vice-principal Baek.

118
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,529
Regarding the school bullying issue,

119
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,399
this school will discipline Jeong Hae Seong...

120
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,369
by expelling him for his actions that brought shame...

121
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,370
No.

122
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,340
It wasn't Hae Seong.

123
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,320
Tae Soo made me do it.

124
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,990
Everything Tae Soo did to me.

125
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:51,590
He told me to frame Hae Seong.

126
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,558
He used my grandma to threaten me.

127
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:55,590
Hey.

128
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,289
Shut your mouth.

129
00:09:58,259 --> 00:09:59,299
Dong Min.

130
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,629
Can you be responsible for what you said?

131
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,269
Can you?

132
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,799
Can you be responsible?

133
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,500
Nothing you say...

134
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,340
will change the truth.

135
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,610
Even if others say I'm insisting without proof,

136
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,480
I'll speak up until the end.

137
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,220
Dong Min.

138
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,628
Thank you.

139
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:31,759
You did enough.

140
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,769
I'm so sorry.

141
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:38,240
Don't cry, punk. You look ugly.

142
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,539
You were cool just now.

143
00:10:42,669 --> 00:10:43,909
I'll take it from here.

144
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:48,750
Here's the evidence on Park Tae Soo that backs up...

145
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,279
what Gu Sang Tae said.

146
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,590
- Open the files. - Where'd you get this?

147
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,860
Don't ask, just do it. Everyone's waiting.

148
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:11,669
- Can I go now? - Stay here.

149
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,940
Yes, sir.

150
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,840
(USB flash drive)

151
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,480
(Files)

152
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,259
Here.

153
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,289
Darn it.

154
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,159
(Identity Card)

155
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:43,830
(Baek Kwang Du)

156
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,169
Evidence, a witness, a victim's statement...

157
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,739
This is enough to land you in a police station,

158
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,440
not an anti-bullying committee session.

159
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:56,980
Turn it off.

160
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,120
Turn it off, punk.

161
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:01,649
Congratulations, Tae Soo.

162
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,148
You're done for.

163
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:05,559
Turn it off, you son of a gun!

164
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:13,159
You punched me first.

165
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:16,529
Tae Soo!

166
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,070
You lunatic.

167
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,840
You dare punch my son?

168
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,240
He's my student!

169
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:24,139
Who do you think you are?

170
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,679
Honey!

171
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,649
Honey.

172
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,350
Tae Soo.

173
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:38,258
Mr. Park.

174
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,489
(Seo Myeong Ju)

175
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,490
Oh, dear.

176
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:45,000
Are you all right?

177
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,459
Shall I call an ambulance?

178
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,969
Or your aide if you're embarrassed?

179
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,070
- Darn it. - I don't have your aide's number.

180
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,399
What can I do to help you?

181
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,440
- Well done. - Thank you.

182
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:16,990
- Hae Seong. - What?

183
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:18,700
Sorry for everything.

184
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,870
I should've been honest from the start.

185
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,539
You had your reasons.

186
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,470
Buy me a pastry.

187
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,179
Why are you nice to me?

188
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:37,679
I'd always wanted to know.

189
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:41,320
Everyone else acts like I'm invisible.

190
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,820
You don't.

191
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,960
Because you're like someone I know?

192
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,629
It's a shame you hurt your back.

193
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,070
I have no choice but to say...

194
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,210
we must expel your son.

195
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:03,809
Chairwoman.

196
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,440
He's involved in a criminal case.

197
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,378
That's beyond anything I can accept,

198
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:11,179
and Tae Soo presents too big of a risk...

199
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:13,879
for our school to take on.

200
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,750
You took him in to reap the benefits,

201
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,889
and now you'll discard him?

202
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:22,460
Chairwoman. You can't do that.

203
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:24,830
Have you forgotten...

204
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:26,960
who helped you get Edu-City green-lit?

205
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:30,570
You still owe hundreds of millions of dollars.

206
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:32,769
One wrong rumour...

207
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,169
could ruin your lifelong dream...

208
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,210
right before your eyes.

209
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,509
Let's do what's good for us both.

210
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,110
If you get the message,

211
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,149
you'll let my son stay.

212
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:49,220
This is the problem with politicians.

213
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,048
- What? - They forget...

214
00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:54,159
how they got there and who got them there.

215
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,889
They completely forget how it started.

216
00:14:57,289 --> 00:14:58,929
Why you crazy...

217
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:09,269
Be gentle.

218
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,409
Gently, please.

219
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:17,149
You're such a baby.

220
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:21,379
Tae Soo was expelled.

221
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,320
That's good to hear.

222
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,220
Not even an assemblyman could shield him.

223
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,859
Even if you mean well,

224
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,029
you can't go around beating people up.

225
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,700
It's a warning instead of a penalty.

226
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,730
I'll be careful.

227
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:03,059
We're done.

228
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:07,200
Take this and put it on regularly.

229
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,970
- Thank you. - For what?

230
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,440
For posting online.

231
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,039
I can say for sure that...

232
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:23,250
not anyone could've done that.

233
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,049
I'm proud of you.

234
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:29,220
That wasn't me.

235
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,990
It was...

236
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,590
someone who was really awesome.

237
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,289
How dare you say...

238
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,759
you're proud of your teacher? That's too arrogant...

239
00:17:01,549 --> 00:17:02,890
This was on your head.

240
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,000
Where are you going?

242
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:34,950
first chairman.

243
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,759
We should speed things up.

244
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:24,369
The girl who always came second...

245
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,739
to her friend.

(Ranked 2nd)

248
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,179
Eun Ok came first.

249
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,609
- What? - Let's see.

250
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,548
- Eun Ok! - Oh, my.

251
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,450
- Congratulations. - You did so well!

252
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:40,379
- Good for you. - I know you studied hard.

253
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,118
- Look at this! - She came first!

254
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:45,660
Blinded by jealousy over her friend,

255
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,089
she did something she should have never done.

256
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,079
She fell, hit the ground with her head, and died.

257
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:16,849
Seeing her friend's body lying on the ground, she thought,

258
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,460
"Now,"

259
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:25,700
"I can come first."

(Byeongmun High School)

261
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,099
The girl who killed her friend...

262
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:37,230
was found dead.

263
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,069
After that, rumours started to spread.

264
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:42,839
"You should never be at school..."

265
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,410
"when the clock bell chimes."

266
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,880
"Crimson eyes will come for you."

267
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:53,420
And there are two more stories like this?

268
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,049
Like I said, there are four in total.

269
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,650
Do you know what's really spooky?

270
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,160
No one knows the fourth story.

271
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:03,190
- You don't know either? - No.

272
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:06,329
Even though I've been reading books and scouring the Internet.

273
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:10,430
I'm still researching but haven't found a single clue yet.

274
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,240
Anyway, Hae Seong.

275
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:20,179
Why are these people here?

276
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,240
What?

277
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,119
Goodness!

278
00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:30,089
What are you doing here?

279
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,559
- This place is so scary. - I'm really scared.

280
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,859
Hey, turn on the lights.

281
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:38,799
My goodness.

282
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,700
Oh, well...

283
00:21:42,829 --> 00:21:44,129
Do you know these people?

284
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,699
Oh, I guess I didn't tell you.

285
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,970
I work here part-time.

286
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:48,500
I see.

287
00:21:54,339 --> 00:21:55,710
All right.

288
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,589
You punk. You should study hard.

289
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:14,630
You, Hae Seong's friend. What's your name?

290
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,430
- I'm Lee Dong Min. - I see.

291
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:20,169
Come by often. You can come alone.

292
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,640
I'll give you many freebies.

293
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:25,039
You must be hungry. Dig in. Eat up.

294
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:26,839
Thanks for this.

295
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,779
It just came out of the oven. Eat it while it's still warm.

296
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:37,690
- It's so good. - Is it?

297
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:48,299
What is this? Why is this so tasty?

298
00:22:52,029 --> 00:22:53,069
Here.

299
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,539
It must've given your grandma such a scare.

300
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:56,970
Go and take good care of her.

301
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,240
Thanks.

302
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,879
It sure is nice to have a friend.

303
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,509
Come on. Don't make me cringe.

304
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,578
And you won't call me once after we graduate.

305
00:23:06,579 --> 00:23:07,979
I'll definitely stay in touch with you.

306
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,919
Sure, whatever.

307
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,990
We'll see about that.

308
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,390
I'm off.

311
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,919
Hey, if you just want to stare at the wall, do it somewhere else.

312
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,619
I'm losing my appetite because of you.

313
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,720
What is it? Did something happen?

314
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:50,390
No, it's nothing.

315
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:55,200
I just feel like...

316
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,299
my heart is...

317
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,470
skipping.

318
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,369
Does it feel different from when it's fluttering?

319
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,640
Yes, it's different.

320
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,079
It's kind of like...

321
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,049
You don't need to know.

322
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,720
I'm sorry, Yu Jeong. You must be exhausted.

323
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,119
No. I got to see many things, thanks to you. It was fun.

324
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,389
I only bought things for myself, didn't I?

325
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,459
How come you didn't get anything? You should've bought something.

326
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,160
I didn't really see anything I needed. It's all good.

You're right.

331
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:39,910
You always come first anyway.

332
00:24:40,109 --> 00:24:41,140
Congratulations, in advance.

333
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:43,549

335
00:24:45,579 --> 00:24:48,150
No way. Me? Beat you?

336
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:49,719
How?

337
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
You don't think so?

Are you interested in Hae Seong?

343
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,599
If I must tell you, yes. I'm very interested.

344
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:12,578
Gosh, I'm tired from all the walking.

345
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:13,940
- I'll get going, then. - Okay.

346
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:17,009
- See you at school. - Yes.

As you all know,

351
00:25:57,849 --> 00:26:00,420

00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:01,890
So, the higher-ups want...

353
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:04,190
to appoint an advising teacher for the student council.

354
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,559
Is anyone interested in the position?

355
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:07,659
It sounds like an honorary title,

356
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,400
but who wants to be ordered around by those students?

357
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:12,299
They're the ones who call the shots. No teacher can mess with them.

Hey, teachers. Are you all going to stay quiet?

359
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:18,539
The meeting won't end until we pick someone for the position.

360
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,819
All right.

361
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:31,049

This is why I'm so fond of you, Ms. Oh.

Pardon?

This can't be. My brain got me into the NIS.

554
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,639
I get it, so that's enough.

555
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,050
You were good in school which means you'll catch up easily.

556
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,550
Focus.

557
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,489
- Okay? - Got it.

558
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,650
Good.

559
00:38:16,829 --> 00:38:18,289
Unbelievable.

560
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,670
Tell me about it.

561
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,538
Here it is.

562
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:30,710
("Why Am I Like This?")

563
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,110
Why am I like this?

564
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:44,750
I see you're focused.

565
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:49,219
- I'll take this. - Sure.

566
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,860
Here you go.

567
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,710
Are you ready for this?

568
00:39:10,579 --> 00:39:11,610
Let us begin.

569
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,118
- No way. - Come on.

570
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,428
- There's a cheese option. - That looks so good!

571
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:25,328
- Come on. - Get one too.

572
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:27,129
(Korean History)

573
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,300
What's that?

574
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:32,669
- Hurry. - Check this out.

575
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,539
- What's that? - No way.

576
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,009
If you vote for Jeong Hae Seong,

577
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,808
you get a free sandwich.

578
00:39:39,809 --> 00:39:42,579
Jeong Hae Seong for student council!

579
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,809
The pride of Byeongmun

580
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:46,750
Jeong Hae Seong of Byeongmun High

581
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:50,320
He will do whatever it takes for the students

582
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,289
Working for the students

583
00:39:52,489 --> 00:39:54,090
A hero of justice

584
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,789
Jeong Hae Seong for student council

585
00:39:58,059 --> 00:39:59,730
The hero of Byeongmun

586
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,960
(Hope)

587
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,130
He was born to serve Byeongmun

588
00:40:05,699 --> 00:40:07,340
Our very own Jeong Hae Seong

589
00:40:07,469 --> 00:40:08,500
What the...

590
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,138
Seriously?

591
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:11,969
Jeong Hae Seong for student council

592
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,480
Are they trying to embarrass me to death?

593
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,880
- Come here. - Why?

594
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,109
Let go!

595
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,610
Working for the students

596
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,280
The hero of Byeongmun

597
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,190
The hope of Byeongmun

598
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,260
Sign for Jeong Hae Seong

599
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:31,829
Jeong Hae Seong for student council

600
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,198
- Jeong Hae Seong! - Jeong Hae Seong!

601
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:36,099
- Jeong Hae Seong! - Jeong Hae Seong!

602
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:40,699
Jeong Hae Seong for student council

603
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,339
No way.

604
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,469
- Is this for free? - Really?

605
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:48,239
Jeong Hae Seong for student council

606
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,578
Jeong Hae Seong for student council

607
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:54,920
Jeong Hae Seong for student council

608
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:58,448
Everyone, give it up for Hae Seong!

609
00:40:58,449 --> 00:40:59,988
Jeong Hae Seong!

610
00:40:59,989 --> 00:41:02,518
- Jeong Hae Seong! - Jeong Hae Seong!

611
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:04,959
- Jeong Hae Seong. - Jeong Hae Seong.

612
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,428
- Jeong Hae Seong! - Jeong Hae Seong!

613
00:41:07,429 --> 00:41:09,460
- Jeong Hae Seong! - Stop it!

614
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,069
Did you check out that sandwich place earlier?

615
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,969
It was hilarious.

616
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:15,799
Doesn't that count as cheating though?

617
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,070
He's buying people's votes.

618
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:19,109
Isn't that what you also did, Seung Jae?

619
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,738
What I did isn't the same.

620
00:41:20,739 --> 00:41:23,279
Seung Jae, are you worried...

621
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,109
about Hae Seong joining the student council?

622
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,780
I'm definitely going to stop you from debuting.

623
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,119
Whatever.

624
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:32,789
Even if Jeong Hae Seong hands in his application to join,

625
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:34,860
I'll be against it.

626
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,119
For what reason?

627
00:41:37,889 --> 00:41:39,630
He drove Tae Soo out.

628
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,259
He may be a hero to the others...

629
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,969
but a traitor to us.

630
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,570
It doesn't seem right for him to join us.

631
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:48,799
Why not? Don't you think it'll be fun?

632
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,769
- Why you... - Yu Jeong, how about you?

633
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:52,769
What's your take on it?

634
00:41:53,539 --> 00:41:54,539
Me?

635
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,780
Well, I...

636
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:02,719
I wouldn't be too pleased with him joining us either.

637
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:06,049
He only just transferred here,

638
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:07,820
and we don't know him that well.

639
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:11,389
Maybe after he spends more time here.

640
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,989
That was unexpected.

641
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:15,960
I thought you'd vote for him.

642
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:17,828
The Yu Jeong I know would've.

643
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:19,869
- Well... - I must've been mistaken.

644
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,699
So? Did he get enough signatures?

645
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:24,138
It seems that way.

646
00:42:24,139 --> 00:42:26,409
- Stop talking, will you? - Why?

647
00:42:26,909 --> 00:42:28,110
(List of Endorsing Students, Jeong Hae Seong)

648
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,210
And the midterms?

649
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,178
I've been studying.

650
00:42:35,179 --> 00:42:37,989
I had to make 100 sandwiches...

651
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,559
including a jingle which wasn't an easy feat.

652
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,289
It's up to you now,

653
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,460
so your grades better be in the top ten.

654
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,389
I'll do my best.

655
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,500
Good luck.

656
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I'll get going.

657
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:52,399
Guys, let's go.

658
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,538
- Hey! - Be careful.

659
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:55,598
My gosh.

660
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,940
Get up, will you?

661
00:42:59,269 --> 00:43:00,380
Come on.

662
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:02,440
Goodness.

663
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,150
Come on, let's go.

664
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:06,309
Is this even necessary?

665
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:17,190
(Yu Jeong)

666
00:43:25,969 --> 00:43:29,400
Look at you being all serious and charismatic.

667
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:30,670
Don't. It's not you.

668
00:43:31,969 --> 00:43:33,909
Are you going to join the student council?

669
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,578
That's no way to talk to someone older.

670
00:43:36,579 --> 00:43:37,610
Don't join.

671
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:42,150
Rip up the sheet of signatures.

672
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,819
Don't even look at or listen to anything...

673
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,089
regarding the student council.

674
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:46,889
Consider it off-limits!

675
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:52,429
- Yu Jeong, is something wrong... - Just don't!

676
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:56,129
I don't want you entering my world or anything else,

677
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:58,170
so stop annoying the heck out of me!

678
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,380
I said it loud and clear.

679
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,780
Don't join the student council.

680
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:16,989
If you do,

681
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:19,019
I'll tell people who you are.

682
00:44:20,789 --> 00:44:22,090
Do you think I won't?

683
00:44:22,889 --> 00:44:24,460
Test me, then.

684
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,650
Can we talk later tonight?

685
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:53,219
I'll swing by the house.

686
00:45:26,889 --> 00:45:28,119
(Bulletin Board)

687
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,329
(Silence!)

688
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,380
Good job, guys.

689
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:05,130
Word has been going around about your morning campaign rush.

690
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:07,929
I have to get this done by any means necessary.

691
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:09,629
Aren't you heading home?

692
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:11,130
I'm supervising the late-night self-study session.

693
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:14,469
That sounds exhausting.

694
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,480
It's for the textbook.

695
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:24,809
It's not poisoned, so go ahead.

696
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:27,179
I quite like caramels.

697
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:32,250
Hold on, the textbook?

698
00:46:32,989 --> 00:46:34,219
Did you see me?

699
00:46:35,019 --> 00:46:36,288
You were visible.

700
00:46:36,289 --> 00:46:37,760
Why didn't you greet me, then?

701
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:39,960
You didn't either.

702
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:43,159
Would it have killed you to greet me first?

703
00:46:47,539 --> 00:46:50,099
Crimson eyes?

704
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,809
The clocks at the heart of the second ghost story.

705
00:46:58,449 --> 00:46:59,480
These are the two.

706
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:01,149
(Donations by first chairman Seo Byeong Mun)

707
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:02,579
Which one is the original though?

708
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:06,250
How has Jeong Hae Seong been after the Anti-School Bullying Committee?

709
00:47:06,489 --> 00:47:09,119
He handed in his application to join the student council.

710
00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:11,329
- Our student council? - Yes.

711
00:47:20,269 --> 00:47:21,869
I hope it works out for him.

712
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:27,238
What happened during the session proved he's a loose cannon.

713
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:30,510
He could stir up more ruckus, so keep an eye on him.

714
00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:31,849
Yes, ma'am.

715
00:47:36,449 --> 00:47:37,489
Mom.

716
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:39,320
Ye Na.

717
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:41,889
You're here too, Principal Park.

718
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:45,059
Don't you know how late it is? You had me worried.

719
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,730
I see you were worried about me.

720
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,428
Sorry about that.

721
00:47:49,429 --> 00:47:51,469
I ate dinner with friends after studying.

722
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:55,340
Starting tomorrow, she'll be under special care.

723
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,509
She worries me.

724
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:58,909
Mom, come on.

725
00:47:59,269 --> 00:48:01,239
I'll get going, then.

726
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:03,509
Thank you for working well into the night.

727
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:04,949
Get home safely.

728
00:48:06,179 --> 00:48:07,349
Are you leaving already?

729
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,349
You're more than welcome to stay.

730
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,119
It's already quite late.

731
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,989
I'll see you tomorrow at school.

732
00:48:14,219 --> 00:48:15,219
Then...

733
00:48:15,789 --> 00:48:16,789
Sure.

734
00:48:27,869 --> 00:48:28,940
I'll get going too.

735
00:48:31,269 --> 00:48:32,670
Was the dinner necessary?

736
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,308
Midterms are right around the corner.

737
00:48:38,309 --> 00:48:39,780
Shouldn't you spend your time wisely?

738
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,519
You've been sleeping a lot lately too.

739
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,789
Why don't you cut back an hour?

740
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,718
Mom, I only get about four hours of sleep...

741
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:50,489
This is medicine for ADHD.

742
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:52,260
I hear it helps one focus.

743
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:55,800
Take one a day.

744
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:00,769
Ye Na?

745
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:17,719
My daughter.

746
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:24,789
You know I love you, don't you?

747
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:27,900
Everything I do...

748
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,630
is for you. You know that, right?

749
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:35,840
- I know, Mom. - No one...

750
00:49:36,539 --> 00:49:39,070
remembers those who come in second.

751
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:43,309
Second place is only first place among losers.

752
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:45,750
You see,

753
00:49:46,949 --> 00:49:49,079
I want my Ye Na...

754
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,460
to be someone this world remembers.

755
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:58,989
Sure, Mom.

756
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,530
I'll keep that in mind.

757
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:16,510
Ye Na.

758
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:25,750
Take it now.

759
00:51:03,789 --> 00:51:04,888
Hey, Mi Jeong.

760
00:51:04,889 --> 00:51:06,630
Hae Seong, we have a problem.

762
00:51:17,739 --> 00:51:18,739
What?

763
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:21,780
Say that again. What about Jeong Hae Seong?

764
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:26,409
You see, Hae Seong...

765
00:51:27,179 --> 00:51:28,380
You're not feeling well?

766
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:30,420
Yes, I'm afraid...

767
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:34,889
I have a severe cold.

768
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,860
I'm sorry, Ms. Oh.

769
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:39,090
I should be in school today but...

770
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:42,360
Is it bad?

771
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,199
- Did you take your meds? - Yes.

772
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:47,800
A day of rest will do the trick.

773
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:51,510
Sure. See you tomorrow.

774
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,880
Hae Seong!

775
00:51:58,650 --> 00:51:59,750
Hurry on in.

777
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:12,589

778

779
00:52:16,429 --> 00:52:17,469
You!

781
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:53,469
Hello?

782
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,840
Hae Seong, how's the cold?

783
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:02,380
I'm still running a fever.

784
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:04,050
That's lasting quite long.

785
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,979
I'm on my way with porridge and medicine,

786
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,118
so sleep until then.

787
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:10,479
You live in the rooftop unit of Chanseo Villa...

788
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,820
that's at the school intersection.

789
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:13,119
What?

790
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,869
Still, we dodged a bullet with Hae Seong today.

791
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:31,768
What would we have done...

792
00:53:31,769 --> 00:53:32,940
if it were a two-night mobilization training?

793
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:34,340
Don't even mention that.

794
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:36,039
The thought of it sends chills down my spine.

795
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:39,780
- Are you done cleaning up? - Yes.

796
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:41,849
Call Hae Seong over for some barbecue.

797
00:53:46,949 --> 00:53:49,519
Hey, Hae Seong. I was just about to call you.

798
00:53:49,719 --> 00:53:50,729
Sir,

799
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:52,259
that rooftop unit on my student record.

800
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:53,489
How has the room been set?

801
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,158
Hey, has the rooftop unit been set up?

802
00:53:56,159 --> 00:53:57,300
- No. - Why not?

803
00:53:57,699 --> 00:53:59,429
- I was going to do it next week. - I see.

804
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:02,340
It's still an empty unit. Why?

805
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:06,710
What?

806
00:54:07,579 --> 00:54:09,280
You've got to be kidding me.

807
00:54:09,909 --> 00:54:10,980
Code black.

808
00:54:21,789 --> 00:54:23,389
This can't go cold.

809
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:57,119
- Come on! - Darn.

810
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,630
Didn't you bring anything?

811
00:55:01,429 --> 00:55:03,299
Who'd believe I live in an empty unit?

812
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,968
How could we bring anything on short notice?

813
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:06,598
This would compromise the entire mission.

814
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:07,698
Is there a way out of this?

815
00:55:07,699 --> 00:55:09,070
Failing the mission won't be the worst of it.

816
00:55:09,369 --> 00:55:11,039
You should've gotten this done!

817
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:13,368
I didn't have any days off!

818
00:55:13,369 --> 00:55:14,480
Shut it. That's enough!

819
00:55:19,309 --> 00:55:20,579
I know where we can find what we need.

820
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,820
Right there.

821
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:32,360
Sir, are you suggesting that we borrow everything?

822
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:35,599
Do you have a better idea?

823
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:38,030
If not, do as I say.

824
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:41,400
Listen up. This is an order by your team leader.

Right this moment,

00:55:42,901 --> 00:55:45,710
we will run around this neighbourhood...

827
00:55:45,969 --> 00:55:48,179
and obtain all that is needed by a high school student living alone.

828
00:55:49,309 --> 00:55:51,210
- Did you bring your school uniform? - It's back at home.

829
00:55:51,309 --> 00:55:52,779
How could you have forgotten that?

830
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:54,719
Things were happening too fast. What's next?

831
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:55,980
Okay, fine.

832
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:58,920

833
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:02,420
from his school uniform to necessities.

834
00:56:02,789 --> 00:56:04,489
In the meantime, we'll focus...

835
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:05,960
on securing a TV, a laptop, and other appliances.

836
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:08,099
What's the ETA on your teacher?

837
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:10,699
- She'll be here in 20 minutes. - Okay.

838
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:12,730
Time your clocks. We have 15 minutes.

839
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:15,738
Hear me loud and clear.

840
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:17,610
There is no room for error.

I believe I'm taller than you, Bong Ja.

921
01:04:13,179 --> 01:04:15,079
Later on, you idiot.

922
01:04:15,619 --> 01:04:18,749
Besides, stop calling me Bong Ja.

923
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:19,750
Why?

924
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:21,389
I think it's a pretty name.

925
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:30,230
I'm watching my weight.

926
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,269
I'll throw it out anyway, so eat.

927
01:04:37,699 --> 01:04:38,940
Hey, Oh Bong Ja!

928
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:51,420
I wonder how he's doing.

929
01:05:24,579 --> 01:05:26,949
It's more than just suspicious.

930
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:29,690
There could be a chance he isn't a student.

931
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:32,729
Stay clear of Oh Su A in school from here on out.

932
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:34,058
What is this woman doing here?

933
01:05:34,059 --> 01:05:35,360
As if there's a way to avoid her.

934
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:37,928
I have the results of your midterms.

935
01:05:37,929 --> 01:05:38,969
How high did you rank?

936
01:05:39,429 --> 01:05:41,469
I bet this is the first time Ye Na got crushed.

937
01:05:41,739 --> 01:05:42,968
It's getting on my nerves.

938
01:05:42,969 --> 01:05:45,639
Or maybe have him kicked out of school.

939
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,868
Could the operation have been leaked?

940
01:05:47,869 --> 01:05:48,879
I want detailed reports...

941
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,879
on the staff and teachers at Byeongmun High.

942
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,409
Are you the one who sent the letter?

943
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:09,000
(Undercover High School)
