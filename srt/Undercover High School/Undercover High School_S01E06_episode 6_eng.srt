00:00:00,303 --> 00:00:04,320

 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Undercover Love Team ðŸ’– @Viki.com 

3
00:00:13,505 --> 00:00:15,965
You're earlier than I thought.

4
00:00:32,965 --> 00:00:35,395
   

5
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,155
   

6
00:04:07,155 --> 00:04:09,795
That took longer than expected.

7
00:04:12,465 --> 00:04:15,885
There was a bit of an obstacle.

8
00:04:15,885 --> 00:04:17,875
What about the notebook?

9
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,335
Everyone except the Director, please leave.

10
00:04:38,335 --> 00:04:41,615
Hey, Jeong Hae Seong! Why are you barging in here?

11
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,405
I said you all need to leave.

12
00:04:43,405 --> 00:04:45,345
Who do you think you're talking to?

13
00:04:45,345 --> 00:04:47,015
Get out, bastard.

14
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,055
Everyone, leave.

15
00:04:59,985 --> 00:05:02,715
If this isn't urgent, you're in big trouble.

16
00:05:02,715 --> 00:05:04,495
What is it?

17
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:19,625
This notebook belongs to Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon,

18
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,245
my father, who went missing 22 years ago.

19
00:05:23,805 --> 00:05:28,555
From this moment, answer every single question I ask you.

20
00:05:31,035 --> 00:05:33,775
Why is this notebook

21
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:36,155
at Byeongmun High School?

22
00:05:42,535 --> 00:05:47,085
I can cut your throat right here. So tell me.

23
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:52,305
Why is my father's notebook at Byeongmun High?

24
00:05:52,305 --> 00:05:55,495
Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon's last mission

25
00:05:55,495 --> 00:05:57,655
was the one you have now.

26
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:04,045
Jeong Hae Seong! Open the door!

27
00:06:04,045 --> 00:06:05,175
Director!

28
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:06,925
 Agent Jeong Hae Seong! 

29
00:06:06,925 --> 00:06:09,235
To find the gold bars hidden at Byeongmun High.

30
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:11,845
I have no idea if he's dead or alive now.

31
00:06:11,845 --> 00:06:14,155
You son of a bitch!

32
00:06:16,135 --> 00:06:18,355
Why did you hide this from me?

33
00:06:18,355 --> 00:06:20,515
Why did you hide this from me?

34
00:06:20,515 --> 00:06:27,005
Under no circumstances can I reveal what happens to an agent in the line of duty.

35
00:06:27,005 --> 00:06:29,745
Don't you know the basics?

36
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:33,955
It doesn't matter if Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon was your father.

37
00:06:33,955 --> 00:06:37,665
What matters is whether you complete the mission.

38
00:06:37,665 --> 00:06:41,955
Ever since my father went missing over 20 years ago,

39
00:06:41,955 --> 00:06:45,385
do you know what that time was like for me?

40
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:47,485
And that's why?

41
00:06:48,255 --> 00:06:50,995
I should've hidden it better.

42
00:06:50,995 --> 00:06:54,815
I'm sorry you had to find out like this, Agent Jeong Hae Seong.

43
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:57,025
You call yourself a human being?

44
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:59,485
Hey, Jeong Hae Seong!

45
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,155
Are you crazy?

46
00:07:32,155 --> 00:07:34,265
Throwing punches at the director?

47
00:07:34,265 --> 00:07:36,425
Are you out of your mind?

48
00:07:36,425 --> 00:07:40,025
We're looking up Kim Hyeon Ho's identity, the deceased.

49
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:42,975
We're investigating why he had the notebook

50
00:07:42,975 --> 00:07:46,145
and what he was trying to say to you.

51
00:07:46,145 --> 00:07:48,085
But if you do this,

52
00:07:48,085 --> 00:07:52,045
if you behave like this, it could all end!

53
00:07:52,695 --> 00:07:55,865
Did you know about this, too, Team Leader?

54
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,065
Ahjussi,

55
00:08:07,815 --> 00:08:10,455
tell me honestly.

56
00:08:13,795 --> 00:08:16,525
Ahjussi, did you know that...

57
00:08:19,405 --> 00:08:22,135
my dad went missing on this mission?

58
00:08:26,775 --> 00:08:28,525
I didn't know.

59
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,115
My father vanished when I was nine...

60
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,480
and reappeared now that I'm 31.

61
00:08:43,085 --> 00:08:49,365
This bastard of a son didn't even know why his dad disappeared.

62
00:08:51,645 --> 00:08:53,730
How is this right?

63
00:08:54,335 --> 00:08:57,305
But this f***ing organization knew all this...

64
00:09:26,975 --> 00:09:29,055
I'm sorry, Team Leader.

65
00:09:30,935 --> 00:09:33,200
I can't do this anymore.

66
00:09:33,815 --> 00:09:35,615
Hey, Hae Seong...

67
00:09:35,615 --> 00:09:37,205
Hey!

68
00:09:41,835 --> 00:09:43,765
Let me...

69
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:49,285
Let me take a short break.

70
00:10:37,405 --> 00:10:40,425
   

71
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,195
   

72
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:56,445
 The empty space under the old building could be mission central from now on. 

73
00:10:56,445 --> 00:10:58,575
 It's safe here. 

74
00:11:08,205 --> 00:11:11,255
    
    

75
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:28,045
 Go to the observatory on my beloved son Si Hyeon's birthday. 

76
00:11:29,775 --> 00:11:31,945
 You think I forgot about that? 

77
00:11:31,945 --> 00:11:34,135
 I'll be right back and wake you up. 

78
00:11:34,135 --> 00:11:35,785
 Let's go to your favorite, the observatory. 

79
00:11:35,785 --> 00:11:38,695
   

80
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,835
   

81
00:11:59,835 --> 00:12:02,235
 Someone jumped from the rooftop. 

82
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:04,855
 I'm so scared. 

83
00:12:06,615 --> 00:12:09,305
What in the world...

84
00:12:09,305 --> 00:12:11,205
 Someone fell. 

85
00:12:11,205 --> 00:12:13,595
   

86
00:12:13,595 --> 00:12:15,815
 It's blood. 

87
00:12:15,815 --> 00:12:17,950
 - Oh, no...  
 - Ms. Oh.

88
00:12:18,515 --> 00:12:20,085
Did you hear?

89
00:12:20,085 --> 00:12:22,415
Mr. Kim committed suicide last night.

90
00:12:22,415 --> 00:12:23,535
 Is he really dead? 

91
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:24,715
Suicide?

92
00:12:24,715 --> 00:12:28,835
Yes. They found a note in his office, too.

93
00:12:29,985 --> 00:12:32,855
Hey. Did you hear about the security Ahjussi?

94
00:12:32,855 --> 00:12:34,455
He jumped from the roof.

95
00:12:34,455 --> 00:12:36,175
I know!

96
00:12:36,175 --> 00:12:39,915
He wasn't even on duty and was alone at school.

97
00:12:39,915 --> 00:12:44,920
Could it be the curse of the grandfather clock?

98
00:12:45,545 --> 00:12:48,895
Never be alone at school at night.

99
00:12:49,795 --> 00:12:51,225
When the clock strikes...

100
00:12:51,225 --> 00:12:55,515
A pair of red eyes will come to get you.

101
00:12:59,535 --> 00:13:01,175
Stop it!

102
00:13:01,175 --> 00:13:02,855
I'm so scared.

103
00:13:02,855 --> 00:13:05,495
Let's start the morning assembly.

104
00:13:05,495 --> 00:13:07,855
Go back to your seat.

105
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:11,435
Ms. Oh! What happened to the security Ahjussi?

106
00:13:11,435 --> 00:13:13,865
Do you know anything?

107
00:13:15,565 --> 00:13:18,105
I just heard, so I'm not sure.

108
00:13:18,105 --> 00:13:19,455
Let's check attendance.

109
00:13:19,455 --> 00:13:21,525
Who's not here yet?

110
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:24,645
Is Hae Seong not here yet?

111
00:13:24,645 --> 00:13:25,805
Should I call him?

112
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,535
No. I'll check.

113
00:13:28,535 --> 00:13:30,765
Today's the last day to enter volunteer hours.

114
00:13:30,765 --> 00:13:33,535
If you haven't done it, hurry up.

115
00:13:33,535 --> 00:13:35,880
   

116
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,065
Lastly, Seung Jae, please get the funeral flowers.

117
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:41,635
Meeting adjourned.

118
00:13:41,635 --> 00:13:44,425
Isn't that a job for the newbie?

119
00:13:44,425 --> 00:13:46,085
Where is Jeong Hae Seong?

120
00:13:46,085 --> 00:13:47,805
Where is Jeong Hae Seong?

121
00:13:47,805 --> 00:13:49,315
Unexcused absence? This isn't right.

122
00:13:49,315 --> 00:13:52,505
The meeting is adjourned. You can go.

123
00:13:53,385 --> 00:13:54,975
Let's go.

124
00:13:59,665 --> 00:14:01,115
Yu Jeong,

125
00:14:01,115 --> 00:14:03,355
I've been wanting to ask for a while...

126
00:14:03,355 --> 00:14:05,750
What's your relationship with Hae Seong?

127
00:14:06,425 --> 00:14:08,215
What do you mean?

128
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:11,025
You eat together. You seem close.

129
00:14:11,025 --> 00:14:13,455
You worry and think about each other.

130
00:14:13,455 --> 00:14:15,565
You take care of each other.

131
00:14:16,115 --> 00:14:19,675
He does? I didn't realize that.

132
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:21,835
Be honest with me.

133
00:14:22,505 --> 00:14:24,505
Yu Jeong...

134
00:14:25,275 --> 00:14:26,875
you like Hae Seong, don't you?

135
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:30,015
- What? 
 - It's fine. Just be honest.

136
00:14:30,015 --> 00:14:32,945
- Since when? 
 - Nonsense.

137
00:14:32,945 --> 00:14:35,575
I have high standards.

138
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:39,375
That's weird. My instincts are usually right.

139
00:14:39,995 --> 00:14:41,555
Then, I'm going to like him.

140
00:14:41,555 --> 00:14:42,955
What?

141
00:14:42,955 --> 00:14:44,815
Hey, Ye Na...

142
00:14:44,815 --> 00:14:47,605
I'm being serious right now.

143
00:14:47,605 --> 00:14:50,555
Maybe you should rethink that.

144
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:53,225
You said you didn't like him. You're not dating.

145
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,935
So why not?

146
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,615
W-W-What I'm trying to say is...

147
00:14:57,615 --> 00:15:00,415
Why Jeong Hae Seong out of everyone?

148
00:15:00,415 --> 00:15:03,465
There are a lot of good guys.

149
00:15:03,465 --> 00:15:05,875
Hae Seong is not so bad.

150
00:15:06,755 --> 00:15:08,695
Anyway, now I've told you.

151
00:15:08,695 --> 00:15:11,055
Just don't get in my way.

152
00:15:28,305 --> 00:15:30,165
Good work.

153
00:15:34,405 --> 00:15:36,825
By the way, Director.

154
00:15:36,825 --> 00:15:41,015
Did Seok Ho know that Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon's disappearance

155
00:15:41,015 --> 00:15:44,115
had to do with Byeongmun High?

156
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:47,395
Jin Sang,

157
00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:50,635
do you know why people die in a valley?

158
00:15:50,635 --> 00:15:52,145
It might look shallow

159
00:15:52,145 --> 00:15:56,705
but you don't know how deep it is until you fall.

160
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:59,015
Seok Ho is like that for me.

161
00:15:59,015 --> 00:16:02,915
I have no idea what he knows or is thinking about.

162
00:16:02,915 --> 00:16:05,815
I just thought he was scatterbrained.

163
00:16:06,825 --> 00:16:10,475
I mean, we're not close enough for me to know.

164
00:16:10,475 --> 00:16:11,675
Does that answer your question?

165
00:16:11,675 --> 00:16:13,085
Yes.

166
00:16:13,085 --> 00:16:14,615
You can go.

167
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:07,210
   

168
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,625
How time flies.

169
00:17:48,015 --> 00:17:49,935
 I know. 

170
00:17:52,525 --> 00:17:55,125
 Where did all the glow-in-the-dark stars go? 

171
00:17:57,605 --> 00:17:58,985
 What? 

172
00:17:59,725 --> 00:18:01,585
 Did something happen? 

173
00:18:03,545 --> 00:18:05,335
Dad.

174
00:18:11,555 --> 00:18:14,585
Were you as lonely as I am?

175
00:18:17,655 --> 00:18:20,835
Looking back at this mission,

176
00:18:20,835 --> 00:18:24,195
I wonder if you walked down this path.

177
00:18:28,715 --> 00:18:32,055
Were you as lonely as I am?

178
00:18:34,775 --> 00:18:37,625
I keep thinking about those things.

179
00:18:41,905 --> 00:18:45,255
I believe you are alive,

180
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:54,155
but I also think you might be dead.

181
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,425
You're alive.

182
00:19:02,595 --> 00:19:04,875
You must be somewhere.

183
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:10,695
I try to have faith, but it's too difficult.

184
00:19:14,325 --> 00:19:16,105
I'm sorry.

185
00:19:17,595 --> 00:19:19,915
I'm sorry, Dad.

186
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,565
 It's okay. 

187
00:19:34,245 --> 00:19:36,045
 Si Hyeon. 

188
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:39,925
 Don't cry. It's okay. 

189
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:47,555
â™«  What I could endure deep at night was  â™«

190
00:19:47,555 --> 00:19:52,395
â™«  Counting the stars at the end of the world  â™«

191
00:19:52,395 --> 00:19:55,725
â™«  I learned the secret of the night when I fell asleep in your arms  â™«

192
00:19:55,725 --> 00:20:02,755
â™«  I learned the secret of the night when I fell asleep in your arms  â™«

193
00:20:02,755 --> 00:20:11,065
â™«  You're the only one who holds my hand  â™«

194
00:20:11,065 --> 00:20:15,075
â™«  Whenever I'm lost in pain  â™«

195
00:20:15,075 --> 00:20:19,665
â™«  Every time I fall and fail  â™«

196
00:20:19,665 --> 00:20:23,765
â™«  You help me feel love  â™«

197
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:26,745
â™«  So real  â™«

198
00:20:26,745 --> 00:20:35,805
â™«  I'll shine for you through every night until I'm next to you  â™«

199
00:20:35,805 --> 00:20:39,555
â™«  For you  â™«

200
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:58,125
Geez, I told you not to take in your uniform!

201
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:01,715
I should just mess up your side part.

202
00:21:01,715 --> 00:21:03,775
Gosh, I put on mousse at the spa...

203
00:21:03,775 --> 00:21:07,845
You're headed for the police station, not school.

204
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,295
Hae Seong is gone. We have no choice.

205
00:21:13,295 --> 00:21:15,845
I heard he turned in his gun and ID.

206
00:21:15,845 --> 00:21:18,645
Is he actually quitting?

207
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:21,165
I think we need to prepare for it.

208
00:21:21,165 --> 00:21:24,205
Mi Jeong, prepare Young Hun's school documents.

209
00:21:24,205 --> 00:21:27,235
We should try to get him in this week.

210
00:21:29,165 --> 00:21:30,845
Sunbae!

211
00:21:32,075 --> 00:21:33,935
Hey, Hae Seong.

212
00:21:35,425 --> 00:21:38,485
I was going to quit it all and go fishing,

213
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:44,435
but I think I need to find this guy.

214
00:21:46,155 --> 00:21:49,225
NIS Team 4 Ground Agent Jeong Hae Seong.

215
00:21:50,105 --> 00:21:52,485
I will continue this mission.

216
00:22:00,725 --> 00:22:02,875
Take off your uniform, bastard!

217
00:22:16,785 --> 00:22:18,285
Hae Seong!

218
00:22:18,285 --> 00:22:20,285
Why weren't you here yesterday? Were you sick?

219
00:22:20,285 --> 00:22:22,015
- No. 
 - Is something wrong?

220
00:22:22,015 --> 00:22:25,565
- No, no. 
 - Why didn't you come to the council?

221
00:22:26,465 --> 00:22:28,005
I just had something I needed to do.

222
00:22:28,005 --> 00:22:30,265
You weren't answering your phone.

223
00:22:31,025 --> 00:22:32,735
I was busy.

224
00:22:35,405 --> 00:22:37,595
I took notes for you.

225
00:22:40,565 --> 00:22:42,395
Thanks.

226
00:22:43,035 --> 00:22:44,655
Hey, man.

227
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,725
Skipping school without telling this hyung?

228
00:22:46,725 --> 00:22:49,305
- Why were you absent? 
 - We weren't worried or anything.

229
00:22:49,305 --> 00:22:51,855
We just didn't have enough guys for the PC cafe.

230
00:22:51,855 --> 00:22:54,630
- Is there something wrong? 
 - Nope.

231
00:22:55,215 --> 00:22:57,505
Have a seat.

232
00:23:01,685 --> 00:23:03,975
Jeong Hae Seong, what happened?

233
00:23:03,975 --> 00:23:07,105
I had some personal stuff. I'm sorry.

234
00:23:07,105 --> 00:23:08,685
This is school.

235
00:23:08,685 --> 00:23:12,475
Attendance is the minimum a student must do.

236
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:16,145
You're getting demerits for an unexcused absence.

237
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,965
Did you do something wrong to Ms. Oh?

238
00:23:23,025 --> 00:23:26,245
Want to hit the snack bar before first period?

239
00:23:26,845 --> 00:23:28,635
I have to go somewhere.

240
00:23:28,635 --> 00:23:30,695
Let's go during recess.

241
00:23:30,695 --> 00:23:32,225
Where?

242
00:23:34,025 --> 00:23:35,505
Somewhere.

243
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,260
   

244
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:39,755
     

245
00:24:47,905 --> 00:24:50,895
 The girl who died falling head-first... 

246
00:24:50,895 --> 00:24:53,805
 A corpse standing upside down. 

247
00:24:53,805 --> 00:24:57,555
 Go counterclockwise... 

248
00:25:35,335 --> 00:25:37,855
 Red eyes. 

249
00:26:05,945 --> 00:26:07,785
 Next... 

250
00:26:07,785 --> 00:26:09,985
 a piano that plays by itself. 

251
00:26:19,555 --> 00:26:22,075
What are you doing here? There is no meeting.

252
00:26:23,735 --> 00:26:25,875
I had to look up something urgently.

253
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,795
How about you, Ms. Oh?

254
00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:31,285
I need to check on something urgently.

255
00:26:32,315 --> 00:26:34,845
You heard about Mr. Kim, right?

256
00:26:36,405 --> 00:26:38,245
Yes.

257
00:26:38,245 --> 00:26:41,015
He jumped off the school rooftop.

258
00:26:43,345 --> 00:26:46,025
If there's nothing else, I will get going.

259
00:26:49,325 --> 00:26:51,065
Jeong Hae Seong.

260
00:26:53,175 --> 00:26:55,485
You know it wasn't a suicide.

261
00:26:56,965 --> 00:26:59,605
You were on the rooftop then.

262
00:27:01,785 --> 00:27:03,335
You...

263
00:27:04,825 --> 00:27:06,805
What is your identity?

264
00:27:49,015 --> 00:27:50,685
 Jeong Hae Seong. 

265
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:37,425
I could call the police right now.

266
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:39,595
You're not a student, are you?

267
00:28:54,105 --> 00:28:56,545
I will tell you everything.

268
00:29:13,455 --> 00:29:15,005
I'm...

269
00:29:18,095 --> 00:29:20,915
an undercover NIS agent.

270
00:29:28,345 --> 00:29:29,545
   

271
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,685
What's going on?

272
00:29:41,755 --> 00:29:43,075
Got it.

273
00:29:43,075 --> 00:29:45,105
See you there.

274
00:29:48,015 --> 00:29:50,175
So, according to you, sirâ€”

275
00:29:50,175 --> 00:29:52,415
I mean, Agent...

276
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:59,245
King Gojong's gold bars are hiding in our school and you are here to find them.

277
00:30:00,045 --> 00:30:03,935
Mr. Kim was killed by the person whoâ€”

278
00:30:11,065 --> 00:30:13,945
W-W-What are you doing?

279
00:30:15,995 --> 00:30:18,715
Listen to what I'm about to say.

280
00:30:18,715 --> 00:30:21,595
You have two options, Ms. Oh.

281
00:30:21,595 --> 00:30:23,135
1.

282
00:30:23,135 --> 00:30:25,535
Fully cooperate with a government mission,

283
00:30:25,535 --> 00:30:27,255
fulfilling your duty as a citizen.

284
00:30:27,255 --> 00:30:28,725
What are you saying?

285
00:30:28,725 --> 00:30:30,155
2.

286
00:30:30,155 --> 00:30:33,255
Leak classified NIS operational information,

287
00:30:33,255 --> 00:30:37,365
violate national security laws, and be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

288
00:30:38,595 --> 00:30:42,075
Prosecuted to the fullest extent...

289
00:30:43,595 --> 00:30:46,405
- Like jail? 
 - Minimum 10 years in prison.

290
00:30:51,255 --> 00:30:53,015
Ten years?

291
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:01,355
I'll give you one day to think.

292
00:31:01,355 --> 00:31:03,145
See you tomorrow.

293
00:31:06,815 --> 00:31:09,795
W-Wait. Wait a minute!

294
00:31:15,695 --> 00:31:18,295
Why would I go to prison?

295
00:31:19,855 --> 00:31:21,815
Did I do something wrong?

296
00:31:21,815 --> 00:31:23,960
    

297
00:31:34,595 --> 00:31:37,115
So this is your school's...

298
00:31:37,115 --> 00:31:38,375
I'm sorry.

299
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:41,065
Is this Byeongmun High's school song?

300
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:45,015
Written when Seo Byeong Mun was inaugurated.

301
00:31:45,015 --> 00:31:47,775
Music and lyrics by Seo Byeong Mun.

302
00:31:47,775 --> 00:31:51,145
Like the film "Music and Lyrics."

303
00:31:52,175 --> 00:31:53,585
I'm sorry.

304
00:31:53,585 --> 00:31:56,175
The keyword written here for the third story

305
00:31:56,175 --> 00:31:57,665
is a four-hand ensemble.

306
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,405
A keyboard that moves without sound.

307
00:31:59,405 --> 00:32:02,505
Played by the dead female student.

308
00:32:03,815 --> 00:32:05,775
Will you have no issues accessing the piano?

309
00:32:05,775 --> 00:32:07,285
I'll find out tomorrow at school.

310
00:32:07,285 --> 00:32:10,025
We don't know when that man will show up again,

311
00:32:10,025 --> 00:32:12,375
so be especially careful.

312
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:14,365
Who could be that guy?

313
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:17,015
Seeing that he tried to steal the notebook,

314
00:32:17,015 --> 00:32:19,755
I think he's looking for the gold bars, too.

315
00:32:19,755 --> 00:32:22,255
Of course, I can't be sure without proof.

316
00:32:22,255 --> 00:32:24,435
We do need to be careful.

317
00:32:24,435 --> 00:32:26,815
Did you look into Kim Hyeon Ho's identity?

318
00:32:26,815 --> 00:32:29,635
We looked at everything.

319
00:32:29,635 --> 00:32:31,965
He is a civilian.

320
00:32:31,965 --> 00:32:37,065
Unfortunately, it's still a mystery how he had Agent Jeong's notebook.

321
00:32:37,065 --> 00:32:40,025
Same with why he wanted to meet Sunbae.

322
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:43,675
There are no clues as to what he wanted to say.

323
00:32:44,275 --> 00:32:46,985
Anyway, one thing is certain so far.

324
00:32:46,985 --> 00:32:50,135
Someone is influencing this case.

325
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:55,175
Otherwise, there's no need to wrap it up so fast as a suicide.

326
00:32:56,105 --> 00:32:58,405
Investigate the officer on the caseâ€”

327
00:32:59,685 --> 00:33:00,925
Investigate.

328
00:33:00,925 --> 00:33:02,945
- Got it. 
 - What about your absence?

329
00:33:02,945 --> 00:33:05,435
Nothing's going on between you and Ms. Oh, right?

330
00:33:05,435 --> 00:33:08,145
Oh, I am going to mention it.

331
00:33:08,145 --> 00:33:10,535
There was a bit of a problem,

332
00:33:12,985 --> 00:33:14,845
but I took care of it.

333
00:33:14,845 --> 00:33:17,515
   

334
00:33:30,285 --> 00:33:32,265
What!

335
00:33:32,265 --> 00:33:35,015
What matters is that it was handled.

336
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:38,615
I made it very clear, so please don't worry.

337
00:33:38,615 --> 00:33:40,495
So what you're saying is, Sunbae...

338
00:33:40,495 --> 00:33:44,895
a NIS agent was bluffing to a civilian?

339
00:33:44,895 --> 00:33:46,655
You threatened a civilian.

340
00:33:46,655 --> 00:33:48,855
You could go to jail if something goes wrong!

341
00:33:48,855 --> 00:33:51,555
Hey, man, we should be appeasing her.

342
00:33:51,555 --> 00:33:53,715
Why did you come out so strong?

343
00:33:53,715 --> 00:33:55,445
- Really? 
 - Not "really"!

344
00:33:55,445 --> 00:33:57,445
Of course!

345
00:33:57,445 --> 00:34:00,345
Okay, just stand up.

346
00:34:00,345 --> 00:34:02,535
Stand up and go meet Ms. Oh.

347
00:34:02,535 --> 00:34:05,835
Put your head down and apologize for earlier.

348
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:10,855
Be nice and get her to agree to keep it a secret.

349
00:34:10,855 --> 00:34:12,825
Got it?

350
00:34:30,385 --> 00:34:32,295
What is this?

351
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:37,035
This is on the house. Have plenty.

352
00:34:38,215 --> 00:34:39,885
If you need more, let me know.

353
00:34:39,885 --> 00:34:42,255
Thank you for the meal.

354
00:34:42,255 --> 00:34:44,755
Of course, please enjoy.

355
00:34:46,115 --> 00:34:49,550
Then, enjoy your conversation.

356
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,980
Okay.

357
00:34:53,455 --> 00:34:56,085
(It's not like that!)

358
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,335
What a mess!

359
00:35:02,335 --> 00:35:04,085
Let me get that.

360
00:35:04,085 --> 00:35:05,965
No thanks!

361
00:35:11,325 --> 00:35:13,765
So what did you want to say?

362
00:35:13,765 --> 00:35:17,045
I made a mistake earlier.

363
00:35:17,045 --> 00:35:20,085
Aigoo! Earlier, you were like, "1, 2..."

364
00:35:20,085 --> 00:35:22,345
"I'll give you one day" so seriously. What now?

365
00:35:22,345 --> 00:35:26,105
I lost my mind for a second earlier and misspoke.

366
00:35:27,175 --> 00:35:28,905
I'm sorry.

367
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:47,865
So? Keep talking.

368
00:35:47,865 --> 00:35:49,175
I've been hiding my identity...

369
00:35:49,175 --> 00:35:50,925
You're not going to drink?

370
00:35:54,535 --> 00:35:58,925
I won't ask you to understand why I hid who I am.

371
00:35:58,925 --> 00:36:00,845
Regardless of the reason, I'm a stranger,

372
00:36:00,845 --> 00:36:03,065
and I'm not supposed to be at this school.

373
00:36:03,065 --> 00:36:06,725
But please, I ask this of you.

374
00:36:07,905 --> 00:36:10,435
To investigate the wrongful death of Kim Hyeon Ho,

375
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:11,655
in the interest of our country,

376
00:36:11,655 --> 00:36:13,905
and to punish the criminal,

377
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:16,615
I must remain at this school.

378
00:36:16,615 --> 00:36:20,035
We are also discussing a proper compensation

379
00:36:20,035 --> 00:36:22,185
for you, Ms. Oh.

380
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:27,095
Please keep this a secret.

381
00:36:27,095 --> 00:36:29,085
Come on.

382
00:36:29,085 --> 00:36:32,165
Sure, I hear you, but from my perspective...

383
00:36:32,165 --> 00:36:33,115
Let's be blunt.

384
00:36:33,115 --> 00:36:35,015
You wouldn't give me any gold if you found it.

385
00:36:35,015 --> 00:36:39,615
At most, you'd give me an NIS watch or a ring.

386
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:44,075
Life is give and take, but what will I take in this scenario?

387
00:36:44,075 --> 00:36:48,545
Even if I keep your secret, what do I get? Absolutely nothing.

388
00:36:48,545 --> 00:36:50,755
 Ms. Oh, congratulations on your presidential medal. 

389
00:36:50,755 --> 00:36:54,345
 You aided the NIS agent in finding King Gojong's gold. 

390
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:56,255
 How do you feel? 

391
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:59,385
 I just did what I should do. 

392
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:04,135
 As a Korean history teacher who has a duty to teach children, 

393
00:37:04,135 --> 00:37:07,235
 and as a Korean citizen. 

394
00:37:07,235 --> 00:37:09,345
 Ms. Oh, I always believed in you! 

395
00:37:09,345 --> 00:37:11,035
 I don't deserve your praise. 

396
00:37:11,035 --> 00:37:12,365
 So humble. 

397
00:37:12,365 --> 00:37:14,165
 You're the best, Ms. Oh. 

398
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:18,005
 Vice Principal, promote Ms. Oh to full-time! 

399
00:37:18,005 --> 00:37:19,685
 Congratulations, Ms. Su Ah! 

400
00:37:19,685 --> 00:37:21,255
 Congratulations! 

401
00:37:21,255 --> 00:37:22,545
 Yay! 

402
00:37:22,545 --> 00:37:25,305
 Oh Su Ah! Oh Su Ah! 

403
00:37:25,305 --> 00:37:26,725
 Oh Su Ah! 

404
00:37:26,725 --> 00:37:31,095
 Oh Su Ah!  Oh Su Ah! 

405
00:37:36,775 --> 00:37:37,885
Ms. Oh?

406
00:37:37,885 --> 00:37:39,385
I will help you.

407
00:37:39,385 --> 00:37:41,065
All of a sudden?

408
00:37:43,155 --> 00:37:47,675
Your secret is safe with me.

409
00:37:47,675 --> 00:37:53,355
I will dedicate my entire being and self

410
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:57,085
so that you can do your work without a hitch.

411
00:37:57,085 --> 00:38:02,085
Sounds like you have an ulterior motive...

412
00:38:02,085 --> 00:38:03,725
Nope.

413
00:38:04,555 --> 00:38:06,395
Out of the goodness of my heart.

414
00:38:06,395 --> 00:38:07,895
Goodness of my heart!

415
00:38:07,895 --> 00:38:09,615
Oh, my.

416
00:38:10,615 --> 00:38:11,755
You haven't tried this, right?

417
00:38:11,755 --> 00:38:13,825
This is so... Gosh, look at the meat.

418
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:16,495
I love meat!

419
00:38:18,205 --> 00:38:19,905
Eat up!

420
00:38:19,905 --> 00:38:22,375
This place specializes in potato pork stew!

421
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:23,545
Why, all of a sudden...

422
00:38:23,545 --> 00:38:25,565
Eat up.

423
00:38:26,465 --> 00:38:29,375
Yu Jeong is your little sister?

424
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:35,265
Gosh, and the owner of that food spot is your superior and Yu Jeong's dad?

425
00:38:35,265 --> 00:38:38,005
Yes, that's exactly right.

426
00:38:38,905 --> 00:38:43,115
Given your last names are Jeong and An, you're not siblings.

427
00:38:43,115 --> 00:38:46,415
Well, a blended family? That?

428
00:38:46,415 --> 00:38:48,865
No, it's not that.

429
00:38:52,575 --> 00:38:54,895
It's a long story.

430
00:38:55,605 --> 00:38:58,675
Okay. Everyone has a story.

431
00:39:01,145 --> 00:39:02,765
Ms. Oh.

432
00:39:06,485 --> 00:39:14,350
If the person who killed Kim Hyeon Ho finds out that you were there,

433
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:17,035
you might be in danger, too.

434
00:39:20,065 --> 00:39:23,085
But don't worry too much.

435
00:39:23,085 --> 00:39:27,405
I'll protect you for sure.

436
00:39:27,405 --> 00:39:30,535
I'll make sure you don't get hurt.

437
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,825
As much as you're helping me,

438
00:39:32,825 --> 00:39:35,385
I will do my best to helpâ€”

439
00:39:37,995 --> 00:39:40,095
What's wrong?

440
00:39:40,095 --> 00:39:42,275
Your face is turning red.

441
00:39:42,955 --> 00:39:44,845
You look like you have a fever...

442
00:39:46,265 --> 00:39:49,265
Gosh, what are you doing right now?

443
00:39:49,265 --> 00:39:53,735
Do all NIS agents... Do they all do this?

444
00:39:53,735 --> 00:39:56,395
- What did I do? 
 - Get a grip!

445
00:39:56,395 --> 00:39:58,025
You're a teacher, and I'm a student!

446
00:39:58,025 --> 00:40:00,125
No, I'm a student, and you're a student!

447
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:01,695
What?

448
00:40:01,695 --> 00:40:03,525
What?

449
00:40:03,525 --> 00:40:05,445
Anyway.

450
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:09,345
Don't you say such things with that face of yours.

451
00:40:09,345 --> 00:40:12,205
You should really be more careful.

452
00:40:17,695 --> 00:40:20,135
Why does she keep doing that?

453
00:40:24,235 --> 00:40:25,985
Face of mine?

454
00:40:40,335 --> 00:40:42,805
Thanks for the information.

455
00:40:42,805 --> 00:40:45,315
I bet he's completely in the dark.

456
00:40:46,435 --> 00:40:50,785
But I couldn't do anything about Kim Hyeon Ho.

457
00:40:50,785 --> 00:40:55,135
He was just so arrogant.

458
00:41:09,465 --> 00:41:11,685
 Hello. 

459
00:41:20,135 --> 00:41:22,525
 You have such a kind face. 

460
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:26,555
 Who could've guessed that such a kind security guard 

461
00:41:26,555 --> 00:41:28,695
 would turn out to be like this? 

462
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:36,295
 Why did you do it? 

463
00:41:36,295 --> 00:41:39,180
 Why did you send that letter to Jeong Hae Seong? 

464
00:41:39,775 --> 00:41:41,585
   

465
00:41:44,675 --> 00:41:47,315
   

466
00:41:47,315 --> 00:41:49,815
 I thought it over, 

467
00:41:49,815 --> 00:41:52,325
 and realized I should let him know 

468
00:41:52,325 --> 00:41:56,245
 how Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon went missing. 

469
00:41:58,995 --> 00:42:01,695
 The mission from 22 years ago. 

470
00:42:01,695 --> 00:42:05,635
 You're not the only ones who know about it. 

471
00:42:05,635 --> 00:42:08,475
 Do you think Jeong Hae Seong will believe you? 

472
00:42:09,615 --> 00:42:12,515
 I'll need to show him believable evidence. 

473
00:42:12,515 --> 00:42:16,685
 Such as Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon's notebook. 

474
00:42:16,685 --> 00:42:19,855
 It will be of great help to Agent Jeong Hae Seong. 

475
00:42:19,855 --> 00:42:23,265
 The answer to the Seo Byeong Mun riddle is in it. 

476
00:42:27,975 --> 00:42:31,345
 Let your contact at NIS know. 

477
00:42:31,345 --> 00:42:34,835
 Your previous failed attempt to find the gold. 

478
00:42:34,835 --> 00:42:36,355
 You'll fail again. 

479
00:42:36,355 --> 00:42:38,335
 Kim Hyeon Ho. 

480
00:42:39,175 --> 00:42:41,425
 Why are you speaking so casually to me? 

481
00:42:49,155 --> 00:42:52,255
 See you at... 

482
00:42:52,255 --> 00:42:54,135
 school... 

483
00:42:54,835 --> 00:42:57,775
 No more murders allowed? 

484
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:01,045
 Are we at a scavenger hunt on a field trip? 

485
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:02,765
 Or... 

486
00:43:02,765 --> 00:43:05,795
 are you getting sentimental 

487
00:43:05,795 --> 00:43:08,415
 because you used to work together? 

488
00:43:10,905 --> 00:43:15,925
 Once Jeong Hae Seong meets up with his father's 

489
00:43:15,925 --> 00:43:19,075
 old colleague and learns the truth about him, 

490
00:43:20,635 --> 00:43:23,385
 you think you'll be all right? 

491
00:43:36,675 --> 00:43:39,535
 A minor delay... 

492
00:43:40,395 --> 00:43:43,875
 would've ruined the whole plan. 

493
00:43:55,725 --> 00:43:58,245
 I'll pretend you thanked me. 

494
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:10,340
   

495
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:13,925
 The third urban legend... 

496
00:45:13,925 --> 00:45:16,295
 is a piano that plays by itself. 

497
00:45:40,335 --> 00:45:42,755
 The president of the piano club 

498
00:45:42,755 --> 00:45:45,715
 and his duet partner. 

499
00:46:02,115 --> 00:46:06,755
 The girl learned that she was pregnant 

500
00:46:06,755 --> 00:46:09,735
 and told him about it, 

501
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:17,555
 but his response was ice cold. 

502
00:46:29,305 --> 00:46:32,345
 Completely hopeless, 

503
00:46:32,345 --> 00:46:34,915
 she chose death, 

504
00:46:34,915 --> 00:46:37,945
 and the piano in the Byeongmun music room... 

505
00:47:26,085 --> 00:47:27,995
What the heck!

506
00:47:29,425 --> 00:47:31,345
What is this notebook?

507
00:47:31,345 --> 00:47:35,175
- Why is it so scary? 
 - You're scarier!

508
00:47:37,655 --> 00:47:41,035
A key to King Gojong's gold bars...

509
00:47:41,035 --> 00:47:43,065
The third school urban legend...

510
00:47:43,065 --> 00:47:44,795
A piano that plays by itself.

511
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:49,625
Do you know where they keep the grand piano?

512
00:47:53,725 --> 00:47:57,745
No idea. I haven't been here too long.

513
00:47:59,575 --> 00:48:01,245
Grand piano...

514
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:03,945
From the 1950s?

515
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:10,845
 I think I saw it in the chairwoman's office 

516
00:48:10,845 --> 00:48:13,855
 when I met with Tae Su's and Dong Min's parents. 

517
00:48:15,395 --> 00:48:19,615
It'll be tricky to get into the chairwoman's office.

518
00:48:19,615 --> 00:48:24,695
The building itself is often closed, and security guards are posted inside.

519
00:48:24,695 --> 00:48:27,295
When do they open the building?

520
00:48:27,295 --> 00:48:29,815
When do they open it?

521
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,845
There's a perfect day.

522
00:48:32,845 --> 00:48:35,195
   

523
00:48:36,665 --> 00:48:39,445
As you all know, the special night is here.

524
00:48:39,445 --> 00:48:41,195
Night of Byeongmun.

525
00:48:41,195 --> 00:48:46,515
Not only the alumni, guests from politics, law, and business will be present.

526
00:48:46,515 --> 00:48:49,765
I ask that all the Student Council members attend.

527
00:48:51,545 --> 00:48:54,095
This is going to be tough for Hae Seong.

528
00:48:54,095 --> 00:48:55,355
Huh? Why?

529
00:48:55,355 --> 00:48:57,675
It's not an event just anyone can attend.

530
00:48:57,675 --> 00:49:00,775
Especially if you have more than 20 demerits.

531
00:49:01,675 --> 00:49:03,395
I don't understand.

532
00:49:03,395 --> 00:49:05,235
Why would I have 20 demerits...

533
00:49:05,235 --> 00:49:07,645
For skipping school last time.

534
00:49:08,385 --> 00:49:10,775
- How many demerits do you have? 
 - 19.

535
00:49:10,775 --> 00:49:12,855
You can't just drop this on me.

536
00:49:12,855 --> 00:49:14,675
You should have told me in advance!

537
00:49:14,675 --> 00:49:16,365
Haven't you read the student handbook?

538
00:49:16,365 --> 00:49:18,865
It's all in there. Take a look.

539
00:49:19,705 --> 00:49:21,935
Have you all read it?

540
00:49:32,055 --> 00:49:34,415
You said you would help me.

541
00:49:34,415 --> 00:49:36,995
Full demerit points for skipping school?

542
00:49:36,995 --> 00:49:40,145
You're the one who skipped school. Why blame me?

543
00:49:40,145 --> 00:49:42,965
Plus, just because I said I'd help,

544
00:49:42,965 --> 00:49:46,855
I can't give you 10 demerits instead of 20.

545
00:49:46,855 --> 00:49:50,475
Rules are rules.

546
00:49:50,475 --> 00:49:53,385
Since when were you so good at following rules?

547
00:49:54,475 --> 00:49:57,855
Look at how you speak to me...

548
00:49:58,775 --> 00:50:00,735
How old are you?

549
00:50:03,145 --> 00:50:05,495
Why must we talk about our age?

550
00:50:05,495 --> 00:50:09,415
- You're definitely a noona to me. Open upâ€” 
 - Hey!

551
00:50:13,015 --> 00:50:14,885
Go.

552
00:50:14,885 --> 00:50:17,335
Gosh, so pretty.

553
00:50:19,375 --> 00:50:21,725
Anyway, the situation is looking rough.

554
00:50:21,725 --> 00:50:24,905
Find a solution by tomorrow, and we'll meet again.

555
00:50:29,195 --> 00:50:31,735
Wow, he's so precise.

556
00:50:31,735 --> 00:50:33,355
Bowing before leaving...

557
00:50:33,355 --> 00:50:35,385
Wow, really...

558
00:50:36,685 --> 00:50:40,435
He looks like an oppa. How dare he call me noona?

559
00:50:40,435 --> 00:50:43,115
How do I revenge him for this insult?

560
00:50:44,755 --> 00:50:45,995
   

561
00:50:59,415 --> 00:51:01,725
Hae Seong,

562
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:05,915
didn't you think about letting them know before skipping?

563
00:51:05,915 --> 00:51:10,685
I needed time to collect myself.

564
00:51:10,685 --> 00:51:14,645
I had no idea that skipping means 20 demerits.

565
00:51:14,645 --> 00:51:16,415
This is bad.

566
00:51:16,415 --> 00:51:20,825
This is the only chance at the chairwoman's room.

567
00:51:20,825 --> 00:51:23,645
There is a way.

568
00:51:27,265 --> 00:51:28,965
Ms. Oh.

569
00:51:29,765 --> 00:51:31,555
Let me introduce myself officially.

570
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:34,915
I'm Oh Su Ah, Byeongmun's Korean history teacher.

571
00:51:34,915 --> 00:51:36,515
Yu Jeong's father.

572
00:51:36,515 --> 00:51:38,775
We've met before.

573
00:51:40,065 --> 00:51:44,175
Ms. Oh, sorry about last time...

574
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:48,275
   

575
00:51:50,055 --> 00:51:52,495
Open call for Byeongmun High's ad model?

576
00:51:52,495 --> 00:51:56,185
You will get 25 reward points if you get selected.

577
00:51:56,185 --> 00:52:01,175
Five extra points on top of canceling out your demerits.

578
00:52:02,425 --> 00:52:04,335
You have a point.

579
00:52:04,895 --> 00:52:07,495
But why are you showing me this?

580
00:52:12,355 --> 00:52:14,015
Gosh.

581
00:52:14,015 --> 00:52:17,255
No. This is nonsense.

582
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:20,815
This is not it.

583
00:52:20,815 --> 00:52:24,215
At my age, I can't do this with those kids. How embarrassing.

584
00:52:26,625 --> 00:52:29,135
I even danced that one time!

585
00:52:29,135 --> 00:52:31,375
I'm shy.

586
00:52:33,895 --> 00:52:35,985
I absolutely won't do this. I will not.

587
00:52:35,985 --> 00:52:38,125
I made myself clear.

588
00:52:44,825 --> 00:52:46,705
I won't do it.

589
00:53:06,325 --> 00:53:08,405
Let's go.

590
00:53:12,375 --> 00:53:14,515
Hurry.

591
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:25,355
 Okay. 

592
00:53:25,355 --> 00:53:27,425
 One, two, three. 

593
00:53:39,175 --> 00:53:41,895
Must they go all out?

594
00:53:42,455 --> 00:53:45,505
I've never been to an ad shoot, either.

595
00:53:50,815 --> 00:53:53,155
Okay.

596
00:53:55,255 --> 00:53:57,845
- You're here. 
 - Hello...

597
00:53:58,795 --> 00:54:00,525
Isn't that Ms. Kim Ri An?

598
00:54:00,525 --> 00:54:04,755
I had no idea either, but Ms. Ri An is at a professional level.

599
00:54:04,755 --> 00:54:08,965
Apparently, Ms. Ri An shot all past models.

600
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:16,015
Stop nodding and head over to Ms. Ri An.

601
00:54:16,015 --> 00:54:17,765
Go and change! Now!

602
00:54:17,765 --> 00:54:19,955
Come on!

603
00:54:24,205 --> 00:54:25,835
Relax.

604
00:54:25,835 --> 00:54:29,025
- Let's start with a slight smile. 
 - Yes.

605
00:54:29,025 --> 00:54:30,735
Slight.

606
00:54:30,735 --> 00:54:32,805
Smile.

607
00:54:34,475 --> 00:54:36,975
Relax your mouth.

608
00:54:36,975 --> 00:54:38,985
Smile.

609
00:54:41,295 --> 00:54:44,235
Relax your shoulders.

610
00:54:44,235 --> 00:54:45,815
Am I tense?

611
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:47,565
What's with his facial expression?

612
00:54:47,565 --> 00:54:48,915
He's usually good-looking.

613
00:54:48,915 --> 00:54:50,865
His body is so tense.

614
00:54:50,865 --> 00:54:53,065
He looks awkward.

615
00:54:53,065 --> 00:54:55,475
 Come on. You know how to relax. 

616
00:54:55,475 --> 00:54:57,665
 You can do it. 

617
00:54:57,665 --> 00:54:59,215
Just a moment.

618
00:54:59,215 --> 00:55:00,555
Okay.

619
00:55:02,955 --> 00:55:04,885
What do we do?

620
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:06,505
This won't work.

621
00:55:06,505 --> 00:55:10,125
He's like a log of wood. I can't use any of this.

622
00:55:11,095 --> 00:55:13,075
He won't make it.

623
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:18,295
All right.

624
00:55:19,125 --> 00:55:20,875
 Time for this guy. 

625
00:55:20,875 --> 00:55:23,965
 A former kid model. 

626
00:55:34,705 --> 00:55:36,015
 Hyeon Jun's up. 

627
00:55:36,015 --> 00:55:38,365
 I love it, Hyeon Jun. Good. 

628
00:55:38,365 --> 00:55:40,555
 Look at his body. 

629
00:55:40,555 --> 00:55:42,625
 So cool. Love it. 

630
00:55:42,625 --> 00:55:43,945
 Love it, Hyeon Jun. 

631
00:55:43,945 --> 00:55:46,825
It's clear he's modeled before.

632
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:49,655
He'll probably win.

633
00:55:49,655 --> 00:55:51,115
What?

634
00:55:55,775 --> 00:55:59,725
Let's take a ten.

635
00:55:59,725 --> 00:56:01,575
Hey.

636
00:56:01,575 --> 00:56:04,375
We're not here to take passport photos.

637
00:56:04,375 --> 00:56:05,945
Smile nicely.

638
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,785
I'm trying my best.

639
00:56:07,785 --> 00:56:09,805
 Sexier. 

640
00:56:09,805 --> 00:56:12,605
- Water, water. 
 - Get Dong Min water.

641
00:56:12,605 --> 00:56:15,405
I'm better than them, though.

642
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:17,300
Apples to apples.

643
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:18,600
One, two...

644
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,215
Okay. Love it.

645
00:56:28,755 --> 00:56:33,365
All right. Watch me closely from now on.

646
00:56:37,245 --> 00:56:40,685
First, second, third.

647
00:56:40,685 --> 00:56:42,975
Byeongmun High.

648
00:56:44,115 --> 00:56:45,995
Come to Byeongmun High!

649
00:56:45,995 --> 00:56:47,425
What are you doing right now?

650
00:56:47,425 --> 00:56:50,525
Watch and remember.

651
00:56:50,525 --> 00:56:53,145
Come to Byeongmun High.

652
00:56:55,735 --> 00:56:57,835
I love your face right now.

653
00:56:57,835 --> 00:57:00,515
Stay like that. Okay.

654
00:57:00,515 --> 00:57:01,555
One...

655
00:57:01,555 --> 00:57:03,595
One, two, three.

656
00:57:05,225 --> 00:57:07,515
Right. Come.

657
00:57:07,515 --> 00:57:10,125
Wow, look at this. Look.

658
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:13,475
Look. Much better than before.

659
00:57:14,145 --> 00:57:17,015
So natural.

660
00:57:17,015 --> 00:57:18,665
Good, right?

661
00:57:18,665 --> 00:57:20,315
You got this, right?

662
00:57:21,635 --> 00:57:24,035
Look. Just this feeling.

663
00:57:24,035 --> 00:57:27,645
Go with that. Just like this.

664
00:57:27,645 --> 00:57:29,430
- You can do it. 
 - Got it.

665
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:30,890
Okay?

666
00:57:35,725 --> 00:57:38,315
- Do you feel relaxed after the break? 
 - Yes.

667
00:57:38,315 --> 00:57:40,885
Let's try again.

668
00:57:40,885 --> 00:57:44,355
All right, with a slight smile.

669
00:57:44,355 --> 00:57:46,565
Just like that.

670
00:57:48,645 --> 00:57:50,375
What?

671
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:52,305
All right.

672
00:57:53,345 --> 00:57:55,145
With a slight smile.

673
00:57:55,145 --> 00:57:57,165
Just like that.

674
00:57:59,035 --> 00:58:00,415
 He's doing well. 

675
00:58:00,415 --> 00:58:03,365
Take off your jacket.

676
00:58:03,365 --> 00:58:04,845
Jacket?

677
00:58:04,845 --> 00:58:07,705
All right. Let's go.

678
00:58:10,285 --> 00:58:12,625
Looking great!

679
00:58:15,835 --> 00:58:18,255
Wow! Looking good!

680
00:58:18,255 --> 00:58:21,315
He's a beast!

681
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:26,855
Undo your tie and buttons. Show your beast side.

682
00:58:28,955 --> 00:58:30,935
Good! Love it.

683
00:58:30,935 --> 00:58:33,125
Shatter the lens!

684
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:35,535
Shatter it!

685
00:58:35,535 --> 00:58:37,515
Okay!

686
00:58:38,135 --> 00:58:39,785
Great work.

687
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,535
Good job.

688
00:58:44,535 --> 00:58:47,785
Next, Ye Na. Let's go.

689
00:58:48,615 --> 00:58:51,605
Hae Seong, you were great.

690
00:58:51,605 --> 00:58:53,245
Did something happen during the break?

691
00:58:53,245 --> 00:58:54,605
How come you got so good all of a sudden?

692
00:58:54,605 --> 00:58:56,915
I got a one-on-one lesson.

693
00:59:02,795 --> 00:59:04,995
I said I don't want to.

694
00:59:04,995 --> 00:59:07,595
I won't roll up my sleeves. Just take the photos.

695
00:59:07,595 --> 00:59:09,245
This is enough.

696
00:59:09,245 --> 00:59:12,315
Everyone else looks relaxed in their photos.

697
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:14,925
I'm worried you'll look all tense. Let's roll up your sleeves just for one or two.

698
00:59:14,925 --> 00:59:17,545
I said I don't want to multiple times. I don't want to.

699
00:59:17,545 --> 00:59:20,455
Why do you keep nagging me? I said I don't want to!

700
00:59:29,225 --> 00:59:31,385
Ye Na, are you in pain?

701
00:59:31,385 --> 00:59:33,065
I'm sorry.

702
00:59:36,385 --> 00:59:40,855
Ms. Kim, I accidentally hurt Ye Na earlier.

703
00:59:40,855 --> 00:59:43,425
Can we go to the nurse's office?

704
00:59:43,425 --> 00:59:46,625
Oh, s-sure. Sure, sure.

705
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:48,065
Let's go.

706
01:00:08,195 --> 01:00:09,505
It's okay.

707
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:11,745
I'm fine, so go.

708
01:00:13,435 --> 01:00:17,655
Is your wrist still like that?

709
01:00:19,485 --> 01:00:22,585
 Ye Na, the P.E. teacher said... 

710
01:00:26,775 --> 01:00:29,075
 Hey, what's this? 

711
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:37,325
I told you never to bring it up again.

712
01:00:37,325 --> 01:00:39,125
I'm sorry.

713
01:00:39,125 --> 01:00:42,515
- As your friend, I was just worried... 
 - Friend?

714
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:45,595
Hey, An Yu Jeong.

715
01:00:45,595 --> 01:00:47,695
Have some morals.

716
01:00:47,695 --> 01:00:49,965
You're not my friend.

717
01:00:49,965 --> 01:00:53,145
Do you think we're alike from a few hangouts?

718
01:00:53,145 --> 01:00:55,945
I'm sick of fakes like you playing innocent.

719
01:00:55,945 --> 01:00:57,665
 Hey, Lee Ye Na. 

720
01:01:00,405 --> 01:01:02,225
Apologize to her.

721
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:05,065
- What if I can't? 
 - Apologize.

722
01:01:05,065 --> 01:01:07,755
You're hilarious.

723
01:01:07,755 --> 01:01:10,235
- Who are you to each other? 
 - Stop it. Go inside.

724
01:01:10,235 --> 01:01:11,725
Stop what?

725
01:01:11,725 --> 01:01:14,595
Don't you feel disrespected hearing that?

726
01:01:17,775 --> 01:01:21,085
Hey, An Yu Jeong. You're incredible.

727
01:01:21,085 --> 01:01:23,415
You lied to my face about this?

728
01:01:23,415 --> 01:01:24,705
Ye Na, you're misunderstanding.

729
01:01:24,705 --> 01:01:26,505
We're not like that. No way.

730
01:01:26,505 --> 01:01:28,505
So despicable.

731
01:01:29,265 --> 01:01:31,755
I really hate you.

732
01:01:36,055 --> 01:01:38,915
An Yu Jeong, we need to talk.

733
01:01:39,995 --> 01:01:42,925
Do you think I was joking?

734
01:01:42,925 --> 01:01:45,675
I told you not to meddle!

735
01:01:50,055 --> 01:01:52,405
Later, not right now.

736
01:01:56,855 --> 01:01:59,975
Let's talk after the photoshoot.

737
01:02:06,665 --> 01:02:10,305
I was watching just before you butted in.

738
01:02:10,305 --> 01:02:13,395
You're clueless about high school girls.

739
01:02:13,395 --> 01:02:16,145
What am I clueless about?

740
01:02:16,145 --> 01:02:19,485
To Yu Jeong, you're family.

741
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:24,435
No high school girl wants her brother

742
01:02:24,435 --> 01:02:28,355
to meddle between her and her friend.

743
01:02:28,355 --> 01:02:30,185
I understand, but...

744
01:02:30,185 --> 01:02:34,275
But how can I stand back and watch when she is talking to her like that?

745
01:02:34,275 --> 01:02:39,595
Friendships are much more complex and sensitive than we think,

746
01:02:39,595 --> 01:02:42,355
and need time on their own.

747
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:45,085
Plus, you know this.

748
01:02:45,085 --> 01:02:49,425
You'll only be here temporarily, but Yu Jeong is here to stay.

749
01:02:49,425 --> 01:02:52,625
Yu Jeong has to continue seeing her friends.

750
01:02:52,625 --> 01:02:55,685
At least for another year, maybe more.

751
01:02:55,685 --> 01:03:00,665
So, until Yu Jeong brings it up,

752
01:03:00,665 --> 01:03:02,645
you should stand back and watch.

753
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:04,405
From my perspective,

754
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:08,405
that's how you can help her.

755
01:03:08,405 --> 01:03:10,375
This is difficult.

756
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:12,725
You thought it would be easy?

757
01:03:12,725 --> 01:03:16,045
All right. Bite your tongue and stick it through.

758
01:03:29,225 --> 01:03:33,975
 Wow, what do we do with this idiot? 

759
01:03:33,975 --> 01:03:38,705
 I told you it's spelled "hye" and not "hae." 

760
01:03:38,705 --> 01:03:41,705
 I told you so many times! 

761
01:03:42,585 --> 01:03:44,225
 Korean is really hard. 

762
01:03:44,225 --> 01:03:46,295
 You thought it was easy? 

763
01:03:46,295 --> 01:03:48,945
 Bite your tongue and stick it through! 

764
01:03:51,535 --> 01:03:53,265
 Again! 

765
01:03:53,265 --> 01:03:55,865
 It's hye, in "eunhye"! 

766
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:00,345
Why are you smiling all of a sudden?

767
01:04:01,515 --> 01:04:03,575
I'm just reminded of someone.

768
01:04:07,195 --> 01:04:09,475
Your first love?

769
01:04:11,885 --> 01:04:13,575
What?

770
01:04:13,575 --> 01:04:15,435
Who?

771
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:17,005
Who is it?

772
01:04:17,005 --> 01:04:18,715
Just somebody.

773
01:04:20,995 --> 01:04:23,525
So, who is it?

774
01:04:23,525 --> 01:04:24,745
Tell me.

775
01:04:24,745 --> 01:04:26,375
Gosh, you don't need to know.

776
01:04:26,375 --> 01:04:30,535
Just tell me. I can't sleep when I'm curious about something.

777
01:04:32,345 --> 01:04:35,045
Huh? It's raining.

778
01:04:38,955 --> 01:04:41,235
Oh Bong Ja. Umbrella.

779
01:04:41,235 --> 01:04:43,445
Don't call me by that name!

780
01:04:43,445 --> 01:04:45,275
Just a moment.

781
01:04:46,225 --> 01:04:49,025
Don't call me that!

782
01:04:49,025 --> 01:04:50,255
Only one umbrella?

783
01:04:50,255 --> 01:04:51,865
I'm quick, huh?

784
01:04:51,865 --> 01:04:53,195
Go already.

785
01:04:53,195 --> 01:04:54,815
What?

786
01:04:57,215 --> 01:04:58,915
Fine, fine.

787
01:04:58,915 --> 01:05:00,395
You...

788
01:05:05,325 --> 01:05:07,655
Sorry, we only have one umbrella.

789
01:05:07,655 --> 01:05:10,005
Should we go? Where do you live?

790
01:05:13,595 --> 01:05:17,565
â™«  I'm in love with you  â™«

 â™«  My Love is only you  â™«

804
01:08:48,445 --> 01:08:51,100
I'll come find you soon.

01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:21,375
 - I'll do it! 
 - There you go, Ms. Oh Su Ah! 

810
01:09:21,375 --> 01:09:22,485
 Our wild card! 

811
01:09:22,485 --> 01:09:25,265
 You're going rogue... Stay put. 

812
01:09:25,265 --> 01:09:27,275
 I feel weird today. Get a grip. 

813
01:09:27,275 --> 01:09:29,105
 Coming in without a warning? 

814
01:09:29,105 --> 01:09:32,275
 Start the mission at 20:00 tomorrow with the event. 

815
01:09:32,275 --> 01:09:35,875
 The moment the chairwoman steps away will be our one and only opportunity. 

816
01:09:35,875 --> 01:09:38,815
 - Cheers!  
  - You know today is important, right? 

817
01:09:38,815 --> 01:09:40,415
 Will I able to do it, right? 

818
01:09:40,415 --> 01:09:41,985
 What? 

819
01:09:41,985 --> 01:09:44,695
 Get out of there, Hae Seong. It's dangerous to stay there. 

820
01:09:44,695 --> 01:09:46,215
 I'll make sure everything is okay. 

821
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:47,825
 Don't worry. And... 

822
01:09:47,825 --> 01:09:50,275
   

823
01:09:50,275 --> 01:09:52,095
