1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,340
   

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,090
So who is it? Tell me.

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,610
Gosh, you don't need to know.

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,870
Don't be like that. Just tell me. I can't sleep when I'm curious about something.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,310
Oh? It's raining.

6
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,510
Oh Bong Ja. Umbrella.

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,710
Don't call me by that name!

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,550
Just a moment.

9
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,340
Mom, I'm not Bong Ja anymore!

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,530
Only one umbrella?

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,080
Because I'm quick, right?

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,470
He's waiting. Go already.

13
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,050
What?

14
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,170
Fine, fine.

15
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,850
What are you talking about?

16
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,870
Sorry, we only have one umbrella.

17
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,380
Should we go? Where do you live?

18
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,040
â™«  I'm in love with you  â™«

19
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,280
â™«  Feel my heart, love you most forever  â™«

20
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,860
â™«  Your touch makes me fall for you, hold together  â™«

21
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,840
â™«  I'm in love with you  â™«

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,090
â™«  Feel the glow, as we shine forever  â™«

23
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:23,710
â™«  Your soft hands make me dream of you  â™«

24
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,420
â™«  My love is only you  â™«

25
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,510
Are you crazy?

26
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,190
Is your name Bong Ja?

27
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,140
Oh Bong Ja?

28
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,540
Yeah, that's my birth name.

29
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,550
But why are you laughing at my name?

30
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,820
No, no, you misunderstand.

31
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,630
I know my name is a little retro,

32
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,950
but it's rude to laugh in my face like that.

33
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,570
I was going to walk you home, but never mind.

34
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,100
You can go alone!

35
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,080
â™«  ....makes me feel whole  â™«

36
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,050
â™«  I'm in love with you  â™«

37
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,290
â™«  Feel my heart, love you most forever  â™«

38
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:15,840
â™«  Your touch makes me fall for you, hold together  â™«

39
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,840
â™«  I'm in love with you  â™«

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,080
â™«  Feel the glow, as we shine forever  â™«

41
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,680
â™«  Your soft hands make me dream of you  â™«

42
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,430
â™«  My love is only you  â™«

43
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,150
Why did you come back?

44
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,500
What did you do with the handsome guy?

45
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,880
What happened?

46
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,570
What, what?

47
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:45,040
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Undercover Love Team ðŸ’– @Viki.com 

48
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,720
   

49
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,300
 Let's get married. 

50
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,560
 You like me, right? 

51
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,350
 I like you, too, so let's get married. 

52
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,470
 You're similar to him. 

53
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,450
 Whom? 

54
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,150
 Someone. My arch-nemesis. 

55
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,670
Was she talking about me?

56
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,080
 Here's a participant list for the Night of Byeongmun. 

57
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,190
We confirmed attendance from all the guests.

58
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,800
And these are parents who are participating in GPA management.

59
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,900
   

60
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,000
   

61
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,630
Mom.

62
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,070
Hey, you're home.

63
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,080
Please tell him that we would like to have a separate tea meeting during the event.

64
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,850
Got it. I'll let them know.

65
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,720
I'll get going.

66
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,800
I heard something happened at school earlier.

67
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,560
When were you going to tell me?

68
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,940
My Ye Na will be the face of the school.

69
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:58,800
How can she put a knife to her own skin?

70
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,100
If people found out...

71
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,650
I would be so...

72
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,930
embarassed.

73
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,270
I'm sorry, Mom.

74
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:22,310
I want you to be a strong person, Ye Na.

75
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,800
Mom!

76
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,180
- Mom! 
 - Even if you self-harm,

77
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,430
you should know nothing will change.

78
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,200
We have an important event coming up.

79
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,670
Since we both slashed ourselves,

80
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,930
and cried,

81
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:52,820
let's... smile now.

82
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,740
Whose daughter are you, Ye Na?

83
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,280
Yours.

84
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,930
Eat.

85
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:38,800
â™«  I didn't mean what I said  â™«

86
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:47,320
â™«  I was afraid my feelings for you would be revealed  â™«

87
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,500
â™«  That's all  â™«

88
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,640
â™«  Why can't you see, my darling  â™«

89
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,960
â™«  I only look at you  â™«

90
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,740
â™«  Please just focus on me, babe  â™«

91
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,820
â™«  You pretend like you don't know  â™«

92
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,700
â™«  I pretend like I don't  â™«

93
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,940
â™«  If only I had been a little more honest  â™«

94
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,110
â™«  Would we be different now?  â™«

95
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,520
â™«  If it's not too late  â™«

96
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,750
What are you doing?

97
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,090
When did you get here?

98
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,570
A while ago.

99
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,130
Then you should've made that known.

100
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,200
Are you usually here so early?

101
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,270
I didn't sleep very well.

102
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,610
I got up early, so I just came.

103
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,540
Is there an issue with the mission?

104
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,760
No, it's not that.

105
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,850
But by any chance...

106
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:54,380
You know your arch-nemesis?

107
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,130
What about him?

108
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,830
Nothing.

109
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:05,960
Why all the cleaning this early? I thought the cleaning lady did it.

110
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,750
This is all an investment in myself.

111
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:15,030
Who knows? Someone might post a picture of my love for the school online.

112
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:19,130
It'd all count when I'm trying to become a full-time teacher.

113
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,250
- You work hard. 
 - Right?

114
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,370
I work really hard.

115
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,140
It's cool.

116
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,270
You'll definitely make a full-time teacher.

117
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,090
I'll be rooting for you.

118
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,040
Coming in without warning?

119
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:48,470
â™«  Like a flower blooming softly when you smile  â™«

120
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,600
â™«  I finally found you  â™«

121
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,590
â™«  I assure you that my love can't be undone now  â™«

122
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:01,680
â™«  So until the days run out of time  â™«

123
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,640
Is something wrong at home?

124
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,040
Why are you so serious?

125
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,770
â™«  I will come...  â™«

126
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,620
Ms. Ri An.

127
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,420
I'm asking for a friend.

128
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:20,610
On a rainy day, this guy just embraced my friend like this.

129
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,590
To get her away from a motorcycle.

130
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,550
Is your friend's name Oh Su Ah?

131
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,000
No.

132
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,640
Listen to me.

133
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,450
Then he keeps telling her words of encouragement.

134
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,030
"You work hard."

135
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,840
"It's cool." Stuff like that.

136
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,000
What is this?

137
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,090
That's a green light, right?

138
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,720
What is the relationship between him and your friend?

139
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,650
They know each other.

140
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,080
There have been some incidents, but...

141
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,800
So it's not flirting. They just know each other.

142
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,880
It's nothing.

143
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,580
Ms. Oh.

144
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,410
I mean, your friend.

145
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:12,200
People who've never dated anyone should know

146
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,470
not to confuse niceness with interest.

147
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:19,860
I've seen so many who get confused and cry.

148
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:26,110
Please tell your friend to be careful.

149
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,640
Teachers, come over here.

150
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,580
We need to select an ad model for our school.

151
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,060
Take a look at these photos.

152
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,300
Be honest and share your personal opinions.

153
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:54,170
I think Ye Na would be great. What do you all think?

154
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,070
- I also like Ye Na. 
 - Yes, yes.

155
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,030
Then we've decided on the female student.

156
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:02,240
Next, let's select the male student.

157
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,400
I think this photo is so nice. Right?

158
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,500
I don't know whose son this is but very handsome, right?

159
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,520
What do you all think?

160
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,250
If no one objects, Hyeon Jun will be the male modelâ€“

161
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,080
Let's vote!

162
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,320
Let's decide by vote.

163
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,650
Do we really need to vote?

164
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:27,160
They say voting is the flower of democracy.

165
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:32,570
To protect that flower would be to honor our democratic fighters

166
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:36,030
and our duty as their descendants.

167
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:39,570
What's all this grandness? We're picking a model.

168
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:45,950
If we are not prudent, our society could descend into dictatorship again.

169
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:50,790
As a Korean History teacher who advocates learning from the past,

170
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:57,290
I am gravely concerned with this situation.

171
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:01,500
Fine, vote. Let's vote! Do it!

172
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,740
Thank you.

173
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,840
Hurry up! What's taking so long?

174
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,040
I'm done.

175
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,130
Oh, no... 
    

176
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,990
Let's count the votes.

177
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,740
Ji Hyeon Jun.

178
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,760
Jeong Hae Seong.

179
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,430
   

180
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,490
- Ji Hyeon Jun. 
 - That's right!

181
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,920
Jeong Hae Seong.

182
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,290
   

183
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,590
This is the last vote.

184
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,220
Please, please, please...

185
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:08,390
The votes must be counted by now.

186
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:11,340
I'm more nervous than when you hit me.

187
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,050
Hae Seong will win, right?

188
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,950
I had a lucky dream last night.

189
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,070
Hae Seong will win for sure.

190
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,890
Guys! The Byeongmun ad model votes are out!

191
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,910
Hey!

192
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,030
Did you hear?

193
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,180
- Our school's ad models? 
 - Who are they?

194
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,960
Jeong Hae Seong!

195
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,250
Thank God!

196
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,890
Dear Father, thank you!

197
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,020
Oh, yes, yes, Mrs. Ji...

198
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,840
I'm so sorry. I worked very hard, but...

199
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,250
That's right! That's right!

200
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,760
All to the snack bar. My treat! Let's go!

201
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,940
His treat!

202
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,620
Hae Seong!

203
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,340
Hey, let's hit the snack bar later. Sorry.

204
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,080
What? You said you'd treat!

205
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,490
I'm so sorry. Sorry!

206
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,200
Hey!

207
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,510
Where are you going?

208
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,250
- The library. 
 - The library. Okay.

209
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,800
Hey, you're reading a lot of tough books.

210
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,490
That's a first-place student!

211
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,610
It's all required high school reading.

212
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,740
Pick up a book.

213
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,970
Oh, this one?

214
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,850
Why are you following me?

215
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:17,350
I'm not following you. This is on my way.

216
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,690
Even a 5th grader wouldn't be so immature.

217
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,190
Five minutes.

218
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,810
I have to move classrooms, so no more than that.

219
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,670
First of all, I want to apologize to you.

220
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:48,390
Your situation, how you feel,

221
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,270
I butted in without knowing anything.

222
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,940
I'm sorry.

223
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,290
Did someone coach you or something?

224
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,210
Why are you being like this?

225
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,120
It's how I feel.

226
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,020
I...

227
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:09,940
don't want you to get hurt.

228
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,420
Ye Na isn't as bad as you think.

229
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,910
She's having a hard time.

230
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:25,560
I'm the only one who tolerates her while struggling.

231
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,940
She's just taking it out on me.

232
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,360
Don't hate her too much.

233
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,880
Okay.

234
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,640
Five minutes up. I'm leaving.

235
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,920
- Hey. 
  - We looked into the detective on Kim Hyeon Ho. 

236
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,050
 But I need to talk to you in person. 

237
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,950
The bell is ringing! Let's get inside!

238
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,710
Okay!

239
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,760
 Leaving school early. Need your cooperation. 

240
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,580
Geez!

241
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,160
How old is he?

242
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,610
Cooperation, my foot.

243
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:21,090
   

244
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,980
The detective in charge of Kim Hyeon Ho's case,

245
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,030
I looked at all his accounts, real estate... It's spotless.

246
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,240
Then what's so strange?

247
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,590
The detective in charge has a daughter.

248
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,720
She's hospitalized for chronic heart disease

249
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,350
and recently moved to a Byeongmun-owned hospital.

250
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,520
The foundation is paying her hospital bills.

251
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,690
The recommender is Park Jae Moon. Byeongmun High School Principal.

252
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:42,930
The issue is,

253
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:47,260
why would the principal suddenly help out someone he barely even knows?

254
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,210
Probably to cover up that he's the culprit.

255
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:54,380
By concluding Kim Hyeon Ho's death as a suicide.

256
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,290
The office in the basement of the old building.

257
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,900
It belonged to my dad, not the chairwoman.

258
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,430
At first, I doubted she was looking for the gold,

259
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:15,900
or thought she may have found it already.

260
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,530
If Park Jae Moon tried to steal the notebook,

261
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,440
the chairwoman must still be looking for the gold.

262
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,020
I think we can be certain of that.

263
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,550
This is just a possibility, Sunbae,

264
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:37,090
but maybe Seo Myeong Ju is also involved in your father going missing.

265
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,460
We'll find out soon enough.

266
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,260
   

267
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,000
For now, let's focus on the third urban legend.

268
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,060
- Mi Jeong. 
 - Yes.

269
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:15,960
I compared Byeongmun's original official song to the one you recorded, Sunbae.

270
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,910
As you can see, even though it's the same song, their waveforms are different.

271
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,870
The keyboard has far more keys and a wider range.

272
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:27,970
The one you recorded, unlike the original song, was played by four hands.

273
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,950
Four hands ensemble.

274
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,140
Two people playing the school song together.

275
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:37,010
When they finish playing, the clue for the final urban legend will appear.

276
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,400
Who knows how to play the piano?

277
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,490
I knew the conversation was going too smoothly.

278
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:53,840
What was the use of going into her office, then?

279
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,370
You guys!

280
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,880
What are you going to do about this?

281
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,000
I'll take care of it!

282
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,700
Ms. Oh?

283
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,110
You keep making declarations before coming in.

284
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,770
It looks cool.

285
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,120
I heard everything you were saying from outside.

286
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,220
   

287
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,590
Czerny? The one after Beyer?

288
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:22,630
Our school's song isn't too difficult.

289
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:27,080
With a few hours of practice, even shitty hands can play it, no problem.

290
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,240
Wait a minute.

291
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,320
This isn't a child's play.

292
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,470
What if you get caught in the chairwoman's room?

293
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,890
Then you'll get fired!

294
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,100
Really?

295
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,900
- Then, I won't do it. 
 - What?

296
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,400
- That's a twist. 
 - Good thinking.

297
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,180
- Then let's continue the meetingâ€” 
 - Wait.

298
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,250
- Let's have her do it. 
 - What?

299
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,060
A twist on a twist?

300
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,760
This is a secret. We can't get outside help.

301
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,150
For now, Ms. Oh is our best option.

302
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:04,650
I'm sorry, but I don't want to.

303
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,300
No.

304
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,320
Only you can do this, Ms. Oh.

305
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:16,140
Ms. Oh, you are an invaluable partner to NIS' best agent, Jeong Hae Seong,

306
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:21,650
as well as an honorary agent of Domestic Team 4.

307
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,640
An honorary...

308
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,900
agent?

309
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,160
What are you saying...

310
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,670
What are you talking about?

311
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:35,000
I'll do it.

312
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,350
As an honorary agent.

313
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,460
That's Ms. Oh Su Ah!

314
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,400
She's our team's wild card.

315
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,490
Are you crazy?

316
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:53,240
Instead... promise me one thing.

317
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,640
   

318
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,390
   

319
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,290
I love it!

320
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,410
One second.

321
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,230
Come outside.

322
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,710
I'm not telling you twice. Don't do this.

323
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:41,340
- Why not? 
 - Because it's dangerous!

324
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,970
What kind of question is that?

325
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,280
Anyway, you can't do this, Ms. Oh.

326
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:50,920
Everyone is required to be at the event anyway.

327
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:56,390
Now that we are working together, let's focus on the mission from now on.

328
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,650
And this.

329
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:04,540
Why are you so obsessed with being full-time?

330
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,740
Do I need a reason?

331
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:09,190
Of course, an employee wants to be full-time.

332
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,580
You don't risk danger just because of that reason.

333
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,420
Be honest.

334
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,720
I want to prove something to someone.

335
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,330
 I like this. 

336
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,850
She was my first student when I became a teacher.

337
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:56,620
I promised her that I would become a full-time teacher.

338
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:05,140
Gosh... Now, the vibes are weird. I don't like this.

339
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:10,630
Anyway, I need to become a full-time teacher and ready to give everything for it.

340
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,810
So don't stop me.

341
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:17,010
It's not living if you don't risk anything.

342
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,180
Stay by my side.

343
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,880
Gosh, seriously.

344
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,570
Thanks.

345
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,080
I don't think this is right.

346
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,830
 You really don't know anything. 

347
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:47,910
 Are you pretending not to know, or can't you read the room? 

348
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:52,080
 Ms. Oh, do you even care about your class? 

349
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:57,640
She took it so seriously. I feel so bad about that.

350
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,400
No.

351
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,560
Let's not think about this. It happens.

352
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,640
Why am I thinking about this?

353
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,250
   

354
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,500
It's Jeong Hae Seong.

355
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,190
Why are you lowering your voice?

356
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,370
What's going on?

357
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,600
The principal is here! He's in the school library.

358
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:37,730
 The only two who can open the chairwoman's office door 

359
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:41,350
 are Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju and Principal Park Jae Moon. 

360
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:44,600
 Only their fingerprints can open the door. 

361
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:57,560
Hello, Principal.

362
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,910
Oh, hello.

363
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,420
Are you checking out this book?

364
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:13,150
I also came here for this book.

365
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:16,750
Oh, no, what do I do?

366
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:21,680
I really wanted to read this book today...

367
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,390
You can check it out first.

368
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:28,460
Really? Thank you!

369
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,930
Thank you!

370
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,910
What's wrong?

371
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,380
Nothing.

372
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,100
â™«  Sunlight shining down into my heart  â™«

373
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:31,200
â™«  Like a flower blooming softly when you smile  â™«

374
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,200
â™«  I finally found you  â™«

375
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,320
â™«  I assure you that my love can't be undone now  â™«

376
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,870
â™«  So until the days run out of time  â™«

377
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:50,070
â™«  My love is you  â™«

378
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,430
Are you stupid by chance?

379
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,300
Do, sol, do, sol.

380
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,290
Do, sol, do, sol! You can't...

381
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:02,430
You can't remember that?

382
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,050
I'm sorry.

383
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,310
   

384
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:12,390
â™«  With you, oh, yes, with you  â™«

385
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:17,530
â™«  I assure you that my love can't be undone now  â™«

386
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,360
     

387
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:25,090
â™«  This is my love letter to you  â™«

388
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:28,060
 Hello. Asking for a friend. 

389
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:32,280
 He's been acting strange these days. What is wrong with him? 

390
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:38,110
Of course, we will be prepared, but anything could happen once we're inside.

391
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:43,260
When I can't help you, you need to know how to protect yourself.

392
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,190
I know how to throw someone over my shoulder. I also have a gas gun.

393
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:49,110
You can't bring weapons into the event.

394
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:53,190
I'll show you a few things. Watch closely.

395
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,920
Here. If my opponent grabs my shoulder,

396
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:01,870
I take my opposite elbow, put it on top of theirs and twist.

397
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,080
Easy, right? Try it.

398
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,970
- The hand is here. My opposite elbow goes... 
 - Right.

399
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:12,240
- Twist! 
 - W-Wait!

400
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,510
It really works! Okay!

401
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:17,460
Let's try another one.

402
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,560
Let's do a variation.

403
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,670
If my opponent puts their hand on my shoulder,

404
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:25,400
I swing my arm around, and overpower them!

405
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,430
That's it?

406
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:37,580
Okay.

407
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,280
There's something after this, right?

408
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,000
Try getting out!

409
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,980
The class is adjourned for today.

410
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,040
Already?

411
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,390
Don't ask.

412
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:04,100
I'm a little...

413
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,740
complicated. Bye.

414
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,580
- What's wrong with him? 
 - Get it together.

415
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,670
You're acting weird today. Get it together.

416
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,000
Get it together!

417
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,440
Oh, my.

418
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,510
So, this is the National Intelligence Service?

419
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:39,750
As you are an honorary agent, Ms. Oh,

420
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,300
we wanted to bring you into the office.

421
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,510
Oh, thank you.

422
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,040
- We got rid of the shop. 
 - What?

423
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,680
The owner and his wife had an argument in the US.

424
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,170
They came home early.

425
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:55,030
Why is everything happening so suddenly?

426
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,880
Do you have a cold?

427
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,730
Don't ask. I have a lot on my mind.

428
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,920
Director!

429
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,550
- It's a disaster. 
 - What?

430
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:27,390
A civilian is in Seok Ho's office.

431
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,250
Shouldn't we yell at him?

432
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,530
She's helping with the mission. He told me.

433
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,410
But I'm his direct report. He skipped me?

434
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,080
Want some coffee-flavored milk?

435
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,870
Let's go.

436
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:49,670
- Let's go. 
 - That An Seok Ho...

437
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,500
The event takes place in the ballroom on the first floor.

438
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,920
The office where we must go and solve the third urban legend

439
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,730
is here on the third floor of the annex.

440
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:04,380
 It's a special day when the annex will be open, 

441
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,970
 but if you're not on the list, you cannot enter. 

442
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:12,880
Hae Seong and Ms. Oh Su Ah, it will be difficult with just the two of you.

443
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,360
- Young Hun, get inside the location. 
 - Okay.

444
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,370
 If needed, Mi Jeong and I will be back up. 

445
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:24,380
 But our faces have been revealed to the students so it's safer to be separate from you. 

446
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,460
   

447
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:35,820
 Beware of the CCTV that oversees the annex during the mission. 

448
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:40,310
 Also, the security guards everywhere. 

449
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,590
How will we get to the chairwoman's office?

450
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:48,120
Through the central staircase on the first floor and to the third floor.

451
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,440
The central staircase?

452
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:56,880
Won't it look super suspicious if a teacher and a student sneak upstairs together?

453
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:02,420
- I'll come up with a device to distract everyone. 
 - Yes.

454
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:08,430
Every year, during the event, the chairwoman holds a tea meeting with the parents in the sitting room.

455
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:13,080
This is our only chance...

456
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,600
while she's away.

457
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,090
 There's only one door to the chairwoman's room. 

458
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:22,970
 We have the fingerprint to open the door. 

459
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:27,390
 The moment the door opens, Seo Myeong Ju will be notified, 

460
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:30,690
 and it'll be logged in the server. 

461
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:38,620
 Even if you get to the piano, 

462
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:41,930
 the second they realize there are intruders, 

463
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:47,870
you, Hae Seong, and Ms. Oh, might be kicked out of school.

464
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,340
Pardon?

465
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:56,540
When you're near the door, I will remotely stop the ping to Seo Myong Ju, so don't worry.

466
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:02,130
But you'll need to delete the offline log while you're in the chairwoman's room.

467
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:06,220
It's impossible to fabricate a perfect fingerprint.

468
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,960
But I created an acceptable version.

469
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:16,490
Okay. The mission starts tomorrow at 8:00 p.m. when the event begins.

470
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:20,620
Let's make sure there's no room for mistakes.

471
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,060
   

472
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:37,100
   

473
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,160
Thank you for coming all this way.

474
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,610
- No, there was no traffic. 
 - Oh, I see.

475
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:48,020
Here, have a drink.

476
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,620
- Thank you. 
 - Please, this way.

477
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,460
I'm so bored.

478
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,410
It's no fun when we can't even drink.

479
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:03,950
I smuggled in some liquor. Want some?

480
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:06,510
- Really? 
 - I was joking.

481
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,810
You two complement each other. You know that?

482
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,350
   

483
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,050
By the way,

484
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,300
must we oversee the mission here? Oh!

485
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:32,330
- Do we have to do it here? 
 - It's so cramped.

486
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,570
Other teams' headquarters are in trucks.

487
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:37,440
Hey, hey. The director told us to be grateful

488
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,720
for an old van, when we waste tax money without delivering results.

489
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,620
Aigoo...

490
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,670
Damn!

491
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,290
We will do our best.

492
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:55,390
Remember, today is an important day.

493
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:58,130
An important guest is coming.

494
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:02,810
Be prepared and make sure things go as planned.

495
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:05,210
I will do my best.

496
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,490
Go ahead.

497
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:34,120
I have successfully entered the annex.

498
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:50,670
What's up with you two?

499
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,740
It's nothing.

500
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,730
It's none of your business.

501
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,750
Hi, everyone!

502
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,360
Hae Seong.

503
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,380
You look so cool.

504
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,540
Gosh. Come on.

505
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,770
What's so cool about him?

506
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,240
Wow, he's so cool.

507
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:17,800
When is Ms. Oh Su Ah coming?

508
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,600
 Isn't the guy supposed to propose marriage? 

509
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,700
 Is that right? 

510
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,790
 Then let's just get engaged for now. 

511
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:38,580
 You do it properly later on. 

512
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:43,040
 When I'm wearing a really pretty dress. 

513
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,260
Hi, everyone.

514
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,360
Wow, are you sure you're the Ms. Oh, we know?

515
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,920
You look so pretty.

516
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,950
You all look better. How am I supposed to compete with high schoolers?

517
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,760
What do you think? Do I look okay?

518
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,880
Not so bad.

519
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,570
   

520
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,490
See you later.

521
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:45,030
We'll hear from Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju's opening speech.

522
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,870
   

523
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:50,280
Thank you. I'm Seo Myeong Ju, the chairwoman.

524
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:58,160
We sincerely thank the parents, students,

525
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,230
and alumni for joining us at Night of Byeongmun.

526
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:05,080
 Let me say it again. Listen carefully. 

527
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:10,990
 The moment the chairwoman steps away for the tea meeting, our mission begins. 

528
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:13,650
Why don't we toast to that?

529
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:16,080
Please raise your glasses.

530
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,570
To the esteemed Byeongmun community and our kids.

531
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,630
 Cheers! 

532
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,340
What is he doing, devouring the food?

533
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,970
Gosh...

534
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,300
When did you get that?

535
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,600
I snuck it in earlier. Want some?

536
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,140
How dare you guys...

537
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,920
You're here to work! What the hell!

538
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:12,780
Aigoo, congratulations.

539
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,880
Thank you for coming all this way.

540
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,110
The party is so much better than last year's.

541
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:22,550
Really? I'm glad to hear that. We worked hard on it.

542
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,250
- Hello. 
 - Ye Na.

543
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,440
Ye Na, long time no see.

544
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,370
You look prettier every time I see you.

545
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:30,590
Thank you.

546
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,250
That's what I'm saying.

547
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:35,570
Ye Na is good at studies, pretty, and has a great personality.

548
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:37,480
She is perfect all around.

549
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,450
You must be so proud, Chairwoman.

550
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:43,420
Aigoo, Seung Jae and Young Chae are amazing, too.

551
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,580
In everything...

552
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,230
Are you nervous?

553
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:52,200
Not a lot, just a little.

554
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,980
Come here for a moment.

555
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,300
This is a syringe with a sedative in it.

556
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,030
I'll do my best so you don't need it, but you never know.

557
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,190
Do you think I can handle this?

558
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,450
Turn around.

559
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,840
This is a camera.

560
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,340
Remember what I said before?

561
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:43,010
 I'll protect you for sure. 

562
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:46,090
 I'll make sure you don't get hurt. 

563
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,180
I'll make sure nothing goes wrong today.

564
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,130
Don't worry.

565
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,850
Yes...

566
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:54,620
And...

567
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:58,140
you look pretty today.

568
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:15,050
 What are they doing? 

569
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:17,150
They're young.

570
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:20,730
 Next, a tradition dating back to 1980. 

571
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:24,830
A performance by the Byeongmun Choir, the pride of Byeongmun High,

572
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:27,420
boasting a rich history and tradition.

573
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,420
Shall we step aside now?

574
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,700
Shall we?

575
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,100
Let's head upstairs.

576
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,550
Behave yourself.

577
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,980
Okay, then.

578
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:53,780
Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju is headed upstairs.

579
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,190
 Young Hun, go to the control room now. 

580
00:42:57,770 --> 00:42:59,780
 The moment he kills the cameras, 

581
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,840
 Hae Seong and Ms. Oh, go to the chairwoman's office. 

582
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,800
 It's around three minutes from security to control. 

583
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,170
 You must get into her office before the personnel reaches the control. 

584
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:20,130
Are you okay?

585
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,300
It looks like they are ready.

586
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,070
Let's give them another round of applause.

587
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:26,120
- Here is the performance. 
 - Just a minute.

588
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:44,000
Put this on. It'll help.

589
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,110
Just leave me alone.

590
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:47,970
You're bleeding. Put it on.

591
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:52,690
Ye Na, let's talk...

592
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:57,570
Did you do that again?

593
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:04,590
Seriously, I told you many times to stop this and talk to me.

594
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:06,680
What do you care?

595
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:11,560
- Hey. 
 - Stop meddling and get lost. Don't overstep.

596
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,330
My mom was right.

597
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:17,880
A pet dog thinks she's human.

598
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:22,940
You're my maid, Yu Jeong.

599
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,330
But if you do this to me...

600
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:26,730
I feel so sorry for you.

601
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,090
Really.

602
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:33,080
I feel so sorry for you.

603
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:36,200
- Say that again. 
 - Sure.

604
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,690
I'll say it as many times as it takes.

605
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:41,000
I feel sorry for you.

606
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,340
You act so fearless at school as the president.

607
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,570
When in reality, she...

608
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,850
I don't even know anymore.

609
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:18,180
The next song is the one Byeongmun Choir

610
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:22,150
won the grand prize in a national competition.

611
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:24,480
It's "Bravo My Life."

612
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,340
Let's give them a round of applause!

613
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:42,050
â™«  One afternoon after the sun went down  â™«

614
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:48,100
â™«  On my way home  â™«

615
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:53,900
â™«  My past days are full of regrets  â™«

616
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:58,150
This must be the fine liquor you cherish.

617
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:02,110
The aroma is so nice.

618
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:03,180
Right?

619
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:06,580
The flavor matches your class, Chairwoman.

620
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:10,070
We had to serve something refined for our distinguished guests.

621
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:14,680
But actually, this isn't my most cherished bottle.

622
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:27,030
Founding Chairman Seo Byeong Mun distilled this bottle himself,

623
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:30,460
to commemorate a very important, historical moment.

624
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:36,200
There hasn't been an opportunity to taste it, for better or for worse, so I've inherited it.

625
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:41,130
As for me, once Edu-City is complete,

626
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:43,460
and a new era begins,

627
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:48,830
I look forward to sharing a celebratory glass from this bottle with you all.

628
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:51,710
Wow, that will be a glorious day.

629
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:55,670
I believe our kids are born with potential.

630
00:46:55,670 --> 00:47:01,800
Just as anyone would pick the healthiest dog at the marketplace.

631
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,120
And we're talking about human beings here.

632
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:08,090
So it's best to get the hopeless ones

633
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:11,040
to give up sooner than later.

634
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,110
 Why drag them along, force them to study, 

635
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:18,190
 in the name of equality in process and results? 

636
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:20,800
 I just think that's so wasteful. 

637
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,820
Our nation is lacking in tax revenue as is.

638
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:30,300
A single elite talent can feed countless mouths.

639
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,210
The top 1% of elites lead the world.

640
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:36,940
And my vision is to fill the entirety of that 1%

641
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:40,210
with members of the Byeongmun community.

642
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:45,090
Strong Byeongmun alums that befit this new era.

643
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:47,480
It's so exciting just to hear you speak.

644
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,090
Congratulations on Edu-City in advance.

645
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:52,350
Thank you so much, Yeong Su's mother.

646
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:59,320
 But it may feel like this new era is right within our grasp. 

647
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,850
However, until the finish line,

648
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:04,220
unless we put our energies together

649
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:06,960
dedicating ourselves materially and spiritually,

650
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,300
that era may never come.

651
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:14,540
Until the world of the 1% arrives,

652
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:18,490
please step it up by just 1% each.

653
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:22,500
We will do our best to make your vision come true, Chairwoman.

654
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,230
Thank you so much.

655
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:25,750
Shall we toast to that?

656
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:27,630
Shall we?

657
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,410
All right. To the 1%.

658
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:33,210
To Edu-City.

659
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:36,000
To Byeongmun Foundation.

660
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,140
 Cheers! 

661
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:56,690
Now, shall we discuss our kids' programs now?

662
00:48:56,690 --> 00:49:00,100
My apologies. It was a long introduction.

663
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,740
Principal.

664
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:15,660
â™«  Bravo, bravo  â™«

665
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:19,200
â™«  My life  â™«

666
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:23,700
â™«  For our brilliant future  â™«

667
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,760
 Let's begin if you're ready. 

668
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,420
 Young Hun. 

669
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,370
I got to the control room.

670
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:32,120
What about Hae Seong and Ms. Oh Su Ah?

671
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,980
We're ready.

672
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:36,510
 Good. 

673
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:37,650
Let's do this.

674
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:40,170
Standby on power outage. Three,

675
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:42,310
two,

676
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:45,170
one. 
    

677
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:48,800
 What? 

678
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:49,920
 What happened? 

679
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,140
Everyone, this is not a big deal.

680
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:55,310
Please calm down... Students, calm down...

681
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:05,820
This must be a temporary power outage.

682
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:07,720
Hurry up and look into it.

683
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,110
Okay.

684
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,260
Yes, Principal.

685
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,900
A simple electrical issue, not a technical error.

686
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,190
There seems to be an issue in the control room.

687
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:21,220
I'll check that. Have security guards check the chairwoman's room.

688
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,460
Wow, National Intelligence.

689
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:48,590
I didn't even see anything.

690
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:50,610
There's no time.

691
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,570
Heading up to the chairwoman's room.

692
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:01,180
The power is back.

693
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:02,570
Aigoo...

694
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:04,040
Sorry for all the confusion.

695
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,020
Shall we go back down?

696
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:12,880
The power should still be out.

697
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:17,750
 - Shall we go down? 
 - Yes. 

698
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:23,600
 - Yes.  
 - I've restored power.

699
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:27,370
Yes.

700
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,620
 What is this? 

701
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,490
 What happened? 

702
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:34,960
You said it takes three minutes to control the room!

703
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,870
I had no idea he'd walk so fast! This is nuts!

704
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:39,340
Gosh, I'm going crazy.

705
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:43,050
Don't worry, Team Leader.

706
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:45,240
We have a hidden card strategy

707
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:48,040
for exactly this moment.

708
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,960
Who runs this place?

709
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,570
Excuse me, who are you?

710
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:01,120
Me?

711
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,870
Who?

712
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:06,100
A student's dad!

713
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:10,400
A power outage at such a massive event?

714
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,560
I fell down the stairs and hurt myself everywhere!

715
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,490
I think you look just fine.

716
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:28,350
My back...

717
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:30,270
My fourth lumbar vertebrae!

718
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,570
Wait. Wait a second...

719
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:46,490
I'm good now.

720
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,350
   

721
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:15,340
Is it not working?

722
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:18,120
   

723
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:22,150
Young Hun, it'll take a little longer.

724
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:27,730
I understand, Sir. Then why don't you go to the hospital instead?

725
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:35,120
A parent fell down the stairs, and you act like this?

726
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,920
Hey! Do you know who I am?

727
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:43,370
I'm sure you've dined with, bathed with, played soccer, basketball, baseball with, and ran with our chief.

728
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:44,420
Please leave.

729
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:46,430
Please leave now.

730
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:49,810
Fine, fine. I-I'll leave. I'll go.

731
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:51,510
I'll leave in due time, but...

732
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:54,290
You can't smoke a cigarette inside.

733
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:57,490
The weather is perfect for a cigarette today. Leave.

734
00:53:57,490 --> 00:53:59,790
- Hurry up and go. Wait. 
 - Who the hell?

735
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:00,770
- Come. 
 - Just a second!

736
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:03,510
Hey!

737
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,720
How could you do this to me?

738
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,890
What about the child inside of me?

739
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,970
 Go up all the way. 

740
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:23,350
 Hurry up and go! 

741
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,030
Who are you?

742
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:31,930
Stick to my side.

743
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:33,570
Use what I gave you if needed.

744
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:35,250
Stab someone with this?

745
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:38,150
You're an active agent on a mission.

746
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,880
Stop yapping. I'm going for it.

747
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,350
â™«  It's getting hot  â™«

748
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:49,280
â™«  Spectacularly, dramatically  â™«

749
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,060
â™«  Is it a hopeless battle?  â™«

750
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,830
â™«  Is it war without an enemy?  â™«

751
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:54,560
â™«  Can't keep running every day  â™«

752
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,430
â™«  But I still won't give up  â™«

753
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:59,020
Sorry.

754
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:02,710
â™«  Spectacularly, dramatically  â™«

755
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:04,890
â™«  Hey, yo!  â™«

756
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:08,220
â™«  Hey, yo!  â™«

757
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:13,400
â™«  Hey, yo! I'm going to run, here I am  â™«

758
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,340
â™«  What you gonna do? â™«

759
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:17,530
â™«  Hey, yo!  â™«

760
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:19,240
Behind you!

761
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,150
â™«  Hey, yo! â™«

762
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:22,940
Who was I to you?

763
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,570
Just a fiery one-night stand?

764
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:28,310
We only kissed.

765
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:29,490
Also,

766
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:32,360
you said you didn't like me, Sunbae.

767
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:38,820
You idiot. How could you be so dense?

768
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:45,800
â™«  Loving you, I love you  â™«

769
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,480
â™«  Don't forget even for a moment  â™«

770
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:52,660
â™«  You're the only one I love  â™«

771
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:57,190
You went through hell.

772
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,740
What's going on with me?

773
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:34,950
Good job. Thank you.

774
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,220
Young Hun, please clean up here.

775
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:45,120
   

776
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:49,570
We're going in.

777
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:57,180
Agent. Over there.

778
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,150
What?

779
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:18,730
Nothing.

780
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:27,890
Next, we'll sing the Byeongmun school song.

781
00:57:27,890 --> 00:57:31,180
Let's all rise.

782
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:34,810
The school song.

783
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,640
 The performance has resumed. Now is your chance. 

784
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,820
Okay. Shall we begin?

785
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:43,310
Let's begin.

786
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:45,420
Three, four.

787
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,490
What's wrong?

788
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:02,830
This won't make a sound.

789
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:05,410
Is it broken?

790
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:08,340
There's no point in playing it.

791
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:12,330
Let's still play it till the end. Something might happen at the end.

792
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:14,280
Okay. Again.

793
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:33,800
â™«  Our country that will shine brightly  â™«

794
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:38,400
â™«  Our Byeongmun High  â™«

795
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:44,840
â™«  Our Byeongmun High  â™«

796
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:49,360
Nothing happened.

797
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:05,410
What do we do?

798
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:14,790
Let's get you out, Hae Seong. It's dangerous to stay there.

799
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:19,960
 Delete the entry log and get out of there! 

800
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,980
I will withdraw.

801
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:52,540
   

802
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:07,200
   

803
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:13,780
   

804
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,420
   

805
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:17,300
   

806
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:34,340
   

807
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:43,000
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Undercover Love Team ðŸ’– @Viki.com 

808
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:49,970
   

809
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:03,640
 Congratulations on joining National Intelligence, Jeong Si Hyeon. 

810
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:07,940
 Thank you. 

811
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:11,960
 Now that you are an active agent, you need a pseudonym. 

812
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:19,070
 Have you thought of a name that you'd like to be called by me and others? 

813
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:25,310
 Si Hyeon, let's eat. 

814
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:28,900
 Dad, Liu Bei's courtesy name is Xuande. 

815
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,850
 What's a courtesy name? 

816
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:41,160
 Simply put, a name that others call you by. 

817
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:46,640
 Back in the day, it was rude for others to call the name your parents gave you. 

818
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,410
 - I'll make one, too. 
 - Huh? 

819
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:52,320
 I like stars, so... 

820
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,240
 - Hae Seong. 
 - Hae Seong? 

821
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,440
 Hae Seong, like in Comet Express. 

822
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,810
 They brush by Earth. 

823
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:02,870
   

824
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:04,370
 Here. 

825
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:08,950
 Is this it? You won't regret it? 

826
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:10,360
 Nope. 

827
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:13,420
 Call me Hae Seong from now on, Dad. 

828
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:15,250
 Hae Seong. 

829
01:02:17,550 --> 01:02:20,270
 Jeong Hae Seong. 

830
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:34,100
â™«  The name I wrote down every day in my diary  â™«

831
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:39,070
â™«  Filled up my heart like a magic spell  â™«

832
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:44,950
â™«  Flying above the clouds with both eyes closed  â™«

833
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:48,690
â™«  If I send my heart with the wind  â™«

834
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:52,640
â™«  Will it reach you  â™«

835
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:56,580
 I had no idea this was part of the chairwoman's business. 

836
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:58,340
 Don't care about the full-time position? 

837
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:01,630
 I told you not to mess with the student council. 

838
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:03,610
 Could you help me? 

839
01:03:03,610 --> 01:03:04,710
 We need to stop it somehow. 

840
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:06,260
 Let's go. Let's do it together. 

841
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:07,500
 Did you forget about the mission? 

842
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:11,030
 What have you been thinking about ever since you went into the chairwoman's room last week? 

843
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:14,120
 Seo Myeong Ju put me on this mission. 

844
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:16,520
 Jeong Hae Seong is overstepping these days. 

845
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,190
 Why is Ahjussi obsessed with the gold? 

846
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:21,160
 You might end up dead. 

847
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:25,410
   

848
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:43,800
Are you stupid by chance?

849
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:48,680
Do, sol... Do, sol...

850
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:52,890
Do, sol, do, sol. You can't remember that?

851
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,630
I'm sorry.

852
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:59,310
- Let's get it right just once. 
 - Okay.

853
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:03,490
Again. Ready, set, go.

854
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:16,180
Do.

855
01:04:17,870 --> 01:04:19,210
- Was that right? 
 - Yes.

856
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:23,430
â™«  Why can't you see, my darling  â™«

857
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:26,800
â™«  I only look at you  â™«

858
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:30,410
â™«  Please just focus on me, babe  â™«

859
01:04:30,410 --> 01:04:32,620
â™«  You pretend like you don't know  â™«

860
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:36,330
â™«  I pretend like I don't  â™«

861
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:40,560
â™«  If only I had been a little more honest  â™«

862
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:44,930
â™«  Would we be different now?  â™«

863
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:47,480
â™«  If it's not too late  â™«

864
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:55,010
â™«  I'll run to you right now  â™«
