1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,350
   

2
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,330
 Where do I start? 

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,290
 The secret operation 

4
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,640
 that completely changed my dark life. 

5
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:26,350
 That was where it all began. 

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,510
 That night, I focused on the mission as usual. 

7
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,640
What are you staring at?

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,220
Are you on a blind date or something?

9
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,510
He says...

10
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,630
What are you translating that for?

11
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,020
Just tell him to show me the money.

12
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:48,870
Dollars?

13
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,640
Thank you.

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,850
The object.

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,640
He wants to see the object.

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,030
Oh, yeah...

17
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,520
This is something very hard to get.

18
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,540
To get this, I had to drink in all the dust at the museum.

19
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,120
Let me take it out carefully.

20
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,030
We've confirmed the object.

21
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,160
Listen up. Let me say it again.

22
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,180
This is a national treasure that we managed to find by tracking down the black market route.

23
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,570
We cannot damage it.

24
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:50,450
Of course, we should arrest him but don't forget we must safely obtain the treasure.

25
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,900
Damn it. It's high.

26
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,530
What is this?

27
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,240
This bastard...

28
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,590
Who are you?

29
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,510
Next.

30
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,100
Hands off!

31
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,890
Oh, what the heck!

32
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,790
Don't touch what isn't yours.

33
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,570
I give up!

34
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,370
I got the object.

35
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,920
Senior, I'm heading out first.

36
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,350
Okay.

37
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,300
You're not going anywhere!

38
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,040
Bastard! Damn it!

39
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,630
Give it!

40
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,450
Got it.

41
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,350
Hey, Senior!

42
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,500
Don't come after me!

43
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,730
Next time, I will shoot for real.

44
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,930
 Hey, Jeong Hae Seong! Are you crazy? 

45
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,780
If you don't want a hole in your head, put that down.

46
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,900
I'll give you three seconds.

47
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,090
Three,

48
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,700
two...

49
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,100
Drive now!

50
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,590
Step on it.

51
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,140
How thrilling.

52
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,340
Backup is on the scene.

53
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,080
We'll catch up soon, so just follow him.

54
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,450
We don't have time for that. A busy street is coming up soon.

55
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,510
- I need to catch him before that. 
 - This is an order from your team leader!

56
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,760
Jeong Hae Seong!

57
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,790
Don't do anything dangerous, listen to meâ€“

58
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,530
Hello? Hello!

59
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,400
It disconnected.

60
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,940
What the?

61
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,740
Stop the car, bastard.

62
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,070
What are you doing? Hit him!

63
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,810
Where did he go? Is he gone? Well?

64
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,230
I think he's gone.

65
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,820
He's gone.

66
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,140
What?

67
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,670
What the hell?

68
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,260
Hey! Shake him off! Shake him off!

69
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,610
What?

70
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,110
Hey! He's up there!

71
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,440
Shake him off! Harder! Harder!

72
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,330
Hey, hey, hey!

73
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,770
 Shake! Shake! 

74
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,370
 Shake! 

75
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,770
Don't do it. Don'tâ€“

76
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:00,410
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

77
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,190
No, no...

78
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,870
Stop it!

79
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,210
Are you crazy?

80
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,780
Is he serious?

81
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,300
No...

82
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,500
Senior!

83
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:44,000
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Undercover Love Team ðŸ’– @Viki.com 

84
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,150
That is so f***ing cool.

85
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,480
Mission complete.

86
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,510
What about the Chinese broker and CEO Park? 
    

87
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,130
They were referred to the prosecution. 
    

88
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,140
CEO Park is in the hospital.

89
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,800
So is the driver.

90
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,350
They need to be behind bars to learn their lesson.

91
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,290
Anyway, good job on the mission.

92
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,030
And Yeong Hun...

93
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,650
Dude.

94
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,830
You've been through a lot.

95
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,470
All right. Should we take a look?

96
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,870
Let's see how the Buddha has been doing.

97
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:20,450
Gosh, all this time... you've been through so much.

98
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,840
Now, we will take good care of you.

99
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,780
T-T-T-This...

100
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,460
What's wrong with this?

101
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,380
T-This thing. This.

102
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:45,200
Where's the thing holding his chin? T-This?

103
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,780
Why is the arm...

104
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,700
Team Leader.

105
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,600
This looks like a bullet.

106
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,520
A bullet?

107
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,190
Someone shot at a national treasure?

108
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,420
Who fired their gun on the scene?

109
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,330
The whole arm is gone.

110
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:20,380
What kind of bastard put a bullet inâ€“

111
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,050
Damn it.

112
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,730
   

113
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,770
An Seok Ho!

114
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,060
What are you going to do?

115
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,590
How are you going to fix this?

116
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,560
- I'm sorry. 
 - "Sorry"? My foot.

117
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,380
Please calm down, Director.

118
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,650
I know Domestic Team 4 is incompetent.

119
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,210
I don't think they did this on purpose.

120
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Forget it.

121
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,490
Just fire Agent Jeong first.

122
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,300
- Pardon? 
  - Didn't you hear me? 

123
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,610
 Someone has to be the scapegoat. Are you going to take the blame? 

124
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:20,520
 Director, wait a second... I can't fire Agent Jeong. 

125
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,100
Think of how much he's done for the country.

126
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,000
I know Agent Jeong worked hard.

127
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,860
I know he's too good to rot in your stupid Team 4.

128
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,540
But where are we?

129
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,500
The National Intelligence Service.

130
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,780
 You can succeed 100 times, but if you fail once, you're criticized. 

131
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,980
Fire Agent Jeong by tomorrow.

132
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,740
That's an order, Team Leader An Seok Ho.

133
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,840
- Director, one more chance. 
 - Let's go, Seok Ho.

134
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,190
Directorâ€“

135
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,730
Hey, hey. Let go. Let go of me!

136
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,680
Director! Director!

137
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,580
I'll do whatever you say, Director!

138
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,910
Team Leader Gong.

139
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,980
Damn it!

140
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:09,140
Will you be responsible for saying you'll do anything?

141
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,550
Yes!

142
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,280
Of course!

143
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,600
My goodness.

144
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,520
It wasn't like playing pool. How did a bullet get there?

145
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,040
Geez.

146
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,760
I can't believe how unlucky we are.

147
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,150
I'm sorry.

148
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,260
I should have been careful.

149
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,940
How can Director be like this?

150
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,750
It's not like Senior Jeong meant to do this. It was an accident on duty.

151
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,470
Does he want you to resign for that? How petty.

152
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,990
Team Leader, are you really going to let him go?

153
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,540
I don't have any power.

154
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,950
It's what the higher-ups are telling me to do.

155
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,140
But it's not over yet.

156
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,600
He gave me an order this afternoon.

157
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,280
It's the only way you can stay alive, Hae Seong.

158
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,740
There's a school in Seoul. It's called Byeongmun High School.

159
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,170
You might have heard of it.

160
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,980
 A prestigious private school, the best in the nation. 

161
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,860
 The first director of the board, Seo Byeong Mun. 

162
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,650
 A traitor to our people, unrecorded in history 

163
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,540
 and the secret keeper of King Gojong's safe. 

164
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,780
 He gave Seo Byeong Mun his private funds 

165
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:56,840
 to be used for our nation's independence in the form of 10 tons of gold. 

166
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,690
 The king trusted Seo Byeong Mun, 

167
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,410
 but he had an ulterior motive. 

168
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:19,070
 "There is no hope for this country anyway." 

169
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:23,280
 He decided to embezzle money worth 800 billion won at present market value. 

170
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,550
   

171
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:35,570
 Long live Korean independence! Long live Korean independence! 

172
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:38,040
 Long live Korean independence! 

173
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,960
 Long live Korean independence! 

174
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,920
 Long live Korean independence! 

175
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,660
 Long live Korean independence! 

176
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:51,240
 But when Japan fell, 

177
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,600
 Seo Byeong Mun had to flee. 

178
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,040
 Over here! 

179
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,480
 Look everywhere! 

180
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,550
 Don't miss a spot! Search everywhere! 

181
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:08,190
 The countless gold bars he couldn't take with him... 

182
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,650
 are supposedly still resting somewhere, 

183
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,330
 waiting to see the light once again. 

184
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,190
It sounds like a legend.

185
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,360
Yes.

186
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,430
I also thought so at first.

187
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:30,410
Until the director showed me this.

188
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,930
Undeniable proof that gold bars actually exist.

189
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:41,250
Previously, based on this evidence, the NIS investigated Byeongmun's foundation,

190
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,590
but the investigation was a failure.

191
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:47,030
If the foundation didn't have it, where is the gold?

192
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:51,080
The one place the NIS failed to look

193
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,330
was Byeongmun High School.

194
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,800
Recently, the NIS got an anonymous tip.

195
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,090
Seo Byeong Mun's hidden gold is somewhere inside that school.

196
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:06,500
The foundation intends to smuggle it out abroad.

197
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,500
All the gold bars?

198
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,860
All 800 billion worth of them?

199
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:15,780
If they are successful, it will be a huge loss of state funds.

200
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,940
The damage to our country will be extraordinary.

201
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:24,110
Hey, Hae Seong. What do you think?

202
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,940
What should I do first?

203
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,640
I'm getting to the meat of it.

204
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,120
From now on, Hae Seong, you are a high schooler.

205
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,510
Get into Byeongmun High as a student.

206
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:39,490
Find the gold bars that the traitor Seo Byeong Mun hid.

207
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,850
Operation named...

208
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:45,920
Undercover High School.

209
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,020
Are you crazy?

210
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,650
We don't have time. Let's get to the operation briefing right away.

211
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,170
W-Wait!

212
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,480
This is nonsense. How can I go back to school?

213
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,650
Don't worry.

214
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,630
You have a really young face.

215
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,000
Who would suspect you?

216
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Say you took the wrong tonics and aged quickly.

217
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,060
Push this story all the way.

218
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,350
- Are you serious? 
 - Hey, Youngest, how old are you?

219
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:16,330
- Twenty-six. 
 - Twentyâ€“

220
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,650
Why are you so surprised? I kept calling you, Senior.

221
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:21,460
I thought that was because I started before you, like in the military.

222
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,250
That's why I've been speaking formally to you!

223
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,440
Sir.

224
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,870
So how old did you think I was?

225
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,740
Early 40s?

226
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,070
Took the wrong tonics as a child?

227
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,460
- Tortoise extract. 
 - Tortoise extract. That's what he took.

228
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,660
You heard him, right?

229
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,720
What about this?

230
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,530
A teacher. I can be a teacher.

231
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,140
No, no. That won't work.

232
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,830
There are no openings.

233
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,190
The foundation will notice.

234
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,320
- Stillâ€“ 
 - Forget it! Stop talking!

235
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,780
I promised the director I would send you.

236
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,220
   

237
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,040
I can't do this. I won't do it.

238
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,970
Then will you just quit like this?

239
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,480
Hey, there is no other way.

240
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,370
Let's just get out of the storm.

241
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,680
Let's do this operation, Hae Seong. Okay?

242
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:26,540
Go and catch all the bad guys.

243
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,730
Bring back the 800 billion won worth of gold bars.

244
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,780
And let's come back with glory.

245
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,730
â™ª  Did she come back because she missed me?  â™ª

246
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,180
â™ª  I like it! I like it!  â™ª

247
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,720
â™ª  I like Gwang Du!  â™ª

248
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,200
â™ª  I like it so much  â™ª

249
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,090
â™ª  Gwang Du  â™ª

250
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:57,270
â™ª  I like Gwang Du so much  â™ª

251
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:02,020
â™ª  So much  â™ª

252
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,520
So good!

253
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,960
- That was amazing! 
 - Thank you.

254
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,180
Wow! Ms. Oh!

255
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,780
You're basically a singer.

256
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,880
Your spirit is alive.

257
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,030
Come over here. Let me pour you a glass.

258
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:29,610
I'd be honored if you did, Vice Principal.

259
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:32,180
Happy birthday!

260
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,890
 Happy birthday! 

261
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,840
Thank you.

262
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,370
Thank you for throwing me a party.

263
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:42,000
I love you all!

264
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,770
If we didn't throw him one, he'd be upset for a year.

265
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,900
That was last year.

266
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,350
Oh, my.

267
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:59,110
 - This nutjob...  
 - This is how you drink these days.

268
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,560
One shot!

269
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,970
This whole thing?

270
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,220
Oh?

271
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,950
Are you going to bring the mood down?

272
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,450
I'm going to be upset.

273
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,370
I'm the main character of this party.

274
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:13,800
If you don't listen to your superior, how will you become a full-time teacher?

275
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,640
If she drinks that, she'll be knocked out.

276
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,620
I'm kidding!

277
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,150
One shot! One shot! One shot!

278
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,030
One shot! One shot!

279
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,940
 - One shot! One shot!  
 - One shot!

280
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,870
I will drink it.

281
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,760
That was way too loud.

282
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,050
Why would you drink this?

283
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,750
Well...

284
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,290
- I'll volunteer for her. 
 - Mr. Lee.

285
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,070
Are you on a blind date by yourself?

286
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,300
Sit down.

287
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,980
- One shot! 
 - I'll drink it.

288
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,290
I can hold my alcohol.

289
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,690
Mr. Lee, you only drink Coke.

290
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:53,280
Stop talking nonsense. Sit down!

291
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,520
Sit down, don't move. Stay! Wait!

292
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,730
- Don't move! 
 - Stop it!

293
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:03,050
Byeongmun High, Year 2, Class 1. Oh Su Ah, their homeroom teacher.

294
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,970
I will drink this and die tonight.

295
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:07,260
That's right.

296
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,830
One shot! One shot!

297
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,740
One shot! That's right! Goodness!

298
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,860
Look at her go!

299
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,340
- No... 
 - Keep it up!

300
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,810
Go, go, go!

301
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,650
Look at her go! All the way!

302
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,760
All the way!

303
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,640
Oh, my, all the way! All of it. Goodness.

304
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,980
She drank the whole thing!

305
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:25,760
See you tomorrow.

306
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,340
Get home safely.

307
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,440
- Good night. 
 - There is a taxi.

308
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,960
Where are you going? Let's get another round!

309
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,760
Third round! Club!

310
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,370
Club!

311
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,840
Club, let's go!

312
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,160
- Club, let's go! 
 - Ms. Oh...

313
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,820
- I'm sorry. This is my fault. 
 - No!

314
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,990
- Mr. Lee, please stop her. 
 - No! Club...

315
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,270
- Come on! 
 - Ms. Oh! Ms. Oh...

316
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:51,280
You're very drunk. Let's call it.

317
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,890
Not at all. I'm totally fine.

318
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,380
- Who's taking the taxi? 
 - Sir...

319
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,770
Thank you.

320
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,690
Stop! Vice Principal!

321
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,590
Gosh!

322
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,920
That sobered me up quickly.

323
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,190
Damn it.

324
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,830
I'm going home now.

325
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,700
Please hurry up and go, Sir. Hurry.

326
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,360
Hurry, hurry.

327
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,410
If Hae Seong doesn't want to do it...

328
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:30,250
The team could be dissolved?

329
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:34,600
I'm not sure, but it looks like it.

330
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,200
Dissolution is a fancy term. It means we're fired.

331
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,400
It was the straw that broke the camel's back.

332
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,980
Honestly...

333
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,070
Hae Seong has been carrying us this whole time.

334
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,500
Cheers.

335
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,080
Boss, one order of hangover soup, please.

336
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,910
Gosh, darn it.

337
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:38,990
Crawling in here drunk again?

338
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,370
Girl, go home. Goodness...

339
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,700
I don't know if I opened this shop to make money

340
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,200
or to make my daughter hangover soup.

341
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,910
I'll pay!

342
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,440
It's not like it's busy in here.

343
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,800
You little brat.

344
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,300
- Ma'am. Check, please. 
 - Yes?

345
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,970
Okay.

346
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:06,570
- Did you enjoy your meal? 
 - Yes.

347
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,800
Wow, so handsome.

348
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:30,330
â™«  Sunlight shining down into my heart  â™«

349
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:36,430
â™«  Like a flower blooming softly when you smile  â™«

350
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,060
Are you a student?

351
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,350
College student?

352
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,100
I'm in my second year of high school.

353
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,090
Age 17.

354
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:48,350
Gosh, there's no way.

355
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,190
I checked your IDs.

356
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,840
Gosh, ma'am. You are so naive.

357
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,330
It's easy to make fake IDs these days.

358
00:27:55,330 --> 00:28:02,070
Ma'am, if we report that you sold alcohol to minors, you know what's going to happen. Right?

359
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,960
Thanks for the food.

360
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,340
B-But...

361
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,570
Wait!

362
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,310
What now?

363
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:18,030
The laws changed a long time ago. Still acting like thugs?

364
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,320
What school do you guys go to?

365
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,870
Auntie, who are you?

366
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,870
Auntie...

367
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,590
- I work here! 
 - What?

368
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:36,390
That makes you basically a stranger.

369
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,200
Stop butting your nose in.

370
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,780
- Gosh. 
 - Wipe down that table.

371
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,130
Kids these days don't tolerate these things.

372
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,830
Try taking one more step forward.

373
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:50,520
I'm calling the police.

374
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,220
Hey, who do you think you are?

375
00:28:54,220 --> 00:29:00,210
Who do you think you are to bullshit me saying you'll call the police?

376
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:03,840
Are you my mom? My teacher?

377
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,180
Tell me.

378
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,680
Who do you think you are?

379
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,810
Who do you think youâ€“

380
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,670
That's enough.

381
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,740
Who the hell are you?

382
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,420
Hey, what are you doing? Get him!

383
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,770
Damn it!

384
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,140
You bastard!

385
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,770
That hurt...

386
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:49,570
- That hurt...
 - Let's get out.

387
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,130
Hey! Pay before you go!

388
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,760
Pay before you go, you bastards!

389
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,310
Okay.

390
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,770
Gosh, okay.

391
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:59,880
- He'll pay you. 
 - Shit!

392
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,200
Here's 50,000 won. I'm sorry.

393
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:09,290
Goodness, thank you so much.

394
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,990
Are you hurt anywhere?

395
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,790
I'm okay.

396
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:15,130
Goodness! Gosh!

397
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,640
It should be on the house. No need to pay.

398
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,470
It's all good. You can go.

399
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:23,620
- Just give me extras next time. 
 - Oh, wait...

400
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:27,510
Gosh, then make sure you come back.

401
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:30,550
I'll give you some free potatoes.

402
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,280
Thank you for the food.

403
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,640
Gosh, thank you. Thank you.

404
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:40,700
â™«  Sunlight shining down into my heart  â™«

405
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:46,710
Get home safe.

406
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:50,070
â™«  I finally found you  â™«

407
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,680
I wonder whose son he is. I wish he could be mine.

408
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,610
And you!

409
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:58,300
Why be so reckless when you're going for a job?

410
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:03,240
Mom, my chest is beating.

411
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,650
What is there to beat? It's so flat.

412
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,530
Mom!

413
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:57,570
â™«  After a long day  â™«

414
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:05,580
â™«  I try holding on but fall down on myself  â™«

415
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:09,740
â™«  Like you're going to pass me by  â™«

416
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:19,600
â™«  The distant nights come to me  â™«

417
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,780
   

418
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,940
 This is the problem with bastards with no parents. 

419
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,790
 You need a good beating to come to your senses. 

420
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,750
 Let's go. 

421
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:37,300
â™«  Every day, it was too much for me  â™«

422
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:45,360
â™«  You held me inside the seeping moonlight  â™«

423
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:52,500
â™«  So I could sleep  â™«

424
00:32:52,500 --> 00:33:00,860
â™«  You're the only one who holds my hand  â™«

425
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:04,900
â™«  Whenever I'm lost in pain  â™«

426
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:09,480
â™«  Every time I fall and fail  â™«

427
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:13,540
â™«  You help me feel love  â™«

428
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,620
â™«  So real  â™«

429
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:25,570
â™«  I'll shine for you through every night until I'm next to you  â™«

430
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,960
â™«  For you  â™«

431
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,620
Team Leader.

432
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,520
I'll do the mission.

433
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,960
Byeongmun Private High School.

434
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,780
Seo Byeong Mun, in charge of the king's affairs,

435
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,110
established a foundation to open this school.

436
00:33:55,110 --> 00:34:00,100
During the Japanese occupation, it implemented a colonial policy of subjecting Koreans to Japan.

437
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,500
Its status at the time was equal to

438
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:07,930
the Empire High School, established by the Japanese Government General.

439
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:09,160
   

440
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:13,250
 A prestigious school that produces over 100 students to enter the Top 3 universities every year. 

441
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,200
 Its graduates are influential in politics, business, 

442
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,200
 legal profession, and also the media. 

443
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,120
 With a network stronger than any college or company as their weapon, 

444
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:27,020
 they form a cartel within the powers and interests of Korea. 

445
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,410
   

446
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:32,210
   

447
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:37,300
Chairwoman, the Secretary of Education is here.

448
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,620
My goodness.

449
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,190
Welcome.

450
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,550
I know how busy you are.

451
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,470
- Thank you for coming all this way. 
 - No, no.

452
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:51,350
I'll leave my daughter in your care.

453
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:53,080
Hello.

454
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,720
Take a seat.

455
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:06,170
 The school culture boasts a military-level discipline 

456
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:09,310
 and hierarchy among the students. 

457
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:20,140
 And only the students in the top 0.1% are allowed to join the student council. 

458
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,430
- Hey, Underclassman. 
 - Pardon?

459
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:25,460
- Are you new? 
 - Yes, I am.

460
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,910
Didn't you hear during orientation?

461
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:30,650
Freshmen aren't allowed to wear earrings.

462
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:33,080
I'm sorry, President. I forgot...

463
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,310
- Be more careful. 
 - Yes.

464
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,460
The school is becoming a zoo.

465
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,980
Book a meeting with her homeroom teacher.

466
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:46,040
No one in school dares to

467
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:52,170
challenge the power and authority they hold.

468
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:56,500
All right, then what are the details of the plan?

469
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,310
How will you make me a student?

470
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,760
Agent Park Mi Jeong.

471
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,160
Yes.

472
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:07,060
Based on Hae Seong's identity and background, here are family and student records

473
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,730
and other miscellaneous materials I created.

474
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,280
   

475
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:19,940
I'm a social welfare admission student. But why?

476
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,160
Byeongmun High doesn't accept transfer students

477
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,480
without donating to the school's development fund.

478
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,000
I'll pay. How much is it?

479
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,110
At least 100 million won.

480
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,920
Do you have that money?

481
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,630
That's a harsh truth.

482
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,630
What's this?

483
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:43,390
The previous school was in Haenam Ddangkkeut Village?

484
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:46,900
Transfer students usually attract attention.

485
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,840
They'll ask you about your previous school.

486
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:55,470
We chose a spot as far away as possible to avoid the chances of knowing someone from your previous school.

487
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,930
It makes no sense, but it makes sense.

488
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:02,620
You live near the school in a rooftop room.

489
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,780
Your guardian, an uncle, does deep sea fishing.

490
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:08,250
You live alone in Seoul.

491
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,050
Next.

492
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,210
   

493
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,860
   

494
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,490
   

495
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:19,480
   

496
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,090
Is that Korean?

497
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,880
Memorize it.

498
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,210
You need to be able to talk with the students.

499
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:31,310
Senior, who was the last idol you liked?

500
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:32,550
G-Girls' Generation?

501
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,440
Not Girls' Generation, Wonder Girls is the best.

502
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,860
You must memorize all this.

503
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,170
Don't you dare even mention Girls' Generation

504
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,380
or Wonder Girls.

505
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,350
You cannot.

506
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:48,050
As I mentioned before, Byeongmun High isn't an ordinary school.

507
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:51,070
Same with the students and the parents.

508
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,570
Hey, you.

509
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:55,800
Don't get yourself mixed up with a student.

510
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,900
Then you increase the chance of your identity getting found out.

511
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,720
- Understood? 
 - Yes.

512
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:05,900
Only the director and we know about this mission.

513
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:10,170
The mission shall continue until Agent Jeong Hae Seong...

514
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:17,020
returns 800 billion worth of national assets

515
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:20,120
to the treasury.

516
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,720
The mission starts this Monday.

517
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,290
Prepare what you need.

518
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:26,390
Any questions?

519
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,340
- No. 
 - No.

520
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,720
- Let's split, then. 
 - Me!

521
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:36,980
So the gold bars definitely exist. Right?

522
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,170
That's what the intelligence report said...

523
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,460
- So they have to, right? 
 - What?

524
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:49,210
Is this the director's ulterior motive to fire us

525
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:53,050
after having us chase something that's nonexistent?

526
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:54,580
No, no.

527
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,680
You saw the photo.

528
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,960
It definitely exists.

529
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,060
It absolutely exists.

530
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,140
Don't worry.

531
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,970
Let's split.

532
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,610
What was that?

533
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,920
I don't think it exists.

534
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,580
We still need to do it, even if it doesn't exist.

535
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,080
This news just came in.

536
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,520
Your auntie will come for an inspection later.

537
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:33,800
Cleaning or airing out the house, don't let there be any mistakes.

538
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,130
Got it?

539
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:39,320
Your aunt is dead set on bringing you back home.

540
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,040
- I'll get ready. 
 - Okay.

541
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,520
He's taking care of himself.

542
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,540
Mom! Take a seat. Oppa is uncomfortable.

543
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,590
Yes, enough already.

544
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,100
The meat's ready to eat.

545
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,600
Fine.

546
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,200
Hae Seong.

547
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,230
Are you able to pay all your utilities?

548
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:11,720
Move in with us, so you don't need to pay utilities.

549
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,270
Mom!

550
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:15,610
Fine, you brat.

551
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:18,720
You're just scared that I'll ask you for your room.

552
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,800
Gosh, you're a guy living alone,

553
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,650
but somehow, it's really clean.

554
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:30,070
You startled me.

555
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:33,190
I'm a little bummed out.

556
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:35,670
That's because you raised me well, Aunt.

557
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:38,100
Gosh, you and your words.

558
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,140
Here, open up, Aunt.

559
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,550
I hate watching this.

560
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:45,140
Right, Dad?

561
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,650
What are you doing?

562
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:50,250
Nothing. Eat up.

563
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,350
You know...

564
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:57,300
Since the whole family is gathered, I have an important announcement.

565
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:01,630
Starting Monday, Hae Seong

566
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,880
will be deployed to Byeongmun High on a mission.

567
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,080
At my school? Why would he?

568
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,070
The details are top secret. That's all you need to know.

569
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:11,220
You better watch your mouth at school.

570
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,400
Top secret, my foot.

571
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,410
If you put Hae Seong in danger again, I'll just...

572
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:18,420
Aunt!

573
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,900
Whoa, whoa.

574
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,630
Put it down.

575
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,670
Let me pour you a glass.

576
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,720
Here you go.

577
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,630
Don't worry.

578
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,890
I'm not a kid.

579
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:33,050
You'll always be a kid to me.

580
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,600
Gosh, come on.

581
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,570
Let's do cheers together.

582
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:41,370
To our family's happiness and health,

583
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:44,780
and to the success of Hae Seong's mission.

584
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,110
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

585
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,850
See you back home.

586
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,780
Get out of my way.

587
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:51,070
Me?

588
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:57,090
Why can't she just go around...

589
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:02,470
Who's that? A transfer student?

590
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:14,180
Those kids...

591
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,330
 Ms. Oh! 

592
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:20,290
Is Ms. Oh not here yet?

593
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,990
Does she know what time it is?

594
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:26,490
 - This is why they say teachers are failing!  
 - I'm going crazy.

595
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:28,600
 Teachers, don't be like this. 

596
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,210
Excuse me.

597
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:32,050
 Are you set on dragging the school down? 

598
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:33,600
 I... 

599
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,930
Ms. Oh?

600
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,590
You startled me.

601
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:43,530
Where did she go?

602
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:44,870
Who...

603
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:46,490
I'm Jeong Hae Seong.

604
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:47,700
I just transferred here.

605
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,950
I'm busy right now so save the hello.

606
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:51,410
Did you see a teacher?

607
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:53,340
She was just here.

608
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,160
Yes.

609
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,770
Well...

610
00:44:57,830 --> 00:44:59,790
She went that way.

611
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:01,360
Thanks.

612
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,490
Ms. Oh!

613
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,900
Ms. Oh!

614
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,850
 Where did she go? Ms. Oh... 

615
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:23,230
You're Hae Seong, 
    

616
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:25,060
a transfer student in my homeroom.

617
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:27,040
- Your homeroom? 
 - Nice to meet you.

618
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,090
I'm Ms. Oh Su Ah, your homeroom teacher.

619
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:33,580
I teach Korean History. Erase what you just saw from your memory.

620
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,340
Nice to meet you.

621
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:39,820
It will take time for you to settle in.

622
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,680
Don't hesitate to ask me about anything that's bothering you.

623
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,230
I'll help you as much as I can.

624
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:46,670
Okay.

625
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,610
Have we met before?

626
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:02,870
Wait, at the store...

627
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:08,210
Come here.

628
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:10,330
- You're crazy. 
 - It hurts!

629
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:12,290
Where are your manners?

630
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:14,530
It really hurts!

631
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:17,340
- Get over here! 
 - It hurts a lot!

632
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,020
Let go!

633
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,640
Ms. Oh!

634
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:25,430
- It really hurts! Really! 
 - What?

635
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:30,420
I'm speechless.

636
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,600
How did you get through the ID check?

637
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,750
I bet you have a fake.

638
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:38,290
Were you coming from a funeral? Wearing a suit from head to toe?

639
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:41,910
I'm holding back since you're a transfer student, but you better watch it.

640
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:44,860
Get caught again? Straight to the counseling room.

641
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:47,290
This is ridiculous.

642
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:49,860
It's not like you did anything right.

643
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:52,230
"You"?

644
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:57,040
So you didn't do anything right, Teacher.

645
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,620
You fought with me.

646
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:01,530
You beat them up with all your might that time.

647
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:02,650
- Hey. 
 - With the metal tray.

648
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:04,510
Hey!

649
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:07,540
I was just trying to save you.

650
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,740
I never asked you to save me.

651
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,630
I acknowledge my wrongdoings, so you should acknowledge yours, Miss.

652
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:18,900
Let's end on a high note.

653
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,270
Since this is my first day here.

654
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:24,740
It's time for assembly. Look.

655
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,740
Where's my classroom?

656
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,470
   

657
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:32,520
Ye Na! Ye Na.

658
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,350
I'm so jealous.

659
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:39,140
Your mom... No, can you ask the chairwoman and take me as a French exchange student?

660
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:41,630
Hey. I thought you were training to become an idol.

661
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:44,600
Forget that. Why don't you take me instead? Please?

662
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,930
I'm going during summer break. It's a while till then.

663
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:51,500
Also, I'm sorry, but I have already chosen who I'm taking.

664
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,040
Who?

665
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:57,860
Me?

666
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:00,420
You know I can't live without you.

667
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,410
You'll come with me, right?

668
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:07,160
How much does the exchange program cost?

669
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,000
Not sure.

670
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,200
With the school subsidy, around 10 million won?

671
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:16,170
Ten million? Wow, 10 million won...

672
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:17,730
Ten million won...

673
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:19,800
Good morning, Writer.

674
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,540
Wow. Look at this loser and his stupid antics.

675
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,290
Excuse me, Writer.

676
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:29,750
Are you done with the school project, at least?

677
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:32,770
Sorry. I'll get right to it.

678
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:36,870
Dong Min.

679
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,250
Watch yourself.

680
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:43,160
You know I can be scary when I'm mad.

681
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:46,200
- Yes... 
  - The teacher's coming! 

682
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,960
Quiet down. Get ready for assembly.

683
00:48:56,270 --> 00:49:00,760
We have a new transfer student today.

684
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,500
Come in.

685
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:18,900
Handsome.

686
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,370
I found my destiny.

687
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:30,870
Crazy! What do we do?

688
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:34,720
I'm Jeong Hae Seong. Nice to meet you.

689
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,330
Applause.

690
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:46,020
An empty seat...

691
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,940
Sit there.

692
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:07,900
Let's all help Hae Seong settle in.

693
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:10,120
Roll call.

694
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,360
 - Han Tae Hee.  
 - Hi.

695
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,190
 - Lee Hyeon Jae.  
 - I'm Lee Dong Min.

696
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:15,820
 - Kang Ji Yeong.  
 - Nice to meet you.

697
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:18,270
- I hope we get along. 
  - Jeong Sang Hun. 

698
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:19,850
 Kim Ho Jin. 

699
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,630
 Oppa, rooftop after assembly. 
   

700
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:47,930
Oppa!

701
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:50,630
Are you crazy? You're here as a student?

702
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,290
Don't call your oppa crazy.

703
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:57,410
That's just how it worked out. Don't ask.

704
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,680
It's too much to pose as a student. I thought...

705
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,230
I thought you'd be a teacher or a staff member!

706
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:07,890
Do you think I put this on because I wanted to?

707
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:10,350
Wait till you grow up and have a job.

708
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:23,930
Whatever. I'll do my best to help, so finish up your mission quickly and leave.

709
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:29,090
And promise me. Don't tell my parents how I am at school.

710
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,180
Is something going on?

711
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:34,820
Don't dig. Let's leave it at that.

712
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:37,360
Got it. I promise.

713
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,660
- You promised. 
 - Yes.

714
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:41,130
If you break it, I'll never see you again.

715
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:42,970
Got it.

716
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:12,120
Let's do this.

717
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:24,540
After a year passed, King Gojong returned to Gyeongungung Palace...

718
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:27,980
from the Russian Legation.

719
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,790
Oh, no way!

720
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:34,110
- Sorry... 
 - Bastard...

721
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:36,680
How dare you karate chop me?

722
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:39,320
I'm sorry.

723
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:51,620
Hi, transfer student! What's your social media handle? I'll iksok you.

724
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:53,930
Iksok? 
    

725
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:57,510
You don't know what iksok means?

726
00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:00,740
Hae Seong, are you a caveman?

727
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:05,250
No. I know what that means.

728
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:09,140
I don't know what yaksok you're up to, but let me say no.

729
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:11,180
It's okay...

730
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:13,500
- He's so funny. 
 - What a joker.

731
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,170
- So humorous. 
 - Just a joke!

732
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:16,940
I knew it.

733
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,770
A familiar yaksok*.  (Sounds like iksok) 

734
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,860
It's different from what I memorized. What does iksok mean?

735
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:30,650
 Iksok? Are you sure they didn't mean yaksok? 

736
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:33,700
Forget it. I'm hanging up.

737
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,740
Gosh.

738
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:39,950
 Rock, paper, scissors. 

739
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,840
 Salute! 

740
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:54,390
 Why did you do that? 

741
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,470
 One, two, three! 

742
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:11,230
 Why so long? 

743
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:14,890
I want to go home.

744
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,410
I really do.

745
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,760
   

746
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:50,660
   

747
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:04,600
   

748
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:35,360
   

749
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,360
   

750
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:48,000
 Hey. Hey, Lee Dong Min. 

751
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,990
 As long as you leech off our tuition to go to school for free, 

752
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:54,480
 you better do what we say. Am I right or not? 

753
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,750
Forgetting about it doesn't cut it.

754
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:59,990
How will you use my grandmother's ID?

755
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:02,970
He's a funny guy. Why do you need to know?

756
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:07,370
Just bring it to us if we tell you to, you bastard.

757
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:10,520
This won't do. It's been a while since I taught you a lesson.

758
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:15,250
Stay put. Don't move. Stay still.

759
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:22,680
What the heck?

760
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,370
Hey.

761
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:25,950
Hey!

762
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:28,810
Stop and come over here.

763
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,670
Transfer student?

764
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:40,320
What's up with you? Since when were you there?

765
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:44,090
Since just now. Where's the bathroom?

766
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:45,980
Bathroom, my foot.

767
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:49,600
Since you watched, pay us admission.

768
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,040
Go and get us some dumplings and hotdogs.

769
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:55,520
I'll pay you later.

770
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:03,950
What?

771
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:06,460
What's up? What are you staring for?

772
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:07,950
What are you going to do?

773
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:12,210
That's enough. I've been watching, and you crossed the line.

774
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:16,700
Stop it and go inside. I'm saying this for your sake...

775
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:22,180
 Hae Seong. 

776
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:24,840
 You must hold back. 

777
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:33,070
Wh-What?

778
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:35,370
Why did he stop in the middle of a sentence?

779
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:37,170
Is something there?

780
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:41,130
So?

781
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:43,170
You don't want to go and get it?

782
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:47,920
Should I get beverages, too?

783
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:51,270
You scared me, you son of a bitch...

784
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:52,280
Your eyes...

785
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,340
I'll be right back.

786
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:58,390
Hurry up and go. Hurry up!

787
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:01,320
- Okay. 
 - Run, you bastard! Three, two, one!

788
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:04,270
- I can see your legs! 
 - What a great runner!

789
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:06,640
Dong Min, you must be happy.

790
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,990
You got a loser friend.

791
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:14,050
The transfer student was at your mom's?

792
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:17,580
Your face right now was my face earlier.

793
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:20,150
Whoa, I was in such a shock.

794
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:23,020
Gosh, I hate problem students.

795
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:26,410
What if he has tattoos all over his body?

796
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:30,380
I couldn't have imagined he was a student.

797
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:34,450
He was wearing a full suit and drinking.

798
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:36,650
 Mom... 

799
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:39,620
 My chest is beating. 

800
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:45,920
Are you a crazy b****?

801
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,140
What's wrong with her?

802
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:53,860
This is the last time I'll let him get away.

803
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:55,830
Next time if I catch him in action,

804
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:59,250
I will not let it slide.

805
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,680
Okay, another day of hard work.

806
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,990
Get home safely, and see you tomorrow.

807
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:09,160
All together, the class motto.

808
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,430
Look at the blackboard...

809
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:13,700
 Like it's BTS. 

810
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:14,980
   

811
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:18,380
Great. That's all.

812
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:36,880
- Was your name Dong Min? 
 - What?

813
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,240
Yes, that's my name.

814
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:43,550
Next time, don't just take it. Try fighting back.

815
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:45,910
It's not always the answer to endure through it.

816
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:47,340
Okay?

817
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:50,100
You weren't able to fight back, either.

818
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:52,350
Yun Cheol got your butt.

819
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:55,020
That's okay. I have a lot of fat on my butt.

820
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:56,580
Let me ask you something.

821
01:00:56,580 --> 01:01:00,450
What's up with that old building?

822
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:02,000
The one that says no entry.

823
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,760
Oh, that...

824
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:07,460
That's the old school building. It's no longer in use.

825
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:09,590
They said it's too old and might collapse.

826
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:11,650
How old is it?

827
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:14,010
Probably goes back to the Japanese occupation era.

828
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:17,290
It's the oldest building on campus.

829
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:19,540
Japanese occupation era...

830
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:25,080
Yes. Some say there are ghosts around and corpses beneath.

831
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:28,320
Actually, I love school ghost stories.

832
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,840
If you're interested...

833
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:41,080
   

834
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:05,300
I'm sorry for your loss.

835
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:08,850
Thank you for coming.

836
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:11,370
I'm not sure

837
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:14,920
if this will provide any comfort,

838
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:17,130
but don't worry about your son.

839
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:20,810
Byeongmun Foundation will take care of him.

840
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:28,200
Thank you, Chairwoman.

841
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,920
Make space for him in Byeongmun's special class.

842
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,890
Yes, I understand.

843
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:34,690
Thank you.

844
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:43,510
You never know with people.

845
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:46,470
Who knew a man of such prominent social standing

846
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:49,650
would hang himself out of the blue?

847
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:52,000
It's such a shame.

848
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:56,320
He did butt heads with you about Education City,

849
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,770
but he wasn't a bad person.

850
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:01,560
Why cause you grief if he'd leave like this?

851
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:04,570
- Assemblyman Park Min Cheol. 
 - Yes.

852
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:07,590
We're sending the departed on his way today.

853
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:10,220
Now is not the time for that.

854
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:12,380
I apologize.

855
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:14,930
I just spoke out of sympathy.

856
01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:21,140
But how wonderful it is that you'll take care of his son.

857
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:24,930
I'm sure that'll be of comfort to the late Assemblyman Choi.

858
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,310
Right?

859
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:32,800
I hope it will.

860
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:46,910
You wrapped it up without a hitch, right?

861
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:49,780
The case has been closed without an autopsy.

862
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:53,600
That's enough mourning.

863
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,830
Now that we took care of the problem,

864
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:57,780
let's get moving.

865
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:59,200
Yes.

866
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:02,350
 The old Byeongmun High building? 

867
01:04:02,350 --> 01:04:05,610
It's hard to store a lot of gold in one location.

868
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:08,110
It needs sufficient space, solid security,

869
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:11,180
and the right humidity and temperature.

870
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:14,270
They need to check all of that regularly.

871
01:04:14,270 --> 01:04:18,110
So what's off about it?

872
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:20,110
The electricity meter.

873
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:23,660
Despite the building being abandoned,

874
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:26,290
 the meter was on. 

875
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:29,340
 Students are banned entry, citing safety. 

876
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:31,800
If it's really about the students' safety,

877
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,700
they should've demolished it instead of leaving it.

878
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:36,000
I see...

879
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,140
So the old building is likely the spot, huh?

880
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:43,400
If the foundation is illegally hiding gold.

881
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,790
At least, it's worth investigating.

882
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:48,070
I'll check it out.

883
01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:49,780
   

884
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:51,460
   

885
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:53,540
   

886
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:00,880
   

887
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:19,500
   

888
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:48,340
   

889
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:53,440
Darn...

890
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,100
   

891
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:15,920
   

892
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:24,030
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Undercover Love Team ðŸ’– @Viki.com 

893
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,900
 Someone broke into the old building last night. 

894
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:38,310
 He'll be back. 

895
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:40,920
 Let's see how they play. 

896
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:42,360
 Don't even go near the old building. 

897
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:45,400
 They hid gold under the floorboards? 

898
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,800
 Don't you dare think of going in. 

899
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,200
 Especially the basement. 

900
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,410
 I've been there. I know. 

901
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:53,760
 Anyway, let's wrap up the mission today. 

902
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,700
 Follow me. 

903
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:56,890
 Are you a gangster? A thug? 

904
01:08:56,890 --> 01:08:58,800
 That bastard must've gone crazy. 

905
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,330
 I'm watching you. 

906
01:09:00,330 --> 01:09:01,790
 What have you been up to? 

907
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:03,070
 Is your name Jeong Hae Seong? 

908
01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:05,350
 Hey! Let's not do this. 

909
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:07,410
 I said let's stop. 

910
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:11,330
   

911
01:09:32,530 --> 01:09:34,000
Yes.

912
01:09:34,730 --> 01:09:36,260
That's it.

913
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:38,340
You're a student, all right.

914
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:40,130
Applause!

915
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:41,730
Applause!

916
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:45,390
It feels awkward.

917
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:47,060
- Will it be okay? 
 - It's okay. It's fine.

918
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:49,840
I choose you. Let's go eat.

919
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:52,200
Chosen.

920
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:55,090
I don't get it.
