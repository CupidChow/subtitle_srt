Don't.

40
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,560

171
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,930

172
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,190
- But we're on the third floor. - What?

173
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,600

I'm sorry. That's on me.

175

180

00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,710

00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,640
Let's go.

188
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,040
What the...

189
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,540
Get out here.

190
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,010
Jeong Hae Seong!

191
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,280
No, don't.

192
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:15,980
- Get them. - Yes, sir.

193
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,080
Su A, get going.

194
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,089
- I'll lure them my way. - But...

195
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,590
I'm an NIS agent.

196
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,290
You said you'd protect the kids.

197
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,290
Go and do just that.

198
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,790
Go.

199
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,630
That way. Get him!

200
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,140
Get him!

201
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,550
What the...

202
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,490
Get him. That way!

203
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,790
Yes, sir.

204
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,370
Darn.

205
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,210
Shoot.

206
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,890
Ms. Seo.

207
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,060
- Jeong Hae Seong... - Yes?

208
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,000
They weren't able to capture him.

209
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,510
Those incompetent fools.

210
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,830
(Byeongmun Foundation)

211
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,969
(Byeongmun High, for whom does it exist?)

212
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,029
(Do not crush their dreams.)

213
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,100
(Education is a right, not a privilege.)

214
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,140
(Byeongmun High, for whom does it exist?)

215
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,210
Byeongmun High, please.

216
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,690
We'll cut to the chase.

217
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,760
It's about time you stepped down.

218
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,130
The public is outraged,

219
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,290
and the foundation is unhealthy on the inside.

220
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,129
If you refuse to step down,

221
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,270
we will have to formally bring this up at the general meeting.

222
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,770
I urge you to make a decision before that.

223
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,239
It's right for you to step down.

224
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,669
- We need a decision. - Absolutely.

225
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,909
- I agree. - She should step down.

226
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,470
- The chairwoman... - Unbelievable.

227
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,409
- Has she no shame? - Just step down.

228
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,950
- Chairwoman, step down. - Come on.

229
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,410
Sure.

230
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,480
I am clear...

231
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,150
with where you all stand.

232
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,889
(Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju)

233
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:44,760
Once you pull me down from my position as chairwoman,

234
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,929
you're planning to dismiss me from this board.

235
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,700
Aren't I right?

236
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,100
Sure.

237
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:53,900
Do as you wish.

238
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:58,070
However, I urge you to follow protocol.

239
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,310
As stated in the bylaws,

240
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,939
bring me the consent of over three-fourths...

241
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,380
of the students and faculty members.

242
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,450
Until you do...

243
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,919
- What? - Has she no shame?

244
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,420
Don't forget...

245
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,550
that I'm...

246
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,720
your leader and master.

247
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,529
(Byeongmun Foundation)

248
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,630
Your tongues.

249
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,800
Be careful with what you say.

250
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,700
My gosh.

251
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,469
- What? - I can't believe her.

252
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,909
How can she be this way?

253
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,039
Has she no shame?

254
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,079
Does she think she owns us?

255
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,550
- Unbelievable. - I can't believe this.

256
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,850
Such vermin.

257
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,690
How dare they try to pull me down from my throne?

258
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,590
Either way, we'll need a way...

259
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,630
to calm the students down.

260
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,620
(Police)

261
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,669
The phone has been turned off,

262
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,440
and you'll be redirected to voicemail after the tone.

263
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:45,280
Hey. I'm only asking for my phone.

264
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:46,850
Come on.

265
00:17:46,851 --> 00:17:49,380
Don't be this way to a fellow officer of the law.

266
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,020
No can do.

267
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,050
But... Hey.

268
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,660
Yeong Hun, don't you have any connections?

269
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,230
How can we help Yeong Hun while in here?

270
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,730
My whole life,

271
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,100
I have been led by my integrity and conscience.

272
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,530
Of course I don't have any connections.

273
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,040
It's more like you're not competent enough!

274
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,270
Mi Jeong, what about you?

275
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,870
Don't you know any police officers...

276
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,550
My gosh.

277
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,320
Weren't you hurt?

278
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,950
Gladly, I wasn't.

279
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,250
What about you?

280
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,720
I arrived at the school and am doing what needs to be done.

281
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,960
You never know, so watch your back.

282
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,530
Same for you.

283
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,700
Have you found a way to get into your house?

284
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,460
I think I have...

285
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,170
although it has its flaws.

286
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,440
Hello? Hae Seong?

287
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,780
Hae Seong, is everything okay?

288
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
Hello?

289
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,710
Hae Seong.

290
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,980
- Hae Seong! - Hey, Su A.

291
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,120
Did something happen?

292
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,190
No. I'll call you later.

293
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,450
You do that.

294
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,670
(Byeongmun High, for whom does it exist?)

295
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,240
(Ms. Seo, rescind recent changes made to the school.)

296
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,949
(Byeongmun High, for whom does it exist?)

297
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:31,989
(Byeongmun Foundation and Byeongmun High...)

298
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:32,990
(of history and tradition...)

299
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,210
Scared you, didn't I?

300
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,880
That's for twisting my arm the other day.

301
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,810
And the flash drive?

302
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,860
I heard the recording.

303
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,160
I hate to admit it,

304
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,830
but you were right.

305
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,540
Don't tense up. I'm only here to talk.

306
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,980
- I'll have what he's having. - Sure.

307
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,590
Do you expect me...

308
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:14,950
to believe that?

309
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,260
It's the truth.

310
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,390
Seo Myeong Ju is behind everything.

311
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,460
Fine.

312
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,730
Let's say that's true.

313
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,239
I could slap cuffs on your wrists this instant,

314
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,400
but I'll play along.

315
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,040
Where's your proof?

316
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,680
In a flash drive...

317
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,380
that's at my house. Bring it to me.

318
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,250
What's in it for me?

319
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:42,920
The truth.

320
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,750
The truth?

321
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,690
What if there's no evidence or that you're lying?

322
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,360
This will be your collar.

323
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,130
That's something important to you.

324
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,730
What's the actual truth?

325
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,080
This is all I can do for you.

326
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,680
It's up to you...

327
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,510
to clear your name.

328
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,190
Senior Agent Gong.

329
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,460
I'm sorry for twisting your arm.

330
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,690
Jeong Hae Seong.

331
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,400
Shouldn't the apology be more formal?

332
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,870
He's cool, but borderline rude.

333
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:44,640
(Trustworthy police, safe country)

334
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,890
Excuse me.

335
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,460
How can I help you?

336
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,360
I'm turning myself in.

337
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,729
(Wanted Fugitive)

338
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,900
(Wanted Fugitive)

339
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,139
(Byeongmun High, for whom does it exist?)

340
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,439
(All subsidies canceled, Tuition raised by 50 percent)

341
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,609
(Ms. Seo, I strongly suggest...)

342
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,850
(you rescind recent changes made to the school.)

343
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,720
I apologize. I'll find out who posted this.

344
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,020
It was me.

345
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,360
I put that up.

346
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,090
Why?

347
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,090
I believe I already made myself clear.

348
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,859
Because your policies...

349
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,970
will only crush our students' future.

350
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,700
So?

351
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,239
I only ask because I'm curious.

352
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,810
Tell me. Do you believe...

353
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,939
that this lousy poster...

354
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,009
will change this school?

355
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,649
Historically, those who shifted the world...

356
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,450
were the powerless majority.

357
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,619
I know what you're thinking.

358
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,820
That I'm a powerless temp.

359
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,590
But that doesn't mean I'll give up on the students.

360
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,190
I'll squirm.

361
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,030
I'll do whatever it is I can.

362
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,130
Will it be like striking eggs on a rock?

363
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,870
Then I won't stop until that rock is shattered.

364
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,470
I am their teacher...

365
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,410
and have a duty to protect them.

366
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,610
I see. How admirable of you.

367
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,520
Fine, then.

368
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,789
The new policies we were going to implement?

369
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:36,190
Rescind them all.

370
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,220
Right.

371
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,590
Thank you.

372
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,730
I was about to do so anyway.

373
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,300
On one condition though.

374
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,470
Quit the school.

375
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,270
Why? Do you want to protect the kids...

376
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,140
but not at a price?

377
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:00,910
Right now at this exact moment!

378
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,679
Look deep into that heart...

379
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,150
that is hesitating to give me an answer.

380
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,490
Because that's who you are.

381
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,660
You're...

382
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,200
no better than the rest of us.

383
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,940
I'll gladly quit.

384
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,710
Sure.

385
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,270
But keep your word.

386
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,810
I'm sick of it.

387
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,079
Who is she to pretend she's kind and innocent...

388
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,250
thinking she's a martyr?

(An Yu Jeong)

390
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,799
Once I beat the dismissal proposal...

391
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,370
at the general board meeting next week,

392
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,840
implement the policies I said I wouldn't.

393
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,840
But...

394
00:26:02,841 --> 00:26:05,479
if you do that, the students will oppose even harder...

395
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,580
In what way?

396
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,650
As if they ever took action.

397
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,819
Gathering in groups to speak ill of me...

398
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,690
and gossiping online?

399
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,160
Did you know...

400
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:19,330
that insects can't hear people's footsteps?

401
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,860
But we, humans, can't hear them buzzing either.

402
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:27,570
Still, gather all the students in the main hall after school.

403
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,740
I need them on my side to beat the dismissal proposal.

404
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,170
You killed Jae Hyeon.

405
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,610
What am I supposed to do with this?

406
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,310
You must be thoroughly mistaken,

407
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,179
but I have no interest in an old cold case.

408
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,220
You.

409
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,720
You're the prime suspect in Director Kim Hyung Bae's murder.

410
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,160
Should a detective be this clumsy?

411
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,400
- I bet you got bad grades. - What?

412
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,230
See how long the recording is.

413
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,270
Anyone with a brain would think there's more on it.

414
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,070
Principal Park, why are you here...

415
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,520
Did Seo Myeong Ju order this?

416
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,790
This is why you should've kept your mouth shut.

417
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,400
Chairwoman Seo.

418
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,770
It's been handled.

419
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,170
Let's handle it on our end too.

420
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,470
We'll issue the arrest warrant.

421
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,970
But there's a procedure to follow.

422
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:42,880
How about this, then?

423
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,340
We'll investigate this first and...

424
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,610
Detective Cho Sang Cheol.

425
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,189
Don't make it look obvious...

426
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,460
that you're in league with Seo Myeong Ju.

427
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,630
Otherwise, I'll crush you.

428
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,800
Shoot.

433
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:35,529
What could the chairwoman suddenly want to say?

434
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:36,759
Beats me. Do you know anything?

435
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,560
- Do you? - I only know what you know.

436
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,000
- So she says. - So she says.

437
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,670
- She doesn't know. - Whatever.

438
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,539
- What's this about? - Who knows?

439
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,900
Let's hear what she has to say.

My beloved students at Byeongmun High.

441
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:10,660
I gathered you all here today...

442
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,770
to promise a few things.

443
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,830
First.

444
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,469
As for the school grades scandal, such a disgraceful event...

445
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,740
Regardless of whether it was true,

446
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:24,380
I assure you that it will not happen again at our school.

447
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,180
Second.

448
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,280
As for the new policies...

449
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,350
regarding discontinuation of the scholarship program...

450
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,350
and the tuition increase,

451
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,620
we have decided to scrap them altogether.

452
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,890
- Hey. - My gosh.

453
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,629
- Thank goodness. - Nice.

454
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:40,929
- I don't have to drop out. - What a relief.

455
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:41,959
- Thank goodness. - I know.

456
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,360
- I'm so relieved. - Seriously.

457
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,770

- She was here earlier. - Yes, I saw her too.

- We will protect you. - We'll do better.

- Take it back. - You can't do this to us.

555

- We have your back. - Yes, you can count on us.

- Ms. Oh, you can't do this. - We will protect you, Ms. Oh.

Take Ye Na and head home now.

558

Then...

559
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,170
you should hide too.

Do as I say.

00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,280
Please.

563
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,350
- Please. - Take it back.

00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,710
You are impatient.

570
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,610
You'll see me shortly anyway.

571
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:46,020
I'm not sure if I'll get to see you guys before I go.

572
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,230
In life,

573
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,799
there is only one thing that is fair to all.

574
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,860
Do you know what it is?

575
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,540
Death.

576
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,610

00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:14,550

580
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,800
- Just sign here. - Okay.

581
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,010
Where is Ye Na?

582
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:36,110
Principal Park took her home.

583

- What? - What is this?

584
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,090
- What? - What's going on?

585
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,130
What is this?

- Oh, no. - What's going on?

- My gosh! - What is this?

590
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,800
What is this smell?

591
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,470
Some kind of oil, I think.

592
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,670
- Oil? - Yes.

593
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,270
It's gasoline.

594
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,750
This gasoline will burn you rowdy cockroaches to death.

What do you think you're doing?

596

Don't move.

- Step aside! - My gosh!

603

- You came a little too late. - Put that down.

604
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,630
Put your gun down first.

605

It's too late.

613
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,430
You ruined everything already.

614
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,900
How many chances did I give you?

615
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,700
Every time you took away what was precious to me.

616
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,270
But now, what?

617
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,510
Let the kids go because they did nothing wrong?

618
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,870
I didn't take away anything.

Don't do it, Mom.

Please.

You can still keep her safe.

- Mom! - Go home!

Go back, where?

00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,320
Back to when?

00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,740
No!

- He caught it! - Nice catch!

649
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,889
- He caught it. - He caught the lighter.

650
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:53,089
- He caught it. - Thank goodness.

651
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:54,229
- Oh, my. - Hae Seong!

652
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,530
- Hae Seong! - Hae Seong!

653
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,630
- Hae Seong! - Yes!

654
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,530
- Amazing! - Go, Hae Seong!

655
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,400
- Oh, my! - Thank goodness!

656
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:16,680
- My gosh. - Well done!

657
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,830
Hae Seong.

658
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:47,280
- Get them. - Yes, sir.

659
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:51,820
Thanks, Hae Seong.

660
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,150
- Yes! - Go, Hae Seong!

661
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:05,830
That was nuts.

662
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,170
Good work.

663
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:08,700
You saved the school...

664
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:10,870
- and Yu Jeong... - Bye.

665
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,440
- Take good care of them. - What will happen now?

666
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,110
And everyone else. You saved all of them.

667
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:17,380
So? Do you want to head straight to the office now?

668
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,440
No, I want to talk to the kids first.

669
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,950
All right. They must've been terrified.

670
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,380
Check in on them with Ms. Oh.

671
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,050
Hey.

672
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,120
What's wrong with you?

673
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:30,990
Hey, look at me.

674
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,020
Your face... What happened?

675
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,260
I'm just a little tired.

676
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:37,800
- Let me go talk to the kids. - All right, then.

677
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,230
- Hey, let's go. - Yes, sir.

678
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,179
- Hae Seong! - Hae Seong!

679
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,349
- Hae Seong! - Hae Seong!

680
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:55,409
- Hae Seong! - Jeong Hae Seong!

681
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:56,410
- Hae Seong! - Hae Seong!

682
00:43:56,411 --> 00:43:57,419
- Hae Seong! - Hae Seong!

683
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,420
Dad!

684
00:43:58,421 --> 00:43:59,619
- Hae Seong! - Hae Seong!

685
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:00,620
- Hey. - Hae Seong.

686
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,620
- Hae Seong! - Call 911.

687
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:02,620
- Call 911. - Hae Seong!

688
00:44:02,621 --> 00:44:04,789
- Call 911! - I need my phone!

689
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:06,990
- Hae Seong! - Oh, no!

690
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,270
It's the Big Dipper.

691
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:18,169
Oh, my. You know about the Big Dipper?

692
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:19,600
You're so smart.

693
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,210
Dad.

694
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:23,010
What about the North Star?

695
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:26,140
The North Star?

696
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,280
If we have the Big Dipper, we need the North Star too.

697
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:31,180
Where is the North Star?

698
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:38,290
Si Hyun, the North Star you are looking for...

699
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:53,810
My goodness, look.

700
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:55,570
- You woke up. - Hae Seong.

701
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,439
- Are you all right? - My gosh.

702
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,640
- Are you okay? - What happened?

703
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:02,410
They said you had a mild concussion.

704
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,419
It would've been bad if you'd come any later.

705
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:07,220
Hey, how could you not tell me until this...

706
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:09,549
Goodness. Don't yell at him. He's still recovering.

707
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:10,760
Hey! Stop, seriously.

708
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,919
You really need to take better care of yourself.

709
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,990
As your teammate, I'm always so anxious and worried.

710
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:16,490
Oh, right.

711
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,530
Let's wake Yeong Hun up.

712
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,770
What happened to him?

713
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:23,569
He wanted to stay by your side.

714
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:25,070
He didn't sleep for a few days and collapsed.

715
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,610
I must say, he's loyal.

716
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:31,010
Although he can be dumb at times.

717
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,850
What about Seo Myeong Ju and Park Jae Mun?

718
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:36,410
The case is being tried. They're on trial now.

719
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:41,350
The problem is, Park keeps insisting that he did it alone.

720
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,790
Everything from the incident 22 years ago.

721
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,190
I made the decisions...

722
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:48,560
and did everything on my own.

723
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,170
Let me meet him.

724
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,590
I must say, this is awkward.

725
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,820
To see you without Seo Myeong Ju by your side.

726
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:31,270
I did some thinking.

727
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:34,110
"Who is Seo Myeong Ju to Park Jae Mun?"

728
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:38,610
"How could he be so devoted to one person?"

729
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,050
So I looked into it and learned you go way back.

730
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:43,949
You were an orphan,

731
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:45,980
and her family took you in when you were nine,

732
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:48,790
which means you've known her for over 40 years.

733
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:55,030
She's family to you. Am I right?

734
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,000
You'd risk your life to protect her.

735
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:03,400
I'm sorry to say this,

736
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,100
but you ruined her.

737
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:09,409
Care to explain?

738
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:10,980
Seo Myeong Ju.

739
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:14,380
In your eyes, did it look like she was doing okay?

740
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:16,950
What about Ye Na?

741
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,390
How do you think Ye Na felt as she watched her mom like that?

742
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:24,020
If you take the fall for everything, then what?

743
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,390
Do you think she'll be happy?

744
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:34,170
What are you trying to get at?

745
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,700
The choice is yours.

746
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,970
What would truly help her? Think about it.

747
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:42,670
Don't make her any more miserable than she already is.

748
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:57,760
Witness.

749
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:00,589
Do you have anything to say about Ms. Seo Myeong Ju,

750
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:02,290
the accused?

751
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,000
Witness, answer the prosecutor's question.

754
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:30,289
You said you had something to tell us about the murders...

755
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:32,890
of Jeong Jae Hyeon, Kim Hyeon Ho, and Kim Hyung Bae.

756
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:34,760
Am I right?

757
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:39,400
Please answer. Am I right?

758
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:43,299
(Witness)

759
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,440
Twenty-two years ago,

760
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:47,640
Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju...

761
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,640
killed Mr. Jeong Jae Hyeon,

762
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:55,550
who was an NIS agent at the time.

763
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,050
- What? Seriously? - So, it is true?

764
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:03,890
I did...

765
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:07,160
as Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju said.

766
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,090
Not only did I murder Kim Hyeon Ho,

767
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:11,900
but I also...

768
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,800
took the life of NIS Director Kim Hyung Bae.

769
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:17,400
I killed him too.

770
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:20,640
What?

771
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:24,010
- For real? - Is this true?

772
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,710
For all I did,

773
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:29,910
I put the blame...

774
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,520
on Jeong Hae Seong.

775
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,690
You traitor!

776
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,290
You traitor!

777
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:44,760
You traitor!

778
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,669
- Defendant! Be quiet! - Darn you!

779
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:51,239
- You! - There's a commotion,

780
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,339
so I'll sentence the defendant...

781
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:55,410
- after a short recess. - You!

782
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,550
You traitor!

783
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:04,120
You traitor!

784
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,380
You traitor!

785
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:11,320
You traitor!

786
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:16,530
Case number 2025-KH-9606. I'll deliver the sentence.

787
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,400
Despite the cruel nature of the crimes...

788
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,130
and the clear evidence,

789
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:23,469
the defendant made excuses...

790
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:26,740
that were impossible to believe, and refused to show remorse.

791
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,540
The defendant, Seo Myeong Ju...

792
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:30,780
is sentenced to life in prison.

793
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,700
Wait.

794
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:53,800
Ye Na.

795
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:57,900
I dropped out of school.

796
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,500
I want to start over.

797
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,040
On my own, without help.

798
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:17,920
I love you, Mom.

799
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:22,720
I love you so much,

800
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:25,290
but I need time...

801
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:27,630
to be able to understand you.

802
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,030
I'll visit you again.

803
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:20,340
It's time for morning assembly.

804
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:27,390
You have a visitor.

805
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:30,089
He thought he didn't say goodbye...

806
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:31,890
and wanted to actually do that.

807
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,560
Come in.

808
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:50,680
So...

809
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:54,250
I'm here too often...

810
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:56,010
considering I got expelled, right?

811
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:07,560
Okay.

812
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:10,090
The time...

813
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:13,660
I spent with you meant a lot.

814
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,500
They'll be fond memories.

815
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,200
I'll miss you.

816
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,540
I came to say this.

817
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:32,480
Study hard...

818
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,590
and listen to your teacher.

819
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:38,720
Bye.

820

Hey.

825
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,020
They're in shock.

826
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:07,590
It was a scary evening.

827
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:10,250
They're all pretty sensitive. Don't mind it too much.

828
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,690
Are you consoling me?

829
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:15,860
Look after them.

830
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,030
It hit them hard.

831
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:20,700
See you.

I hid it.

Why would you hide a star?

(Director An Seok Ho)

918
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,810
Uncle became way cool.

919
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:48,010
It's true that a title maketh man.

920
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,750
Good job.

921
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:09,530
Mi Jeong.

922
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,100
I think they opened the accounts overseas.

923
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,670
Yeong Hun finally gave up pursuing Mi Jeong.

924
01:03:15,970 --> 01:03:17,010
If you look at this...

925
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,340
But the funny thing is...

926
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:29,320
Let's call Interpol immediately...

927
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:31,490
to catch...

928
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,730
Mi Jeong.

929
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:41,630
Come with me.

930
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:46,570
I might become an uncle soon.

(Have a Drink With Su A)

932
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:52,109
- What is this? - You don't know anything.

933
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:53,339
This is how they dress.

934
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:55,350
Honey. Where's Hae Seong?

935
01:03:55,450 --> 01:03:58,020
If you think about it, treasures...

936
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:00,820
aren't that far away.

937
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,620
- What took you so long? - Hae Seong!

938
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:05,189
- Hae Seong. - Get over here.

939
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:06,590
- Hae Seong. - Hae Seong!

940
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:07,720
Sit down.

941
01:04:07,721 --> 01:04:09,129
- You're late. - My treasure...

942
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:11,060
It took him so long.

943
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:13,499
- are these people. - Sit down.

944
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,500
- You made it. - Have a drink.

945
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,530
- We were waiting. - Here.

946
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:20,600
No, wait. Mi Jeong's glass is empty.

947
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,509
- Here. - Wait.

948
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:23,540
What is it?

949
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:26,739
- My gosh. - No way!

950
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:27,980
How could you?

951
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:29,950
- You took your sweet time to tell. - My goodness!

952
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:33,880
Let's celebrate. Cheers.

953
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:36,750
- Congratulations! - Thanks.

954
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:39,190
The past I spent with them.

955
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,660
The present I'm spending with them.

956
01:04:42,690 --> 01:04:44,090
And the future I'll spend with them.

957
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,200
Every moment...

958
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,570
is sparkling.

959
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:52,600
I hope you find your own treasures.

960
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,570
Even if it takes time,

961
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:59,780
I hope you find the warmest and the brightest light.

962
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:03,049
I really do.

(Have a Drink With Su A)

964
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:11,620
They're the same stars, but they look different from here.

965
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,190
They're pretty.

966
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:15,790
I think you're prettier.

967
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:20,260
You've changed a lot in a few years.

968
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:27,500
- Su A. - What?

969
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:29,410
Close your eyes.

970
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:32,840
- Why? - Do it.

I'm your new homeroom teacher, Jeong Hae Seong.

I hope we get along.

976
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:14,280
- No way. - He's cool.

977
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,049
- I don't believe it. - He's cute.

978
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:17,280
You're so handsome.
