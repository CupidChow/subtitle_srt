1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,270
   

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,130
I-I-It's okay! Teachers!

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,210
Don't get too nervous about the superintendents.

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,210
What should I say... just trust me.

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,790
Business as usual, got it? Business as usual.

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,320
Got it? Just as you've been doing.

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,850
   

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:32,850
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Undercover Love Team 💖 @Viki.com 

9
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,290
Superintendents, welcome.

10
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,890
Come this way. This way, please.

11
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,600
Yes... this way...

12
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,430
I heard it. You almost died?

13
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,080
You'd better be extra careful from now on.

14
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,540
Our paths are crossing often lately.

15
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,500
The school uniform suits you.

16
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,420
But unfortunately,

17
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,510
it's time to...

18
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,530
stop playing student.

19
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,630
- Vice Principal. 
 - Yes?

20
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,410
Please take the teachers inside.

21
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,850
Got it.

22
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,900
Teachers, please go on inside.

23
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,790
Ms. Oh!

24
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,400
How did you get out?

25
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,440
It's a secret.

26
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,530
Please give back my name tag.

27
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,340
You can't find the gold without me.

28
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,360
"When the one with the bead heads toward the red sun,

29
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,750
the gold will shine."

30
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,250
   

31
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,010
   

32
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,280
Seo Byeong Mun must be the one with the bead.

33
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,530
Anything else you want to say to me?

34
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,210
Any cards I don't know about? Anything?

35
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,070
   

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,400
Make sure you don't leave anything behind.

37
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,670
Let's not ever see each other again.

38
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,320
Expulsion out of the blue? No way. Please reconsider.

39
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,040
I can't help it, either.

40
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,060
It's the chairwoman's orders. Who will defy her?

41
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,850
Even if it's from her, there are protocols.

42
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,290
The chairwoman doesn't own the school!

43
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,750
- How can you do that to a student— 
 - Ms. Oh Su Ah!

44
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,480
Stop it. You're at work.

45
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,400
- Vice Principal. 
 - I'm saying this clearly.

46
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,350
It's a decision from the top, so follow it.

47
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,710
Do not mention Jeong Hae Seong again.

48
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,500
You might get caught in the crossfire, Ms.Oh.

49
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,470
Okay?

50
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,540
Gosh! This is so frustrating.

51
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,930
You don't get how things are flowing.

52
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,010
This is so ridiculous the more I think about it.

53
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,690
What did Hae Seong do wrong?

54
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,020
Will we not see you again?

55
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,050
- Let us talk to the Chairwoman. 
 - Yes. Let's do that.

56
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,810
We can't let Hae Seong go like this.

57
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,170
Thanks for the gesture, you guys.

58
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,890
Don't barge into her office or anything like that.

59
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,260
I don't want you guys to get hurt because of me.

60
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,900
Are you really leaving like this?

61
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,070
I'll put everything back to normal.

62
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,580
It's been fun.

63
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,260
Hey, Hae Seong!

64
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,080
   

65
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:14,630
The parents in the GPA management program are asking for a meeting.

66
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,930
After pulling their kids from school?

67
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,700
Ignore them.

68
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,600
Acting out, not knowing their purpose is done...

69
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,000
Let's get rid of all of them.

70
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,200
Jeong Hae Seong...

71
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,480
   

72
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,380
   

73
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,220
You, too...

74
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,180
   

75
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,610
...won the lottery.

76
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,130
We're almost there.

77
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,720
I'd like to finish it off myself.

78
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,780
I think Director Kim pulled some strings.

79
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,150
Only he would get Seo Myeong Ju out.

80
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,700
Still, we had solid evidence and witnesses.

81
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,380
Destroying evidence is a piece of cake for him.

82
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,190
Same with witness tampering.

83
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,670
What do we do now?

84
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:09,260
If Hae Seong isn't in school, our mission is impossible.

85
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,970
It's clear our jobs got harder.

86
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,780
Still, we should look for a solution.

87
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,590
It was my father's last mission.

88
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,120
Getting kicked out doesn't mean it's over.

89
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,990
Right.

90
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,570
Our duty is to find the gold bars.

91
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,710
Not to remain at school.

92
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,230
- Let's find a solution somehow. 
 - Yes.

93
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,890
We're here from NIS Auditing.

94
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,720
Domestic Team 4, starting now,

95
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,630
we'll start a search and seizure of the office.

96
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,590
- What are you doing? 
 - Move.

97
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,540
Wait!

98
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,490
Just stay still.

99
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,020
Wait a minute.

100
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,230
Tell me the reason behind auditing.

101
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,930
- Why are you doing this? 
 - Found it.

102
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,310
Goodness...

103
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,790
We'll take you quietly. Come with us.

104
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,080
Wait, this is nonsense.

105
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,730
Let go. I said let go!

106
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,570
Whose orders are you following?

107
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,000
Who ordered you to do this?

108
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,400
Tell me before I crush you.

109
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,330
It's okay, Hae Seong.

110
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,900
Keep the office safe until I come back.

111
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,520
Let's go.

112
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,970
Get everything. Don't leave anything out.

113
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,850
Got it.

114
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,560
Come on...

115
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,450
What is this? Stop it!

116
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,000
   

117
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,540
It's Jeong Hae Seong.

118
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,540
I wanted to know if you liked my farewell gift.

119
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,980
 Now you're sending us gifts, too? 

120
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,450
 I'll get you something in return soon. 

121
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,170
Even if it's Ms. Oh Su Ah next?

122
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,140
 All your beloved teammates, Agent... 

123
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,620
 This was just a demo. To show you what happens if you keep messing around . 

124
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,620
Just a demo.

125
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,450
In Japan, at Niko Doshogu Shinsa,

126
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,280
 there's a sculpture of three wise monkeys. 

127
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,310
Don't watch, listen to, or speak of anything ill.

128
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,560
Agent, you think I'm a bad person.

129
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,130
 So, when it comes to me... 

130
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:37,770
don't watch, listen to... or do anything.

131
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,440
 Be a wise monkey. 

132
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,800
Giving me advice, even?

133
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,890
I must be putting a lot of pressure on you.

134
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:48,540
You think I'll let Ms. Oh Su Ah off easy?

135
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,500
I hope you get my point.

136
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,050
I was passing by and walking around.

137
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,130
Ma'am, one order of noodles and a soju glass.

138
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,680
Okay.

139
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,570
Are you going to give up like this?

140
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,450
I don't know.

141
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,780
Team Leader got dragged off to Auditing.

142
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,790
Seo Myeong Ju called me.

143
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,800
She says you're next.

144
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,160
Should I just quit everything?

145
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,090
Am I just being selfish?

146
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,300
That's what I'm thinking.

147
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,690
Get it together!

148
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:20,520
I went easy on you so you now think of me as a burden.

149
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,040
Hey. Don't be a wuss.

150
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,110
Don't worry about me. Just do it!

151
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,210
I'm okay, Hae Seong.

152
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,750
It's because you're scared.

153
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,660
That your people might get hurt because of you.

154
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,320
But I'll help you until the end.

155
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,400
So, at least for my sake...

156
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,240
I don't want you to be scared.

157
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,050
Aren't you scared?

158
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,590
I am.

159
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,600
But I'm clenching my teeth and sticking through.

160
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,550
I can't just watch the chairwoman take the gold.

161
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,330
If her project comes to completion,

162
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,620
the kids' dreams will collapse in a second.

163
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,550
You're the adult.

164
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,620
You think I'm a teacher for nothing?

165
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,810
You look better when you smile.

166
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,180
Really?

167
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,290
Cheers for tomorrow!

168
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,680
Cheers.

169
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,530
   

170
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,070
What happened?

171
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,770
Suspended until further notice.

172
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,840
The team is dissolved.

173
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,830
I'm sorry. It's all because of me.

174
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,240
Stop being weak. It's unlike you.

175
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:23,160
- If this has gotten you down... 
 - Ahjussi, I'm going to keep going.

176
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,380
 I... 

177
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,810
want to correct what went wrong.

178
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,840
Please help me.

179
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,430
Okay, man.

180
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,470
 That's my boy. 

181
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,790
Let's meet at my place starting tomorrow.

182
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:44,000
 Yes, Sunbae! 

183
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:49,930
That's the first time Sunbae has asked for help.

184
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,100
You heard, right?

185
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,360
Starting tomorrow, we will gather at Hae Seong's.

186
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,130
You did great work.

187
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:07,050
Should I be thanking you somehow?

188
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,810
Please don't ask me for such favors again.

189
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,530
If we uncover the past, none of us will be proud.

190
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,110
Moving forward, let's be prudent.

191
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:18,540
My father always used to say this.

192
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,150
If you start giving your servant white rice,

193
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:24,190
they start thinking they're nobility.

194
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,860
Chairwoman.

195
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:30,110
You shouldn't talk to me like that—

196
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,520
Mr. Kim Hyeong Bae,

197
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,990
the director's seat you're sitting in? I put the cushion there for you.

198
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,270
Listen carefully.

199
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,120
Know your place. Don't talk back.

200
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,850
Just like you've done for a long time...

201
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,960
just stuff the feed I give you.

202
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,830
Don't just nod. Answer me.

203
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,910
Principal.

204
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:13,940
Good boy. That a boy.

205
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,810
Wait, I'm Group D.

206
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,580
Then, we can't eat right now?

207
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,140
No way!

208
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,110
Out of the way!

209
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,760
- I'm Group B. 
 - Me, too!

210
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,130
What is this?

211
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:40,340
Chairwoman's orders to eat in order of our grades.

212
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,680
I thought you knew.

213
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,520
Of all things, with our food? Really?

214
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,310
    
 Jeong Hae Seong? All of a sudden?

215
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,470
You're in touch with Jeong Hae Seong?

216
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,860
Why is he calling me?

217
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,230
It must be a mistake. He's never called me.

218
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,410
I'm starving!

219
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,890
A. This way.

220
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,140
That reaction is very suspicious.

221
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,800
Chae Rin.

222
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,830
- You're over there. 
 - Me?

223
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,840
Why me?

224
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,830
Agent Jeong Hae Seong, this is An Yu Jeong.

225
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,900
Starting my report now.

226
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,060
Report.

227
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,670
First of all, lunches.

228
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,860
We're eating in order of our grades now.

229
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,110
 We have different side dishes. If we have bad grades, we eat later. 

230
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,150
How are Dong Min and the kids?

231
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:53,580
- Your friends? Isn't it obvious? They're at the very end. 
 - Anything else?

232
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,660
Moving forward, only the Advanced Class gets night study hall.

233
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,770
No one else is allowed to, even if you want to.

234
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,860
They're just accommodating the Advanced Class.

235
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,580
 They'll publish the midterm results on boards. 

236
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,320
Since the chairwoman came back, it's been weird.

237
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,830
Can... NIS fix this?

238
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,480
I'm hanging up.

239
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,580
So rude!

240
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,980
Hey, do you have a trivet?

241
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,440
Hey!

242
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,110
Get something to put under this.

243
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,810
Okay.

244
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,360
Didn't I mention it?

245
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,900
Seo Myeong Ju solved the third urban legend.

246
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,260
What?

247
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,490
I guess I didn't. I think she looked inside the notebook.

248
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,560
Geez. You sure took your sweet time telling us.

249
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,850
Incredible, Jeong Hae Seong.

250
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,660
Thank you for the compliment.

251
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:12,440
But, thankfully, I don't think she's solved the fourth story yet.

252
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,980
I mean, we haven't, either.

253
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,770
Take a look at this.

254
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,400
Student Council literary collection?

255
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,650
The teacher, Kim Jae Yeong. That's my father.

256
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,560
I had something I wanted to give you.

257
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,820
What is this?

258
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:37,600
Student Council literary collection from when your dad was a teacher.

259
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,490
His name was Kim Jae Yeong.

260
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,210
Was your father a NIS agent, too?

261
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,760
   

262
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,590
   

263
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,910
At midnight, a computer turns on in an empty classroom.

264
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,740
The ghost of a dead teacher

265
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:04,680
writes inside the assignment book. In red letters.

266
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:12,290
So, this is the last urban legend of Byeongmun? According to this.

267
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,450
But isn't something weird?

268
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,800
The computer.

269
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,270
Seo Byeong Mun died in 1957.

270
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:22,180
We didn't have computers in the country then.

271
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,440
Then, this urban legend isn't Seo Byeong Mun's.

272
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,870
If not that guy, who?

273
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,700
The person who compiled this collection.

274
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,330
There were originally only three legends, but he wanted to confuse people.

275
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:41,820
Or to prevent Seo Myeong Ju from getting to the gold.

276
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,890
If the fourth urban legend didn't exist, there is only one possibility.

277
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,540
The meaning of this phrase...

278
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,690
If we can solve it, we will know where the gold bars are.

279
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,320
So? How did it go?

280
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,160
We searched the gym, auditorium, everywhere.

281
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,360
But we haven't found anything.

282
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:17,070
 Has our school gym ever been remodeled? 

283
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,380
 I hear a lot of funny stories around school. 

284
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,360
Oh, he lied to me in the midst of all that.

285
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:28,790
Fine. Starting tomorrow, search the main building.

286
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,830
As fast as possible.

287
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,630
We've revealed each other's cards by now.

288
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:35,380
From now on, it's a speed game. Okay?

289
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,190
Got it.

290
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,640
The one with the bead. "Hwi gyeong."

291
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,050
This phrase refers to Seo Byeong Mun.

292
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,370
The gold will shine. The final spot where the gold is.

293
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:54,610
When Seo Byeong Mun faces the red sun...

294
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:57,820
that's where the gold is?

295
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,550
What is the red sun?

296
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,110
Seo Byeong Mun is a problem, too.

297
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,020
A dead man isn't going to jump out of his coffin.

298
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,140
Where is he supposed to face?

299
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:11,290
- Maybe he left his avatar at school. 
 - An avatar?

300
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:14,890
Protecting the gold from the grave.

301
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,960
With two eyes wide open.

302
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,540
What is this nonsense?

303
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,100
Go home if you'll be like this!

304
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,950
No, wait, wait. Yeong Hun has a point.

305
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,680
See? I have a point.

306
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,370
Then, an avatar that symbolizes Seo Byeong Mun...

307
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,140
What could it be?

308
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:38,230
Hey, you've been at school. You would know.

309
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,110
Seo Byeong Mun...

310
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,930
His portrait?

311
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,360
A portrait?

312
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,220
There are too many of them.

313
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,880
Seo Byeong Mun's...

314
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,570
bust.

315
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,780
Look it up.

316
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,600
"As the Minister of Finance of the Korean Empire,

317
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,020
he also served as the Chief of the Royal Treasury and established the Hwigyeong Private Academy.

318
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:08,430
When the country was stolen, he worked hard for the Independence Movement

319
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:13,720
and served as the first Chairman of Hwigyeong, contributing to improving national education."

320
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,350
Seo Byeong Mun wasn't an independence activist but was pro-Japanese.

321
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:22,400
Heading toward the red sun means he was proactively pro-Japanese.

322
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,590
Hey, where are you going?

323
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,130
School. I'm going to check.

324
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:32,300
How are you going to school? You got expelled.

325
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,820
Right.

326
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,790
   

327
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:44,030
   

328
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,730
After Hae Seong was expelled, the school atmosphere isn't good, huh?

329
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:58,550
It's confusing and unsettling.

330
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,000
There might've been a lot of incidents, but it was fun to have Hae Seong around.

331
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,470
But why did the chairwoman get fixated on him like that?

332
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,750
Do you know anything, Ms. Oh?

333
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,780
No, not really.

334
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:24,000
Aigoo, all these new guidelines...

335
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,760
I don't know what's happening to this school.

336
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,090
I wish someone would come to shake things up.

337
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,220
 Delivery. 

338
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,060
Come on in.

339
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,230
You can put it here.

340
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,160
Enjoy.

341
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,660
Thank you.

342
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,380
Hey!

343
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,810
"Hey"?

344
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:56,810
My stomach hurts!

345
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,290
Have this without me and go home!

346
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:02,760
- What? 
 - My stomach!

347
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,810
This is tasty, though.

348
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,590
Hey! Are you crazy?

349
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,540
You can't come in here!

350
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,620
You must be out of your mind!

351
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,490
This was the best option.

352
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,350
My heart is still beating.

353
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,670
What if the chairwoman catches you?

354
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,590
I need to check something.

355
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,960
What about the bust?

356
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,360
Did you find it?

357
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,530
If my guess is right.

358
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:55,970
So... he stole precious independence funds and hid them here?

359
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,750
Inside his bust?

360
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:00,420
Wow, I'm getting pissed.

361
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:02,990
Wait, what are you doing?

362
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:06,400
You know how much he delayed our independence?

363
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,890
And he calls himself an independence activist? Contributed to national education?

364
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,210
Hey, don't touch it!

365
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,100
I'll have his head!

366
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,980
Who is it?

367
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,220
Ms. Oh?

368
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,840
Vice Principal, what are you doing here?

369
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,740
I left something behind.

370
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,860
Who is that behind you?

371
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,990
I ordered some late-night snacks.

372
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,970
But he couldn't find his way out, so...

373
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,170
If you're here to deliver food then do that.

374
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,430
Why are you loitering here?

375
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,040
Well, that's...

376
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,530
He was interested in our school's history, so...

377
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:04,100
Wait a second.

378
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,150
Where are you from?

379
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,660
Your number.

380
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,140
You can't even answer my question.

381
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,040
You are very suspicious.

382
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,170
Take off your helmet.

383
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,220
What are you doing? Take off your helmet!

384
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:27,080
If you won't, I'm calling the police.

385
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,880
Okay.

386
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,860
Guess who!

387
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:55,380
Ms. Oh, I'm sorry, but what are you doing?

388
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,300
- Are you— 
 - Huh?

389
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,350
Are you serious?

390
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,750
Ms. Oh! What are you doing?

391
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,550
Go!

392
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,330
Are you...

393
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,080
Let me go!

394
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,690
Why are you so strong?

395
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,000
My eyes... What did you do?

396
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:20,930
Where? Where did that guy go?

397
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:24,930
- He's behind in deliveries. 
 - Do you think that makes sense right now?!

398
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:27,570
Where did you order from? Huh?

399
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,270
What app were you using?

400
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,050
I don't know.

401
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,940
Hey, what happened?

402
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,350
Aigoo! You scared me!

403
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,790
Just stay still.

404
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,550
- It's the bust. 
 - It turns.

405
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:55,570
- Daebak. So? 
 - So?

406
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,490
What happened after it turned?

407
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,380
I don't know.

408
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,690
Why not?

409
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,010
I got caught.

410
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,690
Y-Y-You got caught?

411
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,560
By who?

412
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,660
I didn't.

413
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,340
I got caught, but I didn't.

414
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:17,970
What is he saying right now? Please someone translate!

415
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,680
I had my helmet on. Don't worry.

416
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,330
That's not what's important.

417
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,760
How do we get the gold bars out of it?

418
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,180
Hey, man. How do we do that?

419
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,520
We will have to think about that now.

420
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,740
What?

421
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,310
Look at him! What the hell are you talking about?

422
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,020
How can you not have any ideas?!

423
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,490
You said you had one!

424
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:36,560
Then, you go, bastard!

425
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,700
- How dare you? What do you mean? 
 - How would I go?

426
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,750
Stop it! Quiet!

427
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,320
I went through all that...

428
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:48,120
The lunches separated by grade are getting resistance from the students.

429
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:50,880
Even with criticism, history moves forward.

430
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,140
Don't worry about it.

431
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,100
But, Chairwoman, if they continue to complain...

432
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,060
Even when dogs bark, trains keep running.

433
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,120
Don't worry about it.

434
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,370
Next, Vice Principal?

435
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:06,180
Yes. A proposal on rules about external visitors.

436
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,310
- External visitors? 
 - Yes.

437
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:11,560
In the past five years, all grades have had an uptick of bypassers...

438
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,290
But we have no security issues here.

439
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,900
But sometimes teachers working late

440
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,850
use food delivery apps.

441
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:20,530
Yesterday, Ms. Oh Su Ah did.

442
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:21,870
Ms. Oh Su Ah?

443
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,530
Tell me clearly.

444
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:24,720
Ah, yes.

445
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,120
Actually, yesterday, Ms. Oh and a delivery guy...

446
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,990
was talking underneath the late chairman's bust.

447
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,430
She said he was delivering food.

448
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:35,510
He should've delivered the food and left. I asked why he was chatting.

449
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,710
She said she was explaining our school's history.

450
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:44,010
The delivery guy wouldn't have come in a van.

451
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,950
It's Jeong Hae Seong.

452
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:52,680
To find the gold bars, he could try to enter the school again.

453
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,890
What should we do?

454
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:57,600
Even though I asked him so politely.

455
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:02,300
Let's send him the second gift we prepared.

456
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,140
Come in.

457
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,230
Please proceed with the plan.

458
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,840
You must be very busy.

459
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,270
I think so.

460
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,740
What is it again?

461
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,240
If it's about how the school is run, don't even.

462
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,190
It's about Hae Seong.

463
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,620
I thought about it for a day.

464
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,020
But I could only come to one conclusion.

465
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:33,670
You knew, right? That Hae Seong wasn't a student.

466
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,210
That he's an NIS agent.

467
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,300
That's why you expelled him, right?

468
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,940
Everything that's been happening at school...

469
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,390
Mr. Jun Ho, you, the principal...

470
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:44,830
Hae Seong's real identity and his expulsion.

471
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,680
There's something I don't know, right?

472
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,300
Ye Na, if I don't tell you something,

473
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,390
it's because you don't need to know.

474
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,870
Please tell me.

475
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:56,490
I have the right to hear it, Mom.

476
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,960
Everything has trial and error, right?

477
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,220
A bigger ocean has larger waves.

478
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:13,920
What matters is that Edu-City will be completed,

479
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,400
and its owner will be me, Seo Myeong Ju.

480
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,180
And you will carry the baton after me.

481
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:26,730
That's all you need to know. I will take care of the rest.

482
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,660
Mom.

483
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,760
Have you ever...

484
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,900
thought about what I wanted, even once?

485
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,110
I believe...

486
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,500
the day will come when you'll understand me.

487
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,440
I truly believe that.

488
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,340
Should we go for a walk?

489
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,510
It's been a while since you and I hung out alone.

490
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:09,350
It's so cold out these days.

491
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:11,370
Come on outside.

492
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,380
What is wrong with him?

493
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,530
Wow, seriously?

494
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,350
That scared me.

495
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:37,810
Hello?

496
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:42,490
It definitely turned around...

497
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,520
Ms. Su Ah, what are you doing? No class?

498
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,370
I'm headed to class. Don't you need to go, too?

499
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:09,270
Catch your breath. You look like you're about to faint.

500
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:14,390
I'm headed to Homeroom 2. Let's go together.

501
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,600
What is this?

502
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:41,330
- Look at this, guys! 
 - What?

503
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,580
What's this?

504
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,730
What? Daebak!

505
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,650
What is this?

506
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:48,760
Isn't this Hae Seong?

507
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,640
Isn't that Ms. Su Ah?

508
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,720
What's this?

509
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,480
   

510
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:18,410
They should've listened when I said it nicely.

511
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,030
These Koreans...

512
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,250
All right.

513
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,810
Let's start class. Where did we get to last class?

514
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:55,400
Ms. Oh, what's with the photos?

515
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,170
Are you really dating a student?

516
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:59,860
She's not denying it. Must be true.

517
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,960
I told you I saw them at the hospital.

518
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,650
I told you there's something with these two.

519
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:05,400
 Seriously? 

520
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,570
 That's crossing the line. 

521
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:09,460
 That's way too much. 

522
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,830
Ms. Oh Su Ah,

523
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:15,070
the chairwoman is looking for you.

524
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,730
We're in the middle of class. I'll come later.

525
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:21,970
You no longer... have to teach a class.

526
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,290
 Is she getting fired? 

527
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,730
 - Fired?  
 - Let's go.

528
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:44,030
Who dares to interfere with her class?

529
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,770
Hae Seong...

530
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:19,230
We are in front of the kids.

531
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:23,000
Why don't you go back to work, Principal?

532
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:45,840
It's only been a few days.

533
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,510
But it's good to see you.

534
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:52,060
Should we clap?

535
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,510
Clap. Clap!

536
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,010
Clap!

537
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,650
Are you crazy?

538
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,740
Why did you come here?

539
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:18,850
The reason I'm here today is to tell you all the truth.

540
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:21,480
The photos you saw this morning...

541
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,840
They're real.

542
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,730
 They're real? 

543
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,870
They're real...

544
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:33,680
But you shouldn't mistake this.

545
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:39,140
Your teacher... did not go on a date with a minor.

546
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,200
 What? 

547
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,990
 Makes no sense... 

548
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,820
 Ms. Oh... 

549
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,710
Sixth-year reservist of the Republic of Korea.

550
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,930
My current age is 31.

551
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,300
 What? 

552
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,490
 He's an uncle. 

553
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:13,030
- Who's your uncle? 
 - Sixth-year reservist? 31?

554
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:16,760
Anyway, I'm sorry I lied to you.

555
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,800
From now on, call me hyung.

556
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,320
 Hyung! 

557
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:24,570
 So crazy. 

558
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,300
- Hae Seong hyung! 
 - He's a hyung!

559
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,930
   

560
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:33,390
- Jeong Hae Seong is back in Homeroom 1. 
 - Jeong Hae Seong?

561
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:35,860
 Jeong Hae Seong is back! 

562
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,410
Did the bell ring?

563
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:46,180
Chairwoman.

564
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:52,220
Jeong Hae Seong is on campus.

565
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,890
Look, it's Jeong Hae Seong.

566
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:04,620
 Wow. 

567
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,080
 Look. 

568
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,220
 Looks like it's true. 

569
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,560
All right.

570
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,450
Any questions?

571
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,070
Yes, Chae Rin.

572
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:22,170
Why did you lie about your age to come here?

573
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,130
I didn't tell you that part.

574
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,150
To tell you the truth,

575
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:35,450
I'm a member of...

576
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,430
the National...

577
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:51,960
I have trauma from missing national education.

578
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,030
What is he saying?

579
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,930
- He never went to high school. 
 - No high school...

580
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:01,020
I lived a tough life.

581
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:05,950
As a Korean citizen, I figured I needed a high school diploma...

582
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,230
 You can stay. 

583
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:09,180
 So cool! 

584
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,500
 So amazing. 

585
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,180
That's why...

586
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:16,030
I came here.

587
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:18,580
What about the photos of you two?

588
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,650
What's your relationship?

589
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,880
She helped me adjust at school.

590
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,470
Also,

591
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:36,440
I like you a lot.

592
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:42,500
♫  The early dawn, it reminds me of  ♫

593
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,590
♫  Your smile, your voice  ♫

594
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:48,800
♫  It shines within my heart  ♫

595
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:55,430
♫  Deeper and deeper, spreading into my heart  ♫

596
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:58,930
So cool!

597
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:02,860
♫  And just being together guides me to life  ♫

598
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:07,030
♫  I'm in love with you  ♫

599
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:09,790
♫  Feel my heart, love you most forever  ♫

600
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:12,220
 Kiss, kiss! 

601
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,850
 Kiss, kiss! 

602
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:19,660
 Kiss, kiss! 

603
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,960
♫  Feel the glow as we shine forever  ♫

604
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,440
♫  Your soft hands make me dream of you  ♫

605
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,780
♫  My love is only you  ♫

606
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,690
You turned an ugly rumor into romance.

607
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:36,150
Genres change, you know.

608
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:39,330
Depending on the protagonist's choice.

609
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:41,950
Relax your face.

610
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:44,000
I can tell you're pissed off.

611
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:49,530
Also, it's my turn now.

612
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,920
Look forward to it.

613
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,060
Jeong Hae Seong.

614
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,320
What's up?

615
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,760
I'll walk you to the gate.

616
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,260
Sounds good.

617
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,430
Let's go, Ms. Oh.

618
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,990
How did Jeong Hae Seong respond so quickly?

619
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:52,740
- Unless the information was leaked... 
 - That's what I mean. Who leaked the information?

620
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,690
Only you and I know about the photos—

621
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,780
Ye Na, what's taking you so long?

622
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:00,370
I'm waiting.

623
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:02,070
I'm coming.

624
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:21,330
Thanks for your help this morning.

625
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:29,380
 Hello? 

626
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,340
 I need to tell you something. 

627
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,600
 It's about you and Ms. Su Ah. 

628
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,930
 Stop, stop. 

629
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:42,010
 What brings you here? 

630
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:49,040
 He's my friend. 

631
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:51,500
 Go on in. 

632
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:54,370
 Okay... 

633
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:55,950
 Go in. 

634
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:02,090
No worries.

635
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:05,070
Ms. Su Ah is important person to me, too.

636
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:09,410
Oh, do I need to speak formally now?

637
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:13,300
I'll just keep it casual.

638
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,350
That's okay, right?

639
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:16,420
Whatever you want.

640
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,570
Why did you give me a heads-up?

641
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:31,970
I don't know.

642
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:36,790
It just... felt like the right thing to do.

643
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,370
Let me ask you a question, too.

644
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:44,740
Why did you come to our school?

645
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:47,380
Is it by chance...

646
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:50,650
because of my mom?

647
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,550
Later.

648
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,790
I'll tell you later if the opportunity arises.

649
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,250
I'm home.

650
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,190
Why did you do that?

651
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:19,220
Why did you do that for Jeong Hae Seong?

652
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:22,420
Ye Na, gosh...

653
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:25,330
I'm so frustrated.

654
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:28,470
I'm asking you a question.

655
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:33,460
Gosh, so frustrating...

656
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:37,060
Why aren't you answering me when I am asking you something?

657
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,610
Ye Na, lately, you...

658
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:41,110
Why do you keep acting out lately?

659
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:42,990
Because of you.

660
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:51,640
Hae Seong asked me the same question.

661
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,920
I told him I had no idea why.

662
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,410
But I think I know why now.

663
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:57,450
It was all because of you.

664
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,540
You seem so dangerous lately.

665
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:09,790
This is not working.

666
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:14,050
Ye Na, let's send you to study abroad.

667
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:15,400
Mom.

668
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,140
As soon as possible. Within a week.

669
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:19,330
I won't go. I'm going to stay!

670
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:21,250
Don't you dare whine!

671
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:26,230
Ye Na...

672
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:27,710
I give the orders.

673
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:30,220
You just follow.

674
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,250
 Yes, Chairwoman. 

675
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:57,790
Please find the gold safe within today.

676
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:01,110
Even if you have to tear apart the main building.

677
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,640
I cannot let Jeong Hae Seong...

678
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:13,160
take it from me.

679
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,000
Have you seen this on the internet?

680
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,690
A crazy guy in his thirties pretended

681
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:20,920
he was a high school student.

682
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,120
Wow, that's crazy. Is he a pervert?

683
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:29,350
In that sense, we're living in the final days of this world.

684
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:31,900
A full-grown adult had nothing better to do?

685
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,290
Gosh, what a crazy guy.

686
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:35,870
That's me.

687
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:41,270
- What? 
 - It's me.

688
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,580
Eat up.

689
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,080
Thank you.

690
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:50,210
Hey, hey.

691
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:52,450
Stop eating. Talk first.

692
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:54,100
Are you saying...

693
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:58,720
you're the subject of the internet rumor?

694
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,060
Yes.

695
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,330
Wow, look at this.

696
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:05,440
You fully came out to the kids.

697
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,070
At least I didn't say I'm a part of NIS.

698
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:08,620
I did good, right?

699
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:12,600
I'm about to have a stroke.

700
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,420
Give me some water.

701
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:19,550
Why did you do that out of the blue?

702
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:23,520
Seo Myeong Ju threatened me with a photo of Su Ah and me.

703
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,210
I had no choice.

704
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,980
She helped us with the mission all along.

705
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,090
We can't let her get hurt.

706
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,970
Hey. Be honest.

707
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:38,340
Something is going on between you two, huh?

708
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:40,190
What are you saying?

709
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,430
- On the house. 
 - Thank you.

710
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:46,140
Something is going on.

711
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,150
It's mutual.

712
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:53,310
Anyway, that's not what's important.

713
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:55,990
If we don't secure the gold safe tonight,

714
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:57,800
Seo Myeong Ju might take it.

715
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,600
How can we get the gold safe tonight?

716
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,710
The chairwoman is safeguarding the school, and we're suspended.

717
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:06,950
We can't even issue a warrant. We can't move.

718
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:11,380
With the heightened security, it'll be harder to sneak in.

719
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,660
Right.

720
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:17,290
That's why... we'll raid the school loud and proud.

721
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:24,240
Where is it?

722
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:38,160
 Chairwoman, your bust sculpture for the Edu-City building is now ready. 

723
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,050
We don't even know if Edu-City will happen.

724
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:43,120
Bust, my foot...

725
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:50,600
Bust...

726
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,860
What represents you...

727
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:01,140
What symbolizes you...

728
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,270
 What? 

729
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:03,930
Why? Too weird?

730
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:06,650
Weird aside,

731
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:10,230
it just makes no sense.

732
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:12,620
Even if it somehow made sense,

733
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:14,200
we couldn't do it.

734
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,020
Where would we get support personnel?

735
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:21,470
We can't ask the company for help since it's behind Director Kim's back.

736
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:23,620
Can I help?

737
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:28,580
You, ma'am?

738
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,230
My daughter told me about you.

739
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:38,130
Thank you for protecting my daughter, Son-in-law Jeong.

740
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:39,730
"Son-in-law Jeong"?

741
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:43,120
I hear you need people for the mission.

742
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,030
How many do you need?

743
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:08,690
Have you eaten, noonim?

744
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:10,570
Gosh, noonim.

745
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:13,790
Honor to have you in our pigsty post-retirement.

746
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:18,190
It's been a while, Bongcheon-dong Blood Chicken Clan.

747
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:21,980
Let's go on a mission.

748
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,230
 Yes, noonim. 

749
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,030
Did you know about your mother's past?

750
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:53,330
I just found out. I won't fight her again.

751
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:59,920
Why are they called the Blood Chicken Clan?

752
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,990
Sea of Blood was too old-school, and

753
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:05,740
back in the day, she ran a fried chicken shack.

754
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:08,920
They couldn't have called it Saucy Chicken Clan.

755
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,910
Sorry.

756
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,070
Ready?

757
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:17,830
 Yes, noonim! 

758
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:18,870
Let's go!

759
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:20,650
 Yes! 

760
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:24,800
See you later, agents.

761
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,810
 Yes, thank you. 

762
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,260
Gosh...

763
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:52,570
I feel like a storm ripped through.

764
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:55,720
Anyway, we'll get going, too.

765
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:56,920
See you later.

766
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,710
We'll be right there.

767
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,860
Are you staying?

768
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:06,960
How can you be so clueless...

769
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:10,390
Let's go.

770
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:20,020
Today's mission marks the end of student Jeong Hae Seong.

771
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,560
I feel wistful thinking about that.

772
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,930
You looked good in a school uniform.

773
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,120
- Is that right? 
 - Yeah.

774
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:31,070
How do you feel?

775
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:34,250
Do you feel sad about saying bye to the kids?

776
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:36,790
I am sad.

777
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:40,540
I think I'll miss them.

778
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:45,410
See you.

779
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:46,500
Hae Seong.

780
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,960
Huh?

781
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:52,570
After the mission,

782
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:56,630
let's grab a meal together.

783
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:58,060
Meal?

784
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:01,340
Sure.

785
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:04,960
- But out of the blue? 
 - Yes.

786
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:09,420
I just wanted to ask. Let's have a meal.

787
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:11,380
Sure.

788
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:12,730
Let's have a meal.

789
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:14,730
And let's drink coffee, too.

790
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:15,740
Yeah.

791
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:17,330
Bye.

792
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:36,390
The bust, the bust.

793
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:37,880
The founding chairman's bust.

794
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,810
The safe is beneath the bust.

795
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:41,300
I'm headed to school right now.

796
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:44,750
Go ahead and remove the bust right now.

797
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:48,060
Yes.

798
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:55,760
 Go and find it! 

799
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,160
 Hurry up and move! 

800
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:10,220
Did you lift up the bust?

801
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:14,010
Chairwoman, you better get here quickly.

802
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:17,450
 Barricade! 

803
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:21,190
Block.

804
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,880
All right.

805
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,330
Hey.

806
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,400
You can't do this.

807
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:33,680
Car coming in. To your position. Hurry.

808
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,420
- Move it. 
 - Yes, ma'am.

809
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:37,510
Stay alert.

810
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:39,620
Stop wasting time!

811
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:40,680
Hurry up!

812
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:43,110
- Better get inside! Hurry! 
 - Hurry!

813
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:44,750
What are you doing?

814
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:49,330
What are you doing at my school right now?

815
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:53,230
You can talk to me, Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju.

816
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,910
I'm here from the National Intelligence Service.

817
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:00,520
Mr. NIS agent.

818
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,790
What's all this about?

819
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:04,960
I'm sorry I couldn't notify you in advance.

820
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,450
We received a tip that...

821
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:12,000
- a spy has infiltrated Byeongmun High. 
 - A spy?

822
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,230
Official term is North Korean spy.

823
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:17,930
He crossed the Incheon Sea to collect intel.

824
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:26,960
I see.

825
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:31,930
Why don't we confirm?

826
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:36,860
Rotate just like that.

827
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:38,630
Go.

828
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:41,150
Okay. Relax.

829
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:43,570
All right. Good job.

830
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:46,470
- Hello? 
  - This is Seo Myeong Ju. 

831
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:48,930
Hyeong Bae oppa is busy right now.

832
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:50,900
 Are you the missus? 

833
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,220
Seriously? With this janky setup?

834
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:04,190
- How dare you... 
 - We will verify the tip once we investigate.

835
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:07,190
Until then, Chairwoman, for your safety...

836
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:09,710
Sure.

837
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:12,790
Principal.

838
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:16,090
Why don't we call people, too? Right now.

839
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,580
Yes.

840
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:23,610
Excuse me, this way.

841
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:25,370
This way...

842
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:40,220
Hey, they're calling their people.

843
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:41,360
Will we be okay?

844
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,700
I know. We're in trouble.

845
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,130
What?

846
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:47,260
I will find it tonight, no matter what.

847
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:51,010
- King Gojong's gold. 
 - You must.

848
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:09,670
I've gathered them.

849
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:23,370
 If I were Seo Byeong Mun. 

850
00:59:23,370 --> 00:59:27,180
 If I loved riddles and treasures. 

851
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,400
 If I crafted urban legends myself, and... 

852
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:34,230
 only allowed access to those who solved it. 

853
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:36,380
 You're a curious man. 

854
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:40,320
 I bet you wanted to see, even after death. 

855
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:43,250
 Who solved the puzzle you made. 

856
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:46,020
 Whether that is your descendent, 

857
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:48,630
 or someone like me or my father, 

858
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:51,590
 who wants to make everything right. 

859
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,820
 First, the old building. 

860
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:11,680
 Second, the Student Council room. 

861
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:15,530
 Third, the music room. 

862
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:21,680
 The bead shall shine like gold... 

863
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:39,960
 in the red sun... 

864
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:44,770
Team Leader.

865
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:48,680
What's going on? Did you find it?

866
01:02:49,330 --> 01:02:53,150
I don't think the gold bars ever existed.

867
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:54,900
 What are you talking about? 

868
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:57,110
 What do you mean there's no gold? 

869
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:03,210
Hello? Hello?

870
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:04,650
Hello?

871
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:07,090
Geez...

872
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:31,970
   

873
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:41,040

♫  The name I wrote down every day in my diary  ♫

♫  Flying above the clouds with both eyes closed  ♫

878
01:05:59,810 --> 01:06:02,100
 Where is it? 

879
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:03,990
 Where did you stash my gold? 

880
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:05,460
 Chairwoman, you've become a monster. 

881
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:07,060
 I think we found a way. 

882
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:09,480
 A way to make Jeong Hae Seong talk. 

883
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:12,330
 Your father was murdered, right? 

884
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:14,470
 Director Kim gave this to me. 

885
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:15,650
 Could Hae Seong... 

886
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:17,260
 Let's talk in person. Calm down. 

887
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:19,510
 I'm sorry, Ahjussi. This is the only option. 

888
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:21,470
 Why did you kill my father? 

889
01:06:21,470 --> 01:06:22,360
 Jeong Hae Seong! 

890
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:24,320
 Three, two... 

891
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,900
 Su Ah, thank you for everything. 

892
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:30,260
 Hae Seong. Hae Seong!
