 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Undercover Love Team ðŸ’– @Viki.com 

4
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,810
I'm leaving.

5
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,380
   

6
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,120
   

7
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,640
Hello?

8
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,610
 Su Ah! 

9
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,350
Hae Seong, is that you?

10
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,880
Where are you right now?

11
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,080
What happened? Are you out?

12
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,510
Su Ah.

13
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,420
I'm sorry, but...

14
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,520
can you please help me?

15
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,840
 Hae Seong, where are you? 

16
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,130
I'll come to you.

17
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,560
 Where are you? 

18
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,570
 Hae Seong! Hae Seong! 

19
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,340
 Hae Seong! 

20
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,180
Hae Seong...

21
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,300
   

22
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,630
   

23
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,020
   

24
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,700
 This is definitely Seo Myeong Ju's doing. 

25
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,830
We need to prove Hae Seong's innocence first.

26
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,520
- Let's look for evidence. 
 - Got it.

27
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,590
Where is this punk?

28
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,980
You guys go ahead.

29
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,990
Hey, what?

30
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,590
I'm busy. Make it quick.

31
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,290
Hae Seong? What?

32
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,540
E-Excuse me.

33
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,640
Excuse me?

34
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,420
Oh, my! He's awake! He's awake!

35
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,250
He's awake!

36
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,490
A-A-Are you okay?

37
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,950
J-Just stay there.

38
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,590
We'll call an ambulance.

39
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,840
No.

40
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,390
Please don't move!

41
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,010
You're bleeding a lot.

42
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,940
No, I'm okay.

43
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,400
I'll get to the hospital myself.

44
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,680
Hello?

45
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,010
Someone is very hurt here. Please hurry.

46
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,750
The location is...

47
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,000
next to a store called "Country Store..."

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,830
But...

49
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,220
Are you okay?

50
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,540
Do you know him?

51
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,160
I'll take him to the hospital. Thank you.

52
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,060
- Oh, okay. 
 - Let's go.

53
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,570
Never mind.

54
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,950
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,730
Su Ah...

56
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,540
When did you get up?

57
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,510
Just a little while ago.

58
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,930
Want some tea?

59
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,040
Thank you.

60
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,270
Gosh! This isn't it!

61
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,170
Hey, you...

62
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,870
You're fine!

63
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,540
What happened to you yesterday?

64
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,430
I escaped from the transport van.

65
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,920
What?

66
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,610
Seo Myeong Ju killed my father.

67
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,900
   

68
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,520
   

69
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,120
Even the board members who were on our side

70
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,120
are turning their backs.

71
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,580
We can't keep going like this...

72
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,350
What about Jeong Hae Seong?

73
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,670
The police are looking for him.

74
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,460
He is on the wanted list as well.

75
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,890
He won't be able to hide out much longer.

76
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,000
Get him, no matter what.

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,750
Chairwoman,

78
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,970
you should go home and get some rest.

79
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,700
I'll give you the progress updates.

80
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,890
 Your father... 

81
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,450
and that murdered NIS agent, Seo Myeong Ju did all of it?

82
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,210
She's also the one who framed me.

83
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,230
Seo Myeong Ju thinks I have the gold.

84
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,560
I don't know what she might do to people around me.

85
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,040
I'm going to go and get her.

86
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,860
It might be dangerous, so stay home.

87
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,020
No. Then I'll go to school.

88
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,280
If all that's true, the kids might be in danger.

89
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:56,720
I know very well that you care about them.

90
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,770
I'm a teacher, you know.

91
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,830
   

92
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,940
Where did you get this?

93
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,760
The convenience store when I was getting medicine.

94
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,850
What do we do now?

95
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,370
Can you call my team?

96
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,070
Why are you dressed like that?

97
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,320
Hey, don't even go there.

98
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,750
The police are looking for you,

99
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,330
and they're surveilling us, too.

100
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,830
We managed to lose them on the way.

101
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,760
You're on the news and everything.

102
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,910
It's crazy.

103
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,320
Hey! Turn that off!

104
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,730
Hey.

105
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:58,510
I thought you might need this.

106
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,870
Thank you.

107
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,110
Anyway, where do we even start?

108
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,960
We're totally in the dark here.

109
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,470
I don't even know where to start.

110
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,660
Our only card was the recording file. They took that, too.

111
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,490
Are there any other cards we can play?

112
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:28,570
Our original card might still be alive.

113
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,040
Everyone, who am I?

114
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,870
The only woman and brain on Domestic Team 4.

115
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,950
I'm Park Mi Jeong.

116
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,170
My leg is cramping!

117
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,160
Wait.

118
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,080
Let's go, let's go.

119
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,420
Search everything on the second floor.

120
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,910
Got it!

121
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,240
   

122
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,350
I love you, Sunbae.

123
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,150
Take your romance outside.

124
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,480
If we find the USB, we can get Seo Myeong Ju.

125
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,600
I'll go.

126
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,200
The police must be everywhere around your house.

127
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,350
You can't move, Hae Seong.

128
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,680
Then, what do we do? The three of you can't, either.

129
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,660
We managed to escape surveillance to get here.

130
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,930
It'd be impossible to go there.

131
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,460
I would go, but this is hard.

132
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,240
Then what about me, the Honorary Agent?

133
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,900
What do you think?

134
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,390
No. It's dangerous.

135
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,920
Let's do this.

136
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,940
The four of us can play rock, paper, scissors.

137
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:53,140
The loser will get the USB and the winner keeps watch for them.

138
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,630
What do you think?

139
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,860
What now?

140
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,230
It's dangerous for four of us, too.

141
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,090
So why are we just playing rock, paper, scissors?

142
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:06,620
It's so obvious, honestly.

143
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,160
 A murder suspect escaped en route to prison. 

144
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,450
 The police have decided to reveal his identity. 

145
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,850
 Jeong Hae Seong, age 30. 

146
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,990
 He is an ex-agent for the NIS. 

147
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,680
 Jeong allegedly murdered his boss, a male in his 40s, 

148
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,470
 and was arrested on the scene. 

149
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,620
 The police are still going after Jeong 

150
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,450
 and ask for your cooperation. 

151
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:32,100
- Ready? Let's go. 
 - Okay.

152
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,590
Let's go.

153
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,860
Team Leader.

154
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,840
What?

155
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,920
We're in trouble.

156
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,510
What?

157
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,230
- This way! 
 - Damn!

158
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,820
Get inside, get inside!

159
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,130
Open the door!

160
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,910
Hey, Hae Seong, it's over if you get caught.

161
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,630
Take Ms. Oh and go right now.

162
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,580
We're on the third floor.

163
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,010
Why did you get a room on such a high floor?

164
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,380
I'm sorry. I did.

165
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,940
It happens.

166
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,280
Open the door, Jeong Hae Seong!

167
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,790
I think this is it.

168
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,940
Hurry up! Get out somehow!

169
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,900
Damn it...

170
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,270
Okay, I trust you. Bye.

171
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,670
Hand it over to me!

172
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,710
Hey, hey!

173
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,710
We're going to jump from here?

174
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,110
Yes.

175
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,690
Wait, Hae Seong!

176
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,840
Are you okay?

177
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,400
Let's go.

178
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,110
Get out!

179
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,920
Jeong Hae Seong!

180
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,920
Get him.

181
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,830
Su Ah. You go first. I'll mislead them.

182
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,280
- But... 
 - I'm an NIS agent.

183
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,050
You said you'll protect the kids. Go and protect them.

184
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,420
Now!

185
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,120
Stop! Get him!

186
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,820
Get him!

187
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,120
Chairwoman.

188
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,170
Jeong Hae Seong... They failed to arrest him.

189
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,780
Inferior beings...

190
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,150
   

191
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,370
   

192
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,260
Byeongmun High School, please.

193
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,400
Let us be direct. 
    

194
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,590
I think it's time for you to step down.

195
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,840
Public opinion is very poor.

196
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,750
The foundation is also a mess internally.

197
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:10,980
If you resist, we'll need to officially dismiss you in the next meeting.

198
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,050
Please make a decision beforehand, Chairwoman.

199
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,580
It'd be right for you to step down.

200
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,220
Step down, Chairwoman.

201
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,020
Yes, Chairwoman.

202
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,430
Okay.

203
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:30,320
I understand how you all must feel, directors.

204
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,520
So you'll pull me down from my position first,

205
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,950
then cut me out of the foundation altogether.

206
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:42,290
That's your plan, right?

207
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,060
Sure.

208
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,890
Do as you wish.

209
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:49,890
Instead, stick to the rules.

210
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,310
In accordance with foundation regulations,

211
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,410
get 3/4 of the students and teachers to agree.

212
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,660
Until then,

213
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:04,920
I am your head

214
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,980
and owner. Don't forget.

215
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,700
Watch...

216
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,250
your tongues.

217
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,980
She doesn't want to step down.

218
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,710
Those bugs.

219
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,780
How dare they try to push me out?

220
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:47,940
I think we need a way to appease the students.

221
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,310
 The phone is turned off.  

222
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,980
 You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep 

223
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:38,050
Excuse me. Could I have my phone? Please?

224
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,790
We're both public servants. Come on.

225
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,940
I can't.

226
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,120
Excuse me. Hey!

227
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,520
Yeong Hun, do you have any connections?

228
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,770
We need to get out to help Hae Seong.

229
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:57,380
I've lived my whole life with upright integrity.

230
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,160
I have no such thing.

231
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,400
Or you have no skills to make connections.

232
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,060
How about you, Mi Jeong?

233
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,000
Police or anyone?

234
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,500
Useless punks...

235
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,000
You're not hurt?

236
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,460
 No, thankfully. 

237
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,730
How about you, Su Ah?

238
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,540
I'm at school doing what I need to do.

239
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,560
Be careful, just in case.

240
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,340
 You be careful, too. 

241
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,500
Did you find a way to get home?

242
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,630
I think so.

243
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,340
It's not 100%, but...

244
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,620
 Hello? Hae Seong? 

245
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,490
 Hae Seong, did something happen? Hae Seong! 

246
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,100
 Hello? 

247
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,950
 Hae Seong. 

248
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,040
 - Hae Seong!  
 - Hey, Su Ah.

249
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,720
 Is something wrong with you? 

250
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,620
No. I'll call you later.

251
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,510
 Okay. Call me. 

252
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,050
   

253
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,330
   

254
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,330
   

255
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,080
Did I scare you?

256
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,930
It's payback for twisting my arm last time.

257
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,850
What about the USB?

258
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,960
I listened to what's inside.

259
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,330
I don't want to admit it,

260
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,110
but you were right.

261
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,750
 Relax. I came here with something to say. 

262
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,700
 I'll have what he's having. 

263
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:06,460
 Are you asking me... to believe you? 

264
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,700
 Because it's true. 

265
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,810
 Seo Myeong Ju is behind everything. 

266
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,670
 Fine. 

267
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,500
 Let's say you're right. 

268
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,470
 I could put handcuffs on you right now 

269
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,010
 but let's say you're right. 

270
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,820
 Where's the evidence? 

271
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:29,010
 The USB. It's at my place. 

272
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,270
 Go and get it. 

273
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,250
 Then what do I get? 

274
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,980
 The truth. 

275
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,500
 The truth? 

276
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,350
 If there's no evidence, or if it's not the truth? 

277
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,360
 You get to deliver a performance. 

278
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,330
 I know it's important to you, too, Team Leader... 

279
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,910
 to know what the truth is. 

280
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,860
This is as much as I can do.

281
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,570
You'll need to... clear your own name.

282
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:11,350
Team Leader Gong Jin Sang.

283
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,550
Sorry for twisting your arm last time.

284
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,450
Hey, Jeong Hae Seong.

285
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:23,530
One would usually say, "I apologize."

286
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,980
That kid is rude in an ambiguous way.

287
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,930
   

288
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,890
Excuse me.

289
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,410
How can I help you?

290
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,170
I'm turning myself in.

291
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,300
   

292
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,580
   

293
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,280
   

294
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,180
   

295
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,210
I'm sorry. I'll find out who put this upâ€”

296
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,810
It was me.

297
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,400
I put that up.

298
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,580
Why?

299
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,860
I already told you last time.

300
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:31,940
Your policies will trample on the kids' dreams.

301
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,460
So?

302
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,180
I'm genuinely curious.

303
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,410
So, you really think...

304
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:44,240
this little garbage stunt will change our school?

305
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,430
The world could change because of powerless people.

306
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:54,090
Of course, you probably think a temp teacher like me can't do much of anything.

307
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:58,260
But that doesn't become a reason for me to give up on the kids.

308
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:03,210
I'm going to kick and scream. I will do everything I can.

309
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:06,470
Maybe it's like breaking a stone with eggs.

310
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:10,120
but I won't give up until that stone breaks.

311
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:15,130
I am their teacher, and I have a duty to protect them.

312
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,800
Is that so? How amazing.

313
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,700
Sure, sounds good.

314
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,970
The policies that were about to go into effect?

315
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,510
Let's pretend they never happened.

316
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,860
Okay.

317
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,740
Thank you.

318
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,780
I was going to stop them anyway.

319
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,360
Instead, I have one condition.

320
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,610
Quit from your position, okay?

321
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:48,210
Why? You want to protect the kids, but you don't want to pay the cost?

322
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,470
Right now. Now.

323
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:58,950
Look carefully inside your hesitation right now.

324
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:01,650
That's the real you.

325
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:09,290
You're just another mediocre human being.

326
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,010
I'll quit, gladly.

327
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,670
Go ahead.

328
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:20,390
But you'd better keep your promise.

329
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,060
How boring.

330
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,300
Acting all sweet, all innocent,

331
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,440
acting all righteous...

332
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:48,140
After I defend myself against dismissal next week,

333
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:51,990
please put those policies into motion again.

334
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:58,190
- Chairwoman, the backlash from the students willâ€“ 
 - What backlash?

335
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,430
Have they really opposed anything?

336
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:04,900
Talk shit amongst themselves and run their mouths online?

337
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,090
You know what?

338
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:11,310
Insects can't hear human footsteps.

339
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,980
But humans can't hear insects, either.

340
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,720
Still, let's gather all the students after school.

341
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,960
I need to spray pesticides due to the dismissal.

342
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,370
 You killed Jae Hyeon. 

343
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,810
What do you want me to do with this?

344
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,950
I think you got this all wrong.

345
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:38,160
This old incident has nothing to do with me. And you?

346
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,920
You're a suspect in Director Kim's murder.

347
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:46,740
How can a detective be so clumsy?

348
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,220
You didn't get good grades, huh?

349
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,490
What?

350
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,880
Look at the length of the file.

351
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,460
Common sense might tell you there's more.

352
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,290
 Principal, what are you doing here? 

353
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,040
Did Seo Myeong Ju put you up to this?

354
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,420
You should've kept your mouth shut.

355
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:27,070
 Chairwoman, it's done. 

356
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,190
Let's be done here, too.

357
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,910
We'll get the arrest warrant on our end.

358
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:33,090
But there are protocolsâ€”

359
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:37,630
Let's do this. We'll review this first...

360
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,910
Detective Jo Sang Cheol.

361
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,570
Don't make it so obvious you're in cahoots with her.

362
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,810
I might just destroy you.

363
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:07,080
   

364
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,330
F***.

365
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,800
What does the chairwoman want to talk about?

366
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,520
- I don't know. 
 - Do you know anything? Do you?

367
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,080
I got here with you.

368
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,620
- You hear that? 
 - You hear that?

369
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,130
- She doesn't know. 
 - I don't know.

370
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,830
Let's just go.

371
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,160
Let's see what she has to say.

372
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:58,430
My dear students at Byeongmun High School.

373
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,560
I gathered all of you here today

374
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,150
to make a few promises.

375
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:12,320
First: Unpleasant matters, like GPA tampering, whether that was true or not,

376
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,610
it will never happen at our school again.

377
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:23,640
Second: Abolishment of scholarships, tuition increase,

378
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,650
and other recently announced policies will no longer go into effect.

379
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,650
 We did it! 

380
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:35,160
 This is great. 

381
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,210
Byeongmun High will be entirely reborn.

382
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,450
   

383
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,700
   

384
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:56,410
   

385
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:09,860
 A school where you can have real friendships. 

386
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:13,810
 While not missing out on skill and competition. 

387
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:18,740
All that matters to me are your futures and happiness.

388
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:24,570
I, Seo Myeong Ju, will continue to work hard for your future and happiness...

389
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:26,700
What about Ms. Oh Su Ah?

390
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:33,060
Why is it up to you for her to quit?

391
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,410
Ms. Oh quit?

392
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:37,440
 I didn't know. 

393
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,130
You said what matters to you is our happiness.

394
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,890
Then, leave our homeroom teacher alone.

395
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,590
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

396
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,990
I only gave Ms. Oh Su Ah a choice.

397
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:50,460
I heard everything!

398
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,740
You made her quit, Chairwoman.

399
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,330
 - Really? 
 - No way. 

400
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,940
- Why? 
 - Really?

401
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:01,960
The name of the student spreading baseless rumors is An Yu Jeong, right?

402
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,940
Yes. Just like that... in this place,

403
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,590
I speak and you simply listen.

404
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:15,140
I know you're the chairwoman, but you can't just do that to someone!

405
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,290
He's right. Ms. Oh was fighting for us.

406
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,860
How would you feel if we told you to quit?

407
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:24,680
Teachers, those three who spoke without being called on?

408
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,360
Write their names down.

409
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,960
 Seriously? 

410
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,150
I'm Lee Dong Min.

411
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:37,340
I also think you are in the wrong, Chairwoman.

412
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,580
Lee Dong Min. Write his name down.

413
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,310
I'm Kang Gi Hyeong. I don't think this is right.

414
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,090
Yeah, Kang Gi Hyeong. Get his name.

415
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:46,440
I'm Jeong Sang Won. I don't think this is right.

416
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,600
I'm Heo Jun Hyeong. Give us Ms. Oh back.

417
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,090
I'm Lee Yeon Jae. Give us Ms. Oh back.

418
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,370
Give us Ms. Oh back.

419
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:55,950
What? Everyone, say your name clearly.

420
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,550
One at a time!

421
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,110
Ms. Oh won't give up on us.

422
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:14,150
She stood up to you in order to protect us.

423
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:19,330
The one who should really step back is not Ms. Oh but you, Chairwoman!

424
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:23,950
She's right! Chairwoman, step down!

425
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:30,650
 Step down! Step down! 

426
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,360
Oh, so loud...

427
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,670
 Step down! Step down! 

428
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,830
Is this a choir of insects?

429
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:45,870
 Step down! Step down! 

430
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:10,380
   

431
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,910
Are you ready?

432
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,890
The arrest warrant is here.

433
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,230
Where are Seo Myeong Ju and Park Jae Mun?

434
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,940
They're both currently at school.

435
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,640
Good.

436
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,160
Let's go.

437
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:42,750
 Step down! Step down! 

438
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,970
Hey! It's Ms. Oh!

439
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:53,020
 Ms. Oh! What happened? 

440
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:10,000
Got it.

441
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,730
Chairwoman, there is a big problem.

442
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:21,010
There are arrest warrants out for you and me.

443
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:24,360
 We will take care of you! 

444
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,880
 You can't leave! 

445
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,150
 We will help you... 

446
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:37,480
Take Ye Na and go home.

447
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:43,200
Then find somewhere to hide, Principal.

448
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,940
Myeong Ju!

449
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,840
Do what I'm telling you to.

450
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,220
Please.

451
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,370
That's right.

452
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:04,210
Please don't leave!

453
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,940
   

454
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:25,760
You're so impatient.

455
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,790
I'm about to see you.

456
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:38,330
Will we see each other before I go?

457
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:42,970
 There's only... one fair thing in life. 

458
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,010
Do you know what that is?

459
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,360
Death.

460
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,090
 Seo Myeong Ju. 

461
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,810
Seo Myeong Ju!

462
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,330
Hey. Wh-What is he doing?

463
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,790
Huh?

464
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,710
   

465
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,400
Sign here.

466
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,760
Okay.

467
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,480
What about Ye Na?

468
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,350
She went home with the principal.

469
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,540
What?

470
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,400
What is this?

471
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,310
What?

472
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,140
What is this smell?

473
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,770
It smells like oil...

474
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:56,370
Oil?

475
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:58,490
It's gasoline.

476
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:07,000
Gasoline to wipe out all you noisy pests.

477
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,680
What are you doing...

478
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,560
Don't move.

479
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:17,780
I'll drop this the moment anyone tries to leave.

480
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:31,510
You like equality, don't you?

481
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:35,230
From now on, let's all be equal...

482
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,510
and die together.

483
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,120
Move, guys!

484
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,940
You're late.

485
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,660
Put it down.

486
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:29,090
Put down your gun first.

487
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,160
Put it down.

488
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,480
- You don't want to? 
 - Stop!

489
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,510
Turn the car around.

490
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,720
Turn the car around right now!

491
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,270
Let the kids go.

492
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:20,000
- Why would I? 
 - The kids are innocent.

493
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,670
Let them go.

494
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:31,750
It's too late.

495
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:35,840
You've already ruined it all.

496
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,450
I gave you so many chances.

497
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:41,170
Every time, you took what mattered to me the most.

498
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,930
And now you say, "Let the innocent kids go."

499
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:47,090
I didn't take them away.

500
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:49,870
You were fooling yourself.

501
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:54,130
You are eating yourself alive right now.

502
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:58,760
Think about what really matters to you.

503
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:03,410
 Mom! 

504
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:05,340
Ye Na...

505
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,910
Ye Na.

506
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,440
Ye Na.

507
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,680
No, Mom...

508
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,510
Please.

509
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:19,360
Wh-Why are you here...

510
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,920
Mom...

511
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:24,940
You can still do the right thing.

512
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,800
Don't...

513
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,190
Don't hurt people anymore.

514
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,530
- Ye Na, go home. 
 - Mom...

515
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,660
- Go home. Principal! 
 - Mom...

516
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,760
Mom.

517
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,230
- Mom! 
 - Go home! Hurry!

518
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,760
If you stop now,

519
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,260
we can go back to how it was.

520
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,060
So, please.

521
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,100
Please put it down.

522
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,860
Go back?

523
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,740
To where?

524
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,220
To when?

525
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,740
No!

526
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,380
H-He caught it!

527
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,690
Hae Seong hyung!

528
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,790
Hae Seong hyung!

529
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,770
Hae Seong.

530
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,230
Get him.

531
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,740
Yes.

532
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,040
Thank you, Hae Seong.

533
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,750
Good work.

534
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:02,530
You saved the school, Yu Jeong,

535
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,260
and all the kids.

536
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,410
Want to go right to the office?

537
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:11,380
Let me check in with the kids.

538
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,810
Sure. They must be in shock.

539
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:16,580
Take care of them alongside Ms. Oh.

540
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,690
Hey.

541
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:20,740
What's wrong with you?

542
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,820
Hey, look at me straight.

543
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:25,250
You look pale.

544
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,790
I must be tired.

545
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:28,380
Let me first check in with the kids.

546
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,430
Oh, okay.

547
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:32,390
- Get in. 
 - Okay.

548
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:43,910
Oppa!

549
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:44,970
- Hae Seong! 
 - Sunbae!

550
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:46,110
- Sunbae! 
 - Hae Seong!

551
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:47,800
Hae Seong!

552
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,590
- Hyung! 
 - Oppa.

553
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:52,380
Hey, hey.

554
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,860
Call 911.

555
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,070
 911. 

556
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:57,150
 Phone! Call 911. 

557
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:07,330
 It's the Big Dipper! 

558
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:09,400
 Wow, you know what the Big Dipper is, son? 

559
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,380
 You're a genius. 

560
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:14,990
 Dad, what about the North Star? 

561
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:17,840
 North Star? 

562
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:21,050
 If the Big Dipper exists, what about the North Star? 

563
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:23,350
 Where's the North Star? 

564
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,530
 Shi Hyeon, the North Star you're searching for... 

565
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:45,250
Oh, my gosh!

566
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,350
Are you awake?

567
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,460
- Sunbae. 
 - Are you okay?

568
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,810
- Are you okay? 
 - What happened?

569
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:53,790
Mild concussion.

570
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:55,670
A second later, and you'd have been in big trouble.

571
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:58,510
You bastard... You pushed yourself up to this point?

572
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:00,920
Gosh, stop yelling at a sick kid.

573
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,230
Come on.

574
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:04,140
Sunbae, you better take care of yourself.

575
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:06,820
It's scary being your teammate.

576
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:10,770
Wait. Wake Yeong Hun up.

577
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:12,650
What's up with him?

578
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:17,330
He stayed up by your side for a few days and passed out.

579
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:20,790
He is loyal, after all.

580
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:23,580
Despite only having a few brain cells.

581
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,660
What about Seo Myeong Ju and Park Jae Mun?

582
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:26,980
It went to trial.

583
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:28,780
They're amidst a public trial.

584
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:32,910
The problem is Park Jae Mun claims he acted alone on the murder.

585
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:36,500
And also the incident from 22 years ago.

586
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,700
 I acted alone on everything. 

587
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,250
I'll meet with him.

588
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:09,350
It does feel awkward to see.

589
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,940
Park Jae Mun without Seo Myeong Ju.

590
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,590
I gave it some thought.

591
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:26,290
Who is Seo Myeong Ju to you?

592
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:30,820
How could you sacrifice everything for one person?

593
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:34,130
I found out you two go way back.

594
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:38,490
You joined that family as a nine-year-old orphan.

595
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:41,010
So, at least 40 years.

596
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,260
She must be family to you.

597
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:52,130
You'd risk your life to protect her.

598
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,570
But what do we do?

599
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:58,290
You're the one who ruined her.

600
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:00,680
Get to the point.

601
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,230
Seo Myeong Ju, until this point.

602
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,620
You think she was doing okay?

603
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:08,730
What about Ye Na?

604
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:13,110
How must it feel seeing her mom like that?

605
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:16,240
If you take the fall for everything,

606
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:20,520
do you think she'll live happily ever after?

607
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:26,610
What are you trying to say?

608
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,680
The decision is yours to make.

609
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:32,200
Think about what decision actually serves her.

610
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,970
Don't make her more miserable than she is.

611
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:49,410
Witness.

612
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:51,870
Do you have anything to testify

613
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:54,470
regarding the defendant, Seo Myeong Ju?

614
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:59,230
Witness, please answer the prosecutor's question.

615
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,580
Witness.

616
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:20,570
You stated you had testimony about the murders of

617
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:24,830
Jeong Jae Hyeon, Kim Hyeon Ho, and Kim Hyeong Bae.

618
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:26,740
Am I correct?

619
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,590
Answer, Witness.

620
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:31,600
Am I correct?

621
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,550
Twenty-two years ago,

622
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:43,750
Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju murdered Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon,

623
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,790
who was an NIS agent at the time.

624
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:55,660
I followed...

625
00:48:56,170 --> 00:49:02,090
Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju's orders to murder Kim Hyeon Ho,

626
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:09,460
as well as the NIS director, Kim Hyeong Bae.

627
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:19,860
And I framed...

628
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:24,680
Jeong Hae Seong for everything.

629
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:30,360
Traitor!

630
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,240
Traitor!

631
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:36,740
Traitor!

632
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:40,770
Be quiet, defendant!

633
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:42,470
Due to the disruption in the courthouse,

634
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:45,470
we'll take a 30-minute recess before the verdict.

635
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:47,550
Hey!

636
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,120
Traitor!

637
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,640
Traitor!

638
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:58,380
Traitor!

639
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:02,790
 Traitor! 

640
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:08,810
I will announce the verdict for case 20259606.

641
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:10,930
Given the violent nature of the crimes,

642
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:14,760
and her excuses, despite the clear evidence,

643
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:18,310
and her unwillingness to repent,

644
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:20,450
I sentence the defendant, Seo Myeong Ju,

645
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:22,810
to life in prison.

646
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,960
Just a moment.

647
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,590
Ye Na.

648
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:49,860
I dropped out of school.

649
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:53,490
I'm going to start over.

650
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:56,030
This time, only relying on my skills alone.

651
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:10,010
I love you, Mom.

652
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:14,820
I love you so much, but...

653
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:19,710
it'll take time for me to understand you.

654
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:24,970
I'll be back.

655
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:12,400
Let's begin the morning assembly.

656
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:19,130
We have a guest who came to meet you all today.

657
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:21,400
He really wanted to say a proper farewell today

658
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,880
since he didn't get to.

659
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,430
Come on in.

660
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:47,900
I come by a lot for someone who got kicked out.

661
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,120
I had...

662
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:05,700
so much fun spending time with you guys.

663
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,680
It'll be a fond memory for me.

664
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,160
I'll miss you.

665
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:16,670
I came to say this.

666
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:24,550
Study hard.

667
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:26,640
Listen to your teacher.

668
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:30,320
I'm leaving.

669
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:41,230
Just a second.

670
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:49,140
Hae Seong.

671
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:59,400
I think the kids are in shock from what happened.

672
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,790
Don't read into it. They're just sensitive.

673
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:04,720
Are you consoling me?

674
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:08,030
Take care of the kids.

675
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:10,000
It must've been traumatic.

676
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,370
I'm leaving.

677
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:30,240
   

678
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,880
Jeong Hae Seong!

679
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,230
 Bye, Jeong Hae Seong. 

680
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:50,770
 It was fun! 

681
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:52,120
 Love you! 

682
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,630
 Work hard! 

683
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:55,420
 Thank you! 

684
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:56,980
 Take care! 

685
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:58,080
We love you!

686
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:01,960
- Bye! 
 - I'll miss you!

687
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:05,340
 Take care of yourself. 

688
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:06,590
 We'll do our best. 

689
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:08,080
 Stay in touch. 

690
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,070
 Love you! Bye! 

691
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:12,000
 Hae Seong, that was so fun! 

692
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,670
 Bye! We'll miss you! 

693
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:43,040
I love your dad's facial expression here.

694
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:49,770
He must've enjoyed his time with the students.

695
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,580
Like you now?

696
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,980
Take good care of this.

697
00:56:58,530 --> 00:57:00,640
Why would I take this?

698
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:04,280
He wanted it to live on in memory.

699
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:12,360
I feel like he left this message for you.

700
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,230
Gil Sseul Byeol.

701
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,850
Another word for a comet*.
  (Haeseong in Korean) 

702
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:23,010
   

703
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,960
It's so toasty and delicious.

704
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,640
Can I eat the whole thing and another one?

705
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,080
One more?

706
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:38,020
Eat lots.

707
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:39,630
Eat as much as you want.

708
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:41,290
Thanks.

709
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:22,420
 If the Big Dipper exists, what about the North Star? 

710
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:24,680
 Where's the North Star? 

711
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,390
 Shi Hyeon, the North Star you're searching for... 

712
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:32,560
 I hid it somewhere. 

713
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:35,560
 Why did you hide a star? 

714
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:40,700
 So you can find it later, Shi Hyeon. 

715
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:06,010
 A star that is always in the same spot. 

716
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:10,460
 That star always shines brightly. 

717
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:39,390
 Since that star lights people's way. 

718
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:42,260
 Son, follow that star, 

719
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:45,290
 and you'll find the answer. 

720
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,100
 Shi Hyeon. 

721
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,030
 One day, 

722
00:59:54,930 --> 00:59:57,450
 I hope you finish this mission. 

723
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,820
Gosh, that father of mine...

724
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:21,950
 What about your father? 

725
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:26,870
You're quite something.

726
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:39,720
Gosh, what do I say...

727
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,400
Team Leader.

728
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:54,900
The mission is complete.

729
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,290
 My story ends here. 

730
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:04,020
 What about the others? 

731
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:09,920
   

732
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:16,150
- Ms. Oh. 
 - You're here.

733
01:01:18,910 --> 01:01:21,410
Ms. Oh, do you like web novels?

734
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:25,510
A student of mine wrote this.

735
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:26,810
   

736
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,660
Look at this.

737
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:33,620
    
 Ta-da!

738
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:35,510
Finally!

739
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:37,910
Congratulations.

740
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:40,820
I kept my promise.

741
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:43,040
- Let's go get some food. 
 - Love it.

742
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,440
 Su Ah's dream came true. 

743
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,940
 Even though it took a while. 

744
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:51,460
An Yu Jeong, what led you to apply to the NIS?

745
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:56,890
I've always been curious about protecting something, ever since I was little.

746
01:01:56,890 --> 01:02:00,220
 Yu Jeong is working toward her dream. 

747
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,730
 We might end up working at the same company. 

748
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:04,690
 Oh, dear Lord! 

749
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,660
 Ye Na is focused on her true passion. 

750
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,810
   

751
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,760
Yu Jeong! How did the interview go?

752
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:29,840
 And she and Yu Jeong are all good. 

753
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,370
Director.

754
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,130
 Ahjussi is cool now. 

755
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:40,300
 They say the title shapes the person. 

756
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:44,540
Good work.

757
01:02:59,830 --> 01:03:01,240
Sunbae.

758
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:04,510
It looks like there are some offshore accounts.

759
01:03:04,510 --> 01:03:07,270
 Yeong Hun finally gave up on Mi Jeong. 

760
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:08,880
Look here.

761
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:11,450
 But you know what's funny? 

762
01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:21,630
We better connect with Interpol...

763
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:23,590
These bastards.

764
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:27,120
Sunbae.

765
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:31,800
â™«  Sunlight shining down into my heart  â™«

766
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,780
Follow me briefly.

767
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:38,140
 I might get a nephew soon. 

768
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:41,640
â™«  I finally found you  â™«

769
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:42,750
 What's this bracelet? 

770
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:44,560
 People wear it. 

771
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,650
 Honey! Hae Seong is... 

772
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:50,320
 If you think about it, treasure is... 

773
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,750
 not that far away. 

774
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:55,920
Hey, what took you so long!

775
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,140
- Hurry up! 
 - Sunbae!

776
01:03:58,140 --> 01:03:59,160
Hurry!

777
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,290
 - To me,  
 - What took so long?

778
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,740
 these people are my treasure. 

779
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:07,560
Take a glass.

780
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,080
Here.

781
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:12,500
 Hey, hey. Yu Jeong has an empty glass. 

782
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,790
- Take one. 
 - Wait.

783
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:15,030
What's wrong?

784
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:18,040
Oh, my god!

785
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:22,610
Honey, why did you tell them now?

786
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:25,220
Let's cheers to that.

787
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:27,930
Congratulations!

788
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:31,620
 The past I shared with them. 

789
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:33,990
 The present I share with them. 

790
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:36,280
 And the future we'll share. 

791
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:40,700
 Each moment shines brightly. 

792
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:45,440
 I hope you find your very own treasure, too. 

793
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,700
 Even if it takes time, 

794
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:52,040
 I hope you find the brightest shining light. 

795
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:55,350
 I sincerely hope that for you. 

796
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:03,380
All the stars look different through this.

797
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:04,850
So pretty.

798
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:07,920
I think you're prettier.

799
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:12,400
You've changed so much these past few years.

800
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:18,270
Su Ah.

801
01:05:18,270 --> 01:05:19,530
Yes?

802
01:05:19,530 --> 01:05:21,300
Close your eyes.

803
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,250
Why?

804
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:24,780
Just close them.

805
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:30,140
â™«  The name I wrote down every day in my diary  â™«
