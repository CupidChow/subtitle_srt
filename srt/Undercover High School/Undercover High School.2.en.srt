(incidents, and backstories in this drama are fictitious.)

00:00:14,909 --> 00:00:17,350
(Episode 2)

4
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,099
Don't move.

5
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:42,430
Oh Su A the teacher?

6
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,000
Who are you?

7
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:45,800
What are you doing here?

8
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,439
What is she doing here?

9
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,009
Stop! Just don't!

10
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,780
Your hand.

11
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,949
Does this look like a toy?

12
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:03,388
This is a real tear gas gun, okay?

13
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:04,759
(Patrol)

14
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,590
I told you not to move.

15
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,590
Darn it.

16
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,400
Remove your cap and mask.

17
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,870
Hey, you!

18
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,740
Hey!

19
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:23,509
Shoot.

20
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:29,750
(Keep Out)

21
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,620
Why are you so fast?

22
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,259
I was on the track and field team in high school!

23
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:48,400
Stop right there!

24
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:56,239
- Oh, dear. - Mister.

25
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,710
- My gosh. - That weird guy...

26
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:00,009
- A weird guy? - Where'd he go?

27
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:01,978
You didn't see a masked man in a cap?

28
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:03,080
No.

29
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,549
I'm sorry, sir.

30
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,749
Tell me if you're in pain tomorrow.

31
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,020
Okay?

32
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,759
Darn it.

33
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,129
He got away.

34
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:23,569
I'll kill him next time.

35
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:37,849
What?

36
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,550
Were you caught?

37
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,719
You should've been more careful.

38
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,219
You can't get caught by your own teacher.

39
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:46,319
Okay. I'll be more careful.

40
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,860
Who'd have thought someone would patrol the place?

41
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,490
What about your face?

42
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,329
Did she see it?

43
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,629
Fortunately not.

44
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,069
She's weird, though.

45
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,399
She runs like she's a machine.

46
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,470
Like a real Terminator.

47
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:01,810
What?

48
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:04,170
So what happened? Did you get him?

49
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,740
No.

50
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:08,610
I lost him, but I almost had him.

51
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,219
Should I have just shot him?

52
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,350
My gosh.

53
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,389
What if you didn't have the tear gas gun?

54
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,958
I told you...

55
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,019
it was dangerous out there and you'd need it.

56
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:21,259
Yes.

57
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,458
I listened to you and got out alive.

58
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:26,829
You must be so proud of yourself.

59
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:28,470
If I saved your life,

60
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,370
why don't you help me close up?

61
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:32,439
I must've had the shock of my life.

62
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,769
I need to go home and rest.

63
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:36,269
Bye.

64
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:38,310
It's my fault.

65
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,509
I raised her.

66
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,750
It's such a shame.

67
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:48,220
If I'd caught him,

68
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:51,819
I'd have gotten a citizen's award and become a full-time teacher.

69
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,389
Please show up once more.

70
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,199
She's so weird. We won't get along.

71
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,929
(Keep Out)

72
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,470
(Byeongmun High School)

73
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,209
Last night, someone broke into the old building.

74
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,789
Ms. Oh came across the intruder...

75
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,329
on the first floor and gave chase,

76
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,930
but lost him.

77
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,230
She didn't see his face.

78
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,240
See if there were other witnesses.

79
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,370
I will.

80
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:25,579
Okay.

81
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,750
What should N be if these are to be equal?

82
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,689
It should be nine.

83
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:31,289
That's it for today.

84
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,720
Well done. See you next time.

85
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,730
- Thank you. - Thank you.

86
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,329
Why the heck am I studying math at my age?

87
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,230
What's wrong with your age?

88
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,569
You have no idea what you're asking.

89
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,309
Here's your first mission, Hae Seong.

90
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,339
Ta-da.

91
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:56,279
Dong Min's fingers are way too slow.

92
00:06:57,449 --> 00:06:58,549
You have three days.

93
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,019
Get him to max level.

94
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:02,689
- You can do it, right? - Wait.

95
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,259
I don't know this game.

96
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,230
Learn how to play, then.

97
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,670
It's three days. Get to it.

98
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:15,930
Okay.

99
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:17,730
Good.

100
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,970
Three days. Good luck.

101
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:28,949
I know the game.

102
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:31,949
- Want me to teach you? - How can you say that?

103
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:33,720
Where's your pride?

104
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:36,550
You want to do this because they say so?

105
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:39,019
Aren't you a man?

106
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:44,930
- What? - Max level in a game.

107
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,899
Don't tell sir or Yeong Hun.

108
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,328
Hae Seong, this is the NIS.

109
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:51,839
Asking me to hack a game to get you to max level...

110
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:53,739
is crossing the line.

111
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,670
Pretend it's part of the mission.

112
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,670
I'm having the worst time here.

113
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,180
Goodbye.

114
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:01,980
Hello? Mi Jeong.

115
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,278
Park Mi Jeong.

116
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,250
I see you're having a rough time.

117
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,490
You make it max level for me, then.

118
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:10,720
No, thank you.

119
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:13,419
You're really impatient.

120
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:16,629
Even before I told you to stay away from Park Tae Soo,

121
00:08:17,059 --> 00:08:18,199
you two got involved.

122
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,100
I don't know what I'm doing here.

123
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:21,929
What's the guy like?

124
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,700
He's a typical jerk and bully.

125
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,639
He harasses kids because his dad's an assemblyman.

126
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:29,809
What about you, Yu Jeong? Are you okay?

127
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,710
Me? I'm...

128
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,808
I'm, well... We're both on the student council.

129
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:38,850
What? You too?

130
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,350
What? You think it's weird?

131
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,320
I heard it was really hard to join.

132
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,029
I'm impressed.

133
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,360
Well, I happened to get accepted.

134
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:55,129
Anyway, beware of Park Tae Soo.

135
00:08:55,929 --> 00:08:57,768
He's a jerk, but he's on the student council.

136
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:59,739
If you get on their bad side, even I can't help you.

137
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,840
Watch your language.

138
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,070
I smell a nagging old guy.

139
00:09:05,809 --> 00:09:07,309
See you. Stay another five minutes.

140
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,159
What? I'm a nag?

141
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,690
Ms. Oh.

142
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,559
- Do you think little of me? - No.

143
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,860
Whom did you see last night?

144
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:31,169
I told you to patrol with an extra dose...

145
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:33,600
of a sense of duty.

146
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:37,169
Why did you take extra care to lose him?

147
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,779
I apologize.

148
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,679
I promise...

149
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,008
to get him next time.

150
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:45,419
Are you praying for him to reappear?

151
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,679
Enough with the nonsense.

152
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,549
Those reports.

153
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,419
Go through them all and submit a summary.

154
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,330
- All of that? - Is there too many?

155
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:00,500
I'll do it, then. Let's see.

156
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,200
The job posting for a vacancy at our school...

157
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,440
No, sir.

158
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:07,539
I'll do it.

159
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,580
I love this kind of work.

160
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,679
Good.

161
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,048
It's fine.

162
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:22,889
Ms. Oh was the only witness.

163
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,360
The CCTV cameras didn't catch anything.

164
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,389
I see.

165
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,289
However, there was some interference in the footage.

166
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:32,659
An expert says...

167
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:35,029
it looks like a video jammer was used.

168
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,730
A jammer?

169
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:39,539
What an interesting toy.

170
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:43,970
If they fled from the first floor,

171
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,740
they didn't get to the basement.

172
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:50,649
The person will be back.

173
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:53,850
Let's see...

174
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:56,889
what they get up to.

175
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,960
It's that, isn't it?

176
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:04,090
"Workplace bullying."

177
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,929
Discrimination against temporary teachers.

178
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:08,730
We're to put up with it or become a full-time teacher.

179
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,700
The bullying could be because of...

180
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,399
the toupee incident.

181
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,110
Things are already rough. The darn intruder...

182
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,779
I wonder.

183
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,710
What was the intruder doing there?

184
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:27,649
You have a point. There's nothing there.

185
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,149
Only he'd know that.

186
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,259
There are spooky stories and now an intruder too?

187
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:36,429
Why won't they just tear down the old building?

"Spooky stories?"

189
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,669
There's a ballet studio in the basement over there.

190
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,169
Something happened there years ago.

191
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,470
What are you three doing?

192
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,549
Oh, no.

193
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,590
I'm so sorry.

194
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:07,788
Play or you lose. Rock-paper-scissors.

195
00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:08,829
- There. - Okay.

196
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:09,959
Rock-paper-scissors.

197
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,129
- Nice one. - Come on.

198
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:13,058
- No. - Please?

199
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:14,199
- Pay up. - Seriously?

200
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,899
- You lost. - But still.

201
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,668
- Why do you need it? - To play games.

202
00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:20,669
Hand it over.

203
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,740
Be quiet!

204
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,279
Let's start. Turn to page 125.

205
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:31,080
Did Dong Min go somewhere?

206
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,720
Ms. Oh.

207
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,779
He left early saying he felt sick.

208
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,850
Was it Park Tae Soo?

209
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,990
- Who else would it be? - Darn him.

210
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,620
He never mentioned that to me.

211
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:44,960
He said you weren't in the teachers' office...

212
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:46,830
and asked me to tell you, but I forgot.

213
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:48,059
Sorry.

214
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,870
Okay. Let's start the lesson.

215
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:53,939
What did we learn last time?

216
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,969
- The Russo-Japanese War. - The Russo-Japanese War.

217
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,139
Right. Today we'll touch on the 1905 Protectorate Treaty.

218
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,109
As you all know,

219
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,408
the 1905 Protectorate Treaty...

220
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:05,519
isn't exactly a "treaty" because we were unwilling.

221
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,359
The call cannot be connected.

222
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,699
After the beep, you'll be transferred to...

224
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:35,110
I don't have his number so I can't even call.

225
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,080
I'm bothered.

226
00:13:41,789 --> 00:13:43,149
(You are dead.)

227
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:50,830

234
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:35,470
You there.

235
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:38,710
Hurry over here.

236
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,519
You could get into huge trouble.

237
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,419
Weren't you told students were to stay away from the building?

238
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:54,888
Some crazy guy was in there last night,

239
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:56,089
and the principal's on edge.

240
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,330
You could get chewed out.

241
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,860
I'll be careful.

242
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:01,559
Just wait until I set eyes on the fool.

243
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:04,129
Stay away from the old building.

244
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,169
You could get into trouble if you're caught.

245
00:15:06,669 --> 00:15:09,409
Did they hide gold and jewels under the floor?

246
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,169
They make such a fuss of the place.

247
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,039
The eyesore is a headache.

248
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,450
I'll go on my way.

249
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,719
Okay. Study hard.

250
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,720
- I will. - Good.

(Jeong Hae Seong)

252
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:31,700
Byeongmun High's principal?

253
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:33,860
Yes. He went into the basement.

254
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,029
Did you find out what he went there for?

255
00:15:37,629 --> 00:15:38,840
Not exactly.

256
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,340
Something's definitely in the basement.

257
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:43,070
I doubt...

258
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,610
the principal went down there to take a poop.

259
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:49,250
Don't talk about food when we're eating poop.

260
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:50,779
It's the other way around.

261
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:54,679
The school knows of the intruder.

262
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,919
- Move with caution. - Yes, sir.

263
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:49,339
Thanks.

264
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,940
Don't you hate how they treat you?

265
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,380
I do.

266
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,349
But there's nothing I can do...

267
00:17:00,849 --> 00:17:02,420
other than bear with it.

268
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:07,960
Don't tell the teacher.

269
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:10,130
It'll make things worse.

270
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,369
You mentioned your grandma's ID.

271
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,700
Is that why Tae Soo's bullying you?

272
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:20,970
That too...

273
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,769
and some other stuff.

274
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,609
But it'll mostly be for fun.

275

I'm an orphan...

276
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,779
and a parasite of sorts who lives with my grandma.

277
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:33,450
They think it's okay.

278
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,490
Thank you for this. I'll wash it for you.

279
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,259
Okay.

281
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:57,740
What happened?

282
00:17:58,309 --> 00:17:59,940
You left early but didn't answer your phone.

283
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:03,750
I went to see a doctor and just got back.

284
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,480
Without a word to me?

285
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,750
Why are your clothes dirty?

286
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,890
I was throwing out the trash.

287
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,460
- See you later. - Okay.

288
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,799
I'm off too.

289
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,500
Stop where you are.

290
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:32,839
Follow me.

291
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:38,180

Ms. Oh?

293
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,309
You said you wanted to talk to me about something.

294
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,480
Be honest with me.

295
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:12,548

296
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:14,220
Gosh, I'm getting a headache.

297
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,489
Fine. Considering the situation earlier,

298
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,119
I understand why you got the wrong idea.

299
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,230
But you see,

300
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,529
I'm not a bully.

301
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,099
Then explain what happened.

302
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,199
He left early, so why was he with you?

303
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,029
And what happened to his uniform?

304
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,670
You can't even answer these questions.

305
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,079
I knew you'd be trouble when I saw you drinking.

306
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,109
How dare you try to fool me?

307
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,150

- Come closer. - Why?

310
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:27,160
- Come here. - What? Why?

311
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,459
- Why... - Hey, come here for a second.

312
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,099

00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,779
Why do you keep dodging me?

316
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,449
I'm sorry. Blame my reflexes.

317
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:52,250
Shut it. I should use my reflexes and smack you.

318
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,420
You really don't get it, do you?

319
00:20:55,349 --> 00:20:56,720

00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:32,109
Let's decide on the demerit points for each category.

369
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:37,980
What's up?

370
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,289
- Goodness. - Hey, you reek of cigarettes.

371
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,959
You said you quit smoking.

372
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,660
Many smokers quit only to smoke again, you fool.

373
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,730
The transfer student is getting on my nerves.

374
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,828
- Why? What did he do? - Well, he's a weirdo.

375
00:23:54,829 --> 00:23:57,170
He went ahead and let Dong Min go without my permission.

376
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:59,469
Go easy on him. Don't you feel bad for him?

377
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,699
Did you lock him up or something?

378
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,140
Yes, in the recycling bin.

379
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:04,970
You're crazy.

380
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:08,380
My gosh. He bawled his eyes out as he refused to go in there.

381
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:10,479
- Do you want to watch the video? - Yes, show me.

382
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,508
Hold on.

383
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:14,119
Did you really have to do that?

384
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:20,660
What did you say?

385
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,329
I mean, I'll be honest.

386
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,730
There's a line you should never cross.

387
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,470
Also, the others really hate it when you do stuff like this.

388
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,699
This could negatively impact the student council...

389
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,140
My, you're something else.

390
00:24:34,869 --> 00:24:37,240
Who are you to lecture me and tell me what not to do?

391
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:40,108
You're in the student council too, so we let you talk to us.

392
00:24:40,109 --> 00:24:41,309
And you think you're it?

393
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:43,710
Do you think you're on the same level as us?

394
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:48,319
Hey, what's with you? Don't be so delusional.

395
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,348
We let you join because you're Ye Na's friend, you loser.

396
00:24:50,349 --> 00:24:51,518
- Tae Soo. - What?

397
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:53,189
- You're out of line. - Why? Am I wrong?

398
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,288
She was an outcast and had no friends until last year.

399
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:56,660
Ye Na saved her. Am I wrong?

400
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:00,630
Hey.

401
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,868
You should thank Dong Min.

402
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:03,929
I'd be picking on you if he weren't around.

403
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,500
We heard you, so that's enough.

404
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,339
You're starting to get on my nerves.

405
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,078
Hey, stop defending her.

406
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:18,808
What is this? You're ruining the morale here.

407
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,549
Says the one who's actually ruining the morale here.

408
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,049
I agree with everything Yu Jeong said earlier.

409
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:24,650
Apologize to Yu Jeong.

410
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,960
Hey.

411
00:25:34,961 --> 00:25:37,170
Isn't your dad seeking a fourth term in the National Assembly?

412
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:39,599
The party leader dropped by my house yesterday.

413
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,769
I think he and my mom discussed who to nominate.

414
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:49,779
The minute your dad loses his job, you become a loser too.

415
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,250
So, you need to apologize before that happens.

416
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,220
I'm sorry.

417
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:04,559
It's okay.

418
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,480
Hey, Ye Na.

419
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,750
Thanks for doing that earlier.

420
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:25,108
I had been vying for a chance to tell him off.

421
00:26:25,109 --> 00:26:26,849
Tae Soo is a total scumbag, you know.

422
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:31,619
Yu Jeong, but don't step in like that from now on.

423
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:35,190
How you told Tae Soo to stop being a bully.

424
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,589
Let me say those things. It shouldn't come from you.

425
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:42,500
Right, I'm sorry. I'll be careful from now on.

426
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Let's go.

427
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,568
(Grade 11)

428
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:48,569
This is the cut off line.

429
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,910
That's our top one percent.

430
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,439
Assemble them...

431
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,279
and create a special class for our top students.

432
00:26:54,609 --> 00:26:57,548
We already have a special class. Do you want to split them up?

433
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:00,849
Create the best environment for them to study.

434
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,018
Get ready to manage their extracurricular activities...

435
00:27:03,019 --> 00:27:04,989
on top of offering college admissions consultations.

436
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,089
Anyway, they should get more perks than those in the special class.

437
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,429
Ma'am.

438
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:12,599
Many students are complaining about the school's policies.

439
00:27:12,859 --> 00:27:16,798
Especially those who aren't in the top ten percent.

440
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,869
They don't care about winning the competition.

441
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:25,809
No wonder they aren't in the top ten percent.

442
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:28,079
If we split up the class again...

443
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,549
in the current situation,

444
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,979
more people will complain.

445
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,279
Back when black slavery...

446
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,288
was a key part of the economy and society in America,

447
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:39,859
many slaves killed their masters and ran away,

448
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:41,960
so someone wrote a book called...

449
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,960
"How to Make a Slave."

450
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:46,759
It's very simple.

451
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:50,229
Create a caste system within the slave community,

452
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,799
clearly differentiate the groups in the slave caste system,

453
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:55,298
and treat them differently based on their caste.

454
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:57,140
In other words, drive a wedge...

455
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:59,979
between the slaves to...

456
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,140
So they'd look at...

457
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,450
who's at their level...

458
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,920
instead of who's above them when they have complaints.

459
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:09,720
We should split up the 90 percent too.

460
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,489
Give it a name that's similar to the special class.

461
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,890
Thirty percent in each class. We'll have three classes in total.

462
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:17,130
Yes, ma'am. Got it.

463
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:22,430
(Bulletin Board)

464
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,069
Are you skipping lunch?

465
00:28:32,109 --> 00:28:33,210
I'll eat in a bit.

466
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,279
It's embarrassing to eat alone, you know.

467
00:28:37,579 --> 00:28:38,650
Okay, suit yourself.

468
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:56,069
I hate crowds.

469
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:57,829
Wake me up when you're heading out.

470
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,869
Why did you ask me about the old building the other day?

471
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,109
Hey, kid. I'm going to sleep.

472
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:06,980
We're the same age.

473
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,709
I'm warning you just in case.

474
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,150
You'd be better off staying away.

475
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,849
Especially from the basement.

476
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,680
I know because I've been inside.

477
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,660
If you're curious, I could tell you more...

478
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,630
while we have lunch together.

479
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,470
Let's go. I'm hungry.

480
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,470
Come on. Let's go.

481
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:37,410
Are you not eating?

482
00:29:38,369 --> 00:29:39,679
Well, just go ahead and tell me...

483
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,079
why I should stay away from the old building.

484
00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:43,980
Before that, if you're not eating...

485
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,650
Here, it's all yours.

486
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,789
All yours.

487
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:55,759
Eat up.

488
00:29:57,789 --> 00:29:59,960
Hae Seong, you're new here, so you probably don't know about...

489
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,730
the spooky stories about that building.

490
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,240
Years ago, there were classrooms in the building,

491
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:08,369
and this happened in the ballet studio.

492
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,420
There was a girl who dreamed of becoming a ballerina.

493
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,420
She practised there every night.

494
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,339
Oh, no. That must hurt.

495
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:48,579
She was being bullied by her classmates.

496
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:50,910
One night...

497
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,009
- Hey! - Hey!

498
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,449
Hey, where are you going?

499
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,319
- Stop! - Stop right there!

500
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:56,650
Get her!

501
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,989
Stop right there!

502
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,490
- Stop! - We'll catch you!

503
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,369
- Oh, no. - What do we do now?

504
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,670
- Darn it. - What should we do?

505
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,539
(Byeongmun High School)

506
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:04,349
She felt that she'd lost all hopes and dreams and chose to...

507
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:06,689
- For real. - What are you saying?

508
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:07,890
What do you mean? It's...

509
00:32:36,589 --> 00:32:39,319
The girls decided to hide her body...

510
00:32:39,619 --> 00:32:41,460
somewhere in the old building...

511
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:47,900
so that no one...

512
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,230
would ever find out what they did.

513
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,059
Hey.

514
00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:21,400
What are you doing here? You should go home.

515
00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:23,099
Hey.

516
00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:25,069
Sir.

517
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:27,539
I have no legs.

518
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:37,480
That was when...

519
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,578
rumours started to spread that she'd appear every night...

520
00:33:40,579 --> 00:33:43,389
in the studio at the time of her death.

521
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:44,750
That's an interesting story.

522
00:33:44,849 --> 00:33:46,260
I hope you don't expect me to believe it, though.

523
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,899
You see, I don't believe that stuff.

524
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,900
Come on.

525
00:33:54,429 --> 00:33:57,070
I mean, in this day and age... Give me a break.

526
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,340
But I saw her.

527
00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:06,510
I told you. I've been inside the building.

528
00:34:06,809 --> 00:34:08,110
You actually saw a ghost?

529
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:16,849
(Dance Studio)

530
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:44,570
I swear, I wasn't mistaken.

531
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,139
I'm sure it was the ghost people talk about.

532
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:04,590
Do you want to hear the other spooky stories too?

533
00:36:05,389 --> 00:36:07,130
The four spooky stories about Byeongmun High.

534
00:36:10,699 --> 00:36:12,869
There are four scary stories about our school.

535
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,900
The first one is about the old building,

536
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,239
and the second one is...

537
00:36:16,769 --> 00:36:18,610
Look, the losers are having lunch together!

538
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,480
- What? - What's going on?

539
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,650
- Are they talking about Dong Min? - Goodness.

540
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,948
(Lee Dong Min)

541
00:36:25,949 --> 00:36:27,050
What if Dong Min is...

542
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,150
What if he's going through something?

543
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,760
School violence, perhaps?

544
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,929
Could he be being bullied?

545
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,130
What if he is being bullied?

546
00:36:40,929 --> 00:36:42,429
But who'd bully Dong Min?

547
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,300
The transfer student, perhaps?

548
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:47,440
That's my guess.

549
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,940
But then again,

550
00:36:50,769 --> 00:36:53,480
the look on his face tells me that he may not be a bully.

551
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:56,110
If you're not sure, just observe them for now.

552
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:57,710
And if you get a chance,

553
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:00,949
try talking to Dong Min.

554
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,789
I put in some honey to help boost your appetite.

555
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,730
- Eat up. - Nice, that looks delicious.

556
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:16,269
Eyes down.

557
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:18,500
Put your phones away.

558
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,510
And you, Dong Min.

559
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:26,538
Why did you crawl out without your master's permission...

560
00:37:26,539 --> 00:37:27,840
to be embarrassed like this?

561
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,280
You think you can act out now that you've got a friend?

562
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,050
All right, go on and eat.

563
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,260
Hey, if you keep this up, I'll make you drop your pants.

564
00:38:22,329 --> 00:38:24,669
Eat it!

565
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,699
Don't eat it.

566
00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:33,280
What did you just say?

567
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,309
You keep crossing the line.

568
00:38:38,179 --> 00:38:40,079
You three are disgusting.

569
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,090
He's out of his mind.

570
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,929
Say that again.

571
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,199
I dare you to say it again.

572
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,659
Hae Seong.

573
00:38:57,969 --> 00:38:59,769
Repeat yourself, you punk.

574
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,909
Sorry. I guess I overreacted.

575
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,480
My bad. I apologize.

576
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:10,750
This won't ever happen again, so...

577
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,649
- What the... - No way.

578
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:15,079
Did you see that?

579
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,590
- Darn it. - Unbelievable.

580
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:21,319
- Are they insane? - What's going on?

581
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,860
Shouldn't we get someone?

582
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,670
What gives?

583
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:33,469
- No way. - This is bad.

584
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,369
Ms. Oh, it's bad!

585
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,710
Hey.

586
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:44,750
Jeong Hae Seong, was it?

587
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:48,349
- Come with me. - No, don't do this.

588
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,050
Hey.

589
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:52,988
Come on. I can't get into fights.

590
00:39:52,989 --> 00:39:55,289
You've clearly lost your mind.

591
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,559
- I said that was enough. - Let go.

592
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:01,400
Let go of me, you punk.

593
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,339
Everyone's watching, so let's cut this short.

594
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,769
Let go, you prick.

595
00:40:10,969 --> 00:40:12,869
Let go of me, darn it!

596
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:17,179
Get over here.

597
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,409
You...

598
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,349
Did you see that?

599
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,989
This is insane.

600
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,360
- No way. - My gosh.

601
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,130
That was crazy.

602
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,000
I can't believe it.

603
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:42,570
Stop right there!

604
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:46,940
Darn it.

605
00:40:52,849 --> 00:40:54,119
What are you two doing?

606
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,619
Both of you, wait for me at the counselling office!

607
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:07,429
No way. The stream is going viral.

608
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,039
I've never seen Park Tae Soo get his butt kicked before.

609
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,869
That will cause quite the commotion.

610
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:19,309
He's an amusing one.

611
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,110
Let's eat.

612
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,820
(Student Counselling Office)

613
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,158
Are you that stupid?

614
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:40,460
How can you cause problems in less than a day?

615
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:46,099
I bet you have no idea what you've done.

616
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:49,139
You messed with the wrong guy.

617
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,840
You're in for a painful lesson.

618
00:41:54,739 --> 00:41:57,880
Tae Soo, what are you doing here? Come on out.

619
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,679
Getting into fights when you just transferred?

620
00:42:01,579 --> 00:42:04,320
I'm curious to know what will become of you.

621
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:10,659
I hope we can get along.

622
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:22,340
These schools are still pretty much the same.

623
00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:30,750
Why is it just you? Where's the class monitor?

624
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,550
The vice-principal came by.

625
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,059
Why did you and Tae Soo fight?

626
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,219
Because he started it.

627
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:43,929
As in Tae Soo?

628
00:42:45,389 --> 00:42:47,500
What could the two of you get into it about?

629
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,900
A physical altercation of this level isn't something I can take lightly.

630
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:54,869
So answer me.

631
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:56,599
Why did you two fight?

632
00:42:58,039 --> 00:43:01,039
You should've come to me if an argument had started.

633
00:43:02,309 --> 00:43:03,650
Are you a common thug?

634
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:05,550
A bully?

635
00:43:06,309 --> 00:43:08,578
How can you get into fights only just after transferring?

636
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:10,550
You really are clueless.

637
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:13,050
What?

638
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,760
Are you knowingly turning a blind eye...

639
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:18,159
or are you just dense?

640
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:23,369
Ms. Oh, do you even care about your students?

641
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:28,969
I'll think that Tae Soo's a fine actor.

642
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,209
Because I'll be disappointed...

643
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:32,940
if you've knowingly been turning a blind eye.

644
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:38,179
I have nothing more to say.

645
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:41,019
This is up to you now.

646
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:07,280
Darn.

647
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:25,030
I bought another while getting mine.

648
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:27,559
I'm the reason you couldn't finish your lunch.

649
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,829
Thanks.

650
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:40,110
What did Ms. Oh say?

651
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,210
You know, the usual.

652
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:46,980
Don't get into fights and whatnot.

653
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,190
Sorry I made it hard on you.

654
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:57,389
Why would you need to apologize?

655
00:44:58,630 --> 00:44:59,929
It's this world that's the issue.

656
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:05,570
Why did you hold back the other time?

657
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,340
You seem to pack a punch.

658
00:45:09,969 --> 00:45:11,070
What was it again?

659
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:16,079
Hiding your true powers or something like that.

660
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,679
- HTP? - Yes, it's something like that.

661
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:21,579
I see.

662
00:45:57,449 --> 00:45:58,449
Dong Min.

663
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:01,690
Hang in there.

664
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,530
You too.

665
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:10,130
(Have a Drink With Su A)

666
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:18,670
Darn.

667
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:21,809
Who does he think he is?

668
00:46:23,409 --> 00:46:25,809
Of course, I care about my students.

669
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,678
Why do you think I want to be a full-time teacher?

670
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:33,250
Why? Just why? Darn it!

671
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,058
- Goodness. - My gosh.

672
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:36,788
- Darn! - I'm so sorry.

673
00:46:36,789 --> 00:46:38,888
This is what I should've said to him.

674
00:46:38,889 --> 00:46:40,598
She's not in her right mind.

675
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:42,198
Oh Su A,

676
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,570
you idiot.

677
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:50,670
You wait and see, Jeong Hae Seong.

678
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:54,840
I'll get rid of you.

679
00:46:55,539 --> 00:46:56,739
Shouldn't the line be...

680
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:59,449
"I'll crush you?"

681
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:01,079
Potato, po-tah-to.

682
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:06,250
Darn.

683
00:47:07,789 --> 00:47:09,690
I have students talking down to me now.

684
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:13,960
What a life this is.

685
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:15,829
It's the path you chose.

686
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,800
Hang in there.

687
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:21,199
What about that first student you taught?

688
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:22,699
Min Ji, was it?

689
00:47:22,969 --> 00:47:25,209
You want to be a full-time teacher for her sake.

690
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,539
To guide other students since you failed her.

691
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,448
Is that something I said?

692
00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:33,179
Yes, while crying your eyes out.

693
00:47:37,849 --> 00:47:39,250
Drink in silence and go home.

694
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,610
Sir,

695
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:06,710
it's about Hae Seong.

696
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,050
- Will he be all right? - Don't.

697
00:48:10,349 --> 00:48:12,289
Don't you dare say you want to be in a school uniform.

698
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:14,219
We're short-staffed as is.

699
00:48:15,789 --> 00:48:18,190
Also, you look like...

700
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,260
you can pass for a disciplinary teacher.

701
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,328
Why are you hung up on school uniforms?

702
00:48:23,329 --> 00:48:26,030
That's not it. I'm seriously worried.

703
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:29,038
You know how Hae Seong gets easily worked up.

704
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:31,710
You can worry about everyone else but not Hae Seong.

705
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:33,679
I know him better than anyone.

706
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:37,010
I heard you two had a long history.

707
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:38,949
You've known him since he was young.

708
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:41,949
Tell me about it.

709
00:48:42,949 --> 00:48:43,949
My gosh.

710
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:45,889
Time sure does fly.

711
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:49,019
I can't believe that tiny thing is already...

712
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:51,960
Goodness.

713
00:48:53,829 --> 00:48:54,860
Anyway,

714
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,400
he's not someone who'd easily cause trouble.

715
00:48:59,769 --> 00:49:00,969
I trust him.

716
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,110
Let's eat before the noodles go mushy.

717
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:12,809
Director, my gosh.

718
00:49:14,179 --> 00:49:15,280
Eat for now.

719
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,590
See for yourselves.

720
00:49:19,949 --> 00:49:21,090
Eat while you watch.

721
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,019
Let go.

722
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:25,090
Let go of me, darn it!

723
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:28,929
You...

724
00:49:42,409 --> 00:49:43,639
The transfer student has balls.

725
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:48,150
He messed with you of all people.

726
00:49:48,349 --> 00:49:49,349
Here.

727
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:50,889
I'm not in the mood to laugh.

728
00:49:52,519 --> 00:49:53,888
How can I end that punk?

729
00:49:53,889 --> 00:49:55,519
You're not one to let this slide.

730
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:59,559
Tell me.

731
00:50:00,429 --> 00:50:01,659
Should I come to your aid?

732
00:50:02,429 --> 00:50:05,030
Forget it. He's not even worth it.

733
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:09,699
If that's what you say.

734
00:50:10,769 --> 00:50:13,980
By the way, when are you going to pay me back?

735
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:17,349
If you're having trouble with it,

736
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:20,010
get me IDs instead like last time.

737
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:27,989
(Spark Golf)

738
00:50:47,909 --> 00:50:49,139
I enjoyed the video.

739
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:51,980
What have you been getting yourself into?

740
00:50:53,349 --> 00:50:54,750
Senior Agent An, didn't you warn him?

741
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:56,479
He's to lead a quiet school life...

742
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,719
to keep it from interfering with the mission.

743
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:00,150
I'm sorry.

744
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:03,059
I'll keep it brief, Agent Jeong.

745
00:51:03,789 --> 00:51:05,460
If anything like this happens again,

746
00:51:05,789 --> 00:51:07,300
the mission will be called off,

747
00:51:07,829 --> 00:51:09,899
and you'll be investigated on the charge...

748
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,429
of damaging national treasure.

749
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:15,170
That'll definitely be the end of the idiotic Domestic Team Four.

750
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,110
You.

751
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:20,369
You joined the NIS to follow in your father's footsteps.

752
00:51:20,909 --> 00:51:22,510
What will you say to him when you finally locate him?

753
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:25,110
That you got fired for botching a mission?

754
00:51:28,949 --> 00:51:30,789
That'd be humiliating if you ask me.

755
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,960
Don't just look at me and get going.

756
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,659
Darn, I have an important game tomorrow.

757
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,210
Was it necessary to put it like that?

758
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:54,980
Don't be bothered about that comment about your father.

759
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:57,510
Just behave from here on out.

760
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:00,880
What about what I requested?

761
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:08,519
It'll be able to crack any door lock out there.

762
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:11,360
You said there was likely to be a storage room.

763
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:14,599
Anyway, let's wrap up this operation today.

764
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:16,730
Sure.

765
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:42,460
Ta-da!

766
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:44,259
What's this?

767
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:45,760
A gift for Parents' Day.

768
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,829
Really?

769
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,360
This is incredible.

770
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:53,230
I should wear this forever.

771
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,300
Dad.

772
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:57,769
Job shadowing is required for homework.

773
00:52:58,070 --> 00:52:59,840
You said you worked for the government.

774
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,610
What should I say under job description?

775
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:05,809
Say I'm like a compass.

776
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:07,719
A compass?

777
00:53:09,949 --> 00:53:12,489
A nameless compass that guides the nation...

778
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:14,420
to prosper and into the future.

779
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:25,199
When will you get home if you leave this late?

780
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:27,440
It's my birthday tomorrow.

781
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,369
As if I would've forgotten that.

782
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:32,510
I'll be home before you know it and wake you up.

783
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,739
We'll go to your favourite observatory.

784
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:36,880
Keep your promise this time.

785
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,909
Or I won't ever talk to you again.

786
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:43,320
I promise.

787
00:53:48,489 --> 00:53:49,789
This won't take long.

788
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,289
Bye.

789
00:53:58,869 --> 00:53:59,900
Dad!

790
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:04,070
Dad!

791
00:54:04,869 --> 00:54:07,139
- Yes? - You forgot this.

792
00:54:07,639 --> 00:54:08,809
Your notepad.

793
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:15,980
Thanks, Son.

794
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:23,119
Bye.

795
00:54:26,829 --> 00:54:28,099
I'll be back before you know it.

796
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,229
- Who is it? - Hello, ma'am.

797
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:04,670
I'm Dong Min's friend Jeong Hae Seong.

798
00:55:04,929 --> 00:55:07,070
Why would Dong Min's friend come by at this hour?

799
00:55:07,329 --> 00:55:08,800
He's at his part-time job.

800
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:10,869
He asked me for a favour, that's all.

801
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:13,239
- A favour? - I guess he didn't tell you yet.

802
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:15,479
He's receiving the encouragement scholarship,

803
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,779
but your ID is needed to complete the process.

804
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:20,579
He asked me to get it for him.

805
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,380
How sweet of you.

806
00:55:24,519 --> 00:55:26,119
- Just a second. - Sure.

807
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:29,119
Goodness me.

808
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,360
My gosh.

809
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,960
- Hello. - Delivery!

810
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:35,230
Over here.

811
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:37,500
I'll leave it here. Please enjoy.

812
00:55:37,699 --> 00:55:38,730
Sure.

813
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:42,400
(365 Pool)

814
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:20,539
Hae Seong.

815
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,579
What are you doing here?

816
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:34,860
What about you?

817
00:56:35,289 --> 00:56:37,320
I saw you while out working my part-time delivery job.

818
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:40,460
Why did you jump over the wall?

819
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,099
Could you be after what I think you're after?

820
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,099
You are.

821
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:53,110
That's why you're here. To see if the story is true.

822
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:54,210
What?

823
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:56,980
No wonder you sneaked in here.

824
00:56:57,239 --> 00:56:58,749
The place is out of bounds,

825
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,480
and you didn't want your name written down on the visitors' log.

826
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:02,849
Yes, that's it.

827
00:57:03,849 --> 00:57:05,449
- Can I come with you? - No way.

828
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:12,190
Getting in here wasn't an easy feat for you.

829
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,760
Nothing good will come out of you being disciplined.

830
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:16,429
It'll only upset your grandma.

831
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,570
So head home already.

832
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:19,900
Be on your way.

833
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:23,739
You'd be disciplined as well.

834
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,179
Darn.

835
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:39,150
For the record, I told you to leave.

836
00:57:40,619 --> 00:57:43,590
I didn't follow you in here. I'm going my own way.

837
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,659
You're more stubborn than you seem.

838
00:57:46,829 --> 00:57:48,129
Whatever. Come back tomorrow, then.

839
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:49,730
Go your own way tomorrow.

840
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,329
Wait.

841
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:53,130
Do you hear that?

842
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:18,130
Senior Agent An.

843
01:02:19,929 --> 01:02:22,099
I'm afraid this mission will take a while.

844
01:02:22,539 --> 01:02:23,570
What do you mean?

845
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,309
My guess is that the chairwoman...

846
01:02:30,139 --> 01:02:31,809
is also looking for the gold bars.

847
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:30,138
(Retired to the countryside after the 1905 Protectorate Treaty)

848
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:31,539
(The emperor's lost gold funding Byeongmun Foundation?)

849
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:50,690
Dong Min, let's go.

850
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,630
Let's go. It's dangerous here.

851
01:04:11,409 --> 01:04:12,809
That was when...

852
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,019
rumours started to spread that she'd appear every night...

853
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:18,989
in the studio at the time of her death.

854
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:25,960
Hey.

855
01:04:26,659 --> 01:04:28,199
What are you doing here? You should go home.

856
01:04:28,829 --> 01:04:29,900
Hey.

857
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:31,099
Sir.

858
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:33,699
I have no legs.

859
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,579
The story was true.

860
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:47,250
About the school ghost.

861
01:05:07,769 --> 01:05:11,199
(Undercover High School)

862
01:05:28,159 --> 01:05:29,159
(Sending back to desk)

863
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:30,218
(Where did the 800 million dollars from the national coffer go?)

864
01:05:30,219 --> 01:05:31,488
(He was appointed as the first chairman...)

865
01:05:31,489 --> 01:05:32,730
(of the school board.)

866
01:06:34,989 --> 01:06:36,058
Who's there?

867
01:06:36,059 --> 01:06:37,988
Seo Byeong Mun who hid the gold bars...

868
01:06:37,989 --> 01:06:40,559
set up the ghost story as a riddle.

869
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:42,729
You must be interested in ghost stories.

870
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:43,899
Jeong Hae Seong did what?

871
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:44,929
Darn!

872
01:06:45,099 --> 01:06:46,169
You're busted.

873
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:48,170
Jeong Hae Seong, get your act together.

874
01:06:48,269 --> 01:06:50,968
Young man, you can't go in there.

875
01:06:50,969 --> 01:06:53,170
This is a serious issue.

876
01:06:53,570 --> 01:06:56,079
What will happen to Hae Seong, then?

877
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:57,840
Will he really be expelled?

878
01:07:12,429 --> 01:07:15,059
