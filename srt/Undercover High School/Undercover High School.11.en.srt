(Episode 11)

5
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,100
We got disconnected, so I didn't get the details.

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,100
We'll have to wait until Hae Seong gets out.

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,470
Until we are back in contact with him,

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,210
we must stall.

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,310
Seo Myeong Ju of all people can't know what we just discovered.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,950
Of course.

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,189
What now?

12
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,250
We've arrived, ma'am.

13
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,490
The time has finally come.

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,160
What do we do?

15
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,370
The game ends here.

16
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,310
Or...

17
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,110
see it to the end if you want.

18
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,550
Ma'am.

19
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,990
This is as far as we go.

20
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,730
Let them through.

21
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,700
Stand by.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

23
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,619
- What the... - My gosh!

24
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,120
- Darn. - What on earth?

25
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,120
How can you just let them through?

26
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,490
Darn.

27
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,790
Goodness.

28
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,710
What on earth?

29
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,080
Where's my gold?

30
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,720
What the heck is all this?

31
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,380
Where is it?

32
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,090
My gold.

33
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,860
Hold on.

34
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,600
Darn, my gold.

35
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,130
Move this.

36
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,879
Where's my gold?

37
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,380
My gold! Where is it?

38
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,350
Where the heck is my gold?

39
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,530
Ma'am? Ma'am!

40
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,270
When will you get home if you leave this late?

41
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,540
It's my birthday tomorrow.

42
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,340
As if I would've forgotten that.

43
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,510
I'll be home before you know it and wake you up.

44
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,750
We'll go to your favourite observatory.

45
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,910
Keep your promise this time.

46
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,880
Or I won't ever talk to you again.

47
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,290
I promise.

Hae Seong.

50
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,750
Grab a bite at least.

51
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,650
Or go inside and get some sleep.

52
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,490
Su A.

53
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,160
I'm fine.

54
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,260
I'm good.

55
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,030
Goodness.

56
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,300
Hae Seong's father.

57
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,540
The evidence points to a homicide, right?

58
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,010
We won't know the details until the analysis is done,

59
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,340
but a bullet was found.

60
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,680
Why he was there also needs to be investigated.

61
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,220
What have we been doing?

62
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,589
After all the hoops we had to go through...

63
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,690
to find those darn gold bars,

64
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,630
this is what we ended up with, and Hae Seong...

65
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,860
Oh, dear.

66
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,940
Glasses shouldn't be raised.

67
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,680
Goodness.

68
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,080
If the gold was never there to begin with,

69
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,180
how come there was a photo of it?

70
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,050
We all saw the photo.

71
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,660
I think it was bait.

72
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,529
The director fabricated one...

73
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,690
to reel us in so that we'd accept this mission.

74
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,360
Anyhow,

75
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,830
Hae Seong is finally sending his father off,

76
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,540
but no one's here.

77
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,100
For Hae Seong to find peace,

78
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,910
it should be bustling with people.

79
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,150
My gosh. What...

80
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,420
Goodness.

81
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,160
Hae Seong.

82
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,040
How did you know to come here?

83
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,350
They wanted to come, so I brought them.

84
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,690
Let's pay our respects to his father.

85
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,020
Dad,

86
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,480
I guess you won't be so lonely.

87
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,850
Thanks for coming.

88
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,750
You must be hungry.

89
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,130
Thanks.

90
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,430

(Deceased: Jeong Jae Hyeon, Chief Mourner: Jeong Hae Seong)

93
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,220
As you requested, I had it analysed by a private facility...

94
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,959
and not the National Forensic Service...

95
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,030
so that the director wouldn't know.

98
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,400
A Glock 17?

99
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,240
Around 22 years ago,

100
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,170
it was the issued firearm for senior agents of the NIS and above.

101
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,540
A senior agent at the time...

102
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,250
That's why I looked into it.

103
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,320
October of 2003. Director Kim...

104
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,020

107
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:55,930
is a prime suspect.

111

my gold have gone?

112
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,700
Ma'am,

113
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,140
the investigation concluded...

114
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,280
that the space we found was never the vault.

115
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,079
It was a secret conference room...

116
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,619
that was put together...

117
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,520
by the founding chairman to collude with pro-Japanese figures.

118
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,190
It is my belief that the gifts...

119
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,390
presented to the chairman by those people...

120
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,659
were later misinformed as gold bars.

121
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,330
No, the gold existed.

122
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,630
I know that much. The gold was there at some point.

123
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:12,869
But where did the darn gold go?

124
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,039
Who took it?

125
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,379
Ma'am, please.

126
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,950
Was it Hae Seong? Yes, it was.

127
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,150
What an agent.

128
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,019
That is one talented agent.

129
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,660
In that short amount of time,

130
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,590
how did he manage...

131
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,100
to steal and hide all that gold?

132
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,570
Ma'am, please.

133
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,580
Yes, Director.

134
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,020
Bring HR in.

135
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,390
We're to discuss...

136
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,990
the suspension of Domestic Team Four's Agent Jeong.

137
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,990
What could be the reason?

138
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,090
As if he hasn't caused more than enough trouble.

139
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,400
The incident at the school yesterday...

140
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,670
and a few others will be enough.

141
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,830

143
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,880
Find my gold.

144
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,920
Kidnap Jeong Hae Seong...

145
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,119
or torture him if you have to.

146
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,090
Do whatever is necessary.

147
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,230

149
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,130
As of this moment, you ought...

150
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,570
to prove your worth.

(Jeong Hae Seong, Agent status terminated)

155
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,840
What will you say to him when you finally locate him?

156
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,750
That you got fired for botching a mission?

157
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,860
What the...

158
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,160
Are you going somewhere?

159
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,530
Yes. What brings you by?

160
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,669
Everyone's gathered at the restaurant...

161
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,009
and Senior Agent An told me to get you.

162
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,070
Let's grab a bite to eat.

163
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,780
Maybe later.

164
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,410
Start without me.

165
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,780
Hae Seong.

166
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,090
Are you sure you're okay?

167
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,900
Su A.

168
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,010
Thank you for everything.

169
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,330
You think the bullet...

170
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,300
was Director Kim's?

171
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,500
Yes.

172
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,570
That's how it seems so far.

173
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,110
I'm here.

174
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,640
Why is it just you? Where's my son-in-law?

175
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,140
He had somewhere to go.

176
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,180
Still. You should've brought him with you.

177
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:24,150
But he must be exhausted from the funeral.

178
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,719
Call him yourself then.

179
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,820
There's something else that's bugging me.

180
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,860
What could be bugging you?

181
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,260
What Hae Seong said to me last.

182
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,200
He thanked me...

183
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,160
as if he was saying goodbye.

184
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,600
Sir,

185
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,340
- could Hae Seong... - Come on.

186
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,540
I get he's upset,

187
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,610
but I doubt he'll hold a gun to Director Kim's head.

188
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,649
- Mom, I'm going too. - Hey, hold on!

189
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,119
- Su A, wait. - I'll see you!

190
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,550
Goodness me.

191
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,020
Hae Seong.

192
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,589
Let's talk this out.

193
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,259
Take a deep breath.

194
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,260
I'm sorry, Uncle.

195
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,730
But this seems like the only way.

196
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,130
I know you're frustrated, but if you do this...

197
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,400
You know this isn't the way.

198
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,700
Hae Seong, come on. Turn the car around.

199
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,569
We'll get together and discuss this.

200
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,070
This is for me to end.

201
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,440
Don't follow me.

202
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,750
Hey. Hello?

203
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,050
Where's Director Kim?

204
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,319
He's at the Incheon Hotel...

205
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,420
for the Defence and National Security Conference.

206
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,630
(Defence and National Security Conference)

207
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,339
Hello.

208
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,009
Welcome. How may I help you?

209
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,139
My director forgot this document.

210
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,710
It's urgent, but he's not picking up his phone.

211
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,649
What is the guest's name?

212
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,809
It's Kim Hyung Bae.

213
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,850
Mr. Kim Hyung Bae.

214
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,389
Yes, Mr. Kim is staying with us.

215
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,719
Allow me to have it delivered.

216
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,790
Thank you.

217
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,100
(Calling extension number 1201)

218
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,870
Yes?

219
00:20:24,871 --> 00:20:27,470
There's a file for Mr. Kim Hyung Bae.

220
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,180
The one who...

221
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,890
- I'll head downstairs for a bit. - Sure.

222
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,300
(An Seok Ho)

223
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,250
Would it have killed you to take the keycard?

224
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,360
Your bullet was found with my dad's body.

225
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,270
Why did you kill him?

226
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,700
Why did you kill my father?

227
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,949
Where's the person who gave you this?

228
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,950
He suddenly disappeared, and I don't know where he went.

229
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,500
It's Room 1201.

230
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,000
Wait.

231
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,639
How do you expect to handle the fallout?

232
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,700
Agent Jeong!

233
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,809
Calm down. Let's sit down and talk.

234
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:08,910
Call security.

235
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,510
Yes, sir.

236
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:13,680
You're only making things worse.

237
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:14,980
Lower your gun and...

238
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,820
What happened...

239
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,430
the day my father died?

240
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,600
Why did he...

241
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,400
have to take a bullet?

242
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,030
Tell me everything.

243
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,340
Hurry!

244
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,410
Get in.

245
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,110
I think we're one step behind.

246
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,120
It's still not too late.

247
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,260
Pull yourself together...

248
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,760
and let us talk.

249
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,390
Agent Jeong!

250
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,760
As a member of the NIS,

251
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,969
- you should serve the state... - Three.

252
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:08,199
Forget that. Clear your mind...

253
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,369
and pull yourself together...

254
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,400
Two.

255
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,740
Fine. I'll talk!

256
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:14,970
I'll tell you everything.

257
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,549
That night...

258
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,480
Jeong Hae Seong, lower your gun!

259
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,590
Or I'll fire.

260
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,460
Lower your gun!

261
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,640
Sir, are you all right?

262
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,850
Get him out of my face.

263
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,010
Take him outside.

264
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,460
Have him ready for the local police.

265
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,360
You're out of your mind.

266
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,100
How dare you point a gun at the director?

267
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,970
He's dangerous, so keep your eye on him.

268
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,200
Take him away.

269
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,070
Stay frosty!

270
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,240
What now?

271
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,910
One problem at a time.

272
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,779
Right now, let's focus on helping Hae Seong.

273
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,149
To do so, we need to get past that mountain gorilla.

274
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,190
Would that be possible?

275
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,250
If only I had brought a banana.

276
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,360
How about this?

277
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,730
Hey, gorilla. It's been a while.

278
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,470
Domestic Team Four, you're supposed to be on standby.

279
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,440
What brings you here?

280
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,340
We were passing by...

281
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,070
and heard of a seminar.

282
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,080
Are you here to help Hae Seong escape?

283
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,750
I'm right.

284
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,450
Security.

285
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,220
Gosh, it's Song Hye Kyo.

286
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:06,789
Where?

287
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,350
As if that'd be true, you moron.

288
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,730
Ms. Oh.

289
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,130
You're up!

290
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,230
I've been meaning to ask.

291
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,500
Who is she?

292
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,300
Her?

293
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,440
Our team's wild card.

294
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,710
Why you...

295
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,550
Hold on.

296
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,720
Can I go to the restroom?

297
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,319
Those who request bathroom breaks at this point...

298
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,890
are up to no good.

299
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,390
Don't be absurd. This isn't a TV show.

300
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,600
I really need to go. Come on.

301
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:26,630
Stop!

302
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,139
- Su A? - What on earth?

303
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,440
No, don't!

304
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,510
What the...

305
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,120
Hold on.

306
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,160
Why are you here?

307
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:53,690
Is Agent An here too?

308
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,429
The whole team?

309
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,759
Yes, we all came to stop you.

310
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,830
Me and the rest of your team.

311
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,230
How stupid can you be?

312
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,569
I don't care how upset you are.

313
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,270
This isn't the place to come without a plan.

314
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:08,510
You guys are driving me nuts.

315
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:11,880
I told you not to come, but you just won't listen!

316
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,250
What are you talking about?

317
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,209
- Where is he? - He went downstairs.

318
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,250
Run for now.

319
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,990
Act normal.

320
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,060
One male and one female suspects of a violent crime...

321
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,470
are evading authorities within the hotel.

322
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:37,840
Excuse me. May we see some ID?

323
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,750
We'll hold them off, so go.

324
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,119
But Agent An...

325
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,960
Today, I'm paying you back...

326
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,989
for all you did for me.

327
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:03,059
- Yeong Hun. - Don't worry.

328
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,730
It's our turn to protect you.

329
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,030
Mi Jeong.

330
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:07,569
Don't just stand there and get going.

331
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:08,930
Go!

332
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,440
I can't believe he actually left.

333
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,839
Hey! Are you sure about this?

334
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,879
(Exit)

335
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,010
I know my team can handle this.

336
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,110
Let me tell you about my team.

337
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,650
Individually, they lack talent.

338
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,990
But together, they can take on anyone.

339
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,380
Get them!

340
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,630
Mi Jeong!

341
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,169
Yeong Hun?

342
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,170
You little...

343
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:21,910
Here we go!

344
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,410
Get them!

345
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,400
Are you all right?

346
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,600
Yeong Hun!

347
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:20,070
Our scholarship system and...

348
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:23,300
This too. Financial aid for those who need social support.

349
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,000
Go ahead and get rid of these.

350
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:28,840
Also, we'll increase our tuition fees by 50 percent.

351
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,480
Ma'am.

352
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,810
Then many of our students may not be able...

353
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,250
to continue their studies with us starting next semester.

354
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,880
And I'm sure the board won't be okay with it.

355
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,349
Those kids won't be able to transfer to Edu-City anyway.

356
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,549
They'll drop out anyway,

357
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,360
so we'll just be rid of them now.

358
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,920
Ma'am.

359
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,590
It may not be my place to say this, but if you made this decision...

360
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,400
to secure funding for Edu-City,

361
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,830
I suggest you take a step back for the time being.

362
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:58,399
Public opinion and the situation with the National Assembly...

363
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,910
aren't unfolding in our favour at the moment.

364
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:04,280
We should reassess the situation and wait for our next opportunity.

365
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:06,779
All will be taken care of once we find the gold bars.

366
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,510
What are you talking about now?

367
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:11,849
Wait for our next opportunity and take a step back for now?

368
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,620
Must you talk like a gutless coward?

369
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,260
I mean, once you have a plan,

370
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,289
you need to do whatever it takes...

371
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,090
to execute that plan.

372
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,930
Principal Park, why are you here now?

373
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,170
Go and find the gold bars.

374
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,740
Go and find the gold bars.

375
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:37,580
Go and find the gold bars!

376
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,509
Go and find the gold bars!

377
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,610
Ma'am.

378
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,820
Yes, ma'am.

379
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,570
I can find the gold bars.

380
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,400
I can beat Jeong Hae Seong.

381
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,600
So, Edu-City will be all mine.

382
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:07,010
I can find the gold bars.

383
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,710
I can beat Jeong Hae Seong.

384
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:12,140
So, Edu-City will be all mine.

385
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,490
So, you guys are saying...

386
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:24,060
I was about to shoot Director Kim in the head. Is that right?

387
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:28,030
That's why you made such a big fuss and tussled with those guys?

388
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,770
Do you seriously think I'm that dumb?

389
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,340
I ranked tenth in my entire school.

390
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,940
Well, we really thought that was what was going on.

391
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:43,710
Then you shouldn't have said what you said.

392
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,010
What? What did I say?

393
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:49,920
Su A.

394
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,350
Thanks for everything.

395
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:55,950
What the...

396
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,820
Am I Chow Yun Fat?

397
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,459
I meant that I was grateful to her...

398
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,730
for attending my father's funeral.

399
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,199
Then you should've said so.

400
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,769
You confused me by saying that in such a serious voice.

401
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:11,799
Right?

402
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,470
In other words, it was all my fault?

403
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:14,810
It wasn't my fault.

404
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,180
My gosh.

405
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,910
Unbelievable.

406
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,949
I can't believe this.

407
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,380
Stop. That's enough!

408
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:27,150
Hey, why did you go and see Director Kim?

409
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,560
His bullet was found...

410
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,859
with my dad's body,

411
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,190
but there was something suspicious.

412
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,530
Something suspicious?

413
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,470
Seo Myeong Ju.

414
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,200
Kim Hyeon Ho had my dad's notebook, but he died.

415
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,210
And my dad's death.

416
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,380
It all happened at Byeongmun High.

417
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,250
Seo Myeong Ju and Director Kim were the ones...

418
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,180
who chose me for this operation,

419
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:57,480
so maybe they were the ones who sent my dad...

420
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,290
to Byeongmun High in the past too.

421
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:02,720
Maybe...

422
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,160
Seo Myeong Ju...

423
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:09,030
had something to do with my dad's death.

424
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,170
So, I wanted to ask Director Kim about it...

425
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,240
before they arrested him.

426
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,940
Your bullet was found with my dad's body.

427
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,740
Why did you kill him?

428
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:25,940
Why did you kill my father?

429
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,250
You're only making things worse.

430
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,899
What happened the day my father died?

431
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,100
Tell me everything.

432
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,840
You turned Director Kim's phone into a zombie phone?

433
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:59,710
Monitoring his phone conversations, location tracking, and so on.

434
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,380
I wanted full access.

435
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,880
How is Seo Myeong Ju connected to all of this?

436
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,850
And what happened that day?

437
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,690
It was the only way to find out the answers.

438
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,860
Hey, but...

439
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,690
do you think he will give away what you need to know?

440
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,500
He must be under a lot of pressure, knowing they found his bullet.

441
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,260
He'll try whatever he can to get it sorted out.

442
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,070
I'm sure we'll find something.

443
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,190
Hey, it's me.

444
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,030
Tell them I can't attend the seminar tomorrow.

445
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,830
Why do you look so tired today?

446
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,700
Did you have a busy weekend?

447
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,270
It was very eventful.

448
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,110
I couldn't sleep at all because of the dopamine rush.

449
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,440
Hey, something's fishy here.

450
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,910
I bet something happened between you and Mr. Jeong Hae Seong.

451
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,980
Why are you calling him like that?

452
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,920
He's 31.

453
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,790
I still dream about how he confessed his love in front of everyone.

454
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,490
"I like her, a lot."

455
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,360
"Can I kiss you now?"

456
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,430
Hey, don't exaggerate it.

457
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:29,000
By the way, why would you have a dream about Hae Seong?

458
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,370
You're free to dream about anything you wish.

459
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,270
Are you jealous now?

460
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,440
- Don't have dreams about him. - Oh, no.

461
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,540
- "Don't have dreams about him." - Attention, please.

462
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:41,150
I have special instructions from Chairwoman Seo.

463
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,720
I mean, does this make sense to you?

464
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:47,290
How can the school suddenly make a decision like this?

465
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,690
Hey, Dong Min.

466
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,420
- Will you be all right? - No.

467
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,160
I'm in trouble now.

468
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,600
It's not just Dong Min. We're all in trouble now.

469
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,000
We'll practically become refugees when the next semester begins.

470
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:06,040
Look at them making such a fuss over the 50-percent tuition hike.

471
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,210
Hey, Chae Lin. Read the room.

472
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,850
That's not what I meant.

473
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,350
Right.

474
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,120
(Byeongmun High Notice)

475
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,690
Don't worry too much.

476
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,660
Okay.

477
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:35,270
Ms. Oh, I'm only asking out of concern.

478
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:38,270
You won't take this up with Chairwoman Seo, right?

479
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,240
Ms. Oh!

480
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,910
Where are you going now?

481
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,520
If you push ahead with this,

482
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,929
at least 150 students...

483
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:02,060
will have nowhere to go in the new semester.

484
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,429
There are no schools in the district...

485
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,299
that can accept that many students.

486
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,330
Did you have an appointment to see me?

487
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:14,140
This is a school.

488
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:18,939
A school must offer equal opportunities to everyone...

489
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,909
Equal opportunities, my foot.

490
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:23,180
You know the world is an unfair place.

491
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,749
You teachers share the same office,

492
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,749
but only some of you have permanent positions.

493
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,849
A school guides its students toward better futures...

494
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:31,220
through education. That is what a school does!

495
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,490
Be quiet.

496
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:37,659
When I decided to become an educator...

497
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,830
Goodness. I'm sick of this.

498
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,429
I made a promise to myself.

499
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:43,570
Hey, you are so fake.

500
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,740
You tell kids that everyone is equal, knowing it isn't true.

501
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:49,169
It's not like you will take care of them for life.

502
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:51,209
You keep making promises you can't even keep.

503
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,210
You're a hypocrite!

504
00:38:52,211 --> 00:38:53,649
"Don't become a selfish adult..."

505
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:56,479
"who turns her back on children to pursue her own personal gain!"

506
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,720
Get lost!

507
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,290
You are a narcissist. A hypocrite!

508
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,630
You must be very lonely.

509
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,470
Ms. Oh.

510
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,370
Ms. Oh, where are you going?

511
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:00,180
(Byeongmun Foundation)

512
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,660
Hello.

513
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,830
I'm here to speak to the board...

514
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,300
about Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju.

515
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:55,000
What brings you here? You didn't even call.

516
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,310
My bullet was found with Jeong Jae Hyeon's skeleton.

517
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,310
I see.

518
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,709
It is evidence that he was killed,

519
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,279
so Jeong Hae Seong won't sit idly by.

520
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,909
We must get rid of him before he does anything.

521
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:09,950
No.

522
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,950
Never.

523
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,089
Not before I find my gold.

524
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:19,589
Then I'll be put in a difficult position.

525
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,460
Director Kim, you are a 50-year-old man.

526
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:23,330
Figure it out on your own.

527
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,530
I will deal with Jeong Hae Seong.

528
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:29,630
As for the bullet, you deal with it.

529
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,540
You can't do this.

530
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,610
You...

531
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,209
You can't do this to me.

532
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:41,580
What do you mean?

533
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,020
You killed Jae Hyeon.

534
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,420
You killed Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon!

535
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:51,260
You might not remember, but you fired the gun!

536
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:54,090
You killed Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon!

537
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,230
Dad!

538
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:57,930
Yes?

539
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:00,300
You need this, your notebook.

540
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,470
Thanks, son.

541
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:11,640
Bye.

542
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,310
I'll be home soon.

543
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,730
Hey, Jae Hyeon.

544
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,430
Oh, what are you doing here?

545
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,860
Nothing much.

546
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,630
I wanted to talk to you someplace quiet.

547
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:41,940
Was it you?

548
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,380
You're the spy in league with Seo Myeong Ju?

549
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:47,150
You see, here's the thing about life.

550
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,480
It all comes down to money.

551
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,820
Considering the amount of gold hidden there,

552
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:54,890
I hope you can understand.

553
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:03,430
Oh! Hello, Mr. Kim Jae Yeong.

554
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,630
Right. Today, you are here as Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon.

555
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:09,370
I should've greeted you properly sooner.

556
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,640
Just get to the point.

557
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,170
Where is my gold?

558
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,480
Gold?

559
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,079
Just tell her where it is, Jae Hyeon.

560
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,110
Let's take the easy road.

561
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:23,850
There is no gold.

562
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,419
The secret vault built by Seo Byeong Mun, the founder.

563
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,390
It was empty.

564
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:31,359
Your crazy delusions led you to believe...

565
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,730
Jeong Si Hyun is your son's name, right?

566
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:36,690
Stay away from Si Hyun.

567
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:39,030
Stay away from my son!

568
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:42,300
My gosh. I'm so scared.

569
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,900
Let me ask you one last time.

570
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,840
Where is it?

571
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,280
Chairwoman Seo.

572
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,720
Then grant me a wish.

573
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,050
Go on and tell me.

574
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:02,820
I only have one wish.

575
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:06,720
I want the world to know all about your disgusting corrupt deeds.

576
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:09,530
What are you doing?

577
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,930
What you so desperately want.

578
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:15,500
No, don't shoot!

579
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,400
You'll never find it.

580
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,910
- Oh, no! - Ma'am.

581
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,690
What are you doing?

582
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:35,990
Do you want him dead?

583
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,760
That's why I pulled the trigger.

584
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:44,130
The vault is in the school anyway.

585
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:46,430
If I have to let the government confiscate my gold,

586
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:47,930
it's better...

587
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:49,930
to just kill him now.

588
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,120
- You didn't find him? - We're sorry, sir.

589
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:46,119
I swear, he came in here!

590
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,560
- Find him! - Yes, sir.

591
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:49,730
Search every corner!

592
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:51,030
- Go upstairs. - Yes, sir!

593
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:34,940
Son.

594
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,580
I couldn't keep my promise.

595
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,380
I'm sorry.

596
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:57,430
Happy birthday.

597
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,490
You killed Jae Hyeon and want me to take the fall for everything?

598
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,290
I won't let that happen.

599
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,630
Do you have evidence?

600
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,430
Evidence to prove that I was the one who shot Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon.

601
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,440
Do you have such evidence, Director Kim?

602
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:43,140
No, I do not.

603
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,240
But I do have something.

604
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,780
I can testify against you as a living witness.

605
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,020
What could you even do with the gold if you find it?

606
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:56,790
Will Edu-City ever be completed when a murderer is behind it?

607
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:58,290
That will be interesting to watch.

608
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,260
Jeong Hae Seong...

609
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:06,300
really wants to know how his father died.

610
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:09,830
I'm going to tell him, one thing at a time.

611
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:37,030
I think I found a way.

612
00:48:37,031 --> 00:48:38,630
I think I found a way.

613
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:40,470
A way to make...

614
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:42,630
Jeong Hae Seong talk.

615
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,770
Darn it!

616
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:21,439
(Jeong Hae Seong)

617
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,440
Shoot.

618
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:28,910
What's up?

619
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,350
How does it feel to be dumped by Seo Myeong Ju?

620
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,220
What are you on about?

621
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:35,390
(Jeong Hae Seong)

622
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:37,420
If you testify,

623
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:39,390
we can take down Seo Myeong Ju.

624
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:43,030
Show you have some humanity left.

625
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:48,970
Let's meet in person.

626
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:51,200
I have a lot to tell you.

627
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:24,570
Director.

628
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:55,799
(Education Goal)

629
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,470
(Student Counselling Office)

630
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,750
(Byeongmun High)

631
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:11,350
(Byeongmun High, for whom...)

632
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:20,190
(Byeongmun High, for whom does it exist?)

633

634
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,229

(Tuition raised by 50 percent)

(Crushing dreams)

637
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:41,539
Hey, open the door.

638
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,710
Open the door right now!

639
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:46,640
- Get him out. - Come on out.

640
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,810
Drop the knife!

641
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,750
Drag him out.

642
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:55,890
You're being arrested at the site of Kim Hyung Bae's murder.

643
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:57,590
You can hire a lawyer,

644
00:52:58,190 --> 00:52:59,520
explain yourself,

645
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,630
and refuse to incriminate yourself.

646
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,790
- Take him away. - Okay.

647
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:09,070
(Police)

648
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,920
The final exams are coming up.

649
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,230
Talk to the students...

650
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:37,860
so they don't loosen up.

651
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,270
- This month's dinner... - Ms. Oh.

652
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:50,310
Yu Jeong. What...

653
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,709
This morning, ex-NIS agent Jeong...

654
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:56,779
was arrested...

655
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:59,880
on-site for the murder of his superior Kim.

656
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:02,819
Jeong had had a grudge against Kim...

657
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:04,390
because of his recent dismissal.

658
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:07,760
They met last night and the argument escalated,

659
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:09,889
resulting in Jeong reportedly stabbing him...

660
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:11,360
- with a knife he'd brought. - No way.

661
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:13,459
- Police... - Hae Seong!

662
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:14,999
requested an autopsy...

663
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,539
to identify Kim's cause of death,

664
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:18,939
- How come... - while questioning...

665
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:21,640
a warrant for Jeong's arrest.

666
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:28,310
Find any proof you can...

667
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,550
focusing on last night's movements.

668
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,420
Hae Seong ended up like that...

669
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,820
because something happened last night.

670
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:36,790
- Get to it. - Yes, sir.

671
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:58,510
Sir.

672
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:02,450
- Yeong Hun. - Yes?

673
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:05,380
- You found something? - A recording.

674
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:11,960
You killed Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon!

675
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,560
You might not remember, but you fired the gun!

676
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:17,460
You killed Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon!

677
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:18,860
Do you have evidence?

678
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:26,900
Let's go.

679
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:33,480
I get it now.

680
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:36,049
He heard this and went to see Director Kim.

681
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:37,620
Where he fell into a trap?

682
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,490
Secure all exits...

683
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:43,089
and take all you can find.

684
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:44,119
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

685
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,620
Get Seo Myeong Ju's recording.

686
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:47,320
Take all that.

687
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:52,529
We're executing...

688
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:54,830
a search and seizure warrant at Jeong Hae Seong's residence.

689
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:56,869
I need you three to come with us...

690
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:57,969
to give a statement.

691
00:55:57,970 --> 00:55:59,840
- Get to it. - No, wait.

692
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,310
What's the rush?

693
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,510
You brought a lot of boxes.

694
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:06,079
Let me help. Come this way.

695
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,049
This could become obstruction.

696
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:09,079
Get started!

697
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,149
- Let us through. - I can help.

698
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:11,279
Please cooperate.

699
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,920
- Take your time. - Let us in.

700
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:14,350
Coming through.

701
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:16,049
Get out of the way.

702
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:17,120
- Fine. - Come in.

703
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:21,390
My leg cramped up.

704
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:24,530
Wait.

705
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,640
What...

706
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,010
You can go now. Okay?

707
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:44,010
Guys. Search the second floor thoroughly too.

708
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,220
- Let's go. - Okay.

709
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,520
After you.

710
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:53,119
Let's get going. To the police station.

711
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,120
- Okay. - Go on.

712
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:55,659
This was found...

713
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:58,000
during the search of Jeong Hae Seong's home.

714
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:03,500
It contains a recording of your conversation...

715
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:05,640
with Director Kim.

716
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:11,710
I can't let my guard down with him.

717
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:14,709
Tell Detective Cho he did well...

718
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:16,350
and pay him handsomely.

719
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:26,090
What do you plan to do with Jeong Hae Seong?

720
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,090
We set a trap and caught him.

721
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:30,330
Let's open him up.

722
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:35,170
We'll see if my gold appears or not.

723
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,370
I'm hungry.

724
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:18,580
I want food.

725
00:58:21,310 --> 00:58:22,310
Seolleongtang, please.

726
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:24,820
He's a psycho.

727
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:26,620
Hey.

728
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:28,420
Order him a seolleongtang.

729
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:33,460
They got Hae Seong?

730
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,390
The police are questioning him.

731
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:39,030
Mom. Do you know anyone...

732
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:41,929
Who are you calling?

733
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:44,800
We can't just sit and wait. Let's break him out of there.

734
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,839
Yes, it's me.

735
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,740
Get all the boys and...

736
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:52,080
Let's break free from the age of violence.

737
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:53,939
We should do something.

738
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,510
We can't let innocent Hae Seong suffer.

739
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,690
If you'd come a bit earlier, we could've eaten together.

740
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,460
We meet again so soon.

741
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:19,340
Let's see what state you're in.

742
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:23,169
Not too bad.

743
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:24,810
I'm not easily intimidated.

744
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:27,310
- So full of energy. - Because I'm not guilty.

745
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:28,980
You know that.

746
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:31,120
Too much hope...

747
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,620
makes you miserable.

748
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:36,320
"Everything's fine. Nothing will go wrong."

749
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,920
"I can win as long as I don't give up."

750
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:40,960
Hope...

751
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:42,730
is evil.

752
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:44,860
Because it prolongs suffering,

753
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:47,530
of all the evil in the world,

754
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:49,530
hope is the worst.

755
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,010
Many years ago,

756
00:59:56,470 --> 00:59:59,010
I met someone just like you.

757
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:03,010
He was so stubborn,

758
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:05,250
he ended up dead in a vault.

759
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:09,590
How dare you mention my father?

760
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:12,760
Where did you hide my gold?

761
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:14,690
Tell me.

762
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:17,060
Do you want to go down a murderer?

763
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:26,039
Why do you think I have it?

764
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,740
Because you have it.

765
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:34,510
Chairwoman Seo, you've become a monster.

766
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,510
What made you like this?

767
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:39,850
The chosen people...

768
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,320
have a duty and responsibility to care about education.

769
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,720
The next 100 years?

770
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:50,030
I'll raise up those who will run our nation.

771
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:51,759
That's my dream.

772
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,030
What of the people who died for that pipe dream?

773
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,499
Stepping on a few insects is nothing...

774
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,230
when you're on a long journey.

775
01:00:58,370 --> 01:00:59,740
That's not a dream.

776
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:04,210
It's a desire and obsession. You pitiful woman.

777
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:07,010
You're pitying me when you're in that seat?

778
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:10,280
I'll ask you again.

779
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,520
My gold.

780
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:15,720
Where is it?

781
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:18,920
It's in your pipe dream.

782
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,330
It must be in your blood.

783
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:30,800
Bad things can be inherited.

784
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:33,370
Okay.

785
01:01:33,371 --> 01:01:35,469
Do you know where I'll go as soon as I leave?

786
01:01:35,470 --> 01:01:36,910
I'll go to Yu Jeong.

787
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,940
I'll cut off a finger and send it to you.

788
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:41,280
Then you'll call me in tears.

789
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:43,009
You'll beg me to stop and to see you.

790
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:44,579
You'll offer to tell me anything.

791
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:46,280
But I won't stop...

792
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:51,120
until all the people you care about become miserable.

793
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:53,659
Don't touch anyone else.

794
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:56,030
You'd be dead if I so much as touched you.

795
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:00,330
I swear I'll take you down.

796
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:07,940
We have a friendship of sorts.

797
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:10,170
For that, I'll give you one day.

798
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:12,410
Think hard tonight...

799
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:14,340
and then call me tomorrow.

800
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:17,380
My number's the same.

801

806

809

Shoot.

810
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:32,920
Stop it!

811

Darn you!

812
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:40,800
Let go!

813
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:45,140
Pull over.

814
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:50,210
Pull over.

815
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,020
How in the world...

816
01:05:42,450 --> 01:05:43,450

Go and protect them.
