5
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,970
Don't move.

6
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,090
Ms. Oh Su Ah?

7
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,900
Who are you?

8
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,360
What are you doing here?

9
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,500
 Why is she here? 

10
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,280
Stop! Stop! Stop!

11
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,820
Move your hand!

12
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,120
This looks like a toy, right?

13
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,560
It's a real gas gun. Come on.

14
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,100
   

15
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:00,060
I told you not to move!

16
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,510
Take off your hat and mask.

17
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,020
Hey! Hey!

18
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,350
Hey!

19
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,780
Gosh! Hey!

20
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,210
     

21
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,570
 Wow! Why is she so fast? 

22
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:35,660
Hey! I was on the track team in high school!

23
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,770
Stop right there!

24
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,270
Ahjussi! That weirdo over there!

25
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,690
A weirdo?

26
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,810
Where did he go?

27
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,230
Didn't you see him? Wearing a hat and mask?

28
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,330
I didn't.

29
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,890
I'm sorry, Ahjussi!

30
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,970
If it hurts, let me know!

31
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,370
Please!

32
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,540
Geez...

33
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,370
He disappeared without a trace.

34
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,870
If I see him again, he's dead meat.

35
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,530
What?

36
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,300
Hey, so did she catch you?

37
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,170
 You should have been careful! 

38
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,700
 You can't let a teacher get you like that! 

39
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,110
Got it. I will be careful.

40
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,710
I had no idea someone would be on patrol.

41
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,330
What about your face?

42
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,720
She didn't see your face, right?

43
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,100
 Thankfully, no. 

44
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,230
But that woman is strange.

45
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,690
She runs like some kind of machine.

46
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,990
Is she the Terminator?

47
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,330
What?

48
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,970
So? What happened? Did you get him?

49
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,180
No.

50
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,590
I seriously...

51
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,930
I just barely missed him.

52
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,510
If I had known, maybe I should have just fired.

53
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,800
 My goodness! 

54
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,700
What would you have done without the gas gun?

55
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,280
Hey. I told you, right?

56
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,430
You need it. It's scary out there these days!

57
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,940
I know, I know.

58
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,720
Goodness, I'm alive thanks to you, Mother.

59
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,330
You must feel so proud.

60
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,730
If you are alive thanks to me, want to come and help me close up?

61
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,220
Mom, I think I'm still in shock. My heart...

62
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,470
I'm going to go home and rest.

63
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,520
Good night.

64
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,680
This is my fault.

65
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,690
I raised her.

66
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,480
The more I think about it, I was so close.

67
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,220
If I had caught him,

68
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,240
I could have been a brave citizen, straight to full-time teacher.

69
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,630
I hope he shows up again.

70
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,610
What a strange person.

71
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,580
I can't get used to it.

72
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,620
   

73
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,920
   

74
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,600
Someone broke into the old building last night.

75
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,440
Ms. Oh Su Ah discovered an intruder on the first floor

76
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,590
and chased him, but he got away.

77
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,540
She did not see his face.

78
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,690
See if there were other witnesses.

79
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,210
Got it.

80
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,720
What is "n" if you want to get the same equation?

81
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,350
"N" would be 9, right?

82
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:24,170
Class is adjourned for today. Good work. See you next class.

83
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:27,220
- Thank you! 
 - Thank you!

84
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,340
Why am I doing math at my age?

85
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,240
What about our age?

86
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,030
Never mind.

87
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,570
Hae Seong, this is your first mission.

88
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,100
I know.

89
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:48,850
Dong Min's fingers are way too slow.

90
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:52,180
I'll give you three days. Get to the max level by then.

91
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,410
You can do it, right?

92
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,980
Yeah.

93
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,630
But I don't know this game.

94
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,510
Learn it, bastard! Just learn it!

95
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,110
Three days.

96
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,680
- Don't let us down. 
 - Okay.

97
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,540
Three days.

98
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,230
Fighting!

99
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,890
I know that game.

100
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,770
- Want me to teach you? 
 - How can you say that?

101
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,180
Don't you have any pride?

102
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,970
You'll play it because those bastards tell you to?

103
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,440
Be a man, bastard.

104
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,460
What did you say?

105
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,470
Game max level. Don't tell the Team Leader and Yeong Hun.

106
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,660
Senior, this is the NIS.

107
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,700
Do you want us to hack the game to reach the max level?

108
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,030
You are crossing the line.

109
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,390
Just think of it as part of the mission.

110
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,290
I am struggling right now.

111
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,830
I'm hanging up.

112
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,430
Hello? Mi Jeong. Park Mi Jeong! Hey!

113
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:59,000
Goodness... struggling, huh?

114
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,930
Why don't you get me to max level, then?

115
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,660
No thanks.

116
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,310
Oppa, you are so impatient.

117
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,480
Before I even had a chance to tell you not to, you got involved with Park Tae Su.

118
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,130
I don't know what I'm doing here, either.

119
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,370
What kind of kid is he?

120
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,330
Typical thug trash.

121
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:18,860
A bully whose assemblyman dad has his back.

122
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,630
How about you, Yu Jeong? Are you okay?

123
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,610
Me? Me...

124
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,880
I-I-I'm...

125
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,170
We are in the Student Council together.

126
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,320
What?

127
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,800
You too, Yu Jeong?

128
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,870
Why? Is that weird?

129
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:37,180
I heard it's hard to get positions in there.

130
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,250
My cousin is something else.

131
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,660
Well, it just happened.

132
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,150
A-Anyway, watch out for that Park Tae Su.

133
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,080
He's an ass, but he's on the Student Council.

134
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,660
- If the Student Council hates you, I can't help you. 
 - Watch your language!

135
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,400
Ew! Smells like a boomer.

136
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,690
I'm off. Come down in five minutes.

137
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,420
Boomer?

138
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,350
Ms. Oh, are you mocking me?

139
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,600
No.

140
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,530
So what is this person you saw last night?

141
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,530
I told you to have a special sense of purpose,

142
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,630
to go on patrol with that special purpose.

143
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:29,070
But why did you especially miss him, Ms. Oh?

144
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,040
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,520
Next time...

146
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,250
Next time, I will get him.

147
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,170
You might as well pray that he comes back.

148
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,840
Stop saying useless things.

149
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,380
See those?

150
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,810
Go through all of those and submit a proposal.

151
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,780
All of those?

152
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,390
Too many?

153
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,020
Then I'll do it.

154
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,260
Let me see...

155
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,660
Does our school have openings for teachers?

156
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,520
No!

157
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,790
Of course, I'll do it.

158
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:08,020
I love this kind of work.

159
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,490
Sure.

160
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,550
- Yes. I'm okay. 
  - Besides Ms. Oh Su Ah ,

161
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,650
there are no other witnesses.

162
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,620
Nothing out of the ordinary on the CCTV, either.

163
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,860
I see.

164
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,860
But there is subtle noise in the camera footage.

165
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,590
The security company says a video jammer may have been used.

166
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,950
A video jammer?

167
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,720
How interesting.

168
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,560
If he ran away on the first floor,

169
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,050
he hasn't gotten to the basement yet.

170
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,870
He will be back.

171
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,220
Let's keep watching...

172
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,980
how he plays.

173
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,300
This is that, right?

174
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,990
Workplace bullying.

175
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,150
The struggles of a contractor.

176
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:00,510
He's saying if it's unfair, be a full-time teacher.

177
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,170
In terms of the bullying...

178
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,890
Su Ah,

179
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,970
you have a prior record.

180
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:10,790
Oh. Things were already bad and that man showed up!

181
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,600
But I have a question.

182
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,970
Why do you think the intruder was there?

183
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,080
That is a good question.

184
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,290
What is in there anyway?

185
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,130
I don't know. I'm sure only he knows.

186
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:25,010
I'm already scared of the urban legends. An intruder now?

187
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:28,590
Why won't they just tear down that old building?

188
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,330
Urban legends?

189
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:34,580
There's a ballet studio in the basement.

190
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,600
It happened there...

191
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,670
What are the three of you doing?

192
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,840
Vice Principal...

193
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,850
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

194
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,480
 Rock, paper, scissors, shoot! 

195
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,250
Okay! Shoot!

196
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,800
Pass!

197
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,410
 Gosh, come on. 

198
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,360
 Really... 

199
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,130
Quiet!

200
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,580
Let us start class. Open to page 125.

201
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,900
Where did Dong Min go?

202
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,940
Ms. Oh, Dong Min went home sick earlier.

203
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,140
Park Tae Su did this, right?

204
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,460
Who else could there be?

205
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,880
He didn't say anything like that to me.

206
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,270
You weren't in the office, so he told me.

207
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:40,140
I forgot to relay it to you. Sorry!

208
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,600
Got it. Let's start class.

209
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,190
What did we learn last time?

210
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,260
 Russo-Japanese War. 

211
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,910
Right. Today, let's cover the Eulsa Forced Treaty.

212
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:57,940
As you know, the "Eulsa Forced Treaty" is a more accurate term than "Eulsa Treaty."

213
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,210
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep. 

214
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,300
   

215
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,190
I don't have his number, so I can't call.

216
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,290
This is bothering me.

217
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,250
 Game over. 

218
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,960
Damn it!

219
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:53,480
     

220
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,580
   

221
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,290
   

222
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,180
   

223
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,320
Hey, Student!

224
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,850
Student!

225
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,590
Hurry up.

226
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,010
You've got some nerve on you!

227
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:43,310
Didn't you hear students shouldn't loiter near the old building?

228
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:47,520
A crazy man broke in last night, so the principal is sensitive right now.

229
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,090
You'll get in big trouble!

230
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,660
I will be careful.

231
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,020
Whoever he is, when he gets caught...

232
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,730
Anyway, don't come near the old building.

233
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,990
You might get in big trouble if you get close.

234
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:00,840
There must be treasures at the bottom or something.

235
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,940
Everyone is making a fuss about it.

236
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,420
This ugly building is the bane of my existence.

237
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,770
I should get going.

238
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,000
Sure, sure. Study hard.

239
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,450
Got it.

240
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,780
   

241
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,170
The principal at Byeongmun High School?

242
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,670
Yes. He was headed to the basement.

243
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,110
 Anything special? 

244
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,870
Do you know why he went downstairs?

245
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:33,270
 Not exactly. Clearly, there is something in the basement. 

246
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:38,210
I mean... the principal wouldn't go all that way to poop.

247
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,920
Don't talk about black noodles while eating poop.

248
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,000
The other way around.

249
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,260
The school is aware of an intruder.

250
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,440
 Let's move cautiously. 

251
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,260
Got it.

252
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,300
Thanks.

253
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:47,570
Aren't you angry being a victim all the time?

254
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,110
I am.

255
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,160
But there's nothing I can do.

256
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,670
All I can do is take and bear it.

257
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:00,080
Don't tell our teacher.

258
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,280
I'll get in more trouble if you do.

259
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,310
You were talking about your grandmother's ID.

260
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,000
Is that why Tae Su is bullying you?

261
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,100
That and... a bunch of things.

262
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,940
But probably because he thinks it's fun.

263
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:23,340
Since I have no parents and I'm a parasite who lives with my grandma,

264
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,730
he probably thinks he can treat me like this.

265
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,780
Thanks for this. I'll wash it and give it back to you.

266
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,340
Okay.

267
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,610
Dong Min.

268
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,530
What happened?

269
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,220
I heard you went home early. You weren't picking up.

270
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,290
I went to the doctor and came back.

271
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,860
Without even telling me?

272
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,860
What is wrong with your clothes?

273
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,190
I was taking the trash out.

274
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,810
- I should get going. 
 - Okay.

275
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,940
I should get going, too.

276
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,640
Stop for a second.

277
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,780
Follow me.

278
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,720
Damn, that makes me nervous.

279
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:57,350
Ms. Oh? Do you have something to say to me?

280
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,760
Be honest.

281
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,910
Are you bullying Dong Min?

282
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,240
Oh, I have a headache.

283
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:12,510
Fine. I know what that looked like.

284
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:16,360
But... it wasn't me.

285
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,050
Then explain.

286
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:23,290
Why was a kid who went home earlier with you? Why did his uniform look like that?

287
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,290
See? You can't answer.

288
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:33,290
I knew it when I saw you drinking.

289
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,390
Who are you trying to fool?

290
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,170
 Don't move. 

291
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,230
What are you doing?

292
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,470
Come over here.

293
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,720
- Why? 
 - Just come over here.

294
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,710
What are youâ€”

295
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,800
- Wait. 
 - Come over here for a second.

296
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,310
- What isâ€“ 
 - Come here!

297
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,400
Bastard, are you out of your mind?

298
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,740
Hey. Am I the plague or something?

299
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,210
Why did you avoid me?

300
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,740
I'm sorry. It was reactive.

301
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,400
Reactive? Watch me react and hit you.

302
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,620
He is hopeless.

303
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,060
I'm going to keep an eye on you. Don't cause trouble.

304
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,200
I know that better than anyone. Bye now.

305
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,980
Team Leader.

306
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,680
You need to look at this.

307
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,180
"A mega-large project by Seo Myeong Ju, Chairwoman of the Board of Byeongmun High School,

308
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:28,200
to make Seongju a global city for education."

309
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,840
"Elementary through graduate school. An all-in-one elite course.

310
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,480
Total expenses estimated at 800 billion..."

311
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,330
800 billion? That sounds familiar.

312
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,060
The gold bars of King Gojong.

313
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,150
You said they are worth 800 billion won, right?

314
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,180
Then what?

315
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,090
Smuggling them out abroad for money laundering

316
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:52,060
and using the money to fund this project?

317
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,170
Using national funds like it's her own money.

318
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,330
   

319
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:08,510
I hear online gambling is a big problem recently among students.

320
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:12,250
Have there been any cases at our school?

321
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:16,130
Chairwoman, your love for the school and students...

322
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:20,790
There is no need to worry. As Vice Principal Baek Gwang Du, I swear

323
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:25,310
on my educational career, I will make sure the students do not play a single game.

324
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:30,310
Mr. Baek, delete the game on your computer first.

325
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:33,090
Oh, that's for dementia prevention...

326
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:41,120
As you all know, the Edu-City construction is almost complete.

327
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,070
Please keep clear of anything

328
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:47,870
that may negatively impact the image of the foundation and the school.

329
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:51,180
Got it. You can count on me.

330
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,540
 Next item on the agenda is the demerits system. 

331
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,120
Do they want to increase the demerits?

332
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,420
Don't ask me. It's coming from the teachers' meeting.

333
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,120
The vice principal wants us to decide.

334
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,090
Damn it, he is crazy.

335
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:16,020
Hey, Ye Na. Can you talk to the chairwoman? Get rid of Gwang Du.

336
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,560
Say that to Mom, and she'll get rid of you first.

337
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,400
Let's decide on the demerit increases per subject.

338
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,820
What?

339
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,010
Darn, you smell like smoke.

340
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,240
I thought you quit smoking.

341
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,850
I do it on and off, bastard.

342
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,970
The transfer student is getting on my nerves.

343
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,810
What did he do?

344
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,140
He's funny.

345
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,920
He let Dong Min loose without asking his owner.

346
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,740
Stop it. I feel bad for him.

347
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,050
Did you lock him up somewhere?

348
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,400
In the dumpster by the recycling bins.

349
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,330
Crazy bastard.

350
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:00,240
He was sobbing, begging me not to put him there.

351
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,870
- Want to see a video? 
 - Let me see.

352
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:06,310
Did you have to do that?

353
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,920
What did you say?

354
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,740
Honestly, you know.

355
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:18,330
There is a line.

356
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,980
Also, the kids don't like you being like this.

357
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,810
If you impact the Student Council...

358
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:26,150
Wow. This bitch is giving me a headache.

359
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:29,660
Who are you to tell me what to do or not?

360
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:33,270
I let you speak to me since we're on the council. But you don't know your place.

361
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:36,100
Do you think you're on our level now?

362
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,800
What's wrong with you? Don't get any other ideas.

363
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,590
You crawled in here riding on Ye Na's coattails.

364
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,770
- Tae Su. 
 - What?

365
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,410
- That's enough. 
 - What? Am I wrong?

366
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:48,910
Just last year, she was a useless nobody. Ye Na gave her a life.

367
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,300
Hey.

368
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,120
You should be grateful to Dong Min.

369
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,170
If it wasn't him, it'd be you.

370
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:58,130
Got it. You can stop now.

371
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,480
You're starting to get on my nerves.

372
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,380
Hey. You can stop covering for her.

373
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,060
You're muddying the waters around the council.

374
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,570
I think you're doing the muddying.

375
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,600
Nothing Yu Jeong said was wrong.

376
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,870
Apologize to Yu Jeong.

377
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:29,040
- Hey. 
 - Isn't your dad running for his 4th term?

378
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,000
The head of his party was at my house last night.

379
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I think he was talking to Mom about endorsements.

380
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,980
If your dad's out of a job, you're a nobody, too.

381
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,450
So let's apologize before that happens.

382
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,270
I'm sorry.

383
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,390
Okay.

384
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,480
Ye Na.

385
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,620
Thank you for earlier.

386
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,430
I've been waiting to do that.

387
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:19,100
He's a piece of trash.

388
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,560
But Yu Jeong.

389
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,840
Don't chime in like that next time.

390
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,960
When you tried to pull back Tae Su?

391
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,050
Let me say that kind of stuff.

392
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,790
Not you.

393
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,280
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll be careful.

394
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,970
Let's go.

395
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,750
Up to here.

396
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,480
The top 1%.

397
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,900
Gather these kids and create a top-tier class.

398
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,850
You want to split the pre-existing advanced class?

399
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:52,680
Provide them the best study space possible,

400
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,320
plus extracurricular and admissions consulting.

401
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,710
Differentiate it somehow from the advanced class.

402
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:04,230
Chairwoman, students are complaining more about policy.

403
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:08,180
Especially from students not in the top 10%.

404
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:13,130
They're not thinking about how they can win.

405
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,360
That's why they're in the 90%.

406
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:22,070
Splitting the class in these circumstances...

407
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,320
may make the complaints grow even more.

408
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,550
When Black people were enslaved in America,

409
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:31,590
many slaves murdered their masters and escaped.

410
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:34,230
Someone wrote this in a book.

411
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,850
"How to create a slave."

412
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,560
It's very simple.

413
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,560
Create a caste system among the slaves,

414
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,860
and make the differences in castes very clear.

415
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,610
Discriminate.

416
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:51,270
Create conflict among the slaves...

417
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:58,450
Make them complain laterally, not vertically.

418
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:01,960
Let's separate the 90% of students, too.

419
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,770
With names similar to "advanced class."

420
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:06,850
Every 30%. Three classes.

421
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:09,480
Okay, got it.

422
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,310
Aren't you going to eat?

423
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,460
In a bit.

424
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:28,860
It's embarrassing to eat alone.

425
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,490
Fine, then.

426
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:47,900
I don't like crowded places.

427
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,010
Wake me up when you're going.

428
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,280
Why did you ask me about the old building?

429
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,790
Hyung is sleeping.

430
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,150
We're the same age.

431
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:02,760
Just so you know, don't go in there.

432
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,610
Especially not the basement.

433
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,960
I know because I've been there.

434
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:14,800
I can tell you if you're curious...

435
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,860
while we eat.

436
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,400
Let's go. I'm hungry.

437
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,070
Let's hurry.

438
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,710
Aren't you going to eat?

439
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,990
Now that we're here, tell me.

440
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,820
Why shouldn't I go into the old building?

441
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,330
Before I do, if you're not going to eat that...

442
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:41,040
Here. Take it all.

443
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,040
Take it all.

444
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,680
Eat plenty.

445
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,730
You don't know this because you're new, Hae Seong.

446
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,980
The urban legend of Byeongmun High's old building.

447
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:57,930
This is from when classes were held over there

448
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,650
in the ballet department.

449
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:14,810
A girl who practiced until late every night, dreaming of becoming a ballerina.

450
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,690
 That must hurt! 

451
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:41,210
She was being bullied by her classmates.

452
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,240
But one day...

453
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,730
 - Hey! 
 - Where are you going? 

454
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:45,770
 Stop right there! 

455
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:48,100
 Stop right there! 

456
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,180
 Stop right there! 

457
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,860
 Wait!â€” 

458
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,080
 Oh, no! 

459
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,810
 No! 

460
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,780
 With her dreams gone, she chose... 

461
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,230
What are you talking about?

462
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:33,710
The students hid her body somewhere in the building...

463
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:42,490
so the world would not know what they did.

464
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,220
 Student. 

465
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,710
 What are you doing here? You should go home. 

466
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:19,920
 Ahjussi, I have no legs... 

467
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,520
It started then.

468
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,880
They say every night around the hour she died,

469
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,920
she appears in the closed dance studio.

470
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,160
Interesting story.

471
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,520
I hope you don't expect me to believe it.

472
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,690
I-I-I don't believe in stuff like that.

473
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,370
In this time and age? No way.

474
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,440
I saw her.

475
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:58,050
I told you. I've been in there.

476
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,320
You really saw a ghost?

477
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,620
   

478
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,510
I swear.

479
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,640
I saw it correctly.

480
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,730
It's definitely the ghost from the urban legend.

481
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,300
What?

482
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:56,670
Want me to tell you more school ghost stories?

483
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:59,380
The four legendary Byeongmun High ghost stories...

484
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,530
There are four ghost stories at our school.

485
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,290
The first one is at the old building.

486
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,440
The second oneâ€“

487
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,990
 Look at the losers stuff themselves! 

488
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,340
Dong Min?

489
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:24,390
I hope he is okay.

490
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,640
What if he's bullied?

491
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,010
Could he be bullied?

492
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:31,420
If he's bullied...

493
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,710
Who would bully Dong Min?

494
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,800
Could it be the transfer student?

495
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,110
That's what I think this far.

496
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,120
But...

497
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,850
I'm not so sure when I look at him.

498
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:47,910
If you're not sure, just wait and see.

499
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:53,320
When you get a chance, try talking to Dong Min.

500
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,670
I mixed in honey to make it more appetizing.

501
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,980
Eat up.

502
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,390
A great meal topper.

503
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,130
Look away.

504
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,770
Put away your cell phones.

505
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:20,000
Dong Min, why escape without Master's permission and go through this?

506
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:23,530
Do you think you can do whatever with a new friend?

507
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,340
Okay. Pick up your spoon.

508
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:32,630
Keep acting like this, and I'll take your pants.

509
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,940
Eat! Eat!

510
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,590
Don't eat it.

511
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,410
What did you say?

512
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,580
I've been watching. This is too much.

513
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,460
You guys are revolting.

514
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,160
He's gone crazy.

515
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,890
Say it again.

516
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:44,940
I said say it again.

517
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,570
Hae Seong...

518
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,000
What did you say, you bastard?

519
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:57,820
Sorry. I got sensitive.

520
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,540
My bad. I apologize.

521
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:03,090
I'll make sure this doesn't happen again...

522
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,540
What are you doing?

523
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,660
Teacher! We're in trouble.

524
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,720
Hey.

525
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,520
Was your name Jeong Hae Seong?

526
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,160
- Let's go. 
 - Hey. Let's not do this.

527
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,370
Hey.

528
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,050
You.

529
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:44,290
I can't get into a fight. Hey!

530
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:47,440
Look at this bastard. He must be crazy.

531
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,140
I said let's stop.

532
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,920
Let go.

533
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,520
I said let go, you bastard!

534
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,610
The kids are watching. Let's really stop.

535
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,190
Let go, you son of a bitch.

536
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:05,140
I said let go, you son of a bitch!

537
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:08,550
Hey, you.

538
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:34,780
 Both of you, stop! 

539
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,680
He...

540
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,360
What do you think you're doing?

541
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:49,890
Go to the counseling office, you two!

542
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:59,510
Wow, the views are going crazy.

543
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,690
Wow, I've never seen Tae Su take it like that.

544
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,500
Things are about to get messy.

545
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,440
Interesting kid.

546
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,170
Let's eat.

547
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,830
   

548
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,490
 Are you a goldfish, Oppa? 

549
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:32,800
 Not even half a day, and you're in trouble? 

550
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,320
You have no idea what you just did, do you?

551
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:41,160
You messed with the wrong person.

552
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,990
I'll make sure you regret it.

553
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,510
Tae Su, what are you doing here?

554
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,340
Leave.

555
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,860
Getting into a fight as soon as you got here?

556
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:56,120
I wonder what you'll grow up to be.

557
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,850
I hope we get along.

558
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,610
Nothing has changed at school.

559
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,290
How come you're here alone?

560
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,700
Where's the class president?

561
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,820
The vice principle.

562
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,650
Why did you fight with Tae Su?

563
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:34,210
He started a fight.

564
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:36,080
Tae Su did?

565
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:39,790
What beef do you have with Tae Su?

566
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:44,880
You two had a fistfight. Neither of you can get away with this.

567
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,840
So, answer me.

568
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,750
Why did you fight?

569
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:53,060
You should've called a teacher if a fight was brewing.

570
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,880
Are you a gangster?

571
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,570
A thug?

572
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:59,850
You barely got transferred here, and alreadyâ€“

573
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:02,680
You really don't know anything.

574
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:05,060
What?

575
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,950
Are you pretending not to know or

576
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:10,440
can't you read the room?

577
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,620
Ms. Oh, do you even care about your class?

578
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:21,130
I'll just think Tae Su is a great actor.

579
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:25,090
I'd be really disappointed if you're pretending not to know.

580
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,910
I have nothing more to say.

581
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:33,180
You take it from here, Ms. Oh.

582
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:17,250
I got you one while buying for myself.

583
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:19,870
You couldn't eat because of me.

584
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:23,870
Thanks.

585
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,310
What did the teacher say?

586
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:35,270
Well, you know...

587
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,220
a bunch of stuff. Telling me not to fight.

588
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,370
I'm sorry. It's all because of me...

589
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,930
You have nothing to be sorry about.

590
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:52,260
The world is the problem.

591
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:57,590
Why did you hold back earlier?

592
00:44:57,590 --> 00:45:00,620
You seem like you're really good at fighting.

593
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,520
What do they say?

594
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,510
The him... the one who's really strong, you know.

595
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:10,840
- Himsoonjjin*? 
 - Yeah. Yes, that. 
  (*Someone who looks weak by their appearance but are hiding strong power inside them) 

596
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,450
Dong Min.

597
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:53,790
Cheer up.

598
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,330
You, too.

599
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:13,910
Who does he think he is?

600
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,960
Why would I not care about my class?

601
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:22,250
Why else would I want to be a full-time teacher? Why? Why else?

602
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:25,100
Why? Why else would I? Shit!

603
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:28,270
Gosh, I'm sorry.

604
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:30,170
I should've said this to him!

605
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:31,830
She is not well.

606
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:35,980
Oh Su Ah. You stupid girl.

607
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,870
Brace yourself, Jeong Hae Seong.

608
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:46,820
I'll get rid of you.

609
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:51,360
Shouldn't you say, "I'll break you"?

610
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,330
Same, same.

611
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:58,530
Damn it.

612
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:01,890
My life is so pathetic that...

613
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:05,490
a student makes a joke out of me.

614
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:08,050
You chose this path.

615
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:09,980
Stick through it.

616
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:13,170
Who was that student you had in your first year?

617
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:14,300
Min Ji?

618
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,510
You said you'll become a full-time teacher for her.

619
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:19,770
To do for others what you couldn't do for her.

620
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,720
Did I say that?

621
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,430
Yeah. While sobbing.

622
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,510
Drink quietly and go home.

623
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:56,790
Team Leader,

624
00:47:56,790 --> 00:48:00,610
Agent Jeong will be okay. Right?

625
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:03,890
Don't even think about wearing a school uniform.

626
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:06,490
We're so low on manpower.

627
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:10,570
Plus, your face doesn't cut it.

628
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:14,630
You look like a dean, yet you're obsessed with the school uniform.

629
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:17,790
I'm just worried from the bottom of my heart.

630
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:20,360
Agent Jeong can be fiery.

631
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,420
That can be true for others but not Hae Seong.

632
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:25,890
I know him better than anyone.

633
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:28,400
I heard you've been together for a long time.

634
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,180
You've known him since he was a kid.

635
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:34,320
That's right.

636
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,980
Wow...

637
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,830
Time flies...

638
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:41,450
He was so tiny. Now, he's all grown up...

639
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,260
Gosh.

640
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:50,980
Anyway, he won't get himself in trouble recklessly.

641
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,990
I trust Hae Seong.

642
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,430
Hey, the food is soggy. Let's eat.

643
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:04,700
Director.

644
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:07,300
Eat first.

645
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:11,220
Take a look yourself.

646
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,660
Watch while eating.

647
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,830
 Let go! 

648
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:17,660
 I said let go, you son of a bitch! 

649
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:21,230
 Seriously! 

650
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:35,850
Wow, that transfer student is cool.

651
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:40,630
Of all people, you, Tae Su. Here.

652
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:43,290
I'm not in the mood to laugh.

653
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:45,190
How should I ruin him?

654
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,840
My Tae Su has no patience with such things.

655
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,670
So...

656
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:53,650
Want this hyung's help?

657
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:57,450
Leave it. He has no game.

658
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:02,090
If you say so.

659
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:06,190
When are you planning to pay me back, by the way?

660
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:12,270
If you can't pay me back, bring me IDs like you did before.

661
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:19,430
   

662
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:41,220
I enjoyed the video.

663
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:44,630
What are you up to?

664
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:46,770
Team Leader An, haven't you warned him?

665
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:49,770
To stay out of trouble and focus on the mission.

666
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,980
I apologize.

667
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:55,050
Let me be brief, Agent Jeong Hae Seong.

668
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:59,160
The mission stops the moment something like this happens again.

669
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:03,380
You will undergo an investigation for allegedly damaging a national treasure.

670
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:07,560
It would be the end of Team 4.

671
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,850
And you.

672
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:12,160
I heard you joined the NIS after your dad.

673
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,360
What will you say to him when you find him later?

674
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,490
That you got fired during a mission?

675
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:23,060
That'd be an embarrassing thing in itself.

676
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,270
Stop watching. Leave.

677
00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:32,980
I have an important round tomorrow.

678
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:43,500
Why does he have to talk like that?

679
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,300
Don't worry about what he said about your father.

680
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,750
Just be careful from now on.

681
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,960
Do you have what I asked for?

682
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,740
This can open any standard door lock.

683
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:03,410
You said the storage is likely behind the door.

684
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:07,100
Let's wrap up the mission today.

685
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,580
Okay.

686
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,490
 Ta-da! 

687
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:35,590
 What is this? 

688
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:38,140
 Your parents' day present! 

689
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:40,090
 Oh, really? 

690
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:42,540
 Wow, this is so cool. 

691
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:45,630
 I'll wear it every day for the rest of my life. 

692
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:49,340
 Dad, I have job experience homework I need to do. 

693
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,650
 You said you're a civil servant. 

694
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:54,930
 What should I say you do? 

695
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:57,940
 I'm like a compass. 

696
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,990
 A compass? 

697
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:06,740
 A nameless compass that points toward a prosperous future for our country. 

698
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:19,160
 When will you be back? Tomorrow is my birthday. 

699
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,980
 You think I forgot about that? 

700
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:24,300
 I'll be right back and wake you up. 

701
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,310
 Let's go to your favorite, the observatory. 

702
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:28,710
 Keep your promise this time. 

703
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:32,230
 Or I'll never speak to you again. 

704
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,120
 Promise. 

705
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,640
 I'll be right back. 

706
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,410
 Bye! 

707
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,070
 Dad! 

708
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,130
 Dad! 

709
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:57,230
 Yeah? 

710
00:53:57,230 --> 00:54:00,880
 You need to take this with you. Your notebook. 

711
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,070
 Thank you, son. 

712
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:15,350
 Bye! 

713
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:20,260
 I'll be right back. 

714
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:52,970
Who is it?

715
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:56,300
Hello, ma'am. I'm Dong Min's friend, Jeong Hae Seong.

716
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,570
Dong Min's friend at this hour?

717
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:00,110
Dong Min went to work.

718
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:02,250
Dong Min asked me for a favor.

719
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:04,810
- A favor? 
 - You must've not heard yet.

720
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:09,990
Dong Min got a financial scholarship at school. In order to receive it, your ID is needed.

721
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:12,090
He asked me to get it on his behalf.

722
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:15,860
Gosh, I'm so thankful.

723
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:17,920
- Just a moment. 
 - Yes.

724
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,580
Gosh... My goodness...

725
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:23,090
I can't believe it...

726
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:24,340
Hello.

727
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,520
Delivery!

728
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,990
Here.

729
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,950
I'll put it here. Enjoy.

730
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:30,440
Thanks.

731
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:33,790
   

732
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,490
Hae Seong.

733
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:19,850
What are you doing here?

734
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:26,570
What are you doing here?

735
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:29,700
I saw you while I was working my part-time job.

736
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:32,820
Why did you climb the fence?

737
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:38,440
By chance, is it because of that?

738
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,000
I'm right...

739
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,530
It's because of the old building's urban legend.

740
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:46,000
What?

741
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,470
That's why you snuck in...

742
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:52,400
You're headed to a no-entry area, without leaving an entry record.

743
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,140
Yes, you're right.

744
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:57,780
- Can I come in with you? 
 - No way.

745
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:03,700
It was hard for you to get into this school.

746
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:08,600
If you get suspended, it'll be your loss, and your grandma will be sad.

747
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:11,820
So, it's time to leave. Go, go.

748
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:16,000
He thinks he's immune to suspension.

749
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:31,270
I told you to leave.

750
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:36,300
I'm not following you. I'm just doing my thing.

751
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,070
You're so stubborn.

752
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:41,620
Come back tomorrow. Do your thing tomorrow.

753
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,360
Wait.

754
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,310
Do you hear that sound?

755
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,170
Team Leader.

756
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:13,800
I suspect this mission will take a little longer.

757
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,730
 What are you talking about? 

758
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:19,500
I think the chairwoman...

759
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:24,030
is looking for the gold, too.

760
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:22,980
   

761
01:03:40,970 --> 01:03:42,720
Dong Min, let's go.

762
01:03:48,670 --> 01:03:50,960
Let's go. It's dangerous to stay any longer.

763
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:04,530
 It started then. 

764
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:07,390
 They say, every night around the hour she died, 

765
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:11,150
 she appears in the closed dance studio. 

766
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:17,960
 Student. 

767
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:20,430
 What are you doing here? You should go home. 

768
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:25,930
 Ahjussi, I have no legs... 

769
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:36,800
It was true...

770
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:39,580
Our school's urban legend...

771
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:02,590
   

772
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:07,610
   

773
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:21,770
   

774
01:05:21,770 --> 01:05:24,160
   

775
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:57,990
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Undercover Love Team ðŸ’– @Viki.com 

776
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:27,390
 Who are you? 

777
01:06:27,390 --> 01:06:32,060
 Seo Byeong Mun, after hiding the gold, set up a riddle of the school urban legend. 

778
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:34,100
 You must be interested in ghost stories. 

779
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:37,430
 Jeong Hae Seong? Seriously! 

780
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:39,660
 Jeong Hae Seong, get yourself together. 

781
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:42,280
 Young man, you can't go in there. 

782
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,930
 This is very serious. 

783
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:50,160
 What happens to Hae Seong now? Will he really get kicked out?
