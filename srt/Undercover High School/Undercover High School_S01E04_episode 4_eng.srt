 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Undercover Love Team ðŸ’– @Viki.com 

4
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,000
You scared me!

5
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,610
Who are you?

6
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,300
A high school student.

7
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,160
Raise your hand if you're Gu Sang Tae.

8
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,330
Are you Gu Sang Tae?

9
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:52,030
I mean it is me, but...

10
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,620
Why is a high schooler here? Want a job?

11
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,530
You know Park Tae Su, right?

12
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,390
Give me all the materials related to him.

13
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,030
Why are you talking down to us?

14
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,000
Hey. How old are you?

15
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,890
Hey, it's fine. It's fine.

16
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,510
I hear home education is a fantasy these days.

17
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,200
Teach him properly and send him away.

18
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,970
Yes, Hyungnim.

19
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,070
You're dead, dude.

20
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,800
My fist was itchy, anyway.

21
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,900
Sunbae!

22
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,790
Sunbae!

23
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,710
How did you know I was here?

24
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,430
Damn it.

25
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,710
I heard roughly on the way.

26
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,230
We don't have time. Get the data first.

27
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,800
Got it.

28
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,380
And you.

29
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,160
Why didn't you mention the Anti-School Bullying Committee meeting?

30
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,090
If he hadn't told me, I would've never known!

31
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,180
I'm sorry.

32
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,320
I know you're trying not to burden others,

33
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,770
but please let us support you.

34
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,230
If you're struggling, lean on us, share with us.

35
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,880
We're a team!

36
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,760
Exactly.

37
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,050
I like everything about you, but you're oddly shy.

38
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,070
You shut up.

39
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,670
Got it.

40
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,640
We'll wrap up around here. You go ahead.

41
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,590
And you might need a witness for the Anti-School Bullying Committee Meeting.

42
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,410
Take this Ahjussi with you.

43
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,880
Okay.

44
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:47,230
â™«  It's chasing after me without stopping  â™«

45
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,950
â™«  There is nowhere to hide  â™«

46
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,440
No!

47
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,020
â™«  It's getting hot  â™«

48
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,880
â™«  Spectacularly, dramatically  â™«

49
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,650
â™«  Is it a hopeless battle?  â™«

50
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,490
â™«  Is it war without an enemy?  â™«

51
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,190
â™«  Can't keep running every day  â™«

52
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,050
â™«  But I still won't give up  â™«

53
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,360
â™«  It's getting hot  â™«

54
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,370
â™«  Spectacularly, dramatically  â™«

55
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,470
â™«  Hey, yo!  â™«

56
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,940
â™«  Hey, yo!  â™«

57
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,970
â™«  Hey, yo! I'm going to run, here I am  â™«

58
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,160
â™«  What you gonna do? â™«

59
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,270
â™«  Hey, yo! â™«

60
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,750
â™«  Hey, yo! â™«

61
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,710
â™«  Hey, yo! I'm going to run, here I am  â™«

62
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,850
Come.

63
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,200
I'm sorry I'm late.

64
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,260
â™«  Hey, yo!  â™«

65
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,960
â™«  Hey, yo! You can't stop  â™«

66
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,410
â™«  The reins are off  â™«

67
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,990
Now, shall we begin?

68
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,740
Jeong Hae Seong, what is this situation?

69
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,370
Not only are you late, but you brought an outsider to the committee?

70
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,230
- Who is he? 
 - An important witness to this case.

71
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,150
I needed some time to convince him.

72
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,640
What do you mean a witness?

73
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,420
One moment.

74
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,260
Okay. You're going to confess everything now.

75
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,280
If not, I'll beat you up real good like earlier.

76
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,770
The real operator of the illegal gambling site.

77
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,660
CEO Gu Sang Tae?

78
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,920
- Yes. 
 - You know someone here, right?

79
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,420
Yes. I do.

80
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,820
Him.

81
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,720
What kind of bullshit is this?

82
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,360
Ahjussi, you know me?

83
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,240
How do you two know each other?

84
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,500
That bastard.

85
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,860
He's a VIP client of our website.

86
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,790
He owes me a lot of money.

87
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:03,400
When I said I would forgive his debt,

88
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,980
he got me a new member and an ID.

89
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:11,450
Oh! The grandma who went to the police?

90
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,440
That was because of him.

91
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,640
Father, he's lying.

92
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,670
Listen to me.

93
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,990
Be quiet.

94
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,230
So how does what that man has to say

95
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,800
have to do with this Anti-School Bullying Committee Meeting?

96
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,270
I think you're mistaken.

97
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,110
This committee meeting is not for my son.

98
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:35,400
If you're asking me if I bullied Dong Min,

99
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,750
I'll say no. I've never done that.

100
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,810
Then who bullied Dong Min?

101
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,730
Everyone here knows.

102
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,660
Threatening kids to join the illegal gambling site,

103
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,200
taking their family members' IDs for his crimes,

104
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,000
all because they are weaker than him.

105
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,820
Because you can get away with it,

106
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,980
you hit a fellow student,

107
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,410
stepped all over him,

108
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,250
spit in his food,

109
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,620
and put him inside a dumpster.

110
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,740
You son of a bitch.

111
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,290
Wow.

112
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,400
This is ridiculous.

113
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,970
Dong Min, you tell us.

114
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,050
What are you doing? You say it.

115
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,080
That bastard bullied you, not me.

116
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,110
Dong Min,

117
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:53,500
the victim's testimony is treated like evidence.

118
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,680
So speak very carefully right now.

119
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,150
Do you have anything to add to what you said earlier?

120
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,160
All right then. Vice Principal?

121
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,950
Yes. Then regarding the school violence incident,

122
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,480
the committee has determined the punishment for

123
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,640
Jeong Hae Seong will be expelled...

124
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,510
No.

125
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,660
It wasn't Hae Seong.

126
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,650
Park Tae Su made me do all of it.

127
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,300
Everything Tae Su has done to me up until now,

128
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,170
he said to blame Hae Seong for it.

129
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,880
He used my grandmother to threaten me!

130
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,200
Hey.

131
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,600
Shut your mouth, bastard.

132
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,140
Dong Min,

133
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,000
can you be responsible for what you just said?

134
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,470
I said, can you be responsible for what you said?

135
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:00,220
Just because you say that,

136
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,640
it won't change the facts.

137
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,940
Even if others tell me there is no evidence,

138
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,380
this is the story I'm sticking with.

139
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,100
Dong Min.

140
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:24,600
Thank you. You've done enough.

141
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,290
I'm really sorry.

142
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,780
Don't cry, bastard. You'll turn ugly.

143
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,670
What you did was really cool.

144
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,180
Let me take it from here.

145
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,590
To back up Mr. Gu Sang Tae's testimony, here is evidence that involves Park Tae Su.

146
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:47,940
Please open this.

147
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,230
Where did you get this?

148
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,160
Don't ask. Everyone is waiting. Hurry up.

149
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,320
Can I go now?

150
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,880
- Stay right there. 
 - Okay.

151
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,930
That's me.

152
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,180
 Geez. 

153
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,700
 Here. 

154
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,520
   

155
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:40,710
Evidence, witness, the victim's testimony...

156
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,190
At this rate,

157
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:45,750
we need the police, not a committee, Tae Su.

158
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,700
Turn it off.

159
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,700
Turn it off, bastard.

160
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,470
Congratulations, Tae Su. You're done.

161
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:58,000
Turn it off, you son of a bitch!

162
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,370
You hit me first.

163
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,590
Tae Su!

164
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:12,340
Crazy bastard. Do you know whose son you just hit?

165
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,130
He is my student!

166
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,810
Who the hell are you?

167
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:20,040
- Hey! 
 - Honey!

168
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:26,050
Honey...

169
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,440
Tae Su...

170
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,870
Aigoo, Tae Su's father!

171
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,790
Should I call 911?

172
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,950
Should I call your aide?

173
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,080
I can take him downstairs.

174
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,810
Yes. What can I do to help you?

175
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,790
- Good job. 
 - Thank you.

176
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,860
- Hae Seong. 
 - Yes?

177
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,990
I'm sorry I caused all that.

178
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,270
I should have been honest from the start.

179
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,890
You had a reason not to.

180
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,360
Buy me some pastries.

181
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,540
Why are you nice to me?

182
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,610
I've always wondered, honestly.

183
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,930
Everyone at school treats me like I'm invisible.

184
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,100
But you don't.

185
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,170
You remind me of someone.

186
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:48,210
I'm sorry you hurt your back,

187
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:54,100
but I think we need to expel Tae Su.

188
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,040
- Chairwoman! 
 - He's involved in a criminal case.

189
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,610
That is beyond what I can allow.

190
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:05,580
It's too much of a risk for our school to keep defending Tae Su.

191
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,580
You squeezed so much money out of me.

192
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,990
And now you want to throw me to the curb?

193
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,970
Chairwoman, this isn't going to work.

194
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:19,640
Did you forget who got you the Edu-City permit?

195
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,430
You said billions were needed for the construction.

196
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,390
If the wrong rumors spread, Chairwoman,

197
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,840
your life's dream may blow up at the last minute.

198
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,230
Let's just work this out, Chairwoman.

199
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:36,880
If you understand that, there will be no expulsion for my son.

200
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,210
- That's why this is a problem for politicians. 
 - What?

201
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:46,260
They can't remember how they got to where they are, or...

202
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,570
who put them there when they were babies.

203
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:51,290
You crazy bitch!

204
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,350
Gently.

205
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,650
Gently, gently, gently.

206
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,790
Come on.

207
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:09,640
Stop whining!

208
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,660
Tae Su is going to be expelled.

209
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,500
What a relief.

210
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,110
Not even an assemblyman could get away with it.

211
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:25,590
No matter how good your intentions are, don't go around beating people up.

212
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,970
I'm giving you a warning instead of a demerit.

213
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,960
I will be careful.

214
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:48,450
â™«  Sunlight shining down into my heart  â™«

215
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:53,390
â™«  Like a flower blooming softly when you smile  â™«

216
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,030
All done.

217
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,160
Take this and keep applying it.

218
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,630
â™«  That my love can't be undone now  â™«

219
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,740
Thank you.

220
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,340
For what?

221
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,090
For posting on the bulletin board.

222
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,660
I can say this for sure.

223
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,270
Not everyone could've done that.

224
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,980
It's a compliment.

225
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,160
I didn't do it.

226
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,770
Well, someone truly amazing did it.

227
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:32,730
But how dare you, a kid, compliment a teacher? You have an attitude...

228
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,730
â™«  With you, oh, yes, with you  â™«

229
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:40,900
â™«  I assure you that my love can't be undone now  â™«

230
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,690
â™«  Love you, oh, I love you  â™«

231
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:49,910
â™«  This is my love letter to you  â™«

232
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,090
This was on your hair.

233
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,060
Where are you going, Ms. Oh?

234
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:27,370
The gold bars that the first director left...

235
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,070
I think we need to hurry.

236
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,460
 A girl who always lost the top spot to her friend 

237
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,880
 and got second place... 

238
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,430
 Oh, Eun Ok got first place! 

239
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,410
 Where? Where? 

240
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:29,000
 - You really came in first place. 
 - Congrats! 

241
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,470
 - Good job. 
 - Good for you. 

242
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,370
 - You worked hard. 
 - Look at this! First place! 

243
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,600
 She was blind with jealousy toward her friend 

244
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,330
 and did something she shouldn't have. 

245
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,240
 Her friend hit the ground head first and died. 

246
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,180
 The girl thought as she watched her friend... 

247
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,970
 "Now, I can come in first place." 

248
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:29,570
The student who killed her friend was found dead.

249
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:32,600
Since then, a rumor has spread.

250
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,130
When the clock strikes, don't be at school.

251
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:41,230
A pair of red eyes will come to get you.

252
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,070
There are two more stories like this?

253
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,860
They are the four urban legends.

254
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,330
But do you know what's interesting?

255
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,970
No one knows what the last story is.

256
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,460
- You don't know, either? 
 - No.

257
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,620
I looked on the internet and in books, but nothing...

258
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:02,710
I'm still looking, but I still haven't gotten any clue yet.

259
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,550
But Hae Seong, why are these people here?

260
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,980
What?

261
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,220
Oh, my god!

262
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,430
What are you doing?

263
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,640
It's so spooky here.

264
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,220
So spooky.

265
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,110
Hey, turn on the light. The light.

266
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,980
Scary.

267
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,500
Do you know them?

268
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,070
I forgot to tell you.

269
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,190
I work part-time here.

270
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:48,020
Here you go.

271
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,850
This punk works very hard.

272
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,850
What's your name, our Hae Seong's friend?

273
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,930
Lee Dong Min.

274
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,580
Come often, even if you're by yourself.

275
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,890
I'll give you lots of freebies.

276
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,100
You must be hungry. Eat up.

277
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,350
Thanks for the food.

278
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:21,090
It just came out of the oven. Eat it while it's hot.

279
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,870
- It's so good. 
 - Really?

280
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,700
What? This is delicious.

281
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,020
Here.

282
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,080
Your grandmother must've been scared.

283
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,420
Go take care of her.

284
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,230
Thank you.

285
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,280
I like having a friend.

286
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,030
Don't be so extra.

287
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,950
Kids like you never call after graduation.

288
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,280
I'm going to keep in touch.

289
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,240
Aigoo! Sure you will.

290
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,710
I'm watching you.

291
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,610
I'll get going.

292
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,530
What is wrong with you?

293
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:33,150
Hey, if you're going to space out, go elsewhere.

294
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,980
Don't make me lose my appetite.

295
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,980
Did something happen?

296
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,570
No, just because.

297
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,470
It's just that...

298
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,670
my heart...

299
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,300
is jumping.

300
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,670
Is that different from beating?

301
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,680
It is.

302
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,110
There's something...

303
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,960
there.

304
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,420
I'm sorry, Yu Jeong. You must be tired.

305
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:11,230
No. I got to look around, thanks to you. It was fun.

306
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,740
Did I just shop for myself?

307
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,850
Why didn't you get anything? You should've.

308
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:18,460
I don't really need anything. I'm okay.

309
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,730
Let's come back together next week.

310
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:27,310
Never mind. We'll be busy with midterms.

311
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,160
Right.

312
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,490
Still, you always come in first place in school.

313
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:32,900
Congratulations in advance.

314
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,940
You've been studying hard these days.

315
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,830
Maybe you'll beat me this time.

316
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:39,760
No way. Me? Beat you?

317
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,100
How?

318
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,150
Is that so?

319
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,530
Who did you get that for?

320
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,660
This? Hae Seong.

321
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,030
What?

322
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:55,430
Are you interested in Hae Seong?

323
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:58,870
If I had to say, very much so.

324
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,890
We walked so much today. I'm tired.

325
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:06,640
- I'll get going. 
 - Okay.

326
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,480
See you at school.

327
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:35,590
â™«  Sunlight shining down into my heart  â™«

328
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:40,170
 This was in your hair. 

329
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:47,720
About the advisor role for the Student Council...

330
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,960
As you all know, it's been chaotic around here because of Tae Su.

331
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,770
The higher-ups want a Student Council Advisor.

332
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,150
Who wants to volunteer?

333
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:00,700
It might be called "advisor," but who wants to be the Student Council's servant?

334
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,930
They have the real power here.

335
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,250
Even the teachers can't touch them.

336
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,760
Teachers, is this how you're going to be?

337
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,800
The meeting will not end until we decide this.

338
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,490
Good.

339
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:23,310
Then everyone who doesn't want it, get out.

340
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,100
Ms. Oh, your willingness to sacrifice...

341
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,050
How could I not love you, Ms. Oh?

342
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:36,480
What?

343
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,330
Why me?

344
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,720
It's decided, then!

345
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,200
What is?

346
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:18,230
What are you doing?

347
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,680
This looks expensive.

348
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,240
You are busy looking around, aren't you?

349
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,250
Get out of the way. Don't block me.

350
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,010
Ar you looking for Student Council members?

351
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:44,230
Thanks to someone so great...

352
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,460
I'm grateful but also worried.

353
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,680
It's a little complicated.

354
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,750
Why, why, why?

355
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,990
Because he's on the Student Council's radar.

356
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:58,620
In fact, it is on the Council President's radar.

357
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,820
Let me help you.

358
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:15,320
- Hey, Oppa. 
 - Huh?

359
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,180
How long will you be around here?

360
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,770
Why do you ask?

361
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,980
Because things are getting very twisted.

362
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,890
Something's wrong, huh?

363
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,810
Nothing is wrong.

364
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,670
Your hands are resting. Put them up.

365
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,060
Okay.

366
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,230
What are you staring at?

367
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,770
Were there always two clocks?

368
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:58,590
The twin clocks?

369
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,410
That's what we call them.

370
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,950
Since there were always two.

371
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,730
Here,

372
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:06,310
and over there.

373
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,740
   

374
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,420
Hi.

375
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,510
What are you doing here?

376
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,570
Can I take a look?

377
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,690
A tour of the Student Council room.

378
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,920
I didn't know you were interested in the Student Council.

379
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,330
What?

380
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:17,550
Yeah. A little bit.

381
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:22,240
But, unfortunately, regular students can't enter this room.

382
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,570
Is there a way?

383
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,560
I'll buy you pastries.

384
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,790
How about you become a member?

385
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,810
I think that would solve everything.

386
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:38,010
You coming in here and us becoming friends.

387
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,380
Why would you become friends with me?

388
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:45,000
I was going to give it to you later, but I got it while shopping for myself.

389
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,750
My arm hurts. Hurry, take it.

390
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:51,400
It wasn't that expensive. Don't worry about it.

391
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,240
Look at you.

392
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,320
How could a student have this kind of moneyâ€“

393
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,730
Right, you have a lot of it.

394
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:02,820
Still! Go return it.

395
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,240
- What? 
 - Buy workbooks with this kind of money.

396
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,360
I know your mother is the chairwoman and you're rich,

397
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,230
but you can't spend money like this.

398
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,720
Well, I...

399
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,360
I just want to be friends with you.

400
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:20,200
If you want to be friends, find a new way.

401
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,550
Here.

402
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,690
Return it.

403
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,240
Try this one more time.

404
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,630
I'll scold you. Seriously.

405
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,550
Damn.

406
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,790
So what do I do?

407
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:47,560
To get on the Student Council?

408
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,850
Qualification to join the Student Council?

409
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:53,750
I was told to ask the advisor.

410
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,060
Why the Student Council all of a sudden?

411
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:03,000
I've been struggling with questions these days.

412
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,010
What can I do for the school?

413
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:10,810
How can I show my love and passion for the school?

414
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:13,000
- You think that's the Student Council? 
 - Correct.

415
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,910
You are a smooth talker.

416
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:17,240
- Wait a second. 
 - Okay.

417
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,950
   

418
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:26,200
Here it is.

419
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,800
Students who wish to run for Student Council must meet the following criteria.

420
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,040
1.

421
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,320
Be within the top 10 on the most recent test.

422
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,290
2.

423
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:42,350
Receive at least 100 signatures from those who recommend them.

424
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,540
And lastly.

425
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:49,320
The final say in choosing Student Council members is with the Council President that year.

426
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,120
That's it.

427
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,670
- All of them? 
 - Yes.

428
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,000
All of them.

429
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:10,220
   

430
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,630
I hope you can join the Student Council.

431
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,150
Fighting!

432
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,020
Thank you!

433
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:21,360
How will you get 99 more signatures?

434
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,990
Somehow.

435
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,440
I'll get them.

436
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,350
Do you have any friends?

437
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:32,610
Are you asking me?

438
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,650
I'm sorry.

439
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,800
I happen to specialize in signatures.

440
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,350
Hey.

441
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,540
Where do I sign? Here?

442
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,980
Why are you pretending to be friends?

443
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,320
- Let's see. 
 - Hey.

444
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,710
Since when are you friends with them?

445
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,340
Don't ask questions.

446
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,710
A lot happened.

447
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,840
 Dong Min, 

448
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,720
 I'm sorry about everything that happened. 

449
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,640
 Take your anger out on us. 

450
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,400
 Guys, don't do this. I'm okay. 

451
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,060
 This is not okay. 

452
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,980
 We deserve to die. 

453
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,070
 So sorry. 

454
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:30,710
 We deserve to be beaten. 

455
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,200
 - Hit us! 
 - Go! 

456
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:38,540
 I'll hit you just once then. 

457
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,590
 Wait a second... wait... Okay, hit now. 

458
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,940
It's okay.

459
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,070
My butthole is not doing so hot, but I'm wearing a diaper.

460
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:05,170
When are you going to fill this?

461
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,260
We'll help you.

462
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,330
We're friends!

463
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:13,460
I don't want friends like you...

464
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,010
Guys.

465
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:18,320
- Hey, this... 
 - Hey, friends. Sign this.

466
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,190
Nope.

467
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,090
- Hey, guys. Sign this. 
 - What is this?

468
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,390
It won't take long. Hey...

469
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:27,000
We used to play soccer together...

470
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,680
They won't be much help, will they?

471
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,240
 Please, a signature. 

472
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,130
- Just one signature. 
 - It won't take long.

473
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,120
For Hae Seong. Guys.

474
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,270
 He thinks he's good-looking. 

475
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:57,760
This is what I think, Hae Seong.

476
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,010
We had good intentions, and that's what matters.

477
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:03,780
I agree with that.

478
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,110
Is this a presidential election or something?

479
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,360
Why is it so intense?

480
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,620
Gosh, the popular vote is all about the face card.

481
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,080
He'll have no problems.

482
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,140
Let's first look at the list of recommenders.

483
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,400
How many signatures did you get?

484
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,510
   

485
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:41,670
The face card is not everything.

486
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:44,730
Hey, this represents your peer relationships.

487
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:47,630
There are 20 students in your class alone.

488
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:50,480
I tend to get shy sometimes.

489
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,470
I'll start getting signatures tomorrow.

490
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,110
What about the midterms?

491
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:59,330
You'll be in the top 10 in the school, right?

492
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:03,270
It's a high school midterm. It's a piece of cake.

493
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:05,100
I'm a special recruit to National Intelligence.

494
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,230
   

495
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,260
   

496
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,100
Good luck.

497
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,270
You got a subset of the math problems right.

498
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,940
This is a problem of willpower.

499
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:31,030
We're in trouble.

500
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:33,040
This makes no sense.

501
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,490
This is because they updated the curriculum.

502
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:37,430
How many days until the midterms?

503
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,430
   

504
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,850
Jeong Hae Seong, come to and look at me.

505
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:45,350
We'll somehow round up the signatures.

506
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,870
You focus on...

507
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:49,820
Focus on the midterms. Got it?

508
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,800
No, this makes no sense. I'm a special recruit...

509
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,740
Got it. Please!

510
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:57,870
You're a natural brain so it won't be too hard.

511
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,530
Focus.

512
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,010
Okay?

513
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,840
Got it.

514
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,310
Okay...

515
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,400
Seriously...

516
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,680
This is it...

517
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,790
Here it is. 
    

518
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:25,380
I have no idea why I'm like this.

519
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,050
He's working hard.

520
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,470
- This, please. 
 - Yes.

521
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,770
Here.

522
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,970
All ready, right?

523
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,800
Let's start.

524
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:14,770
   

525
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,170
 Run! 

526
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,100
Hurry, take one. 
    

527
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,940
- Hurry! 
 - What is this?

528
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:31,070
 Everyone, vote for Jeong Hae Seong and get a free sandwich! 

529
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:34,490
Jeong Hae Seong to Student Council!

530
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,300
â™«  Pride of Byeongmun  â™«

531
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,270
â™«  Hae Seong of Byeongmun  â™«

532
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:41,960
â™«  Hae Seong will be there for the students  â™«

533
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,850
â™«  The people's worker  â™«

534
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,750
â™«  The defender of justice  â™«

535
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:49,470
â™«  Our Student Council rep Hae Seong  â™«

536
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,310
â™«  Byeongmun's hero  â™«

537
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:53,250
â™«  Byeongmun's hope  â™«

538
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:56,890
â™«  A man born to serve Byeongmun  â™«

539
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,780
â™«  Our Jeong Hae Seong  â™«

540
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,420
â™«  Byeongmun's Jeong Hae Seong  â™«

541
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,030
â™«  Jeong Hae Seong for Student Council  â™«

542
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,390
So embarrassing...

543
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,780
- Hey. 
 - What? What, what?

544
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,350
Come here.

545
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,850
â™«  Byeongmun's hero  â™«

546
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:15,620

547
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:20,360
â™«  Sign for Hae Seong for Student Council  â™«

548
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:24,420
â™«  Send Jeong Hae Seong to Student Council  â™«

549
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,850
 Jeong Hae Seong! 

550
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:33,270
â™«  Hae Seong to Student Council!  â™«

551
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,330
â™«  Yeah, yeah  â™«

552
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:40,760
â™«  Jeong Hae Seong to Student Council  â™«

553
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,900
â™«  Yeah, yeah  â™«

554
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,280
â™«  Jeong Hae Seong to Student Council  â™«

555
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,420
Everyone, a big applause for Hae Seong!

556
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:55,180
 Jeong Hae Seong! 

557
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,760
 Jeong Hae Seong! Jeong Hae Seong! 

558
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,770
Hae Seong's getting it!

559
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,370
Did you see the sandwich shop earlier?

560
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:05,450
It was hilarious.

561
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:07,110
Isn't that cheating?

562
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,530
Buying signatures with money.

563
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,440
You bought signatures, too, Seung Jae.

564
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,600
I'm different from him.

565
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,380
Little Seung Jae, worried Hae Seong will join us?

566
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,390
I'll make sure you don't debut.

567
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:20,250
Go ahead, try.

568
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,990
Even if Jeong Hae Seong submits an official application,

569
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,420
I'm against it.

570
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,160
And the reason?

571
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:31,600
Jeong Hae Seong ousted Tae Su.

572
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:36,150
He might be a hero to some, but he's like a traitor to us.

573
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:38,140
It's not right to bring him in.

574
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,110
Why? It'll be fun if he joins us.

575
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,290
You.

576
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,030
Yu Jeong, how about you?

577
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,840
What do you think?

578
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,330
Me?

579
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,860
Well...

580
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:55,350
I don't love the idea of him joining.

581
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:59,500
He only recently transferred here, and we don't know him well.

582
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:03,300
I feel like he needs more time.

583
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,560
I'm surprised.

584
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,910
I thought you'd say yes.

585
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,990
- The Yu Jeong I know. 
 - Wait...

586
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,050
I must've been mistaken.

587
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:14,400
So? He got all the signatures?

588
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,920
- I think he did. 
 - I said be quiet.

589
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,360
Why?

590
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,580
   

591
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:25,380
What about the midterms?

592
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,520
I'm preparing for it.

593
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,640
I almost died making 100 sandwiches

594
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,490
and the theme song. It was exhausting.

595
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:34,140
It's your turn now.

596
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,640
You better rank in the top 10.

597
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,770
I'll do my best.

598
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:40,350
Good luck.

599
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,490
I'm leaving.

600
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:43,780
Hey, hey. Let's go.

601
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,080
Hey!

602
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,940
Careful!

603
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,540
Gosh, get up!

604
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,070
Get up!

605
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,440
I'm getting up...

606
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:56,540
Gosh, let's go.

607
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,880
What's with him?

608
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:08,580
   

609
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,940
Why are you so serious?

610
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,320
Don't do that. It doesn't suit you.

611
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,770
Are you joining the Student Council?

612
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:27,840
Stop that. I'm your brother. So impolite...

613
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,750
Don't join it.

614
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:33,780
Rip up the recommenders list.

615
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,400
Don't even think about or look at the Student Council.

616
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,160
Don't you dare step your foot in.

617
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,760
- Yu Jeong, is something... 
 - I said don't you dare!

618
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:50,240
I don't want to be connected to you. I hate it! Why do you annoy me like this?

619
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:04,410
I made myself clear.

620
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:07,140
Do not join the Student Council.

621
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,790
If you join?

622
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:11,300
I will reveal your true identity.

623
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,170
You don't think I will?

624
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:16,680
Then, try me.

625
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,400
 Can we meet up later? 

626
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,560
 I'll stop by the house. 

627
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:41,360
Bye.

628
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,040
Rumors are flowing. The major event of the morning.

629
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,850
These are desperate times. I can't be choosy.

630
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:01,010
Don't you need to clock out?

631
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:03,330
I'm the night study hall monitor.

632
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:06,760
Working so hard.

633
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:15,000
I'm paying you back for the book.

634
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,330
I didn't poison it. Have some.

635
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:19,490
I like this.

636
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,330
What do you mean by the book?

637
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:26,320
Did you see me there?

638
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,580
You came into my view.

639
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:30,020
Why didn't you say hi?

640
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,260
You didn't, either.

641
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,380
Does it hurt to say hi first?

642
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:42,280
Crimson red eyes...

643
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:48,970
So there are two clocks connected to the...

644
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:51,360
second urban legend.

645
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,430
   

646
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:54,890
Which clock is the real one?

647
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:57,810
How has Jeong Hae Seong been since the committee meeting?

648
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:00,910
He applied to join the Student Council.

649
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:02,230
Our Student Council?

650
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:03,670
Yes.

651
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,410
I hope he gets it.

652
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:18,560
He's unpredictable, judging from the incident.

653
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,040
He might keep causing trouble. Watch him closely.

654
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,100
Understood.

655
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:29,590
Mom.

656
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:31,890
Ye Na.

657
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,640
You're here too, Principal.

658
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:37,210
It's late. I was worried about you.

659
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:39,590
You got worried?

660
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:43,800
I'm sorry. I had dinner with friends after the study session.

661
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:47,110
Take special care of Ye Na starting tomorrow.

662
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:48,740
What should I do about you?

663
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,520
Mom.

664
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,670
I'll be leaving.

665
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:54,680
Yes, thank you for staying so late.

666
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,670
Take care.

667
00:47:57,530 --> 00:47:59,110
You're leaving already?

668
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:01,030
You can stay longer if you want.

669
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:02,830
It's quite late.

670
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:05,570
See you at school tomorrow.

671
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:07,050
Well, then.

672
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,580
Yes.

673
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:21,250
I'm leaving, too.

674
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,050
Did you need to have that dinner?

675
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:32,160
The midterms are coming up. You should watch how you spend your time.

676
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,810
You sleep a lot these days.

677
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:36,450
What if you sleep an hour less?

678
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:39,000
Mom, I sleep four hours these days.

679
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,030
This is ADHD medication.

680
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:44,630
It's good for your focus.

681
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:48,020
Take one a day.

682
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:52,750
Ye Na.

683
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:09,620
My daughter.

684
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:17,130
You know how much I love you, right?

685
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:20,720
Everything I do, I do....

686
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:24,040
for you, Ye Na. You know that, right?

687
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:26,140
I know, Mom...

688
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:31,550
Ye Na, the world forgets about the person who comes in second.

689
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:35,940
Second place is merely first among the losers.

690
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:41,510
As for me, I would love for...

691
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:49,270
the world to remember you, Ye Na.

692
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:51,120
Yes, Mom.

693
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,860
I'll keep that in mind.

694
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,480
Ye Na.

695
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,690
Take it now.

696
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:56,900
- Mi Jeong. 
  - Sunbae. 

697
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,920
There's a problem.

698
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:10,490
What?

699
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:14,080
What? Repeat. What about Jeong Hae Seong?

700
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,450
So, Hae Seong...

701
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,100
You're not feeling well?

702
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:22,800
 Yes. I feel a little... 

703
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:27,090
I'm sick with a bad cold.

704
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:29,070
I'm sorry, Ms. Oh.

705
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:31,290
I really should be at school today...

706
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:34,240
Are you really sick?

707
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,450
Have you had medicine?

708
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:37,180
Yes, I have.

709
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:40,570
I'll feel better if I rest today.

710
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:43,800
Yes, see you tomorrow.

711
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:49,980
Sunbaenim!

712
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,060
Please hurry.

713
00:51:55,950 --> 00:52:01,370
   

714
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:06,820
Since this is a secret mission, there's been a disconnect with National Defense...

715
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,260
Hey!

716
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,610
   

717
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:45,800
- Hello? 
 - Oh, Hae Seong.

718
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,160
How are you feeling?

719
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:53,620
I still have a high fever.

720
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:56,260
Gosh, the fever's lasting a while.

721
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:59,270
I'm bringing you porridge and medicine, so sleep.

722
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:03,380
 The rooftop room in Chanseo Villa at the intersection, right? 

723
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,790
Pardon?

724
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:21,360
I'm glad it worked out for Hae Seong.

725
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:24,340
What if it was a three-day mobilization training?

726
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:25,910
Don't even say that.

727
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:28,440
I shudder at the thought.

728
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:31,860
- Are you done cleaning? 
 - Yes.

729
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,130
Let's call Hae Seong and grill up some meat.

730
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:41,010
Oh, Hae Seong. I was just about to call you.

731
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:43,600
Team Leader, the rooftop room written in my transcript.

732
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,680
Has it been set up?

733
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,500
Hey, did you set up the rooftop room?

734
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,020
- No. 
 - Why not?

735
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:51,350
I was planning to do it next week.

736
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:54,740
It's not set up yet. Why?

737
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:58,770
What?

738
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:01,180
I'm going crazy.

739
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:03,100
 Code Black. Code Black. 

740
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,860
Gosh, I hope it doesn't get cold.

741
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:52,660
You didn't bring anything?

742
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:54,560
Who'd believe I live in an empty studio?

743
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,170
How can we get furniture out of the blue?

744
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:57,950
This would ruin the mission.

745
00:54:57,950 --> 00:54:58,990
Is there a way?

746
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:00,680
I'd rather the mission be ruined.

747
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,440
Why didn't you set it up already?

748
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,650
We've had no days off!

749
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:06,780
Shut up! Stop it!

750
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:12,910
I know where to get furniture.

751
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:16,580
Okay.

752
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:18,270
Here.

753
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:24,770
Team Leader, are you saying we should borrow them?

754
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:27,560
Is there any other way?

755
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:30,040
If not, do what I say.

756
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:33,190
This is an order from your team leader.

757
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:37,260
Now, we will scour the neighborhood to secure

758
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:40,580
all items a student might need to live alone.

759
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,560
- Did you bring your uniform? 
 - It's at home.

760
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,060
Hey! You should have brought that!

761
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:46,290
I was busy and distracted! Keep going.

762
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:47,660
Fine.

763
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:50,550
Young Hun and Mi Jeong, uniforms, street clothes...

764
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:54,040
Get everything one might need for daily use.

765
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:57,940
We'll focus on the TV, laptop, and electronics.

766
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:00,460
How many minutes before Ms. Oh gets here?

767
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:01,490
Twenty.

768
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:03,170
Good. Set a timer.

769
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:04,900
Fifteen minutes from now.

770
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:07,030
Keep in mind, everyone.

771
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,560
We can't allow for any mistakes from now on.

772
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:12,410
We have 14 minutes and 55 seconds left.

773
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,700
Okay, move.

774
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,520
Who is it?

775
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:24,530
Excuse us.

776
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:26,240
   

777
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,430
   

778
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:30,390
What?

779
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:33,420
   

780
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,640
Excuse me.

781
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,570
Thank you!

782
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:49,010
We'll bring them right back.

783
00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:00,710
Okay! Hurry.

784
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,140
Hurry up!

785
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:24,200
What in the world!

786
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,690
Five minutes until target arrival. Hurry.

787
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:49,360
Got it.

788
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:52,510
Sunbae! Team Leader! You need to come outside.

789
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:54,730
Wh-Wh-What?

790
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:00,380
Wh-Wh-What?

791
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,220
- We're screwed. 
 - Screwed.

792
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:06,100
We're screwed.

793
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:30,230
Hae Seong!

794
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,530
You made it.

795
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:51,190
You haven't eaten, have you?

796
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:53,930
I made this. Porridge is good for the flu.

797
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:56,350
Thank you for the food.

798
00:58:57,470 --> 00:59:00,270
Are you okay? Why is your face so sweaty?

799
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:01,680
What?

800
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:04,980
I'm not feeling well.

801
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:26,830
Thank you for the food.

802
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:34,480
I'm sorry.

803
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:39,130
Can I use the bathroom?

804
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:40,530
What?

805
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:41,760
The bathroom.

806
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,670
- Let me clean it off you. 
 - No! The bathroom!

807
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:54,490
The bathroom...

808
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,710
Over there.

809
00:59:56,710 --> 00:59:58,330
Wait!

810
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,380
Go ahead.

811
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,290
How did you guys get in here?

812
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:26,620
Because we were in a rush.

813
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:27,880
What about Ms. Oh?

814
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,330
She's in the bathroom. Get out now!

815
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:31,640
 - Hae Seong!  
 - Yes?

816
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,080
Where do I put the towel?

817
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,220
My hand got stuck.

818
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:44,470
What are you doing there?

819
01:00:45,630 --> 01:00:49,440
I was organizing my clothes.

820
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,520
All your clothes are out here.

821
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,790
Right.

822
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:55,910
Your answers make no sense.

823
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:57,410
You must be really ill.

824
01:00:57,410 --> 01:01:00,930
- No. 
 - Get some rest. I'll take care of this.

825
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:02,760
Can I put them in here?

826
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,490
Ms. Oh!

827
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:21,830
Let me see you out.

828
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:23,980
I have to go to the doctor now.

829
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,460
At this hour?

830
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:29,300
Nighttime clinic.

831
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,510
No way.

832
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:48,700
Don't.

833
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,180
Don't.

834
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:57,780
Okay. I'll come with you.

835
01:02:29,170 --> 01:02:32,590
No. Don't do it! Don'tâ€“

836

â™«  Sunlight shining down into my heart  â™«

837
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:57,340
â™«  Like a flower blooming softly when you smile  â™«

838
01:02:57,340 --> 01:03:00,230
â™«  I finally found you  â™«

839
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:05,330
â™«  I assure you that my love can't be undone now  â™«

840
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:09,040
Can someone explain...

841
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:13,030
this situation?

842
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:19,930
â™«  I will come to you  â™«

843
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:24,390
   

844
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:29,120
â™«  Sometimes when I'm dreaming of the stars  â™«

845
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:35,470
â™«  I think of you too and I would dive into the sky  â™«

846
01:03:35,470 --> 01:03:38,430
â™«  With you, oh, yes, with you  â™«

847
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:43,690
â™«  I assure you that my love can't be undone now  â™«

848
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:46,410
â™«  Love you, oh, I love you  â™«

849
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:48,680
 I want to try taking the photo! 

850
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:50,170
 Can I touch it? 

851
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:51,930
 Hey, take a picture of me! 

852
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:54,430
 Wow, what is this? 

853
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:56,180
 So cool. 

854
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:59,780
 Si Hyeon, you're going to regret that later. 

855
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:02,530
 My mom says if you don't eat beans, you won't grow. 

856
01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:04,500
 I'm already taller than you, Bong Ja. 

857
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,920
 I mean later, you dummy! 

858
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:09,970
 Also, don't call me Bong Ja! 

859
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:13,760
 Why not? I think your name is pretty. 

860
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:20,010
â™«  Oh, I want to kiss you someday  â™«

861
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:22,200
 I'm on a diet. 

862
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:25,580
 I won't eat it anyway. You can have it. 

863
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,970
â™«  I'll come to you  â™«

864
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:31,260
 Hey, Oh Bong Ja! 

865
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:37,960
â™«  And my love is you  â™«

866
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:43,610
I wonder how he's doing.

867
01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:50,340
â™«  And my love is you  â™«

868

869
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:18,570
 He's not just strange. 

870
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:21,110
 He might not be a student at all. 

871
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:24,070
 Don't run into Ms. Oh Su Ah at school. 

872
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:25,350
 Why is she here? 

873
01:05:25,350 --> 01:05:26,990
 How can I avoid her? 

874
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:29,270
 The midterm results are out. 

875
01:05:29,270 --> 01:05:30,820
 How did you do? 

876
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:33,050
 It's the first time Ye Na has a crush on someone, right? 

877
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:34,220
 This is bothering me. 

878
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:37,160
 Maybe he should get kicked out. 

879
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:39,290
 Our mission details haven't leaked, right? 

880
01:05:39,290 --> 01:05:42,200
 Get all details and information of Byeongmun High School teachers and staff. Now! 

881
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,570
 Did you write the letter?
