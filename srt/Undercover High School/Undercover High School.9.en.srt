(Episode 9)

2
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,380
Who are you?

3
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,040
Who are you and why are you here?

4
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,870
Let go!

5
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,870
Let go of me!

6
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,270
Su A?

7
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,900
Hey.

8
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,469
Su A, come on. Wake up.

9
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,840
Su A...

10
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,380
Su A, wake up. Su A!

(Emergency Medical Center)

12
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,650
Doctor, over here!

13
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,460
Prep the OR and secure a bed in the ICU. Hurry.

14
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,600
Let's move her.

15
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,230
I'm afraid you must stay here.

16
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,700
(Restricted Area)

17
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,280
Don't worry too much.

18
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,650
My Su A...

19
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,820
is strong...

20
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,290
and will wake up soon.

21
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,530
That's also the Su A I know.

22
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,780
Hae Seong!

23
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,510
How's Ms. Oh?

24
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,919
Fortunately, it wasn't a fatal injury.

25
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,950
She hasn't woken up yet though.

26
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,449
Did you look into it?

27
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,919
The scene was processed.

28
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,989
The culprit must've been an amateur...

29
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,390
because he left his DNA all over your house.

30
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,790
- Tell me when the report comes in. - Sure.

31
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,160
Get some shut-eye somewhere.

32
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,660
You look exhausted.

33
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,600
Forget it. As if I can sleep right now.

34
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,270
Hey. How's Ms. Oh?

35
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,970
Is she all right?

36
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,240
Yes, the surgery went well.

37
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,109
I'll get some air.

38
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,980
You should go see Su A. She's in Room 503.

39
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,280
See you later.

40
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,620
(Yoonbit Hospital)

41
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,580
Are you okay?

42
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,650
We'll stay behind,

43
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,220
so go home and get some rest.

44
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,689
I'm fine.

45
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,720
It shows that you haven't had any sleep.

46
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,800
- Don't be like that and... - I said I was fine!

47
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,140
Sir.

48
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,820
It's nothing.

49
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,690
Don't mind me and head back inside.

50
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,200
Sure.

51
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,300
I'll see you later.

52
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,990
Hae Seong must be running late.

53
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,130
Skipping classes and being late. He's sort of a slacker, isn't he?

54
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,899
Although, that's what makes him hot.

55
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,029
Hi, guys. It's time for roll call.

56
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,430
Ms. Kim, where's Ms. Oh?

57
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,730
Ms. Oh?

58
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,840
A personal matter came up for her.

59
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,269
That's why I'm here as your temporary homeroom teacher.

60
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,770
What personal matter?

61
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,679
Will she be gone for long?

62
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,279
You brats.

63
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,810
If only you had always been this interested in your teacher.

64
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,610
I'll check attendance.

65
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,590
How are you feeling?

66
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,620
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

67
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,260
Ms. Oh also came down with something.

68
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,730
They're not kidding about the flu going around.

69
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,930
Anyway, take care of yourself...

70
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,099
and don't forget to submit a doctor's note...

71
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,570
so that your absence can be excused.

72
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,800
Sure.

73
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,200
I'm sorry.

74
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,270
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

75
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,840
What? Ms. Oh's in the hospital?

76
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,770
She was brought to my dad's hospital last night...

77
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,179
and was admitted.

78
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,410
Why was she brought in? Is she that sick?

79
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,580
I can't have access to that kind of personal information.

80
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,420
Do you know what's even more crazy though?

81
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:00,290
It was Hae Seong who brought Ms. Oh to the hospital.

82
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,189
My gosh.

83
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,160
Is Ms. Oh the reason Hae Seong skipped school?

84
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,690
It's highly possible.

85
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,630
Come to think of it,

86
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,729
they've been joined at the hip lately.

87
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,000
This is between a teacher and a student.

88
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,300
Let's not create any sick rumours and watch our mouths.

89
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,370
I'm with Ye Na on this.

90
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,109
We don't know...

91
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,980
why those two were at the hospital.

92
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,180
What if what you said led to weird rumours?

93
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,020
- Sorry. - Sorry.

94
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,590
Can you believe them?

95
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,729
Aren't people allowed to go to the hospital together?

96
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:43,800
It's no big deal.

97
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,930
Also, being there together...

98
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,700
could be just a big coincidence. Right?

99
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,340
Right, of course. That's possible.

100
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,010
Don't be like that.

101
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,510
What?

102
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,110
You're saying all that to spare my feelings.

103
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,580
There's no need for that.

104
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,380
Right. Was I saying that for your sake?

105
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,320
Weren't you?

106
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:05,950
I was.

107
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,330
Do you still have feelings for Hae Seong?

108
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,400
I had a crush on him, but I'm going to move on.

109
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,230
He doesn't seem interested in me.

110
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,330
Right. I'm glad to hear that.

111
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,399
What are you doing after school?

112
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,440
Do you want to catch a movie?

113
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,170
I'd love to, but I should get home.

114
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,480
The math competition is coming up.

115
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,950
The math competition?

116
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,780
Yes.

117
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,280
You're competing too, aren't you?

118
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,949
Yes.

119
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,190
I studied really hard this time around.

120
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,260
You'll have to do your best if you want to beat me.

121
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,340
If you're that sorry,

122
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,050
be good to me.

123
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:13,690
Are you okay?

124
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,000
I was worried.

125
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,000
What a relief.

126
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,850
What?

127
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:41,779
It was Lee Jun Ho, a teacher at the school,

128
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,280
who executed the exam scandal.

129
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,480
Lee Jun Ho?

130
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,690
Mr. Lee was the proctor during the tests...

131
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,460
of all those competitions.

132
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,790
Don't think about this for now.

133
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,390
I'll take it from here.

134
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,700
You only just woke up and shouldn't be...

135
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,270
- Yeong Hun. - Hey, Hae Seong.

136
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,540
I have the DNA analysis report from the break-in.

137
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,100
But...

138
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,969
it's odd though.

139
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,710
The one at your house...

140
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,580
was Lee Jun Ho.

141
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,280
- Lee Jun Ho was at my house? - Yes.

142
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,280
Lee Jun Ho, the math teacher at Byeongmun High School.

143
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,020
Why did he...

144
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,960
break into your house?

145
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,320
Monitor him closely for now.

146
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,589
Sure. What about Agent An?

147
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,590
Don't tell him.

148
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,130
I'll inform him myself.

149
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,060
He used a knife I had at home.

150
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
Not bringing a weapon...

151
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,370
implies that...

152
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,740
hurting me or Su A wasn't part of his original plan.

153
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,410
He was looking for something at my house.

154
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,780
If the file regarding the scandal wasn't his target,

155
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,820
what could Lee Jun Ho have been after?

156
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,360
Who'd want to take the notebook from me?

157
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,730
Seo Myeong Ju.

158
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:18,040
Goodness. You did well.

159
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:23,410
However, I heard there was an incident last night.

160
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,750
How will you remedy this situation?

161
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,350
Please keep your word.

162
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,920
If I do what you asked,

163
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,330
you said you'd keep my name out of the school cheating scandal.

164
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,860
Also, you promised...

165
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,800
you wouldn't order me to fix the exams again.

166
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:49,040
You're bringing up a promise after stabbing someone with a knife?

167
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,639
I didn't know you were a psychopath, Mr. Lee.

168
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,570
I won't ask about the notebook...

169
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,580
or Jeong Hae Seong's identity.

170
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:57,880
However,

171
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,950
I trust that you'll protect me.

172
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,220
Why should I?

173
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,960
Because my arrest would only put you in a predicament.

174
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,960
So that's how it works.

175
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,600
Sure. Your job is done, Mr. Lee.

176
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,040
You may go. Don't you have classes to prepare for?

177
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,910
I'll trust you to protect me, then.

178
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,610
Mr. Lee.

179
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,690
I appreciate your service.

00:16:10,821 --> 00:16:12,020
"The fourth ghost story."

186
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,890
"No one seems to know..."

187
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,360
"what it is."

188
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,589
Anyway, Ms. Seo,

189
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,090
has the school gym gone under renovation before?

190
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,230
What he's saying...

191
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,470
is that only he has the answer.

192
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,250
Mr. Lee took your notebook?

193
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,950
That's probably what he was after.

194
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,890
You were only collateral.

195
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,990
Ms. Seo must be pulling the strings.

196
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,460
We'll have to arrest Lee Jun Ho and make him testify...

197
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,230
to end Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju,

198
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,530
who deceived the students and played me.

199
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,910
Do whatever it takes to figure out the fourth ghost story.

200
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,739
Considering our situation,

201
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,680
it's too dangerous to keep Jeong Hae Seong...

202
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,920
at this school.

203
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,920
I understand.

204
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,190
What is it, Ye Na?

205
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,440
The upcoming math competition.

206
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,070
Did you plan for me...

207
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,310
to come in first place?

208
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,510
So what if you are?

209
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,580
That's what you wanted to talk about?

210
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,990
I want to compete fairly this time.

211
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,320
I'll come out on top on my own.

212
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:58,890
I give you my word.

213
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,490
So please Mom, I...

214
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,660
You frustrating brat.

215
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,800
Why do you keep standing...

216
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,310
on the edge of the cliff...

217
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,380
when there's a safer road?

218
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,280
Because I don't want to be ashamed.

219
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,490
As your daughter,

220
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,460
I want to hold my head up high.

221
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,460
Please allow this, Mom.

222
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,250
Ma'am, perhaps...

223
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,720
this time around,

224
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,720
you should give in to Ye Na's request.

225
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,719
I believe this is the first time...

226
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,230
she has asked anything from you.

227
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,700
It wouldn't have been easy for her to come to you like this.

228
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:14,230
I'm aware that, like your late father,

229
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,700
you also...

230
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,510
have high expectations for your child.

231
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,250
Don't bring my father up.

232
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,550
That was unwise of me.

233
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,150
Have Ye Na come out on top as previously arranged.

234
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,220
And find someone to take Lee Jun Ho's place.

235
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,890
Yes, ma'am.

236
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,280
What's your take on it?

237
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:00,780
About what?

238
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,080
Senior Agent An and Hae Seong.

239
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,750
Aren't things chilly between them?

240
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,990
They must still be getting over a quarrel.

241
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,690
It seems more serious than that.

242
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,560
Did something happen between them?

243
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,930
Hey, get to work. Over there.

244
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,070
Darn.

245
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,340
He's the school principal, right?

246
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,210
Chairwoman Seo's lackey.

247
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,550
It's me, Hae Seong.

248
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,050
Park Jae Mun's here to see Lee Jun Ho.

249
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,850
He's moving faster than I anticipated.

250
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,350
What are they up to?

251
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,250
Hey, they're getting in.

252
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,890
They're going for a drive in Park Jae Mun's car.

253
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,489
Lee Jun Ho must be arrested alive.

254
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,030
- Tail them. - Got it.

255
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,259
(Insider: Go Yeong Hun, Park Mi Jeong, Gong Jin Sang,)

256
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,500
(Kim Hyung Bae, An Seok Ho)

257
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,910
May I ask where we're going?

258
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,430
Why are we here of all places?

259
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,170
Over there.

260
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,610
Drag him out.

261
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,260
Put him in the car and crush him.

262
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:11,610
Am I right to assume that this is murder in the works?

263
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,180
Hae Seong won't be here in time.

264
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,010
We'll stop them ourselves.

265
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,250
How?

266
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,249
We're way outnumbered!

267
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,690
Should we do nothing, then?

268
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,860
I'm sure you remember our combat training.

269
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,500
I'll get going.

270
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,780
I'm sorry, Mi Jeong,

271
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,880
for being an embarrassment to you.

272
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,350
We'll go together.

273
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:00,960
Sure.

274
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,880
Get over here!

275
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,510
I said we couldn't do this ourselves!

276
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,620
Watch your tone.

277
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,590
- Help! - Help!

278
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,659
- Help. - Help.

279
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,690
- Help! - Help.

280
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,429
- Mr. Lee! - Mr. Lee, no.

281
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,000
Are you okay?

282
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:42,939
- Are you good? - What now?

283
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,169
What do we do?

284
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,909
You, Park Jae Mun!

285
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,810
You'll regret this.

286
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,180
This is murder!

287
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,680
Our people won't let you get away with this.

288
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,649
- Oh, no. - No, don't.

289
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:00,049
- Stop. - Stop it.

290
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,320
Wait!

291
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,489
- No! - Oh, no.

292
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,659
- No! - Shoot!

293
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,759
- No! - No...

294
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,030
- This can't be. - No!

295
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:14,800
No...

296
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,069
- Hae Seong! - Hae Seong!

297
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,540
Is this in the job description for school principals these days?

298
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,440
Talk about having it extreme.

299
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:53,840
We meet again, right?

300
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,540
This time, no running away.

301
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:59,210
I didn't want any extra work,

302
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,380
but deal with him.

303
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,999
- What? He pressed the button. - He pressed the button.

304
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,169
Darn. What now?

305
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:22,100
What do we do?

306
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,000
Don't worry, Mi Jeong.

307
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,140
I'll protect you...

308
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,579
no matter what.

309
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,610
- Yeong Hun. - Mi Jeong.

310
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,580
Yeong Hun...

311
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,969
I'm scared!

312
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,580
You jerk!

313
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,510
Is this your way of protecting me?

314
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:08,810
- Hey, Lee Jun Ho. Wake up. - I'm scared.

315
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,650
This is all your fault!

316
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,880
Get up.

317
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,019
Get up!

318
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,189
We're in this mess because of you.

319
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,919
- Hae Seong! - Open your eyes, darn it!

320
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,190
- Wake up! - Don't cry!

321
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:56,060
Lie down flat.

322
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,229
Lie down.

323
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,300
Darn.

324
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,409
Save us, the merciful Buddha.

325
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,739
- Please allow us to live. - Please, no.

326
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,780
Save us, the merciful Buddha!

327
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,130
Please have mercy on us.

328
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,989
Please allow us to live!

329
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,060
Please...

330
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:36,500
Please have mercy on us. Please!

331
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,350
We're alive.

332
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,920
Hae Seong...

333
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,869
The phone is turned off.

334
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:47,339
Please leave a message after the tone.

335
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,770
Extra charges may apply.

336
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,140
Why did you do that?

337
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,680
As for what you did to me, I guess you could call it a mistake.

338
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:29,450
But what you've been doing at school is not a mistake.

339
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,490
How did you know?

340
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,989
Seo Myeong Ju made me do all of it. I had no choice.

341
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,590
What about the kids you've wronged?

342
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:45,799
The kids who always said hello to you with smiles on their faces.

343
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,700
Did you not feel an ounce of guilt when you saw them?

344
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,970
You still have a chance to make up for what you've done.

345
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,640
Don't let the chance slip by.

346
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,330
- Hey, Yeong Hun. - Hae Seong.

347
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:20,330
We've handed the principal over to the police.

348
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,500
What do you plan to do with Lee Jun Ho, the teacher?

349
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,570
I'll hand him over myself.

350
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:27,310
And I'll update Senior Agent An on it myself.

351
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,940
All right, then.

352
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,420
Stay here until tomorrow.

353
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,220
Do not even think about coming out.

354
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,190
Hand over your phone.

355
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,330
Why are you taking my phone?

356
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,370
Seo Myeong Ju and her people might track you down.

357
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:55,030
Get out.

358
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,140
Let me ask you a question before I go.

359
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,110
Who are you, really?

360
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,610
Just a high school student.

361
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,380
Hey, Hae Seong.

362
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,180
About Seo Myeong Ju's involvement in the scandal.

363
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,450
I think we can prove it.

364
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,119
How?

365
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,490
The accomplice in the scandal.

366
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,550
Turns out, it was the guy who stabbed Su A.

367
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,320
Teacher Lee Jun Ho at Byeongmun High.

368
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,260
I'm keeping him at the safe house for now.

369
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,730
Lee Jun Ho is at the safe house?

370
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:56,900
Just until 7am tomorrow.

371
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,630
If the police question him tomorrow,

372
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,930
Seo Myeong Ju will also have to go in for questioning.

373
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,200
She will, right?

374
00:32:03,201 --> 00:32:04,769
If the grade rigging becomes known to the public,

375
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:05,999
all the VIP parents...

376
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,610
will withdraw their support from Seo Myeong Ju's projects.

377
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,840
Then Seo Myeong Ju and Edu-City are finished.

378
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,080
- Uncle. - Yes.

379
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,020
I'll just...

380
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,920
go home and get some rest now.

381
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,970
(Wednesday, November 19, 10:20pm)

382
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,700
(Missing Person)

383
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,720
(Missing Person, Jeong Jae Hyeon, Male, Age 38)

384
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,660
You little rascal. I found you, at last.

385
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,220
Hold this.

386
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:33,790
Hey.

387
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,230
Who said you could leave without a word?

388
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,330
Auntie and I have been looking for you all day.

389
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,969
(Missing Person)

390
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:42,970
There, it's done.

391
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,840
You must be hungry.

392
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,310
Let's go and eat something.

393
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,810
(Missing Person, Jeong Jae Hyeon, Male, Age 38)

394
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,390
Here, eat up.

395
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,090
Hey, there's no poison in this. Watch.

396
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,460
It's good.

397
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:15,700
It's okay. Eat.

398
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:17,669
Thank you.

399
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,740
Sure.

400
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,540
Hey, Si Hyun.

401
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:26,280
Do you hate our home that much?

402
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,280
You keep disappearing without a word.

403
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,350
Your place isn't my home.

404
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,160
Don't look for me anymore.

405
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,560
I'm an orphan,

406
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,360
so I should take care of everything on my own.

407
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

408
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,600
Why are you saying you're an orphan?

409
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,340
Because I don't have a mom or dad.

410
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,610
My mom passed away,

411
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:56,910
and my dad...

412
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,240
My dad...

413
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,290
I know your dad will come back.

414
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:09,920
Until then,

415
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,990
let me...

416
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,530
be your dad, Si Hyun.

417
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,960
Don't cry.

418
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:20,800
Don't cry.

419
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:22,970
It's okay.

420
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,670
Don't cry.

421
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,610
It's all right.

422
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:29,910
Stop crying.

423
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,310
(Thursday, November 11, 7:15am)

424
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,600
Hey, Hae Seong.

425
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,469
Where are you?

426
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,130
I'm on my way to the office. Why?

427
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:31,870
Hello?

428
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,670
Hello? Hae Seong.

429
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:36,880
Uncle.

430
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,810
I owe you an apology.

431
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,049
Uncle, the truth is...

432
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:48,120
Hey, I know.

433
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,920
I've known you for more than 20 years.

434
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,920
Of course, I know you well enough.

435
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,630
I'm sorry.

436
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,230
Let's have some grilled eel and soju later.

437
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,400
It's on you, obviously.

438
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,940
Hey, I'm busy now.

439
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,770
You should hang up and get ready for school too.

440
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,310
- Are you skipping school today? - No, I'll see you later.

441
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,880
Okay, have a good day.

442
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:44,280
Ms. Oh!

443
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,610
You're here.

444
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,720
My gosh.

445
00:37:50,721 --> 00:37:53,350
Your face was already tiny, but it looks even smaller now.

446
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,220
Are you okay now?

447
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,220
It still hurts a little, but I'm okay.

448
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,430
Oh, right. Mr. Lee Jun Ho.

449
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:04,099
While you were away,

450
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,300
he was really worried about you.

451
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,440
- Your call cannot be connected... - That's odd. He's not answering.

452
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,240
(Mathematics, Lee Jun Ho)

453
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,920
You said I could come and visit anytime.

454
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,500
But you still need to make an appointment...

455
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,930
if you have good manners.

456
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,610
We both know what's going on, so I don't need to hide it from you.

457
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:50,210
Let me just ask you one thing.

458
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,940
So, you know a lot about me.

459
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,850
You see, I know a lot about you too.

460
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,150
I know who at the NIS is in league with you,

461
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,549
what you want to do once you find Emperor Gojong's gold bars,

462
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,090
and what you're trying to achieve.

463
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:03,760
I know all about it.

464
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,630
But here's something I don't know.

465
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,930
Why me?

466
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,170
Why did you want me on this operation?

467
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,910
What really happened to my father?

468
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,780
Why would you...

469
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:26,310
ask me that?

470
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,150
Right, I didn't think you'd answer anyway.

471
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,350
Let's get down to business.

472
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:37,059
Byeongmun High School is the most prestigious high school...

473
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,160
in the country.

474
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,089
Earlier today, one of the school's faculty members...

475
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,989
turned himself in, saying he wanted to reveal...

476
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,299
the truth behind the school grades scandal.

477
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,659
- He's here. - Oh, that's Lee Jun Ho.

478
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,030
- Lee Jun Ho is here. - Isn't that Lee Jun Ho?

479
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:47,999
(Byeongmun High School Teacher Turns Himself In)

480
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,739
You said you'd reveal the truth behind the scandal. Is it true?

481
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,769
I will tell the police everything I know.

482
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:54,369
Some say Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju...

483
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,039
threatened to kill you to silence you.

484
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,809
I'll explain that during the questioning too.

485
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,279
- Please tell us! - Just tell us now!

486
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,579
- Just a comment, please! - What else did she do?

487
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,480
- Were the parents... - Please tell us!

488
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,480
So, how do you feel?

489
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:07,890
That was boring.

490
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,890
And you're too...

491
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,460
amateurish.

492
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,629
Did you think I'd panic over a mere teacher's confession...

493
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,900
- as if it's a big deal... - No, of course not.

494
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,240
Lee Jun Ho gave me this evidence.

495
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,670
Here.

496
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:31,679
What is this?

497
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,280
This shows that the grade rigging was entirely orchestrated by you.

498
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,550
On top of that, you instigated an attempted murder.

499
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,889
Once they reinvestigate Kim Hyeon Ho's case,

500
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:44,890
you'll be convicted of that too.

501
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,430
Congratulations.

502
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:48,930
You're going to jail for at least ten years.

503
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,970
That seems like an urgent call. Answer it.

504
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:58,070
The police will be here soon, so prepare yourself mentally too.

505
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,540
Oh, one more thing.

506
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,049
When you have a guest visiting you,

507
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,780
you need to offer a cup of tea, at least.

508
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:10,920
That's called good manners.

509
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,430
(Seung Jae's father)

510
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:28,930
What was that?

511
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:32,200
- What was that? - Hey, hurry up and go on in.

512
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,419
Hey, guys! This is huge!

513
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,579
- The school is in deep trouble. - The confession of a teacher...

514
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,950
at Byeongmun High School is causing quite a stir.

515
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,420
According to Mr. Lee's confession, the school...

516
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,989
manipulated student records,

517
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:53,689
which will affect the students' college admission results,

518
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:55,429
- Yes, we're looking into it too. - and had the winners...

519
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,430
of various competitions predetermined,

520
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:58,400
which always included a specific group of students.

521
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,200
In other words, every section of the student records was manipulated.

522
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:04,499
The so-called VIP students and their parents were the ones...

523
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,000
who benefited from this and received the perks.

524
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:09,710
Mr. Lee also confessed that he partook in the grade rigging too.

525
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,510
Dad, you said there would be no problems.

526
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:17,380
You want me to study abroad? What?

527
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,190
How can I study abroad when I can't even speak English?

528
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:21,750
You said you'd take care of...

529
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,160
You said nothing would happen.

530
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,020
Darn it!

531
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,289
(Police)

532
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:30,500
- Just a comment, please. - Mr. Park.

533
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,360
- Do you admit everything? - Move aside, please!

534
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,369
What is even more shocking is that...

535
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:36,469
Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju tried to murder Mr. Lee,

536
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,670
according to Mr. Lee's statement.

537
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,369
Due to Mr. Lee's confession about the school grades scandal...

538
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:42,310
and Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju's alleged incitement to murder,

539
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,239
it is now unclear whether or not...

540
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,280
Byeongmun Foundation can move ahead with its Edu-City Project.

541
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:49,809
As controversy is growing, all eyes are on how the school...

542
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:51,350
will respond to the allegations.

543
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,450
Reporter Ju Gi Jin, MBS.

544
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:11,740
Su A.

545
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:14,210
Yes?

546
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:16,110
You saved this school.

547
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:21,450
This place would've never changed if it weren't for you.

548
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:26,320
Thank you, teacher.

549
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:29,550
Thank you.

550
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,129
(Edu-City in Crisis, Investors Backing Out)

551
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:14,200
The situation...

552
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,170
isn't looking so good, Chairwoman Seo.

553
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:20,870
All the projects connected to Edu-City have been scrapped.

554
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:24,210
It seems that your students' parents have washed their hands of it too.

555
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:25,940
Also, your position...

556
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,120
Do you have a solution to get the situation sorted out?

557
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,430
I guess you don't.

558
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:44,760
And you have no means to keep your promise.

559
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,000
Then there isn't anything I can do.

560
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,640
You see, I know this lawyer who's very good.

561
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,770
They can write a good apology letter for you.

562
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:58,910
If you're interested,

563
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,810
give them a call.

564
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:37,920
What do you think a mad woman is capable of doing...

565
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,620
when she has lost everything?

566
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,320
You've got some nerve, pulling this on me.

567
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,500
Here. About Seo Myeong Ju, well done.

568
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:02,140
By the way, in the morning,

569
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,940
you said you were sorry. What was that about?

570
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:07,810
What?

571
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:09,679
You said you knew.

572
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,519
Well, I only said that because...

573
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,020
I felt like I had to pretend to know what you were talking about.

574
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:17,560
Hey, come on.

575
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,990
It's fine, so just tell me honestly.

576
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,100
I bet you got yourself into trouble again at school.

577
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:29,530
This really is nuts.

578
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:35,570
I...

579
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:38,140
I...

580
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,010
I suspected you, to be honest.

581
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,350
You suspected me?

582
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:49,090
Why? Of what?

583
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,020
In Chairwoman Seo's office, I found information about me...

584
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:54,490
as an NIS agent and about our covert operation as well.

585
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:57,600
So, I thought you might be the spy...

586
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,960
working with Seo Myeong Ju.

587
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,240
I was wondering why you were so snappy with me.

588
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:07,210
That was why. Goodness.

589
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:11,240
But why didn't you ask me anything?

590
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:15,850
Because we're family.

591
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,749
"Something must be weighing on his mind."

592
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:19,950
"I should give him some time."

593
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:24,020
I just trusted you and waited.

594
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,330
That's what family is for.

595
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:35,430
Enough about that.

596
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:37,840
Let's drink.

597
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:50,320
So, who's the spy? Have you figured it out?

598
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,620
There's only one suspect.

599
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,180
Is it Director Kim, perhaps?

600
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:56,950
How did you know?

601
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:08,430
The day your dad went missing 22 years ago.

602
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,100
He called me,

603
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,570
He said we should meet, that he had...

604
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:17,340
something to say about Director Kim.

605
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,310
I hesitated after the call.

606
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:28,720
Should I report it or not?

607
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:32,820
I didn't even know what mission your dad was on.

608
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:37,060
I showed up late and couldn't meet your dad.

609
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,400
That's...

610
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:43,940
how we got here.

611
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:52,910
Why have you been keeping this from me?

612
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:56,980
In case it was my fault.

613
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:01,290
I didn't trust your dad...

614
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,360
and I showed up late.

615
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:10,330
In case that's why your dad disappeared.

616
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:14,969
Because if you knew...

617
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:16,370
I'd resent you?

618
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,840
Uncle.

619
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,680
We've known each other for 20 years.

620
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:35,190
We go back too far to resent each other for that.

621
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,490
Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon's mission from 22 years ago.

622
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,460
I'll complete it.

623
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,040
I'll find everything.

624
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:54,940
The gold bars...

625
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,180
and my dad.

626
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:02,450
So don't cry.

627
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:06,180
When you cry,

628
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:09,620
you look so ugly.

629
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,130
I wasn't crying.

630
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:20,930
I forgot my wallet.

631
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:23,730
Foot the bill.

632
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,740
Are you kidding me?

633
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:27,510
I always foot the bill.

634
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,039
You get paid more than me.

635
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,610
Hey. My salary is wired to your aunt's account.

636
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,110
Pay for the drinks.

637
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:36,250
You should pay at least once.

638
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:38,680
Be consistent and pay for everything.

639
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,490
They're fighting again.

640
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:42,020
Goodness.

641
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:44,890
I told you to bury the hatchet, not start a new fight.

642
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,519
He wants me to pay for this.

643
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,029
You're in the wrong, sir.

644
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:50,130
Why are you like that when you're paid a lot?

645
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:53,429
Hae Seong. I forgot my wallet.

646
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:54,929
- Why you... - Sorry.

647
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:56,500
Can we have two glasses and chopsticks?

648
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:57,670
Yes.

649
00:50:58,070 --> 00:50:59,440
Did you cry?

650
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:01,339
- No. - Your eyes are puffy.

651
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:02,609
My eyes are always dry.

652
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:04,339
- What an excuse. - What?

653
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:06,780
- Why the ugly face? - Gosh.

654
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,980
"When the one with the bead..."

655
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:16,220
"faces the red sun, the gold will shine?"

656
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:18,860
What's this?

657
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:20,760
You don't know?

658
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:22,789
I don't know.

659
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:24,230
You have to know.

660
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,529
You said you liked scary stories.

661
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:28,470
What does that have to do with this...

662
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,230
that you'd get angry with me?

663
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:32,800
I'm leaving.

664
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,510
Okay, sorry. My bad.

665
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:40,340
Did you find out anything about the fourth story?

666
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,510
- No. - Darn you.

667
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,150
No. I do have something.

668
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:52,560
I know what happens to the person who finds out about the last story.

669
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:54,390
What happens to them?

670
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:58,030
It's nonsense, of course,

671
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:00,930
but the school's curse befalls...

672
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:03,370
the person who knows the last story.

673
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:06,040
Really?

674
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,810
Okay, then.

675
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:10,040
The vanishing effect.

676
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:16,580
They vanish without a trace all of a sudden.

677
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:22,890
As you're all aware,

678
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:26,020
something terrible happened at the school.

679
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,390
Everyone's calling to ask who the VIP parents are...

680
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:31,400
and who got special favours.

681
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,860
The school's in uproar.

682
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:37,800
I still can't believe Mr. Lee was corrupt.

683
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:39,369
- The police... - Me either.

684
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:40,839
will handle the case.

685
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:44,010
Keep control of your homeroom students so that...

686
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,839
they don't start a witch hunt...

687
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,450
or spread groundless rumours.

688
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:49,850
Oh, and tomorrow, the Office of Education...

689
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:52,380
will send a vice-commissioner.

690
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:53,920
You know what that means.

691
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,189
It means we need one of you to prepare...

692
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:58,720
for the visit and then show them around.

693
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:01,030
Who...

694
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:03,490
Come on, people.

695
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,360
This meeting will never end.

696
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,400
Just you wait and see. I won't do it this time.

697
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,870
Okay. Let's do it his way this time.

698
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,910
The person who doesn't want to do anything.

699
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,180
Last time, we had to stand to avoid the task, right?

700
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:19,340
Yes.

701
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:21,280
The person who doesn't want to do anything.

702
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:23,850
- Me! - Stay seated.

703
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:26,980
Ms. Oh. The job is yours.

704
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:29,320
The meeting's over.

705
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:31,790
- Well done. - Thanks.

706
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:39,160
You should wait until they finish talking.

707
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:42,830
We were to stand up last time.

708
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:45,200
I thought it would be the opposite.

709
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:47,270
(Intra-school Math Competition Postponed)

710
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:53,140
Hey, have you heard?

711
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,650
Han Seung Jae from Class Two.

712
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:56,450
He quit school to study abroad.

713
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:58,320
He was involved in the grade-rigging.

714
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:00,750
How could something like this happen?

715
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:03,989
And what's that about Seo Myeong Ju conspiring to murder?

716
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,019
I know, right?

717
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:07,630
Through all that, Ye Na still comes to school.

718
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:09,590
When her mom's in trouble.

719
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:12,900
I bet her grades were rigged too.

720
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,130
Think about it.

721
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,130
Would the chairman help everyone but her own kid?

722
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,140
No way.

723
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:23,310
What are you talking so gleefully about?

724
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:27,210
You weren't gossiping about someone, were you?

725
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,380
Why would we? Right, guys?

726
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,780
- No way. Never. - That's right.

727
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,949
Ho Jin would never do something so foolish.

728
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:37,020
Right?

729
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:01,150
It hurts if you scratch so hard.

730
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,760
It's tough, isn't it?

731
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:17,460
I'm fine.

732
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:22,370
I know what Mom did was wrong.

733
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:24,970
Even if I didn't know our grades were being rigged,

734
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:27,300
I'm the chairwoman's daughter.

735
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:31,740
I know I can't be free of my mom's crimes.

736
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:35,480
I get why the kids badmouth me.

737
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:37,520
I'm fine.

738
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,550
It's not hard at all.

739
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,150
I think...

740
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:44,960
it's okay to say it is.

741
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,490
It's okay to cry.

742
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:51,660
It's okay to suffer.

743
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,670
Why should you be responsible for what the adults did?

744
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,570
It's not your fault.

745
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:00,910
It's okay, Ye Na.

746
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:14,790
Do you want a lollipop?

747
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:20,420
Where did you get these?

748
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:22,990
It's my emergency stash.

749
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:26,200
When you feel down, sugar is the best.

750
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,600
Here.

751
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:35,740
Shall I peel it for you?

752
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:37,370
No.

753
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:48,350
- You didn't jump. - I saw you.

754
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:57,030
Did you get the school in trouble?

755
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,700
Is everything my fault?

756
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,430
No?

757
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:04,670
If you find the person, tell them...

758
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:08,570
that thanks to them, our school's changing for the better.

759
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,610
What are you reading?

760
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:20,180
Do you know anything about our school's last scary story?

761
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:21,519
You're the number one student.

762
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,550
I wouldn't know.

763
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:24,860
You're no help at all.

764
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:30,790
Isn't it time you told me what your mission is?

765
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,459
- I won't tell you. - Tell me.

766
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:34,870
I'm asking nicely...

767
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:41,770
What is it now?

768
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,440
"To hide."

769
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:45,110
"Bead."

770
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:47,510
- Is that right? - Yes. "Hwigyeong."

771
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,150
"To hide a bead."

772
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:51,150
"To hide a bead."

773
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,890
"The one with the bead."

774
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:57,250
What are you on about?

775
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,760
- I have to go. - Where... What...

776
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:03,330
He does all the talking then vanishes.

777
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:08,170
"Hwigyeong."

778
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:15,839
Sir.

779
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,380
The first part of the clue, "the one with the bead."

780
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,579
It's Seo Byeong Mun himself.

781
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,510
Okay. You deciphered part of it.

782
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,080
Hey.

783
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:27,520
What do you mean it indicates Seo Byeong Mun himself?

784
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:29,620
I guess it means the gold bars...

785
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:31,760
are where he faces the red sun.

786
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:33,890
We should look into it.

787
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:38,630
Oh, okay, honey.

788
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:40,830
I'll be home late.

789
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:45,570
What a weasel.

790
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:48,140
No, I didn't mean you.

791
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:49,570
Hey, so what's next?

792
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:51,779
You heard the Office of Education...

793
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:53,440
will send a vice-commissioner tomorrow, right?

794
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:54,750
- Yes. - Yes.

795
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,480
Don't be too nervous.

796
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,179
They're coming to see if our school's okay...

797
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:01,789
without the chairwoman...

798
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:03,350
It's not "our school."

799
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:06,420
Right. I don't want to claim a school...

800
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:07,990
that rigs grades.

801
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:10,259
What if she hadn't gotten caught?

802
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:11,729
- That would've blown. - Yes.

803
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:13,229
- Right. - We pay a fortune.

804
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:15,369
- It's not fair. - Why should we suffer?

805
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:17,170
- It's stupid. - What a mess.

806
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,770
I will...

807
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:22,410
I'll apologize instead.

808
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:24,880
The school shouldn't have done this to you.

809
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,650
I'm sorry, guys.

810
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:30,680
But I promise...

811
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:33,550
nothing like this will happen again.

812
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:35,990
So that you can love your school again.

813
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:39,820
So that you can have fond memories about this school,

814
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:41,790
this classroom, and your desk,

815
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:44,660
I will do my best.

816
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,060
You're just a temporary teacher...

817
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:51,540
Is a temporary teacher not a teacher at all?

818
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:57,510
It was a long day. Any questions?

819
00:59:57,810 --> 01:00:00,540
Are you preparing for the vice-commissioner's visit?

820
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,550
- I guess? - What about all the cleaning?

821
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:05,480
Will you do that alone?

822
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,020
I guess?

823
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:10,520
I was given the mission to revamp our school image.

824
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:13,590
Any more questions?

825
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:16,130
If not, that's all for today.

826
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,829
You did well today. I'll see your smiley faces tomorrow.

827
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:19,830
That's it.

828
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:22,170
I'll help.

829
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,940
We attend this school.

830
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,940
And they say a school belongs to the students.

831
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:33,180
I want to help.

832
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:38,320
I don't have other plans.

833
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,520
- I'll help too. - Me too.

834

- We defend... - Our territory!

835

Me too, then.

839
01:00:48,761 --> 01:00:50,330
- Count me in. - And me.

840
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,160
- And me? - You?

841
01:00:58,170 --> 01:00:59,870

842
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,170

Hey, I blinked.

848
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:29,669
I prefer this to your real look.

849
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:30,999
No, take another one.

851
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:34,570
Take one without me.

852
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:36,370
No. You should be in it too.

854
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:39,680

01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,620
I have some crazy news.

From now on, you should be extra careful.

But what a pity.

we might lose it to Seo Myeong Ju.

Tell me before I crush you.
