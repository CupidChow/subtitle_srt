00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,040
Hey!

188
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,080
Show some appreciation for those who care.

189
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,210
Come with me. Let's have a drink.

190
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,120
It was Seo Myeong Ju...

191
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,990
who put me on this mission.

192
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,330
She wanted to find the gold,

193
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,400
and she used me to do so.

194
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,970
I was a pawn in a game she'd set up.

195
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,240
She has someone within the NIS.

196
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,380
There's no one I can trust.

197
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,320
I'm not sure if this will console you.

198
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,500
I don't want you to think you're alone.

199
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,940
Suspecting every person around you...

200
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,770
That's too painful.

201
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,279
Once you find the one person you can't trust,

202
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,850
the others will all be on your side.

203
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,180
And...

204
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,250
there's me too.

205
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,230
Here.

206
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,330
You can drink.

207
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,800
Cheers.

208
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,400
Who do you think is suspicious or odd?

209
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,640
It'll be one of the people who knows about this operation.

210
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,410
Don't worry. I'll help you find them.

211
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,480
You have to be in school all day every day.

212
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,320
Starting within the NIS would be too daunting.

213
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,519
Why not spy on the chairwoman?

214
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,660
Tracking her movement, tailing her,

215
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,359
pulling phone records.

216
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,260
Can't NIS agents do that?

217
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,860
To a certain degree.

218
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,930
How did you know we can do that?

219
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,700
I'm a fan of spy movies...

220
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,639
Is it just me?

221
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,809
You dropped the honorifics to speak casually.

222
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,010
We're the same age.

223
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,310
Are we?

224
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,110
When did we share personal details?

225
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,550
In elementary school?

226
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,720
Back then?

227
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,250
In elementary school?

228
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,430
We were in second grade to be exact.

229
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,270
Why am I your sworn enemy?

230
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,840
You kind of look like him.

231
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,309
Who?

232
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,740
Just someone. Someone who's like my sworn enemy.

233
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,629
Why did you change your name?

234
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,090
I prefer Bong Ja.

235
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,600
And one more thing.

236
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:36,930
I live over there.

237
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,380
You're Si...

238
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,980
- You mean you're Jeong Si Hyun? - Yes.

239
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,789
You lived close by...

240
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,620
and until now, all I thought about...

241
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,460
How come? Darn it.

242
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,430
"Jeong Hae Seong."

243
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,670
Why are you "Hae Seong?" Did you change your name too?

244
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,340
I did when I joined the company.

245
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,740
I can't use my real name in the field.

246
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,310
Okay, then you stay Hae Seong.

247
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,050
Don't call me "Bong Ja," or I'll kill you.

248
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,480
I think that name is prettier.

249
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,620
Oh Su A it is.

250
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,820
Multiple shocks in a row.

251
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,530
If there's anything else I should know, tell me now.

252
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,660
There isn't.

253
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,400
Are you sure? There's nothing else?

254
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,700
There isn't.

255
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,300
It's late. Go on home.

256
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,510
See you.

257
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,450
- Hae Seong. - Yes?

258
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,519
When you transferred schools without a word in second grade,

259
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,320
I was really upset.

260
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,560
I heard later on that you'd left...

261
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,560
because your father went missing.

262
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,600
I read this somewhere.

263
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,170
Hope only exists for people who believe in it.

264
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,040
You'll find your father.

265
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,850
I should and will.

266
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,390
Get to bed early. You'll be busy from now on.

(Gong Jin Sang loyal to Kim Hyung Bae)

270
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,900
Your grade percentage went way up this semester.

271
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:30,930
You're the best, Dad.

272
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,140
- And the science essay contest? - Don't.

273
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,170
You know who I am.

274
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,370
Of course, you got it.

275
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,209
It's not just the essay contest.

276
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,940
You'll find your name on many winners lists.

277
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,619
There are many things to check, so go through them.

278
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,820
- Okay. - Hey, by the way,

279
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,590
you can't tell anyone about this.

280
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,120
Of course, I won't.

281
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,360
"Winners?"

282
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,630
What were they talking about?

283
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,540
Hey, what's up?

284
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,300
Is Seung Jae not here yet?

285
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,540
I saw him earlier, but he's not here now.

286
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,340
Should I call him?

287
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,610
No, I'll look for him.

288
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,220
- I know, right? - No way.

289
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,619
- No! - Hey.

290
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,649
- She said... - Hey!

291
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,659
- Come on. - I've been wanting to say this.

292
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,219
That hairstyle really suits you.

293
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,260
Really?

294
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:30,529
- I was so torn. - This time, I...

295
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,959
Yes, it suits you.

296
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,400
- Really? Thanks. - Yes.

297
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,470
What? Isn't this...

298
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,070
Mr. Lee, do you know what this is?

299
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,310
- What is this? - Seung Jae dropped it at the event.

300
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,140
I forgot to give it to him in the morning.

301
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,180
You know, I thought about it.

302
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:50,050
I think you should look into it before you return it to him.

303
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,180
No, this isn't even mine.

304
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,990
These days, so many kids are duped into cybercrimes.

305
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,959
What if he ends up in such a situation...

306
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,520
because you don't intervene?

307
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,760
I think Seung Jae is smarter than that.

308
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,260
Ms. Kim, Mr. Lee.

309
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,500
Yes?

310
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:10,070
Principal Park is looking for you.

311
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,630
- Okay. - Okay.

312
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,100
You should still look into it just in case.

313
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,970
Just give it back if there's nothing suspicious about it.

314
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,030
Darn it.

315
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,090
Shoot.

316
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,370
Oh, hey.

317
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,680
There you are. I've been looking for you.

318
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:56,410
Hey, I'm sorry. I'm kind of busy right now.

319
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,750
Let's talk later.

320
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,180
On the night of the event,

321
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,450
I was here.

322
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,370
I overheard your conversation with your dad.

323
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,000
So I have many questions for you, Seung Jae.

324
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:24,839
Okay.

325
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,140
I mean, I understand what you're trying to say.

326
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,440
- I will... - Hey, Han Seung Jae.

327
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,780
I asked you a question.

328
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,450
Don't list excuses. Just answer my question.

329
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,460
I'll ask you one last time.

330
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,159
The science essay contest hasn't even happened yet.

331
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,560
How could you be the winner?

332
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,029
What was the thing your dad gave you?

333
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,500
Why did he say you must keep it a secret?

334
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,740
Tell me everything. Don't leave anything out.

335
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,820
Just so you know, you asked about it first.

342

That's right.

343
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,049
Since the beginning of tenth grade,

344
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,860
Chairwoman Seo has been telling other kids to do it too.

345
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,220
No way.

346
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,530
Why would my mom do such a thing?

347
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,630
I'm not sure.

348
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,460
The adults must have a reason they can't tell us.

349
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,600

351
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,740
What will you say to Chairwoman Seo?

352
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,450
"This is wrong. You must stop this."

353
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,120
Will you raise a problem with it?

354
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,290
Aren't you dense?

355
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,230
I'm sorry to be so blunt, Student Council President.

356
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,500
You're the one who has benefited the most from it.

You didn't achieve it on your own.

361
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,480

Where are you going in such a rush?

368
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,580
I have to get ready for my class.

369
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,120
You majored in Korean History, right?

370
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,790
Yes.

371
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,320
You see, I truly love world history.

372
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,560
For example, the First Sino-Japanese War,

373
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,630
which started in 1894.

374
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,930
How did Japan...

375
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,970
manage to beat the great Qing dynasty of China...

376
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,470
and seize hegemony over East Asia?

377
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,140
Through their military strength? Weaponry?

378
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:45,980
Clever military strategies?

379
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,280
No.

380
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:49,410
The power of rules.

381
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:54,980
All soldiers were required to obey their commanders.

382
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,650
It was all thanks to their strict rules.

383
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:04,359
Japanese soldiers were shot to death on the spot...

384
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,560
if they drank water when they weren't on their break.

385
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,270
Those who are likely to break the rules,

386
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,500
bring down morale,

387
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,340
and cause trouble.

388
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,370
To get rid of them before they become trouble.

389
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,510
Bang.

390
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,120
Mark my words.

391
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,320
If you want to work here for a long time, that is.

392
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,170
Have fun getting ready for your class.

393
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,380
Ma'am.

394
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,980
I'm sorry, but didn't the Japanese hegemony...

395
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,050
lead the empire to its collapse?

396
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,320
Please excuse me.

397
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,340
Darn it.

398
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:30,180
My gosh. Am I losing my mind?

399
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,350
What was I thinking, talking back to her like that?

400
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:35,850
Unbelievable.

401
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,020
Seriously, what should I do?

402
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,660
I'm scared to handle this alone.

They did nothing wrong.

411
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,030
This should be investigated.

412
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:20,000
I know the school is falling apart, but this is just wrong.

413
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,260
How could this...

414
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,510
Can you help me?

415
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,280
Sorry. That will be hard.

416
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,380
As you probably know already, I have a lot on my plate now...

417
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,490
because of the situation at work.

418
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,320
Sorry about that.

429

431

434

435
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,040
Yes, the math competition.

You may not believe me,

437
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,540
but I always get the highest marks in math.

438
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,009
I beat Ye Na on my midterms...

439
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,480
because I did so well on my math exam.

440
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,420
If they actually follow this plan,

441
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,120

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,130
Nothing.

Well...

447
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,760
Is the competition very important?

448
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,500
Yes, I would say so.

449
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,500
It's definitely helpful to have it on your student record.

450
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,270

451
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,980

No.

454
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,780
That's why this competition is important to me.

455
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:56,349
It'll determine whether or not I can get into the college...

where I'd study to achieve my dream.

457
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,730
It means I have to study even harder from now on.

458
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,460
Did you and Dad fight?

459
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,570

00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,620
I said, on your knees.

548
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,430
Yes, ma'am.

549
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:50,870
You see, your rude mouth is always the problem.

550
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,600
I'm sorry.

551
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:57,210
I swear, I didn't mean to tell Ye Na.

552
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,950
So, you don't even know what you did wrong.

553
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:05,410
Pardon me?

554
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,080
What do you mean?

555
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:14,020
From now on, when you're with your elders,

556
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:19,560
just watch what you say, Han Seung Jae.

557
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,700
Yes, ma'am.

558
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:25,800
Wipe your face with this.

559
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,200
What are you doing?

560
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:57,800
Looking into the school grade scandal?

561
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,770
Are you watching me through a camera or something?

562
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,610
Why are you doing all this?

563
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,720
You said you wanted a permanent position.

564
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,320
No one would dare to look into this.

565
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,060
Why would you do this like a fool, knowing the risks involved?

566
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,030
Because no one else is doing it.

567
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,840
One of my first students I told you about the other day.

568
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,510
She dropped out of school.

569
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,380
Do you have proof?

570
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,979
Can you prove that my daughter framed...

571
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,279
that dirty orphan?

572
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,780
Committee Chairwoman, please.

573
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,120
Ms. Oh, apologize already.

574
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:52,450
Forget it.

575
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,560
- Unbelievable. - Apologize, darn it!

576
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,490
Shoot.

577
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:59,260
Ma'am!

578
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,169
She was framed for stealing the exam sheet.

(Exam Sheet)

580
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,840
I promised to clear her name.

581
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,670
But I failed miserably.

582
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:16,340
I didn't know my place as a temp teacher.

583
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,380
That's when I made up my mind.

584
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,920
To be someone qualified.

585
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,260
Because powerless justice is another name for incompetence.

586
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,460
That's why I have to be a full-time teacher.

587
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,760
But now?

588
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:40,500
Someone reminded me of something I had forgotten about.

589
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:51,050
Something more important than being a full-time teacher.

590
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,520
The reason I chose this career path.

591
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,420
It's my job to protect my students.

592
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,330
I'm not asking for your help, so don't worry.

593
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:07,360
- Just don't try to stop me... - Seo Myeong Ju knows.

594
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,330
She knows you're investigating the fixed school grades.

595
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,840
I don't care.

596
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,070
It's dangerous to carry on at school.

597

Look here.

611
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,860
We'll compare this...

00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,559
Western culture was introduced to us rapidly...

728
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,199
in the 1920s and 1930s through newspapers,

729
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,930
magazines, and movies.

730
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:40,570
Major cities were at the heart of this trend.

731
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:43,470
Capitalistic consumption culture emerged...

732
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,370
especially in and around Seoul.

733
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,650
That'll be the end of today's class.

734
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,520
(Mister)

735
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,859
The mission has been aborted.

736
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:04,960
Wrap it up by the end of this week.

737
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:07,030
Mission aborted?

738
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,699
That's the text I got after I reported Seo Myeong Ju's...

739
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,830
school grades scandal.

740
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,639
But you were just at the NIS.

741
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,740
Who knew about this?

742
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:18,810
My team and the director.

743
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,809
And the only people who could order this...

744
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:23,340
are the director and my team leader.

745
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:31,890
You must stay at the school to keep an eye on Seo Myeong Ju.

746
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:34,620
The order came from...

747
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:36,520
Seo Myeong Ju herself.

748
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,259
The mole at the NIS told her...

749
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:40,460
about my investigation into the scandal,

750
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,060
and she wants me gone.

751
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,730
I must stay at the school...

752
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:48,140
for the sake of this mission and to fish out the mole.

753
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:52,110
I'll bait Seo Myeong Ju.

754
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:53,510
How?

755
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,350
By holding the gold bars hostage.

756
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:02,120
If I tell her I know where the gold bars are,

757
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,790
she won't kick me out of this school.

758
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:08,659
(Ciabatta and butter, Fruit salad, Sweet pumpkin cream soup,)

759
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:09,820
(Steak and cream pasta, Pickles, Fruit juice, Pecan pie)

760
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:12,060
The chairwoman's coming today?

761
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:15,660
Of course. No wonder the meal is this luxurious.

762
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:17,159
So that's today.

763
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,330
The chairwoman eats with us once every six months.

764
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,840
I'll pass on lunch.

765
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,139
Just locking eyes with her will give me indigestion.

766
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,170
I'll pass as well.

767
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:26,040
She's scary, so same here.

768
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:27,540
Same here.

769
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:30,810
Hae Seong, where are you going?

770
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,650
To have lunch. I'm hungry.

771
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:38,720
- What? - What?

772
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:42,890
- Enjoy. - Enjoy.

773
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,729
- Goodness. - Please enjoy.

774
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:48,359
Let's add avocado to the salad.

775
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,629
- Avocado? - That's right. Also...

776
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:52,070
Hello, Ms. Seo.

777
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:53,430
Goodness, hello.

778
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:55,299
What brings you here?

779
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,340
I was hoping to eat with you today.

780
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:00,110
- May I sit here? - Hae Seong.

781
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,609
Can't you see she's eating?

782
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:04,949
To talk to her, you must have an appointment...

783
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:05,950
Don't.

784
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:07,580
Sit over here.

785
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:09,380
Thank you.

786
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,690
But...

787
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:21,360
I'll enjoy it. Gosh, this looks good.

788
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,170
What did you want to say?

789
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:29,939
Sorry?

790
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,940
Didn't you sit here because you had something to say?

791
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:36,810
You see...

792
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:39,680
I don't know if I should even ask you this.

793
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:41,220
Feel free to ask me anything.

794
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:44,950
Sure. Then...

795
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,690
It's something I've been curious about.

796
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:54,800
Byeongmun High was famous at my old school as well.

797
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:58,600
The rumour that practically everyone has heard.

798
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:01,440
The strange mystery of Byeongmun High.

799
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:07,840
Why is the food at Byeongmun High so delicious?

800
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:14,420
The food?

801
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:15,850
Now I know why.

802
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:19,190
Because you show us you care by being hands-on.

803
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,460
Have your fill.

804
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:26,330
And come to my office if there's something...

805
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,299
you really need to tell me.

806
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,670
How could a student dare to enter your office?

807
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:33,170
The offer alone is much appreciated.

808
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:39,970
Anyway, Ms. Seo,

809
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:43,910
has the school gym gone under renovation before?

810
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:46,710
The school gym?

811
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,750
Never. Why do you ask?

812
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,830
As you know, I'm a curious soul.

813
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:01,760
There are interesting tales surrounding the school.

814
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:04,870
You like ghost stories.

815
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:15,640
Goodness.

816
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:19,880
But the gym ghost isn't known to many.

817
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,280
How did you know about it?

818
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,620
I enjoyed the meal.

819
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,220
I'll get going.

820
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:47,980
He's hoping the fourth ghost story...

821
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:50,640
will be enough to keep him in school.

822
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:52,550
Principal Park.

823
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:56,920
Deal with what I ordered as soon as possible.

824
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,450
Yes, ma'am.

825
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:04,489
I'm going to check Seo Myeong Ju's movements today.

826
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:07,499
Sure. I'll look further into what I can find at school.

827
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,960
Right. Stay safe.

828
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:16,040
(Office of Records and Documents)

829
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:32,990
(2023 Intra-school English Reading Comprehension Competition)

830
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:36,460
We found the link, but it's still not enough.

831
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,089
Hard evidence that'll prove the tests and contests...

832
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:40,729
have been rigged.

833
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,160
Concrete evidence.

834
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:45,500
Let's think about how we'll obtain that.

835
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,540
Why are you here and not at ballet class?

836
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:00,510
I have something to ask.

837
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,280
Which is?

838
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,190
What is it?

839
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,320
Is it true...

840
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:21,529
that the reason I'm at the top of the class...

841
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:22,960
Yes, it was all me.

842
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:28,270
- Mom? - Because you're my daughter.

843
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,239
My daughter should be the best,

844
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,940
and it is my responsibility as your mother to make that happen.

845
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:35,340
What about me, then?

846
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:38,410
What about...

847
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:42,449
all the hard work I've been putting in?

848
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:43,920
That's why no one questioned your scores.

849
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,390
Ye Na.

850
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:53,130
Don't think too much of it and do as you've been doing.

851
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,300
I'll take care of the rest.

852
00:58:57,130 --> 00:58:59,000
You're not like Yu Jeong.

853
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:04,510
You were chosen as Seo Myeong Ju's daughter...

854
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:07,269
and have all the right to reap the benefits.

855
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:08,780
To be honest, I'd do more if I could.

856
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,249
Hey, since we're on the subject,

857
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:14,620
stop associating with that Yu Jeong girl.

858
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:17,050
Playing with her for a year is more than enough.

859
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,450
If I'm being honest,

860
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:22,260
she annoyed me to the core.

861
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,889
How dare a nobody like her...

862
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:26,889
take the top spot from my daughter?

863
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:29,400
Don't speak ill of Yu Jeong.

864
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:31,730
What?

865
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:35,470
She was never my plaything.

866
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:37,470
Don't speak that way about my friend.

867
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:40,010
Did you just call her your friend?

868
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:21,680
Ye Na, hey.

869
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,520
Sorry, but I'll sit here.

870
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:29,189
You had the second highest grades this time around...

871
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:30,360
only losing to me by one question.

872
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:32,960
Can I sit next to you?

873
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,160
What? Sure.

874
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:40,799
What's your secret?

875
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,670
You aren't in any study groups or have any private tutors.

876
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:44,410
Well...

877
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:46,910
I mostly stick to studying the textbooks.

878
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:50,180
Is studying the easiest thing for you?

879
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:51,610
I guess.

880
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:54,780
It's Yu Jeong, right? An Yu Jeong.

881
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:58,320
I'm curious about you.

882
01:00:58,850 --> 01:00:59,890
Let's be friends.

883
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:05,690
Lee Ye Na.

884
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:10,500
What are you doing here?

885
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,350
Here.

886
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,389
My gosh.

887
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:35,720
You must be Ye Na whom I heard so much about.

888
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,860
You're my daughter's best friend.

889
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:42,600
I hope you keep getting along with her.

890
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:45,069
She can be like a pit bull sometimes,

891
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:46,969
but please bear with that.

892
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:48,969
Mom, stop the nonsense and head inside.

893
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:50,200
Why? I don't want to.

894
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:52,140
I'd like to eat with Ye Na.

895
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:55,309
Ye Na, please enjoy,

896
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:56,910
and tell me whatever you need.

897
01:01:58,510 --> 01:01:59,680
I'll enjoy.

898
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:02,250
Goodness. She has such a pretty voice.

899
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:03,450
Leave.

900
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:05,250
All right, fine.

901
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:07,990
Hold on.

902
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:11,590
Please enjoy.

903
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:33,810
You like that, right?

904
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:00,270
I'll get going.

905
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:14,320
Yu Jeong.

906
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:17,620
I enjoyed dinner.

907
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:21,160
Thanks.

908
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:24,030
Whatever. Just get going.

Let's make a promise, Ms. Oh.

934

A promise?

935
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,200
I want schools to have more...

936

people like you.

I have the DNA analysis report from the break-in.

It's odd though. Why did that person...

break into your house?

01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,200
Because if you knew...

944
01:08:59,570 --> 01:09:01,540
Let me ask this one thing. Why me?

945
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:04,840
That doesn't sound like a question for me.

946
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:06,809
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

947
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:08,609
This is daring of you...

948
01:09:08,610 --> 01:09:10,440
considering you don't know how far I'll go.
