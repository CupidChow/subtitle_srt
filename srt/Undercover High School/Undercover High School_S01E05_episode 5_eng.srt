Buddha...

5
00:00:21,683 --> 00:00:25,013
My Hae Seong...

6
00:00:31,633 --> 00:00:33,273
Dear Lord.

7
00:00:33,273 --> 00:00:34,703
   

8
00:00:34,703 --> 00:00:36,193

12
00:00:56,863 --> 00:00:58,283
   

13
00:01:00,203 --> 00:01:02,063
Let's start.

14
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:43,793
 Can someone explain this situation? 

15
00:01:47,423 --> 00:01:49,503
 Surprise! 

16
00:01:49,503 --> 00:01:52,393
 Surprise! 

17
00:01:52,393 --> 00:01:56,073
 Hae Seong! 

18
00:01:57,553 --> 00:02:00,753
 My goodness, you surprised me! 

19
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:02,993
 Surprise! 

20
00:02:02,993 --> 00:02:05,483
 Aigoo, nice to meet you. 

21
00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:10,063
 I'm the owner of the place where Hae Seong works. 

22
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:12,213
 I'm an employee there. 

23
00:02:13,313 --> 00:02:16,073
 Oh, I see. 

24
00:02:16,073 --> 00:02:18,153
 H-Hello. 

25
00:02:18,153 --> 00:02:20,493
 I'm Oh Su Ah, Hae Seong's homeroom teacher. 

26
00:02:20,493 --> 00:02:22,873
 Oh, yes. 

27
00:02:24,263 --> 00:02:26,453
 - And he is... 
 - Oh, he's also an employee. 

28
00:02:26,453 --> 00:02:28,523
 He has narcolepsy. Don't worry about it. 

29
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:32,063
 Just cover him with a blanket. 

30
00:02:33,803 --> 00:02:38,023
 But why are Hae Seong's coworkers here? 

31
00:02:38,793 --> 00:02:43,663
 - What? 
 - I mean it doesn't seem like an ordinary situation. 

32
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,693
 Coming to your part-timer's place... 

33
00:02:45,693 --> 00:02:47,973
 or being in there... 

34
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:51,223
 or having your shoes on. 

35
00:02:54,043 --> 00:02:57,703
 I'm sorry. I don't think it's strange, but... 

36
00:02:57,703 --> 00:03:00,443
 You said "surprise" earlier. 

37
00:03:00,443 --> 00:03:02,453
 But Hae Seong was home all day... 

38
00:03:02,453 --> 00:03:05,323
 Is she Sherlock Holmes or something? 

39
00:03:05,993 --> 00:03:11,363
 Everything I just said warrants an explanation, Hae Seong. 

40
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,163
 Well, the thing is... 

41
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:18,113
 actually... 

42
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:24,223
 Hae Seong! 

43
00:03:24,223 --> 00:03:26,363
 Ms. Oh, this is too much! 

44
00:03:26,363 --> 00:03:28,523
 You asked a sick kid too many questions! 

45
00:03:28,523 --> 00:03:30,563
 Hae Seong! Wake up! 

46
00:03:30,563 --> 00:03:32,883
 You can't die, dude! 

47
00:03:32,883 --> 00:03:35,333
 You can't die, dude! 

48
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,943
 Hae Seong! 

49
00:03:43,843 --> 00:03:46,613
 Don't die, Hae Seong... 

50
00:03:49,493 --> 00:03:50,553
 Excuse me, Hae Seong– 

51
00:03:50,553 --> 00:03:52,823
 No, don't come! 

52
00:03:53,773 --> 00:03:56,403
 What a cruel person! 

53
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,023
 But... 

54
00:03:58,023 --> 00:03:59,723
 I... 

55
00:04:04,263 --> 00:04:06,653
 Excuse me, are you okay? 

56
00:04:06,653 --> 00:04:08,283
 Excuse me... 

57
00:04:14,993 --> 00:04:17,153
Stop. Hands on your head.

58
00:04:18,943 --> 00:04:21,583
Let's collect the answer sheets from the back.

59
00:04:37,103 --> 00:04:38,843
Good job on the test.

60
00:04:38,843 --> 00:04:41,890
- See you at the end of the day. 
  - Okay, thank you. 

61
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,670
 It wasn't easy... 

62
00:04:46,663 --> 00:04:48,303
Sunbae.

63
00:04:49,783 --> 00:04:52,743
For the last few days, I've been thinking...

64
00:04:52,743 --> 00:04:55,643
What are you doing out here?

65
00:04:55,643 --> 00:04:57,483
Hey, Sunbae,

66
00:04:57,483 --> 00:04:59,433
for the last few days...

67
00:05:01,523 --> 00:05:03,203
Hey, Sunbae.

68
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:04,863
For the last few days,

69
00:05:04,863 --> 00:05:08,463
I've been thinking about your feelings for me.

70
00:05:08,463 --> 00:05:11,333
- What? 
- The kiss in the closet that day.

71
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,483
It was my first time.

72
00:05:13,483 --> 00:05:17,073
The thrilling shock that made me pass out...

73
00:05:17,753 --> 00:05:20,033
Sunbae, I mean...

74
00:05:21,443 --> 00:05:25,153
From now on, I won't call you "Sunbae."

75
00:05:25,153 --> 00:05:28,733
A sinner of a woman who stole my lips.

76
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:31,213
If love is a sin...

77
00:05:32,053 --> 00:05:34,103
you should get a life sentence.

78
00:05:34,103 --> 00:05:37,033
I was going to let it go since you're young.

79
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:40,363
Have you finally lost your marbles?

80
00:05:44,363 --> 00:05:45,483
Go Yeong Hun.

81
00:05:45,483 --> 00:05:52,663
How dare you rudely speak down to Noona like this?

82
00:05:52,663 --> 00:05:57,983
Try talking down to me one more time. I'll smash your head in, got it?

83
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,053
Got it?

84
00:06:09,883 --> 00:06:12,753
Let's pretend this conversation never happened.

85
00:06:12,753 --> 00:06:14,853
Let's go eat.

86
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:17,273
Hurry up!

87
00:06:21,593 --> 00:06:23,713
She's multi-dimensional.

88
00:06:24,993 --> 00:06:27,083
Even more attractive than before.

89
00:06:28,003 --> 00:06:29,683
Why aren't they coming?

90
00:06:29,683 --> 00:06:32,103
- I know, right. 
 - Let's have a drink.

91
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:36,093
You are already here.

92
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:37,743
Yeah. Where is Yeong Hun?

93
00:06:37,743 --> 00:06:39,443
He's coming.

94
00:06:39,443 --> 00:06:42,493
Hey. The meat is burning. Let's eat.

95
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,953
Have plenty, Mi Jeong...

96
00:06:48,413 --> 00:06:50,283
Sunbae.

97
00:06:51,183 --> 00:06:54,233
Why are you talking down to her vaguely like that?

98
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:56,263
- Pardon? 
 - Something's up with you two.

99
00:06:56,263 --> 00:06:57,943
- No. 
 - Yes.

100
00:07:00,663 --> 00:07:03,363
Nothing's going on. Let's change the subject.

101
00:07:03,363 --> 00:07:05,423
How did you do on your test?

102
00:07:05,423 --> 00:07:06,603
Don't ask him about that.

103
00:07:06,603 --> 00:07:09,353
I asked Yu Jeong today and got chewed out.

104
00:07:10,323 --> 00:07:11,683
- Great work. 
 - Right.

105
00:07:11,683 --> 00:07:15,783
You guys worked hard praying, too.

106
00:07:17,993 --> 00:07:19,503
Here.

107
00:07:25,303 --> 00:07:27,733
Here, here. Let's do a grand toast.

108
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:30,323
- Good work. 
 - Thank you.

109
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:34,833
Hey, Hae Seong.

110
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:38,873
Has anything happened with Ms. Oh since that day?

111
00:07:38,873 --> 00:07:41,533
Not yet.

112
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:44,523
I gave it some thought...

113
00:07:44,523 --> 00:07:47,453
I think she suspects us, right?

114
00:07:47,453 --> 00:07:48,963
You don't need to think about it.

115
00:07:48,963 --> 00:07:51,363
A ruckus in the closet? It's freaking weird.

116
00:07:51,363 --> 00:07:53,913
You talk like an actual high schooler now.

117
00:07:53,913 --> 00:07:56,853
Don't use words like that. It's awkward.

118
00:07:58,413 --> 00:08:00,883
Anyway, I think we need to be careful.

119
00:08:00,883 --> 00:08:03,443
I'm worried that she's an unpredictable character.

120
00:08:03,443 --> 00:08:06,803
For the mission, it's best if I don't run in–

121
00:08:15,973 --> 00:08:18,493
What? Why did you stop talking?

122
00:08:18,493 --> 00:08:22,293
You look like a perp who's guilty about something.

123
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,303
Guilty? What?

124
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,543
Just eat. Hurry. Team Leader is paying.

125
00:08:25,543 --> 00:08:26,953
Eat.

126
00:08:26,953 --> 00:08:29,913
♫  I finally found you  ♫

127
00:08:29,913 --> 00:08:34,983
♫  I assure you that my love can't be undone now  ♫

128
00:08:34,983 --> 00:08:39,543
♫  So until the days run out of time  ♫

129
00:08:39,543 --> 00:08:43,593
♫  My love is you  ♫

130
00:08:45,373 --> 00:08:47,523
What about Hae Seong?

131
00:08:47,523 --> 00:08:50,223
He's not just strange.

132
00:08:50,223 --> 00:08:53,573
He might not be a student at all.

133
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:55,303
My god.

134
00:08:57,033 --> 00:08:59,713
The strange guy I saw in the old building?

135
00:09:00,513 --> 00:09:05,243
He looks so much like Jeong Hae Seong.

136
00:09:07,803 --> 00:09:11,063
CEO Gu, the guy he brought to the hearing?

137
00:09:11,063 --> 00:09:13,753
How did a high schooler

138
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:16,053
manage to get a thug like that?

139
00:09:16,803 --> 00:09:19,433
And the strangest thing is...

140
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,263
 They're so weird. 

141
00:09:39,723 --> 00:09:42,013
 7665? 

142
00:09:48,403 --> 00:09:49,673
   

143
00:09:51,293 --> 00:09:52,493
 It makes no sense. 

144
00:09:52,493 --> 00:09:55,953
How could a high school student drive a car?

145
00:09:56,853 --> 00:09:59,963
And those three people in the attic apartment...

146
00:09:59,963 --> 00:10:02,203
were so suspicious.

147
00:10:02,203 --> 00:10:04,723
Maybe he repeated a few grades.

148
00:10:04,723 --> 00:10:07,443
Maybe he has a fake driver's license.

149
00:10:07,443 --> 00:10:09,963
You said he drinks, too.

150
00:10:10,783 --> 00:10:13,863
The student records say he is 17 years old.

151
00:10:15,223 --> 00:10:18,123
What is he, seriously?

152
00:10:18,123 --> 00:10:19,743
I have a headache.

153
00:10:19,743 --> 00:10:22,053
Suspecting is a disease.

154
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:24,323
Stop talking nonsense and drink.

155
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,123
Midterms are over!

156
00:10:26,763 --> 00:10:28,393
Cheers!

157
00:10:28,393 --> 00:10:30,673
He's not Seon Deok, is he?

158
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:32,203
He is?

159
00:10:32,203 --> 00:10:34,303
What is Seon Deok?

160
00:10:45,573 --> 00:10:46,713
 Come on... 

161
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:50,293
 Why is this not working? 

162
00:10:50,293 --> 00:10:51,653
What?

163
00:10:51,653 --> 00:10:53,103
Why is she here?

164
00:10:53,103 --> 00:10:54,653
Dude.

165
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:57,143
Get it together. Okay?

166
00:10:58,913 --> 00:11:00,543
Excuse me.

167
00:11:00,543 --> 00:11:03,853
You have the wrong house. Please leave.

168
00:11:04,693 --> 00:11:07,923
 I think you're quite drunk. Are you okay? 

169
00:11:11,393 --> 00:11:13,163
Mom, do you have a cold?

170
00:11:13,163 --> 00:11:14,583
Mom?

171
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,903
I'm not your mother.

172
00:11:17,903 --> 00:11:20,543
You have the wrong– This is crazy.

173
00:11:20,543 --> 00:11:22,793
 Mom, I love you. 

174
00:11:22,793 --> 00:11:24,453
 Mom, I love you. 

175
00:11:24,453 --> 00:11:29,103
 Mom, Su Ah is drunk! 

176
00:11:29,103 --> 00:11:31,323
Open the door, please.

177
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:35,313
I'm your daughter, and I'm being cute!

178
00:11:35,313 --> 00:11:37,863
Please? Are you angry, Mom?

179
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:41,053
- Why is she here? 
 - Mom... don't be angry...

180
00:11:41,053 --> 00:11:42,503
What are you doing at someone else's house?

181
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:44,053
Are you crazy?

182
00:11:44,053 --> 00:11:46,463
 Come on. I'm so sorry... 

183
00:11:46,463 --> 00:11:48,433
 - I'm sorry. 
 - Mom, someone's hitting me. 

184
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:50,433
 - What did you say? 
 - Mom, it's a disaster. 

185
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:52,153
What is?

186
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:56,383
Mom is not opening the door.

187
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,813
Stop talking nonsense. Let's go.

188
00:11:57,813 --> 00:12:00,763
- B-B-But... 
 - Come on.

189
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:03,063
Aigoo. I'm so sorry.

190
00:12:03,063 --> 00:12:04,863
 My daughter is quite drunk. 

191
00:12:04,863 --> 00:12:06,653
 She's not a bad girl. 

192
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:08,333
 I'm sorry. So sorry. 

193
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,993
 - Open the door... 
 - Walk straight. 

194
00:12:09,993 --> 00:12:12,613
No worries. Have a good night.

195
00:12:20,003 --> 00:12:21,763
 Where is your head? 

196
00:12:21,763 --> 00:12:24,793
 - B-B-But... 
 - Seriously. 

197
00:12:24,793 --> 00:12:26,653
 Why are you doing that to my arm? 

198
00:12:26,653 --> 00:12:29,513
 Gosh, why are you doing this? 

199
00:12:29,513 --> 00:12:31,413
 - I'll die early because of you. 
 - I can walk. 

200
00:12:31,413 --> 00:12:33,973
 Mom! 

201
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,823
Be quiet! Please!

202
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:39,383
What? What is it?

203
00:12:41,113 --> 00:12:42,993
What is wrong with you?

204
00:12:42,993 --> 00:12:45,113
Gosh, I'm so sick of this.

205
00:12:45,113 --> 00:12:46,383
 M-M-Mom. My goodness! 

206
00:12:46,383 --> 00:12:48,173
 I'm twice as tired because of you. 

207
00:12:48,173 --> 00:12:49,983
 I'm tired, too. 

208
00:12:49,983 --> 00:12:52,593
- She lives nearby? 
  - How many steps are there? 

209
00:12:52,593 --> 00:12:54,023
 Go inside. 

210
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,193
- Why? 
  - Here? 

211
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:57,573
 Hello! 

212
00:12:57,573 --> 00:12:59,413
 Aigoo, my back... 

213
00:13:00,953 --> 00:13:02,923
This is bad.

214
00:13:13,463 --> 00:13:15,173
Hey, we get our report cards today. Right?

215
00:13:15,173 --> 00:13:17,593
Yeah. I think my rank went up this time.

216
00:13:17,593 --> 00:13:19,453
By how many ranks?

217
00:13:19,453 --> 00:13:20,853
I think within the Top 10.

218
00:13:20,853 --> 00:13:22,573
- Top 10? 
 - Yeah.

219
00:13:22,573 --> 00:13:24,353
- So jealous. 
 - What should I ask for from my dad?

220
00:13:24,353 --> 00:13:26,343
- Maybe a new bag. 
 - A bag?

221
00:13:26,343 --> 00:13:28,193
Quiet!

222
00:13:28,193 --> 00:13:30,833
The bell rang a while ago, you brats.

223
00:13:32,483 --> 00:13:34,423
Today...

224
00:13:34,423 --> 00:13:38,883
the midterm results you've been waiting for are here.

225
00:13:38,883 --> 00:13:41,223
Moan all you want, but this is reality.

226
00:13:41,223 --> 00:13:42,343
Step up to get yours.

227
00:13:42,343 --> 00:13:44,803
- Kang Ki Hyeong. 
 - Yes.

228
00:13:46,863 --> 00:13:48,893
An Yu Jeong.

229
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,153
Lee Ye Na.

230
00:13:57,853 --> 00:13:59,723
Jeong Hae Seong.

231
00:14:09,513 --> 00:14:11,373
Good job.

232
00:14:15,043 --> 00:14:17,013
Oh Se Yeong.

233
00:14:21,323 --> 00:14:23,103
What's your rank?

234
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,813
Lee Dong Min.

235
00:15:00,513 --> 00:15:03,083
It's me. How did it go?

236
00:15:04,693 --> 00:15:06,113
   

237
00:15:10,163 --> 00:15:11,373
I don't think he made it.

238
00:15:11,373 --> 00:15:13,313
Shush!

239
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:16,733
Agent Jeong Hae Seong, report your grades.

240
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:18,773
It's fine.

241
00:15:18,773 --> 00:15:20,823
I did it.

242
00:15:20,823 --> 00:15:22,953
Tenth place in school!

243
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:30,723
He did it!

244
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:39,183
Good job! Proud of you, Jeong Hae Seong!

245
00:15:39,183 --> 00:15:42,963
 I knew you could do it, dude! 

246
00:15:42,963 --> 00:15:44,683
 Good work, man. 

247
00:15:44,683 --> 00:15:46,663
 Really good work. 

248
00:15:46,663 --> 00:15:48,533
   

249
00:15:50,443 --> 00:15:52,073
 But... 

250
00:15:52,073 --> 00:15:54,603
what did Yu Jeong get?

251
00:15:54,603 --> 00:15:57,503
What? Yu Jeong?

252
00:15:58,533 --> 00:16:01,383
Wow, I was so shocked.

253
00:16:01,383 --> 00:16:03,463
Do you know what her rank is?

254
00:16:06,263 --> 00:16:08,633
This is Ye Na's first loss, right?

255
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:11,863
She's right in front of us. Watch it.

256
00:16:11,863 --> 00:16:15,023
An Yu Jeong, first place in school? Daebak.

257
00:16:17,653 --> 00:16:19,173
   

258
00:16:21,913 --> 00:16:25,183
Congratulations. You finally beat me for once.

259
00:16:25,183 --> 00:16:26,253
I got lucky.

260
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:28,223
A lot of what I studied was on the test.

261
00:16:28,223 --> 00:16:30,753
Luck counts as a talent. Don't you know?

262
00:16:30,753 --> 00:16:34,203
Watch me. I'm not losing next time.

263
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,190
 She got first place...  

264
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:20,063
 I heard Lee Ye Na lost to Yu Jeong. 

265
00:17:20,063 --> 00:17:22,403
 She couldn't get what she wanted even with so many tutors. 

266
00:17:22,403 --> 00:17:23,993
 The An Yu Jeong regime takeover. 

267
00:17:23,993 --> 00:17:25,283
 Let's go! 

268
00:17:25,283 --> 00:17:28,463
 She was being extra for being the chair's daughter. 

269
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,933
What? Stop it!

270
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,903
D-Did you see everything?

271
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,833
Was I being that extra?

272
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,873
I'll be more careful.

273
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,613
Y-Y-Ye Na.

274
00:17:57,003 --> 00:17:59,123
Invite me to the group chat.

275
00:17:59,123 --> 00:18:01,213
It looks fun.

276
00:18:03,103 --> 00:18:04,983
T-The chat group?

277
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,753
C-Chat group?

278
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:10,363
Damn it!

279
00:18:10,363 --> 00:18:12,253
Damn it!

280
00:18:12,253 --> 00:18:15,043
Damn it! Seriously...

281
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:20,213
Damn it, you're not all that, either...

282
00:18:20,213 --> 00:18:23,133
   

283
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:24,740
   

284
00:18:32,433 --> 00:18:34,033
   

285
00:18:34,033 --> 00:18:37,103
   

286
00:18:42,153 --> 00:18:44,603
What are you thinking so hard about?

287
00:18:46,483 --> 00:18:49,583
I have a troublesome student.

288
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,243
Your back!

289
00:18:51,243 --> 00:18:53,033
Is your back okay since that time?

290
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:57,563
Aigoo, I'm fine after using pain relief patches.

291
00:18:57,563 --> 00:18:59,643
Don't you have a class soon? You should go inside.

292
00:18:59,643 --> 00:19:02,793
Oh, sure. I will get going.

293
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:08,073
How long was he looking over my shoulder?

294
00:19:12,513 --> 00:19:14,593
I should've come to see you a long time ago.

295
00:19:14,593 --> 00:19:18,753
I'm sorry. I am a little late.

296
00:19:19,443 --> 00:19:23,053
I know very well that you're busy, Chairwoman.

297
00:19:23,053 --> 00:19:24,813
The Edu-City and everything...

298
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:27,343
You have a lot going on.

299
00:19:28,123 --> 00:19:30,153
As you know very well,

300
00:19:30,153 --> 00:19:33,353
there is no hope left for Korean public education.

301
00:19:33,353 --> 00:19:38,033
Standardized education with low standards has long been a headache

302
00:19:38,033 --> 00:19:41,303
for the students and their parents.

303
00:19:41,303 --> 00:19:45,813
I want perfect conditions for our children.

304
00:19:45,813 --> 00:19:50,783
It may look delusional to you, Editor, but...

305
00:19:50,783 --> 00:19:53,603
my dream is to build a global elite

306
00:19:53,603 --> 00:19:57,833
private school and contribute to our country's education.

307
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:01,363
Why are you telling me such inspiring words?

308
00:20:01,363 --> 00:20:04,673
Would you like me to pick up my pen?

309
00:20:05,573 --> 00:20:10,633
Actually, Editor, I read every single piece of your writing

310
00:20:10,633 --> 00:20:12,803
without missing any.

311
00:20:12,803 --> 00:20:15,823
The GB lift for the Seongju Education Cluster,

312
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:18,613
Byeongmun High School as the preferred bidder...

313
00:20:18,613 --> 00:20:21,943
and other numerous suspicions regarding Edu-City...

314
00:20:21,943 --> 00:20:26,593
I was especially taken by your articles about me.

315
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:30,273
I only seek the truth.

316
00:20:32,603 --> 00:20:37,903
If you're here to manipulate me,

317
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,663
please let go of that thought.

318
00:20:40,663 --> 00:20:43,280
But truth...

319
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:48,133
isn't something you seek but rather create.

320
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:52,883
I will create the truth I want myself.

321
00:21:01,483 --> 00:21:03,273
Work with me.

322
00:21:03,273 --> 00:21:08,163
Whatever you want, Mr. Yun, I will give you that and more.

323
00:21:10,943 --> 00:21:13,383
I will pretend I never heard this.

324
00:21:15,313 --> 00:21:17,293
Editor Yun.

325
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:20,453
Aigoo, my arm.

326
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:25,953
If you don't take the drink I'm offering now,

327
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:28,793
the next one will be a penalty drink.

328
00:21:28,793 --> 00:21:30,563
Please have a seat.

329
00:21:47,423 --> 00:21:50,023
I'm sick of these people.

330
00:22:00,363 --> 00:22:03,843
Editor Yun from Seojin Daily.

331
00:22:03,843 --> 00:22:05,323
Look into him.

332
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:07,773
Got it, Ma'am.

333
00:22:07,773 --> 00:22:10,683
Did the midterm grades come out today?

334
00:22:10,683 --> 00:22:14,253
Jeong Hae Seong will get into the Student Council, no problem.

335
00:22:14,253 --> 00:22:16,073
Really?

336
00:22:16,073 --> 00:22:17,963
Daebak.

337
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:20,533
Is he good at academics, too?

338
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:22,813
Should I give him a prize or something?

339
00:22:22,813 --> 00:22:25,103
However, Chairwoman?

340
00:22:25,103 --> 00:22:26,813
Yes?

341
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:32,003
Ye Na's grades shifted a bit.

342
00:22:34,393 --> 00:22:36,043
Here.

343
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,350
   

344
00:22:43,433 --> 00:22:46,223
   

345
00:22:47,293 --> 00:22:49,493
Let's go to the school.

346
00:22:52,983 --> 00:22:54,473
Jeong Hae Seong, 10th place?

347
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,513
I thought you didn't care about grades. Congrats.

348
00:22:56,513 --> 00:22:59,053
Thanks! You guys can do it, too!

349
00:23:01,853 --> 00:23:03,793
Ye Na!

350
00:23:03,793 --> 00:23:05,823
Ye Na? I heard you got second place.

351
00:23:05,823 --> 00:23:07,493
Congratulations.

352
00:23:07,493 --> 00:23:10,773
Also, this is my Student Council application.

353
00:23:10,773 --> 00:23:13,203
Just put it on my seat.

354
00:23:13,203 --> 00:23:15,313
I was going to, but they said I have to hand it–

355
00:23:15,313 --> 00:23:18,433
Do I need to be louder? Just put it there!

356
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:26,063
Is there anything else?

357
00:23:27,663 --> 00:23:30,873
Lee Ye Na, is something wrong?

358
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:34,843
I know it's not my business,

359
00:23:34,843 --> 00:23:36,843
but you don't look so well.

360
00:23:36,843 --> 00:23:39,203
You don't know how to read people.

361
00:23:39,203 --> 00:23:40,873
Why do you think so?

362
00:23:40,873 --> 00:23:42,403
Then I have nothing to say.

363
00:23:42,403 --> 00:23:45,323
I'll put this inside in your desk drawer.

364
00:23:52,603 --> 00:23:54,713
 Come to my office. 

365
00:24:31,793 --> 00:24:33,893
Why aren't you coming in?

366
00:24:45,683 --> 00:24:48,333
Did the class president check your application?

367
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:50,763
Yes. I saw her take it, but...

368
00:24:50,763 --> 00:24:51,883
I don't know.

369
00:24:51,883 --> 00:24:54,943
There are two more candidates besides me.

370
00:24:54,943 --> 00:24:56,023
Two more...

371
00:24:56,023 --> 00:24:58,803
Also, no low-status student has ever gotten in.

372
00:24:58,803 --> 00:25:02,143
They act like they care about talent or character,

373
00:25:02,143 --> 00:25:04,133
but it's all about connections.

374
00:25:04,133 --> 00:25:06,453
I'm not surprised, but that's disappointing.

375
00:25:06,453 --> 00:25:08,873
Kids shouldn't be like that already.

376
00:25:08,873 --> 00:25:12,703
All right. Let's focus on our work.

377
00:25:12,703 --> 00:25:16,143
How do we sway the president so Hae Seong gets in?

378
00:25:16,143 --> 00:25:18,243
If you have ideas, speak freely.

379
00:25:18,243 --> 00:25:20,043
Let's go orthodox.

380
00:25:20,043 --> 00:25:22,093
1,000 paper cranes.

381
00:25:22,093 --> 00:25:24,300
There are four of us, so 250 per person.

382
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,553
We have plenty of time by tomorrow.

383
00:25:26,553 --> 00:25:27,893
All right.

384
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:30,493
From now on, don't speak.

385
00:25:31,253 --> 00:25:34,923
Some say, "What is classic is eternal."

386
00:25:34,923 --> 00:25:37,123
Not orthodox, but tradition.

387
00:25:37,123 --> 00:25:38,983
You two dress up like mobsters

388
00:25:38,983 --> 00:25:41,523
and bully the class president.

389
00:25:41,523 --> 00:25:44,303
Then, Hae Seong shows up and beats them up!

390
00:25:48,823 --> 00:25:50,403
Sounds good.

391
00:25:51,043 --> 00:25:52,593
I have no other choice

392
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:55,410
but to use the secret weapon I've been saving.

393
00:25:56,023 --> 00:25:58,103
Secret weapon?

394
00:26:18,073 --> 00:26:21,573
 You must be thirsty. Drink it and eat slowly. 

395
00:26:25,213 --> 00:26:27,403
 What's this? 

396
00:26:29,423 --> 00:26:32,363
 A small considerate gesture from my heart. 

397
00:26:50,493 --> 00:26:55,103
Thanks for the gesture, but I already have water I'm drinking.

398
00:26:55,103 --> 00:26:57,333
Really? I didn't know.

399
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:59,373
Then Yu Jeong can take this.

400
00:27:00,843 --> 00:27:03,643
Or I will drink it. Bye now.

401
00:27:10,453 --> 00:27:12,703
What were you doing just now?

402
00:27:13,843 --> 00:27:16,283
I want to befriend the president but don't know how.

403
00:27:16,283 --> 00:27:17,933
What could be the problem?

404
00:27:17,933 --> 00:27:19,103
The leaf worked.

405
00:27:19,103 --> 00:27:22,733
Have you, by chance, never dated a girl?

406
00:27:23,953 --> 00:27:26,503
If you'll use your face like that, give it to me.

407
00:27:28,073 --> 00:27:32,123
Wow, I don't understand the leaf thing.

408
00:27:32,123 --> 00:27:34,883
I thought he was filming a historical drama.

409
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:38,523
Hae Seong is kind of cute.

410
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:39,943
What?

411
00:27:40,843 --> 00:27:43,373
I heard that Jeong Hae Seong applied for the council.

412
00:27:43,373 --> 00:27:44,683
What are you going to do?

413
00:27:44,683 --> 00:27:47,043
Per my rights as the class president.

414
00:27:53,073 --> 00:27:55,083
   

415
00:27:56,243 --> 00:27:58,713
It worked.

416
00:28:03,193 --> 00:28:05,423
Wow, Jeong Hae Seong!

417
00:28:05,423 --> 00:28:06,943
Hae Seong!

418
00:28:06,943 --> 00:28:09,253
I heard about your antics just now.

419
00:28:09,253 --> 00:28:10,863
You were amazing with Ye Na.

420
00:28:10,863 --> 00:28:14,663
This is what I think. Honestly, the leaf...

421
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:19,763
was a little too much.

422
00:28:19,763 --> 00:28:22,763
Right. You should have consulted me.

423
00:28:22,763 --> 00:28:25,473
You know, once you fall for me, there's no way out.

424
00:28:25,473 --> 00:28:27,453
Hey!

425
00:28:31,273 --> 00:28:33,433
It worked?

426
00:28:33,433 --> 00:28:35,603
Of course. I knew it would.

427
00:28:35,603 --> 00:28:39,223
Your heart counts more than your face.

428
00:28:39,223 --> 00:28:40,913
That's...

429
00:28:40,913 --> 00:28:42,973
oddly not convincing.

430
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:44,403
Liar.

431
00:28:44,403 --> 00:28:48,103
This is a bit shocking, but congratulations...

432
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:50,023
In that spirit...

433
00:28:50,023 --> 00:28:51,253
- the snack bar? 
 - The snack bar?

434
00:28:51,253 --> 00:28:53,653
- Hae Seong's treat! 
 - Treat!

435
00:28:56,663 --> 00:28:57,993
   

436
00:28:57,993 --> 00:29:00,143
   

437
00:29:00,143 --> 00:29:01,353
   

438
00:29:01,353 --> 00:29:03,493
High school...

439
00:29:08,473 --> 00:29:11,023
 Yes, Gyeongsun High School Teachers' Office. 

440
00:29:11,023 --> 00:29:12,373
Hi there.

441
00:29:12,373 --> 00:29:16,563
I'm Oh Su Ah, a homeroom teacher for Seoul Byeongmun High, Year 2, Class 1.

442
00:29:16,563 --> 00:29:18,503
 Oh, my, hello, Ms. Oh! 

443
00:29:18,503 --> 00:29:21,743
 How come Byeongmun High is calling us? 

444
00:29:21,743 --> 00:29:27,553
It's just that I wanted to ask about Jeong Hae Seong, the transfer.

445
00:29:27,553 --> 00:29:30,993
Oh, Hae Seong!

446
00:29:34,483 --> 00:29:38,233
 Good at academics and sports... He was a very popular kid at our school. 

447
00:29:38,233 --> 00:29:40,073
We've been wondering about him.

448
00:29:40,073 --> 00:29:41,933
 Is Hae Seong doing well? 

449
00:29:41,933 --> 00:29:44,363
Oh, yes, of course.

450
00:29:44,363 --> 00:29:46,883
But by any chance, is Hae Seong...

451
00:29:46,883 --> 00:29:49,253
Oh, my, the bell is ringing. I should get to class.

452
00:29:49,253 --> 00:29:51,493
Please take good care of Hae Seong.

453
00:29:51,493 --> 00:29:54,023
Oh, sure. Thank you. Have a good day.

454
00:29:54,023 --> 00:29:57,413
Have a good day. Bye.

455
00:30:07,883 --> 00:30:09,743
That was weird.

456
00:30:09,743 --> 00:30:11,343
Ms. Oh?

457
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,880
   
   

458
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,303
H-How long have you been here?

459
00:30:16,303 --> 00:30:17,333
Just now.

460
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:20,083
I need access to the Student Council room.

461
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:22,053
But you can't sign up for that at this hour.

462
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:23,783
Everyone in the administrative office went home.

463
00:30:23,783 --> 00:30:25,593
Ms. Oh! Over here.

464
00:30:25,593 --> 00:30:27,253
Coming!

465
00:30:27,253 --> 00:30:28,683
Let's do it together tomorrow.

466
00:30:28,683 --> 00:30:31,113
It's the first Student Council meeting anyway.

467
00:30:31,113 --> 00:30:32,613
Okay.

468
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:46,200
   

469
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,510
   

470
00:31:22,163 --> 00:31:24,953
Are you going to keep avoiding me like this?

471
00:31:34,903 --> 00:31:37,803
I won't tell Aunt and Uncle.

472
00:31:37,803 --> 00:31:40,673
But can you tell me why you're acting like this?

473
00:31:40,673 --> 00:31:45,063
Oppa, you care more about the mission than me.

474
00:31:47,013 --> 00:31:49,183
I told you not to come.

475
00:31:49,183 --> 00:31:53,593
I even threatened to blow your cover if you came.

476
00:31:54,683 --> 00:31:56,323
But...

477
00:31:57,843 --> 00:31:59,923
why are you ignoring me?

478
00:31:59,923 --> 00:32:02,963
I'm not ignoring you.

479
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:06,110
- You know, because of the mission– 
 - Fine.

480
00:32:06,773 --> 00:32:09,833
It's already decided so I won't say anymore.

481
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:12,803
But from now on, don't act like you know me.

482
00:32:14,963 --> 00:32:16,903
Yu Jeong...

483
00:32:20,953 --> 00:32:23,263
Congratulations on ranking first place.

484
00:32:43,783 --> 00:32:45,653
What are you staring at?

485
00:32:46,593 --> 00:32:50,033
Just something that's bothering me.

486
00:32:53,733 --> 00:32:55,893
What did you want to talk about?

487
00:32:55,893 --> 00:32:57,733
Why Jeong Hae Seong?

488
00:32:57,733 --> 00:32:59,273
His qualifications, background...

489
00:32:59,273 --> 00:33:01,783
There were better candidates.

490
00:33:01,783 --> 00:33:04,233
I have the right to choose the members.

491
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:08,373
Even if you're VP, I don't need to explain it.

492
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,743
Are the rumors true?

493
00:33:15,273 --> 00:33:18,033
That you're interested in Jeong Hae Seong?

494
00:33:20,483 --> 00:33:22,803
You want my honest answer?

495
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,893
Yes, Team Leader.

496
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,813
 Are you home yet? 

497
00:33:41,813 --> 00:33:44,033
Yes, I just got back.

498
00:33:44,033 --> 00:33:47,123
I think Ms. Oh suspects you.

499
00:33:47,123 --> 00:33:48,003
Why?

500
00:33:48,003 --> 00:33:53,573
Ms. Oh called Haenam to check if you really went to school there.

501
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,713
 We transferred the call and got away, 

502
00:33:55,713 --> 00:33:59,113
 but the fact that she called means danger. 

503
00:33:59,113 --> 00:34:02,663
Don't even cross paths with Ms. Oh at school.

504
00:34:02,663 --> 00:34:04,983
 - Got it?  
 - I'll be careful.

505
00:34:04,983 --> 00:34:07,503
   

506
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:13,463
 Now that you joined the Student Council, move as swiftly as possible. 

507
00:34:13,463 --> 00:34:14,963
   

508
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,283
 Remember to watch out for Ms. Oh. 

509
00:34:29,283 --> 00:34:31,323
 Make sure you avoid her. 

510
00:34:32,373 --> 00:34:34,963
 She's my homeroom teacher and oversees the Student Council. 

511
00:34:34,963 --> 00:34:36,363
 How do I avoid her? 

512
00:34:36,363 --> 00:34:39,243
Come sit down if you're here. What are you doing?

513
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,653
Yes.

514
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,393
Now that we're all here, let's start.

515
00:34:51,393 --> 00:34:55,803
Hello, everyone. I'm Ms. Oh Su Ah, and I will be overseeing the Student Council starting today.

516
00:34:55,803 --> 00:35:00,073
I look forward to working with you so that we can make a good student council.

517
00:35:00,073 --> 00:35:05,513
And here is, as you know, Jeong Hae Seong, who has joined the Student Council today.

518
00:35:06,453 --> 00:35:08,203
I'm Jeong Hae Seong. Thanks for having me.

519
00:35:08,203 --> 00:35:09,923
Applause!

520
00:35:22,713 --> 00:35:25,053
Okay, that's all for this week's meeting.

521
00:35:25,053 --> 00:35:27,203
Great work, everyone.

522
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,513
What are you still doing here?

523
00:35:43,513 --> 00:35:45,553
I'm just looking around since it's my first day.

524
00:35:45,553 --> 00:35:47,383
Why don't you go ahead?

525
00:35:47,383 --> 00:35:50,253
- Make sure to lock up. 
 - Okay.

526
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,483
What are you doing there?

527
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:22,353
Just browsing the Student Council Room. What about you two?

528
00:36:22,353 --> 00:36:23,553
I need to talk to you.

529
00:36:23,553 --> 00:36:26,373
I was waiting outside, but you didn't come out.

530
00:36:26,373 --> 00:36:27,963
Me?

531
00:36:27,963 --> 00:36:31,233
What are you up to today? Let's grab dinner together.

532
00:36:32,193 --> 00:36:33,303
Dinner?

533
00:36:33,303 --> 00:36:36,183
To celebrate your joining the Student Council.

534
00:36:36,183 --> 00:36:38,203
Yu Jeong is coming, too.

535
00:36:40,013 --> 00:36:42,213
You'll come, too, right?

536
00:36:45,963 --> 00:36:48,773
Yes, let's go.

537
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:50,953
Sure, let's...

538
00:36:52,383 --> 00:36:54,020
Aren't we going?

539
00:36:54,843 --> 00:36:56,373
Let's go.

540
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:14,113
Is it okay if I miss the dinner we planned with Hae Seong?

541
00:37:14,113 --> 00:37:16,443
Why, out of the blue?

542
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:20,173
I thought about it, and I don't think I should go.

543
00:37:20,173 --> 00:37:23,563
Plus, I already have dinner plans.

544
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,623
I thought we already decided.

545
00:37:26,623 --> 00:37:29,143
You should've said so earlier.

546
00:37:29,143 --> 00:37:31,253
I was caught off-guard earlier.

547
00:37:31,253 --> 00:37:33,803
I'm sorry for not saying so earlier.

548
00:37:41,033 --> 00:37:43,763
I hate people who change their minds constantly.

549
00:37:43,763 --> 00:37:46,133
It makes you seem shallow.

550
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,593
Make sure you get dolled up later.

551
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:09,713
I warned Hae Seong to beware of Ms. Oh Su Ah.

552
00:38:09,713 --> 00:38:12,333
We should be more careful, too.

553
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:15,273
I feel like she'll continue to be suspicious...

554
00:38:15,273 --> 00:38:18,743
We need to be as careful as possible on our end.

555
00:38:18,743 --> 00:38:20,643
Or...

556
00:38:20,643 --> 00:38:23,773
we eliminate Ms. Oh Su Ah.

557
00:38:24,563 --> 00:38:27,453
Don't say such a thing with a straight face.

558
00:38:27,453 --> 00:38:29,383
You scare me.

559
00:38:31,353 --> 00:38:34,173
- Welcome. 
 - Welcome.

560
00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:40,833
Okay, three large sandwiches,

561
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:45,473
two pizzas, and lemon-lime sodas.

562
00:38:45,473 --> 00:38:46,763
I'll take it to go.

563
00:38:46,763 --> 00:38:49,963
Wow, you must have a huge family.

564
00:38:50,673 --> 00:38:51,923
It's all for me.

565
00:38:51,923 --> 00:38:53,783
It must be a cheat day.

566
00:38:53,783 --> 00:38:55,923
- Let's get to work. 
 - Okay.

567
00:39:16,913 --> 00:39:19,483
Point the camera at the kitchen.

568
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:22,743
 Wow, it's like we're the NIS. 

569
00:39:22,743 --> 00:39:24,983
Focus, Agent Kim Ri An.

570
00:39:24,983 --> 00:39:26,603
Yes.

571
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,933
That's a camera, right?

572
00:39:33,933 --> 00:39:36,573
She's a colleague of Ms. Oh Su Ah.

573
00:39:36,573 --> 00:39:39,403
We really should eliminate her...

574
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,413
I'm joking.

575
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,813
You're good now, right?

576
00:39:55,813 --> 00:39:58,313
There's nothing there.

577
00:39:58,843 --> 00:40:03,443
Don't waste your energy. Focus on your work.

578
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:07,083
It never made sense that he was not a student.

579
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:09,013
I don't think so...

580
00:40:09,013 --> 00:40:10,543
Something's fishy.

581
00:40:10,543 --> 00:40:13,433
Gosh, stop playing National Intelligence.

582
00:40:13,433 --> 00:40:16,403
I'm going home. You go home, too, Ms. Oh.

583
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:31,203
Ms. Oh! Come over here.

584
00:40:31,203 --> 00:40:32,983
Oh, yes.

585
00:40:32,983 --> 00:40:35,033
How's the Student Council doing?

586
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:37,113
Not bad.

587
00:40:38,013 --> 00:40:39,553
It wasn't great, either, but...

588
00:40:39,553 --> 00:40:44,433
I'm sure you know they need special attention.

589
00:40:44,433 --> 00:40:48,703
It must be tough after such a long vacancy, but please try your best.

590
00:40:48,703 --> 00:40:51,783
So there was a teacher in charge before?

591
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:54,433
That's what they say, but I'm not sure.

592
00:40:54,433 --> 00:40:57,993
I have high expectations for you.

593
00:40:57,993 --> 00:41:01,303
I want you to stick around for a very long time.

594
00:41:01,303 --> 00:41:04,323
No time limit.

595
00:41:04,323 --> 00:41:06,163
Can I rely on you?

596
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:07,753
Of course.

597
00:41:07,753 --> 00:41:10,933
- You can entrust me with anything. 
 - Will do.

598
00:41:16,603 --> 00:41:18,113
Here.

599
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,763
Start by dealing with this.

600
00:41:20,763 --> 00:41:23,443
Expense report and budget.

601
00:41:23,443 --> 00:41:26,613
It's not much. Maybe a year's worth?

602
00:41:28,893 --> 00:41:31,823
I need to clock out soon.

603
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:34,153
Of course, you should clock out.

604
00:41:34,153 --> 00:41:36,373
Work on it at home.

605
00:41:37,733 --> 00:41:39,963
Love you.

606
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,573
Love you...

607
00:41:43,573 --> 00:41:46,623
- Goodbye! 
 - Goodbye.

608
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,053
Goodbye.

609
00:41:50,053 --> 00:41:52,393
Yes, goodbye!

610
00:41:52,393 --> 00:41:55,063
Goodbye.

611
00:42:08,553 --> 00:42:11,513
- I'm leaving. 
 - You haven't eaten.

612
00:42:11,513 --> 00:42:13,783
- Dinner with friends. 
 - Stop! Stop!

613
00:42:13,783 --> 00:42:17,183
How's Hae Seong doing at school?

614
00:42:17,183 --> 00:42:18,923
I haven't heard from him at all.

615
00:42:18,923 --> 00:42:23,873
When I ask your dad, he says it's all confidential.

616
00:42:23,873 --> 00:42:27,553
He must've run out of side dishes. Tell him to call me.

617
00:42:27,553 --> 00:42:30,443
Aren't you curious about how I'm doing?

618
00:42:30,443 --> 00:42:35,183
How I'm doing at school, if anything is going on, if I'm struggling...

619
00:42:35,183 --> 00:42:37,503
You're not even curious, are you?

620
00:42:37,503 --> 00:42:39,733
Well, you always...

621
00:42:39,733 --> 00:42:43,323
take good care of yourself...

622
00:42:43,323 --> 00:42:44,953
Is something going on?

623
00:42:44,953 --> 00:42:47,073
Whatever. That was pointless.

624
00:42:47,073 --> 00:42:48,563
I'm leaving.

625
00:42:48,563 --> 00:42:50,213
Yu Jeong...

626
00:42:50,213 --> 00:42:52,163
An Yu Jeong!

627
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,163
This place looks super fancy.

628
00:43:00,163 --> 00:43:02,783
I wonder how much it costs to eat at this place.

629
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,983
I'll pay.

630
00:43:04,983 --> 00:43:08,223
Of course, I don't expect you to pay.

631
00:43:09,343 --> 00:43:13,023
The chef asked me to take special care of you.

632
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,493
May I take your order?

633
00:43:14,493 --> 00:43:16,183
We're waiting for someone. A little later.

634
00:43:16,183 --> 00:43:18,373
Yes. Okay, then.

635
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,563
Where's Hae Seong...

636
00:43:32,013 --> 00:43:34,473
I'm glad we're meeting up outside school.

637
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,813
I'm sorry I'm late.

638
00:43:39,813 --> 00:43:41,433
We haven't ordered yet.

639
00:43:41,433 --> 00:43:42,883
I see.

640
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,053
Did you wait long?

641
00:43:46,053 --> 00:43:47,633
Not really.

642
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,563
Let's order since we're all here.

643
00:43:51,563 --> 00:43:53,003
Yu Jeong, the menu.

644
00:43:53,003 --> 00:43:54,873
Oh, okay.

645
00:43:54,873 --> 00:43:56,783
Excuse me.

646
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,563
How do you feel about being in the Student Council?

647
00:44:04,243 --> 00:44:05,813
I'm not sure yet.

648
00:44:05,813 --> 00:44:07,773
I'm just feeling out the vibe.

649
00:44:08,953 --> 00:44:12,123
Why were you dead set on joining the council?

650
00:44:20,073 --> 00:44:21,553
Hello?

651
00:44:21,553 --> 00:44:23,783
Is Jeong Hae Seong there?

652
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:29,363
Just because. The Student Council is cool.

653
00:44:33,703 --> 00:44:36,243
How did you two become friends?

654
00:44:37,553 --> 00:44:40,213
Is there a reason why people become friends?

655
00:44:42,163 --> 00:44:45,803
Actually, Yu Jeong used to be...

656
00:44:45,803 --> 00:44:48,493
Oh, sorry.

657
00:44:50,883 --> 00:44:53,503
We were in the same class in our first year.

658
00:44:53,503 --> 00:44:56,413
I was unable to adjust to school very well.

659
00:44:56,413 --> 00:44:59,163
Ye Na helped me a lot back then.

660
00:45:01,133 --> 00:45:02,993
I did.

661
00:45:04,153 --> 00:45:06,693
I saw you two talking the other day.

662
00:45:06,693 --> 00:45:08,343
You two look super close.

663
00:45:08,343 --> 00:45:09,973
No, we're not close.

664
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:12,003
You seem more weird this way.

665
00:45:12,003 --> 00:45:14,603
What's wrong with being close?

666
00:45:14,603 --> 00:45:17,713
Anyway, you're not dating, right?

667
00:45:17,713 --> 00:45:19,803
- What? 
 - What?

668
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:21,683
That's good, then.

669
00:45:24,403 --> 00:45:26,363
Yu Jeong.

670
00:45:26,363 --> 00:45:27,733
Could you get me a pair of stockings?

671
00:45:27,733 --> 00:45:30,193
They're ripped at the heel.

672
00:45:39,283 --> 00:45:41,133
Why aren't you going?

673
00:45:42,453 --> 00:45:44,123
Sit down.

674
00:45:52,503 --> 00:45:54,633
What was that sigh?

675
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,933
I'll let it slide this time.

676
00:45:59,733 --> 00:46:02,013
Don't do this again.

677
00:46:02,013 --> 00:46:04,433
Who are you to Yu Jeong?

678
00:46:19,173 --> 00:46:21,133
Let's get going.

679
00:46:41,103 --> 00:46:42,333
I had fun today.

680
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:44,573
Let's do this again.

681
00:46:46,773 --> 00:46:49,383
Congratulations on joining the Student Council.

682
00:46:50,893 --> 00:46:52,343
All right.

683
00:46:53,403 --> 00:46:56,203
Bye. See you at school.

684
00:47:15,793 --> 00:47:19,383
You didn't want me to join the Council because of Ye Na?

685
00:47:20,423 --> 00:47:22,183
Yu Jeong.

686
00:47:24,063 --> 00:47:26,873
- In my opinion, you two... 
 - You're right.

687
00:47:26,873 --> 00:47:28,913
I'm her maid.

688
00:47:29,563 --> 00:47:32,903
I go and get her stockings, and I run coffee errands.

689
00:47:32,903 --> 00:47:34,933
Stuff like that.

690
00:47:37,933 --> 00:47:41,423
I don't qualify, but I got into the Student Council, thanks to Ye Na.

691
00:47:41,423 --> 00:47:46,003
But I have to do everything she tells me to do.

692
00:47:47,403 --> 00:47:49,443
So what?

693
00:47:49,443 --> 00:47:51,453
I'm satisfied.

694
00:47:51,453 --> 00:47:54,903
What are you going to do about it when I am happy?

695
00:48:02,733 --> 00:48:06,963
You must be happy now that you know.

696
00:48:08,463 --> 00:48:11,243
Don't you ever meddle like that again.

697
00:48:11,243 --> 00:48:13,643
Don't you dare preach to me.

698
00:48:13,643 --> 00:48:15,230
Please.

699
00:48:15,883 --> 00:48:18,893
Please stop caring about me.

700
00:49:14,373 --> 00:49:16,483
I'm home.

701
00:49:16,483 --> 00:49:18,953
How was dinner?

702
00:49:18,953 --> 00:49:20,483
It was all right.

703
00:49:20,483 --> 00:49:21,953
How are the Student Council kids?

704
00:49:21,953 --> 00:49:25,453
No one's against Hae Seong joining the council?

705
00:49:25,453 --> 00:49:27,403
No one in particular.

706
00:49:27,403 --> 00:49:30,213
Mom, why did Hae Seong...

707
00:49:30,213 --> 00:49:35,113
Why did I tell you to let him join?

708
00:49:37,193 --> 00:49:40,763
I'm not telling you the reason because...

709
00:49:42,233 --> 00:49:45,630
you don't need to know, Ye Na.

710
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:47,530
I'm sorry, Mom.

711
00:49:48,073 --> 00:49:50,873
Why did you take Yu Jeong there?

712
00:49:53,313 --> 00:49:55,363
You thought I wouldn't find out?

713
00:49:55,363 --> 00:49:56,943
Ye Na.

714
00:49:56,943 --> 00:50:00,813
I know everything about you, Ye Na.

715
00:50:02,153 --> 00:50:04,703
I felt awkward dining alone with him.

716
00:50:04,703 --> 00:50:06,053
And it would spread rumors.

717
00:50:06,053 --> 00:50:09,123
So you weren't trying to discipline her?

718
00:50:09,123 --> 00:50:13,133
Now that there's a new member, and you're not in first place anymore...

719
00:50:13,133 --> 00:50:15,933
To show her who the master is.

720
00:50:17,793 --> 00:50:20,683
Gosh, Ye Na...

721
00:50:22,013 --> 00:50:26,663
I'm so disappointed.

722
00:50:26,663 --> 00:50:30,373
That was so immature.

723
00:50:30,373 --> 00:50:33,693
I'm sorry. I won't do that anymore...

724
00:50:33,693 --> 00:50:37,373
It would be better to kick her out of the school.

725
00:50:40,923 --> 00:50:45,603
When a pet dog misbehaves,

726
00:50:48,143 --> 00:50:51,190
it's best to get rid of the dog.

727
00:50:51,833 --> 00:50:57,313
One day, it'll think it's a person.

728
00:50:58,753 --> 00:51:00,493
Ye Na...

729
00:51:02,093 --> 00:51:03,950
Ye Na.

730
00:51:04,473 --> 00:51:07,133
My beautiful Ye Na...

731
00:51:08,993 --> 00:51:11,700
Promise me one thing.

732
00:51:12,273 --> 00:51:19,870
Don't you ever let anyone steal your spot ever again.

733
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:23,633
Promise?

734
00:51:36,303 --> 00:51:41,943
   

735
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,430
   

736
00:54:18,673 --> 00:54:21,870
   

737
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:24,060
   

738
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,983
Somebody knows about me.

739
00:54:25,983 --> 00:54:27,843
The timing when I received this letter.

740
00:54:27,843 --> 00:54:31,163
It proves that they knew where I was and what I was doing.

741
00:54:31,163 --> 00:54:33,853
So they're watching you?

742
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:38,613
Could the mission intel have been breached?

743
00:54:38,613 --> 00:54:42,143
Even the higher-ups don't know about this mission.

744
00:54:42,143 --> 00:54:46,823
A leak would have had to come from down below, not up.

745
00:54:49,633 --> 00:54:52,733
What do you think you're doing?

746
00:54:52,733 --> 00:54:53,833
I'm sorry.

747
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:57,903
Figure out why they approached you.

748
00:55:00,453 --> 00:55:01,983
Go.

749
00:55:22,743 --> 00:55:24,043
Yes, Director.

750
00:55:24,043 --> 00:55:28,093
Take x-rays of Byeongmun High staff. Right now.

751
00:55:40,283 --> 00:55:42,150
Here.

752
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:45,113
You should take care of your health, at least.

753
00:55:45,113 --> 00:55:47,300
Wow...

754
00:55:48,043 --> 00:55:50,623
Is there anyone you suspect?

755
00:55:50,623 --> 00:55:52,643
The one who sent you the message.

756
00:55:54,783 --> 00:55:57,123
We better find them soon.

757
00:55:57,123 --> 00:55:59,923
We might not be able to continue the mission.

758
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:02,383
I'll check the CCTVs at school tomorrow.

759
00:56:02,383 --> 00:56:04,973
Please verify it with Forensics in the meantime.

760
00:56:07,013 --> 00:56:10,063
Just wait till we catch this bastard.

761
00:56:11,573 --> 00:56:15,063
Hey, remember to smile at times like this.

762
00:56:15,063 --> 00:56:17,763
It's good to smile during tough times.

763
00:56:23,473 --> 00:56:25,633
Also, beware.

764
00:56:27,353 --> 00:56:31,320
Look into it, but watch out for yourself.

765
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,063
If you get hurt,

766
00:56:33,063 --> 00:56:35,973
I won't be able to face your dad

767
00:56:35,973 --> 00:56:38,863
when we eventually find him.

768
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,503
Will do.

769
00:56:58,763 --> 00:57:02,223
   

770
00:57:09,023 --> 00:57:10,403
   

771
00:57:10,403 --> 00:57:12,423
   

772
00:57:21,433 --> 00:57:23,383
What's wrong?

773
00:57:30,873 --> 00:57:35,233
This is against the rules, but I'll show it to you since you're on the council.

774
00:57:35,233 --> 00:57:37,103
Thank you.

775
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,603
   

776
00:57:39,603 --> 00:57:41,413
Huh? What's going on?

777
00:57:41,413 --> 00:57:43,563
Why is this empty?

778
00:57:43,563 --> 00:57:45,730
Mr. Kim, where are all the video files?

779
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:46,620
   

780
00:57:46,623 --> 00:57:48,103
Where did they all go?

781
00:57:48,103 --> 00:57:49,943
I'm not sure.

782
00:57:49,943 --> 00:57:53,083
Is it because yesterday was server maintenance?

783
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:55,223
But still...

784
00:58:10,493 --> 00:58:13,973
I took care of the video files without a hitch.

785
00:58:13,973 --> 00:58:16,183
Good work.

786
00:58:17,633 --> 00:58:20,343
What do you think, Principal?

787
00:58:20,343 --> 00:58:22,523
Why do you think he did that?

788
00:58:22,523 --> 00:58:25,903
Perhaps he wants something from Jeong Hae Seong,

789
00:58:25,903 --> 00:58:29,263
or maybe he needs his help.

790
00:58:29,263 --> 00:58:31,483
Or both.

791
00:58:33,933 --> 00:58:36,423
Either scenario...

792
00:58:36,423 --> 00:58:38,453
is not great.

793
00:58:40,153 --> 00:58:42,573
I'm so curious.

794
00:58:43,293 --> 00:58:45,303
I wonder...

795
00:58:46,223 --> 00:58:49,343
how much he knows.

796
00:59:01,223 --> 00:59:04,163
Yesterday happened to be server maintenance.

797
00:59:04,163 --> 00:59:06,713
What a strange coincidence.

798
00:59:09,433 --> 00:59:11,793
Not much luck on my end, either.

799
00:59:11,793 --> 00:59:14,503
Not a hint of fingerprint or DNA on the letter.

800
00:59:14,503 --> 00:59:16,653
Who could it be?

801
00:59:17,513 --> 00:59:21,513
I strongly sense they deleted the CCTV files...

802
00:59:21,513 --> 00:59:25,663
The person who sent you the letter or their collaborator.

803
00:59:25,663 --> 00:59:29,843
An internal staff member who has access to or

804
00:59:29,843 --> 00:59:32,593
someone who wants their identity to stay hidden.

805
00:59:32,593 --> 00:59:35,043
Let's not jump to conclusions until we're sure.

806
00:59:35,043 --> 00:59:38,083
It could really have been server maintenance.

807
00:59:38,083 --> 00:59:43,253
 They must now know you checked the CCTVs, if they're internal staff. 

808
00:59:43,253 --> 00:59:45,233
Go home early today.

809
00:59:45,233 --> 00:59:46,703
Okay.

810
00:59:49,013 --> 00:59:52,863
Expense reports are endless.

811
00:59:52,863 --> 00:59:54,723
Thanks for your help.

812
00:59:54,723 --> 00:59:57,453
No, I enjoy it.

813
00:59:57,453 --> 00:59:58,623
You enjoy it?

814
00:59:58,623 --> 00:59:59,893
Pardon?

815
01:00:00,543 --> 01:00:04,803
I just love numbers. Love numbers.

816
01:00:04,803 --> 01:00:06,833
Of course, you're a math teacher.

817
01:00:06,833 --> 01:00:09,513
No, no big deal.

818
01:00:10,413 --> 01:00:13,543
Gosh, reeks of mold.

819
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:16,143
They don't take care of this place.

820
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:18,803
How's Hae Seong?

821
01:00:19,403 --> 01:00:20,763
- Hae Seong? 
 - Yes.

822
01:00:20,763 --> 01:00:25,503
Ms. Ri An said you didn't think Hae Seong was a student.

823
01:00:26,933 --> 01:00:30,023
Of course, she had to talk about it.

824
01:00:32,713 --> 01:00:34,753
It's a secret.

825
01:00:38,653 --> 01:00:40,433
There we go.

826
01:00:45,583 --> 01:00:48,063
I think we're done. Let's go.

827
01:00:48,063 --> 01:00:49,603
Okay.

828
01:00:51,503 --> 01:00:53,513
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

829
01:00:59,623 --> 01:01:03,003
   

830
01:01:17,233 --> 01:01:20,613
   

831
01:01:27,203 --> 01:01:28,993
   

832
01:01:31,403 --> 01:01:32,713
Hello?

833
01:01:32,713 --> 01:01:34,613
 Agent Jeong Hae Seong. 

834
01:01:38,343 --> 01:01:40,353
 Long time no talk. 

835
01:01:43,123 --> 01:01:45,953
You remember my voice, right?

836
01:01:45,953 --> 01:01:47,783
 You won't tell the school, right? 

837
01:01:47,783 --> 01:01:50,263
 Make sure you keep it a secret. 

838
01:01:50,263 --> 01:01:53,763
 No. Don't record. 

839
01:01:55,923 --> 01:01:58,093
Did you send me the letter?

840
01:01:58,093 --> 01:02:01,623
We have a lot to discuss. Why don't we talk in person?

841
01:02:01,623 --> 01:02:03,303
Come to the school rooftop.

842
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:06,573
I need to speak to you privately, Agent.

843
01:02:06,573 --> 01:02:08,723
Be sure to come alone.

844
01:02:33,743 --> 01:02:35,663
   

845
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:37,340
   

846
01:03:43,533 --> 01:03:47,250
 The student who killed her friend was found dead. 

847
01:03:47,843 --> 01:03:50,763
 Since then, a rumor has spread. 

848
01:03:52,533 --> 01:03:57,463
 When the clock strikes, don't be at school. 

849
01:04:02,933 --> 01:04:05,503
 A pair of red eyes 

850
01:04:05,503 --> 01:04:09,173
 will come to get you. 

851
01:05:23,513 --> 01:05:25,403
 Dad! 

852
01:05:25,403 --> 01:05:27,513
 You need to take this with you. 

853
01:05:28,233 --> 01:05:30,143
 Thank you, Son. 

854
01:05:47,973 --> 01:05:52,833
   

855
01:05:58,933 --> 01:06:00,863
 Watch out! 

856
01:06:06,103 --> 01:06:07,813
 Are you okay? 

857
01:06:10,123 --> 01:06:12,253
 Dad! 

858
01:06:12,253 --> 01:06:14,343
 Bong Ja, are you okay? 

859
01:06:14,953 --> 01:06:16,913
 Oh, you're Bong Ja. 

860
01:06:16,913 --> 01:06:19,053
 Shi Hyeon told me a lot about you. 

861
01:06:19,053 --> 01:06:20,743
 When did I say anything? 

862
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:22,463
 Hello. 

863
01:06:22,463 --> 01:06:24,253
 Shi Hyeon and I are getting something yummy. 

864
01:06:24,253 --> 01:06:25,920
 Want to come? 

865
01:06:26,493 --> 01:06:28,383
 Let's go together. 

866
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:34,560
   

867
01:06:34,563 --> 01:06:36,263
   

868
01:06:38,573 --> 01:06:40,473
Ms. Oh.

869
01:06:46,473 --> 01:06:48,483
Do you know him?

870
01:06:49,850 --> 01:06:56,970

 Why is this notebook at Byeongmun High? 

880
01:07:24,363 --> 01:07:25,893
 I had no choice. 

881
01:07:25,893 --> 01:07:28,313
 He's just so cocky. 

882
01:07:28,313 --> 01:07:29,993
 Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon's notebook. 

883
01:07:29,993 --> 01:07:32,063
 This will help Jeong Hae Seong greatly. 

884
01:07:32,063 --> 01:07:34,143
 Nothing's going on between you and Ms. Oh, right? 

885
01:07:34,143 --> 01:07:35,813
 You said you'd help me. How could you... 

886
01:07:35,813 --> 01:07:37,993
 - Hey! 
 - What is this? 

887
01:07:37,993 --> 01:07:40,263
 This might put you in jeopardy. 

888
01:07:40,263 --> 01:07:43,853
 I can't tell what he's thinking or what he knows. 

889
01:07:43,853 --> 01:07:45,873
 Be honest with me. 

890
01:07:45,873 --> 01:07:48,003
 Did you know about this, Team Leader? 

891
01:07:48,003 --> 01:07:50,393
 - Hae Seong... 
 - I can't do this anymore. 

892
01:07:50,393 --> 01:07:51,393
 Let me take a break. 

893
01:07:51,393 --> 01:07:54,403
♫  What you gonna do?  ♫

894
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:56,653
