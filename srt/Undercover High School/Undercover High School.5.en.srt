(Byeongmun High School)

00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,690
Someone needs...

17
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,630
to explain.

18
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,399
Surprise!

19
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,199
Surprise!

20
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,310
Hae Seong!

21
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,080
Gosh, guys. You startled me.

22
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,880
Surprise.

23
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,650
I guess this is our first time meeting.

24
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,980
You see,

25
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,650
I'm Hae Seong's boss at his part-time job.

26
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,920
And I'm an employee there.

27
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,690
I see.

28
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,530
Hello.

29
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,159
I'm Oh Su A, Hae Seong's homeroom teacher.

30
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,830
I see.

31
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,199
- And him? - He's also an employee,

32
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,369
but don't mind him and his narcolepsy.

33
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,969
Bury him under the covers.

34
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,610
There.

35
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,910
Why are people from his part-time job even here?

36
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,479
Sorry?

37
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,150
This doesn't seem normal if you ask me.

38
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,120
That you're here,

39
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,820
that you were in the closet,

40
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,990
and that you're wearing shoes.

41
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,030
Sorry. I'm not trying to be suspicious.

42
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,900
But you said this was a surprise...

43
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,309
even though Hae Seong was home all day.

44
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,110
Does she think she's Sherlock Holmes?

45
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,479
Hae Seong, I think I'm going to need...

46
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,110
answers to my questions.

47
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,790
Well, you see... Actually...

48
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,029
- Hae Seong! - Hae Seong!

49
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,029
Ms. Oh, how could you?

50
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,259
How could you be so cruel to someone sick?

51
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,369
Hae Seong, stay with me.

52
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,540
You can't die!

53
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,870
Don't you die.

54
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,670
Hae Seong!

55
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,620
Hae Seong, don't die.

56
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,349
Hold on. Hae Seong?

57
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,590
Don't!

58
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,690
You're one cruel lady.

59
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,560
But I... Hold on.

60
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,100
Are you all right? Excuse me.

61
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,950
Time's up. Hands on head.

62
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,380
Those in the back will collect the answer sheet.

63
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,599
Good work on the exam.

64
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,639
I'll see you at the end of school.

65
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,269
- Sure. Bye. - Bye.

66
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,309
How did you do?

67
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,310
What was your answer to question number 17?

68
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,410
Mi Jeong.

69
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,619
I've been thinking about us for the past few days.

70
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,920
Why are you out here?

71
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,190
Mi Jeong, these past few days...

72
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,030
Mi Jeong, these past few days,

73
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,829
I thought deeply about...

74
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,829
- my feelings for you. - What?

75
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,500
That kiss in the closet.

76
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,100
It was a first.

77
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,910
It shocked me to the core like never before.

78
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,810
Agent Park... Actually, no.

79
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,610
As of this moment, I'll see you as a peer.

80
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,650
You are a sinner who stole my lips.

81
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,890
If love were a crime,

82
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,860
you'd be sentenced to life in prison.

83
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,889
I've been giving you leeway only because you're my junior,

84
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,100
but this is how you repay me? What was that?

85
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,199
Go Yeong Hun.

86
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,569
Who do you think you are speaking to me...

87
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,810
like I'm one of your classmates?

88
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,079
Address me in that sense again,

89
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,580
and I'll crack your skull open. Got it?

90
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,780
Got it?

91
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,490
I'll dismiss what you just said.

92
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,630
Let's go eat.

93
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Move it!

94
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,540
There are layers to her.

95
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,910
She's even more mesmerizing.

96
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,310
What's taking them so long?

97
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,880
- Tell me about it. - Let's have a glass.

98
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,520
You were already here.

99
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,220
- Where's Yeong Hun? - Behind you.

100
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,160
Right. Let's eat before the meat burns.

101
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,830
Enjoy, Mi Jeong.

102
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,300
I mean, Agent Park.

103
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,040
Why did you address her casually but in an awkward manner?

104
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,009
- Sorry? - Something happened, didn't it?

105
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,040
- No. - Yes.

106
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,610
Nothing happened, sir. Let's move on.

107
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,550
Did you do well on your midterms?

108
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,280
Don't ask him that.

109
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,150
I asked Yu Jeong today and got my ears chewed off.

110
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,019
Anyway, it was rough.

111
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,420
You also had it rough with the praying...

112
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,690
and such.

113
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,930
Here.

114
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,439
All right. This first glass is for us all.

115
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,110
- Good job, guys. - Good job.

116
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,639
Hae Seong.

117
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,310
Did anything happen between you and Ms. Oh since that day?

118
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,880
Not really.

119
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,550
I thought about it and...

120
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,189
she must find it suspicious.

121
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,759
Isn't it obvious?

122
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,189
You all fell out of my closet. That's more than chaotic.

123
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,430
You actually sound like a teenager now.

124
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,600
Stop it with that language. It's not you.

125
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,400
Anyway, we need to be more careful.

126
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,209
She's hard to predict which is why I'm mindful of her.

127
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,740
For the sake of this mission, I should keep my distance...

128
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,450
Why did he suddenly stop talking?

129
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,559
He has the face of a suspect...

130
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,989
who's for real guilty about something.

131
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,059
As if.

132
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,430
Hurry and eat. The boss is buying.

133
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,330
Go on.

134
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,220
What about Hae Seong?

135
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,690
It's more than just suspicious.

136
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,960
There could be a chance he isn't a student.

137
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,320
Oh, dear.

138
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,390
The suspicious man I saw in the old building.

139
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,330
He looked...

140
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,970
so much like Jeong Hae Seong.

141
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,109
That Mr. Gu he dragged...

142
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,170
to the Anti-School Bullying Committee.

143
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,440
How could a high school student...

144
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,810
have subdued a thug?

145
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,250
And what the weirdest was...

146
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,160
What a bunch of weirdos.

147
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,890
Darn it.

148
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,800
Is that 7665?

149
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,350
(Jeong Hae Seong)

150
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,050
That makes no sense.

151
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,780
How can a high school student drive a car?

152
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,390
And those three in that rooftop unit.

153
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,820
They definitely smell of something.

154
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,459
He must've repeated a few years...

155
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,160
and has a fake driver's license.

156
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,730
You said he openly had drinks.

157
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,670
His student record says he's 17.

158
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,010
Darn it, what's his deal?

159
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,510
My head's throbbing.

160
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,739
Having too many doubts is also a sickness.

161
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,149
Enough with the nonsense and drink.

162
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,150
Midterms are over.

163
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,680
Cheers.

164
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,690
He's not that guy, is he?

165
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,520
He is?

166
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,090
Who is she talking about?

167
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,869
Come on. Not again.

168
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,570
Don't be like this.

169
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,110
- What the... - Come on.

170
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,640
What is this woman doing here?

171
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,980
Hey.

172
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,910
Get a grip on yourself.

173
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,720
Excuse me.

174
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,620
You're at the wrong house, so run along.

175
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,760
You seem to be plastered. Are you all right?

176
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,160
My gosh.

177
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,929
Mom, did you catch a cold?

178
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:22,930
Your mom?

179
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,500
I'm not your mom.

180
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,340
You have the wrong house... Are you kidding me?

181
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,970
Mom, I love you.

182
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,970
I love you.

183
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,310
And thanks.

184
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,810
Su A is drunk.

185
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,510
Please let me in.

186
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,750
For your cute daughter.

187
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,649
- Mom, are you upset? - What on earth?

188
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,419
- Please don't be upset. - Why is she here?

189
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,020
What are you doing at someone else's house?

190
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,729
Have you lost your mind?

191
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,259
Get over here.

192
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,329
What a huge inconvenience.

193
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,559
- Oh, no. - Mom, someone's taking me.

194
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,030
What? What was that?

195
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,930
- Mom, it's bad. - What's wrong?

196
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,940
My mom won't open the gate.

197
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,240
Cut the nonsense and get over here.

198
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,979
- Hold on. You can't do this. - Come here.

199
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,679
Hold on. Goodness, I'm so sorry.

200
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,509
I'm afraid she drank a bit too much.

201
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,810
She's harmless though.

202
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,019
- Mom... - I'm so sorry.

203
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,849
- Open the gate. - Walk in a straight line.

204
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,389
- Good night, then. - Walk.

205
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,390
- Sure. - Go.

206
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,499
Where's your head at?

207
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,299
- But... - Unbelievable.

208
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,529
- My gosh. - Goodness.

209
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,339
Why are you pulling my arm?

210
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,300
Are you kidding me?

211
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,309
- You'll be the death of me. - Do better, okay?

212
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,579
- Mom! - Quiet!

213
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,210
Keep it down.

214
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,050
Please! What is it?

215
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,580
What now?

216
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,749
What has gotten into you?

217
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,789
You're killing me.

218
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,020
- Unbelievable. - My goodness.

219
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,959
You're making my life twice as hard.

220
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,859
- I'm exhausted. - Will you just...

221
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,660
- Does she live around here? - How many stairs are there?

222
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,430
Get in.

223
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:03,459
- Where? - Get in.

224
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,799
- Here? - Yes.

225
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,100
- Hello! - You've got to be kidding me.

226
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,800
This is bad.

227
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,949
Hey, don't our midterm scores come out today?

228
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,389
Yes. I think I moved up a few ranks this time.

229
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,420
How high do you think you ranked?

230
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,619
Tenth.

231
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,889
- Tenth? - Yes.

232
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,129
- Lucky you. - What do I ask from my dad?

233
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,890
- The purse that just came out. - A purse?

234
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,500
- Maybe... - Quiet, class!

235
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,670
The bell rang ages ago, you brats.

236
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,000
Today,

237
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,140
I have the results of your midterms which you were dying to get.

238
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,979
Groaning won't change the reality.

239
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,079
Come up as I call your names.

240
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,710
- Kang Gi Yeong. - Here.

241
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,720
An Yu Jeong.

242
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,020
Lee Ye Na.

243
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,660
Jeong Hae Seong.

244
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,270
Good job.

245
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
Oh Se Yeon.

246
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,020
How high did you rank?

247
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,860
Lee Dong Min.

248
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,930
(Class 1, Number 21, Jeong Hae Seong)

249
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,670
(Class 1, Number 21, Jeong Hae Seong)

250
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,250
Here we go.

251
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,790
It's me. How did it go?

252
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,790
(Jeong Hae Seong)

253
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,700
- I think he failed. - You!

254
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,770
Agent Jeong, report your grades.

255
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,470
It's done.

256
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,580
I did it.

257
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,680
I ranked tenth in school!

258
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:37,250
- Yes! - Nice!

259
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,620
He did it!

260
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:44,960
What the...

261
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,830
I'm proud of you, Hae Seong.

262
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,400
I knew you'd do it.

263
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,600
Good job. Excellent work.

264
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,270
(Rank in school: 10th)

265
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,210
By the way,

266
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,740
how high did Yu Jeong rank?

267
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,310
What? Yu Jeong?

268
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,450
You have no idea how shocked I was.

269
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,249
Do you know what her rank is?

270
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,550
(Report Card)

271
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,060
I bet this is the first time Ye Na got crushed.

272
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,060
She sits in front of us. Read the room, will you?

273
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,760
Yu Jeong, good job on ranking first in school.

274
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,700
Unbelievable.

275
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,730
(Rank in school: 2nd)

276
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,240
Congratulations. You finally got to beat me.

277
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,009
Well, I got lucky.

278
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,680
A lot showed up from where I studied.

279
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,310
Luck is a part of one's ability.

280
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,880
You wait and see. I won't lose next time.

281
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,220
Right.

282
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,890
Did you see that?

283
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,560
(The 24th Night for Byeongmunites, 2025)

284
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,030
I heard Lee Ye Na lost to Yu Jeong.

285
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,329
Dozens of private lessons can only get you so far.

286
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,700
Have An Yu Jeong now take the reins!

287
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,200
She's been acting like a queen for being the chairwoman's daughter.

288
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,540
What the... No!

289
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,620
Did you read them all?

290
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,060
Have I been acting like a queen?

291
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,660
I'll be careful.

292
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,260
Ye Na, wait.

293
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,230
Invite me into that chatroom.

294
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,040
What a blast.

295
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,570
Wait, what? The chatroom?

296
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,510
Darn it.

297
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,750
Shoot.

298
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,880
Darn it!

299
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,720
When will she get off that high horse?

300
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,890
(Jeong Hae Seong)

301
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,869
(Attending high school but not actually a student)

302
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,670
(No matches found)

303
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,350
What could be troubling you?

304
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,250
Goodness.

305
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,380
One of my students has been a handful.

306
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,989
- Your back... - What?

307
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,889
Is it better now?

308
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,860
A few pain relief patches did wonders.

309
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,389
Your class starts soon. You should head inside.

310
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,560
Right, of course. I'll get going, then.

311
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,870
How long has he been behind me?

312
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:24,409
I apologize. I should've come by sooner to greet you.

313
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,510
It took me too long.

314
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:31,380
I know better than anyone that you're a busy woman.

315
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,519
You have a lot on your plate...

316
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,090
with Education City and all.

317
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,560
As you know,

318
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,960
there's no hope left for public education in Korea.

319
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,929
Low-grade equalized education...

320
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,400
has become a nuisance to students...

321
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,900
and their parents for far too long.

322
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,770
All I want is to provide...

323
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,509
an education that is perfect for our children.

324
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,479
Chief Editor Yoon,

325
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,910
it might seem absurd in your eyes,

326
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:02,180
but establishing a prestigious global private school...

327
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,079
and contributing to this nation's education...

328
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,420
is truly a dream of mine.

329
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,590
You must be telling me your grand plan...

330
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,530
in the hopes of me writing about it.

331
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,529
To be honest,

332
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:19,299
I have thoroughly read every piece of material...

333
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,870
you have ever written.

334
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,769
Lifting of the greenbelt...

335
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,370
regarding the educational industry in Seongju,

336
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,509
Byeongmun Foundation having first rights to negotiate,

337
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:30,480
and many other suspicions surrounding Education City.

338
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,250
I was most impressed with the piece you wrote on me.

339
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,020
The truth is what I seek.

340
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,450
I see.

341
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,390
By any chance,

342
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,730
if this was to persuade me in any way,

343
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,160
please think again.

344
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,100
But the truth...

345
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:55,570
isn't found but made.

346
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:00,710
I make what I want as the truth.

347
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,180
Join me.

348
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,690
You will receive...

349
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,920
whatever you desire and more.

350
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,060
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

351
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,060
Chief Editor Yoon.

352
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,370
Goodness, my wrist.

353
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,640
If you don't take what I'm offering now,

354
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,210
my next offer will be bitter.

355
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,480
Sit.

356
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,900
Such nuisances.

357
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,540
Chief Editor Yoon of Seojin Daily.

358
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,109
Do a deep dive on him.

359
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,450
Yes, ma'am.

360
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,020
Don't the midterm scores come out today?

361
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,420
It seems as though Jeong Hae Seong...

362
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,989
will easily join the student council.

363
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,060
Really?

364
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,890
No way.

365
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,860
He's smart up top as well?

366
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,830
Does that deserve a prize or something?

367
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,970
- However, Ms. Seo... - Yes?

368
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,640
Ye Na's grades...

369
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,710
There's a change in her rank.

370
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,180
Here.

371
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,980
(Report Card)

372
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,890
(Rank in class: 2nd, Rank in school: 2nd)

373
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,260
Head to the school.

374
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,229
I can't believe you ranked tenth in school.

375
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,299
I thought you didn't care about your grades. Congrats.

376
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,770
Thanks. You guys can do it too.

377
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,670
Lee Ye Na.

378
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,510
Ye Na?

379
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,310
I heard you ranked second in school. Congrats.

380
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,340
And here. I'm applying to join the student council.

381
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,550
Put it on my desk.

382
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,119
I was going to, but they said I should give it to you in person.

383
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,150
Are you deaf? Put it on my desk!

384
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:30,220
- What was that? - Did you hear that?

385
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:33,890
You're done, right?

386
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,660
Lee Ye Na, is something up?

387
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,700
It's not my concern, but you don't look too good.

388
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,240
Reading people must not be your strong suit.

389
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,010
I'm doing just fine.

390
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,780
If you say so.

391
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,180
I'll leave it in your desk drawer.

392
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,490
(Mom)

393
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,490
My office.

394
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,630
Why didn't you come in?

395
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,580
Did the student council president check your application?

396
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,910
Yes, I saw her take it.

397
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,450
But who knows? There were two other applicants.

398
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,819
Two more?

399
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,050
And a disadvantaged student has never joined before.

400
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:10,520
They say they choose based on skill sets and personalities,

401
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,460
but connections are what get you in.

402
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,960
I can't say I'm surprised, but it sure is a bummer.

403
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,960
They're too young to be discriminating like that.

404
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,400
Well, let's focus on our task for now.

405
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,870
How can we win over the student council president...

406
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,540
so that Hae Seong will be picked?

407
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,340
Lay out your ideas freely.

408
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:28,440
I suggest a traditional approach...

409
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,210
with 1,000 paper cranes.

410
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:33,109
There are 4 of us, so we'll fold 250 each.

411
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,750
We can do it by tomorrow.

412
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,250
Right.

413
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,380
I'm revoking your right to speak.

414
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:43,290
They say that classics last forever.

415
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:45,560
Not traditional but classic.

416
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,589
You'll dress up as thugs...

417
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,900
and harass the student council president.

418
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,429
That's when...

419
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:55,500
Agent Jeong will enter the picture and be her hero!

420
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,570
I like it.

421
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,970
I guess I have no choice...

422
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,280
but to play the ace up my sleeve.

423
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,880
The ace up your sleeve?

424
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:29,340
You must be thirsty. Sip on it as you eat.

425
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,210
What the heck is this?

426
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,180
That's me being considerate.

427
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,900
I appreciate the gesture, but no thanks.

428
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,140
I have my own water.

429
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:06,039
Really? I didn't know that.

430
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,170
Have it instead, Yu Jeong.

431
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,480
I'll have it myself. See you.

432
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,350
What the heck was that?

433
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,860
I need to get close to her, but I don't know how.

434
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,360
What could be the issue?

435
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:27,929
Wasn't the leaf a nice touch?

436
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:30,560
Have you never had a girlfriend before?

437
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,330
Give me that face if you're going to waste it.

438
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:39,810
That leaf is something I'll never get.

439
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:42,680
Was he filming a period drama?

440
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,580
I found his dorky side to be adorable.

441
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,380
What?

442
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,780
I heard Hae Seong handed in his application.

443
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,190
What will you do about it?

444
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:54,790
I'll exercise my right as student council president.

(Newest student council member: Grade 11, Class 1, Jeong Hae Seong)

447
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,970
- Go, Jeong Hae Seong. - Hey, Hae Seong.

448
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,740
I just heard about your atrocious act.

449
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,250
You embarrassed yourself in front of Ye Na.

450
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,809
This is what I think.

451
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,820
Anyone would agree that a leaf...

452
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,850
It's a bit too stupid.

453
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:31,489
You should've come to me for advice.

454
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,859
I may not seem like it,

455
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,330
but women find me irresistible... No way!

456
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,169
How was this even possible?

457
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,700
I knew it'd work.

458
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:47,570
How sincere you are matters more than one's looks.

459
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,040
For some reason,

460
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:50,840
that doesn't sound right.

461
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,710
The arrogance.

462
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,320

How may we help you?

477
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,920
Oh, I called...

478
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,349
to ask you about...

479
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,920
Jeong Hae Seong, the student who transferred from your school.

480
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,520
Hae Seong?

481
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,699
He got good grades and was athletic too.

482
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,099
He was very popular here.

483
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,829
I wanted to know how he was doing. Thank you for calling.

484

Hae Seong is doing well, right?

485
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,170
Of course, he is.

486
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:55,639
By the way, did Hae Seong ever...

487
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,810
Oh, the bell is ringing. I've got a class to teach.

488

Please look kindly upon Hae Seong.

489

Really?

541
00:33:56,881 --> 00:33:59,549
She called Haenam to check with the school...

we should move things along as quickly as possible.

550
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:23,610
(Jeong Hae Seong)

551
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,260
Be really careful around Oh Su A.

552
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,120
Avoid her as much as possible.

553
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,360
She's my homeroom teacher and the council's advising teacher.

554
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,900
How am I supposed to avoid her?

555
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,630
Why are you standing there? Take a seat.

556
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,030
Okay.

557
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,950
All right. Everyone's here, so let's get started.

558
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,110
It's nice to meet all of you.

559
00:35:01,111 --> 00:35:04,450
I'm Oh Su A, the advising teacher for the council starting today.

560
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,019
I'll do my best to help you guys and work with you...

561
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,250
to further improve our student council.

562
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,919
And this is... You all know him already.

563
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,160
Meet Jeong Hae Seong, a new student council member.

564
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,959
I'm Jeong Hae Seong. Nice to meet you all.

565
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,960
Applause!

566
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,849
All right. That's it for this week's meeting.

567
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,480
- Good work, all of you. - Thank you.

568
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:49,260
(Byeongmun High School)

569
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,330
Why are you still here?

570
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,800
It's my first day. I want to take a look around.

571
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,470
You can get going.

572
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,470
Lock the door when you leave.

573
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,770
Of course.

574
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,370
What are you doing there?

575
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,540
I was just checking out the room. And you two?

576
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,240
We wanted to talk to you.

577
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,740
We waited outside, but you didn't come out.

578
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,110
Me?

579
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:39,010
Are you busy today? Let's have dinner together.

580
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:41,950
Dinner?

581
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,520
Let's celebrate you joining the council.

582
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,220
- Yu Jeong is coming too. - What?

583
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,990
You'll come with us, right?

584
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:56,090
Yes, let's go together.

585
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,830
All right, we'll do that.

586
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,200
Aren't you leaving too?

587
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,300
Yes, let's go.

588
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,719
You know, about having dinner with Hae Seong later.

589
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,350
Can I pass on that?

590
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:23,990
Why, all of a sudden?

591
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,330
I realized it'd be better for you guys to go without me.

592
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:31,530
Also, I have plans for the evening.

593
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,870
Didn't we already say we'd all go together?

594
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:36,840
You should've told us earlier.

595
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:39,670
It was sudden, so I was too flustered.

596
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,540
I'm sorry for not telling you earlier.

597
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,620
I don't like people who change their minds easily.

598
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,820
It's hard to take them seriously.

599
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,360
Wear something nice later.

600
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:18,010
I sternly warned Hae Seong to be careful around Oh Su A,

601
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,880
so let's try to be more careful too.

602
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,350
My gut tells me that she'll keep on suspecting him.

603
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,649
- Why, you... - We should...

604
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:26,750
just be really careful. That's the only thing we can do.

605
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,620
Or...

606
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,590
we could get rid of Oh Su A.

607
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,660
Don't say stuff like that while looking so serious.

608
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,300
You look scary.

609
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:42,000
- Hello. - Hello, come on in.

610
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:48,670
I'll take three large sandwiches...

611
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,610
and two whole pizzas.

612
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,210
The lemon-lime flavoured soda too.

613
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,310
All to go, please.

614
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,680
Oh, you must have a big family.

615
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,750
- They're all for me. - I see. It must be your cheat day.

616
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,420
- Let's get it ready. - Okay.

617
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,280
Show me the kitchen.

618
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,720
Hey, I feel like we're NIS agents.

619
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,719
Focus, Agent Kim Ri An.

620
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,750
Yes, ma'am.

621
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,360
That's a camera, right?

622
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,330
She works with Oh Su A.

623
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,170
I told you. We should just get rid of her.

624
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,540
Just kidding.

625
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,280
Happy now?

626
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,180
I didn't see anything suspicious.

627
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:09,789
Don't waste your energy on useless things.

628
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,920
Just focus on your job.

629
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,830
Thinking that he might not be a student was plain absurd.

630
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:16,960
No.

631
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,329
There's definitely something.

632
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:21,730
Hey! Stop acting like you're an NIS agent.

633
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:24,200
I'm going home. You should call it a day too.

634
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,880
Ms. Oh.

635
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,690
- Come here for a moment. - Sure.

636
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,260
How are things in the student council?

637
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,020
Not bad.

638
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,160
They weren't exactly welcoming, though.

639
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,760
They'll demand special attention from you.

640
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,300
You know that, right?

641
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,899
The position was left vacant for a while,

642
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,970
so it won't be easy.

643
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,539
But please do a good job.

644
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,569
It was left vacant?

645
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:00,370
Then was there another advising teacher...

646
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:02,740
That's what I heard, but I don't know the details.

647
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,510
But I must tell you, I have high hopes for you, Ms. Oh.

648
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,510
I hope to keep you at our school for many more years to come,

649
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,020
not bound by contract.

650
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,949
Can I trust you and count on you?

651
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,050
Yes, of course.

652
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:18,720
- If you need anything, let me know. - All right, then.

653
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,090
Here.

654
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,360
These too.

655
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:29,200
Take care of these first.

656
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:32,239
They're our attendance and budget approval records.

657
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,270
It's not a lot. Just from the past year or so?

658
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,680
But I have to clock out soon.

659
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,480
Right, of course. You should clock out.

660
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,150
You can do it at home.

661
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,620
I love you.

662
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,160
I love you too.

663
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,389
- Bye! - Bye, get home safely.

664
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,429
What's the plan?

665
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,760
Wait, I think...

666
00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:58,899
Bye.

667
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,800
- Bye. - Bye.

668
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,800
Bye, guys.

669
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,509
It's quite tricky.

670
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,480
- I see. - That's how it's done.

671
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:18,519
I'm going out.

672
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,849
Where? Are you not having dinner?

673
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:22,290
- I'll have dinner with my friend. - Stop!

674
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:25,560
Hey, is Hae Seong doing well at school these days?

675
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:27,689
I haven't heard from him for a while.

676
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,459
Whenever I ask your dad,

677
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:32,060
he just says it's top secret.

678
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,929
He must've finished the side dishes by now.

679
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:35,530
Tell him to give me a call.

680
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,640
And you don't care to know how I'm doing?

681
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:40,639
How I'm doing at school,

682
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,670
if everything's okay, or if anything's stressing me out...

683
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:45,080
You don't even want to know, right?

684
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,850
Well, you're...

685
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,250
You always do well, so...

686
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,280
Are you going through something?

687
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:55,650
Forget it. What do I even expect?

688
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,920
See you later.

689
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,690
Wait, Yu Jeong.

690
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,230
An Yu Jeong!

691
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,230
Darn it.

692
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,430
Oh, my.

693
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:08,200
This place looks really expensive.

694
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,240
How much does it cost to eat here?

695
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,540
It's on me.

696
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:15,870
Of course, I won't ask you to pay for this.

697
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:21,280
The chef said to take great care of you.

698
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:23,209
I'll take your order.

699
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:24,880
We're waiting for one more person. Give us a minute.

700
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,180
Yes, sure thing.

701
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:30,290
How come Hae Seong isn't here yet?

702
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:42,230
It was a good idea to meet outside of school.

703
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,670
Sorry, I'm late.

704
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,680
- We haven't ordered yet. - I see.

705
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,710
Have you been waiting long?

706
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:55,380
Not really.

707
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:00,150
Everyone's here, so let's order now.

708
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:01,350
Yu Jeong, ask for the menu.

709
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:04,460
Okay. Excuse me.

710
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,300
How does it feel to become a student council member?

711
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,200
I'm not sure yet.

712
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:15,700
I'm still trying to figure out how things work.

713
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,900
Why did you want to join the student council so much?

714
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:31,620
Knock, knock. Mr. Jeong Hae Seong, are you there?

715
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:33,750
Yes.

716
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,090
Just because. I thought it was cool.

717
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,000
Anyway, how did you two become friends?

718
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,970
Do we need a reason to become friends?

719
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,970
I'll be honest. Back then, Yu Jeong was...

720
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,310
Oh, I'm sorry.

721
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,710
We were classmates in tenth grade, so we became close.

722
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:04,550
I had a hard time adjusting to school,

723
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,990
and Ye Na helped me out a lot back then.

724
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:10,920
I did.

725
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,790
I saw the two of you talking in private the other day.

726
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,099
I thought you two seemed very close.

727
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,799
No, we're not close.

728
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,530
Your reaction is making you look even more suspicious.

729
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:21,969
What's wrong with being close?

730
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:22,970
Well...

731
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:26,370
Anyway, you two aren't dating then, right?

732
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:27,470
- What? - What?

733
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:29,570
It's all good, then.

734
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:34,210
Yu Jeong.

735
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:36,250
Pick up a new pair of stockings for me.

736
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:37,920
I've got a run because of my high heels.

737
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:49,030
What are you waiting for?

738
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:50,730
Nothing.

739
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:52,300
Sit down.

740
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:02,370
What's with that sigh?

741
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,610
I'll let this go,

742
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,550
but don't do this again.

743
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,120
What's your relationship with Yu Jeong?

744
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:28,970
Let's call it a night.

745
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:51,059
I had fun today.

746
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,460
Let's hang out together again.

747
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:57,130
Congratulations on becoming a student council member.

748
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,600
Thanks.

749
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,000
I'm off. See you at school.

750
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,230
Was Ye Na the reason you told me not to join the student council?

751
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,190
Yu Jeong.

752
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,770
- In my opinion, you two... - That's right.

753
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:36,700
I'm like Ye Na's servant.

754
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,439
When she has a run in her stocking, I go and pick up a new pair.

755
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,740
When she wants a coffee, I go and get that for her too.

756
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:49,480
Ye Na got me into the council when I wasn't even qualified.

757
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:53,750
In return, I have to do everything she orders me to do.

758
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,220
But so what?

759
00:47:58,260 --> 00:47:59,560
I like this.

760
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:02,460
I like this setup, so what will you do about it?

761
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:12,540
Good for you.

762
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,770
Your curiosity has been satisfied.

763
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:19,010
Don't butt in like that ever again.

764
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:22,010
And don't you dare try to lecture me.

765
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:23,550
Please...

766
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:26,720
Please mind your own business.

767
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,210
I'm home.

768
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:26,640
Did you enjoy your meal?

769
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:28,750
It was okay.

770
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,450
The student council kids.

771
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:33,520
Did anyone object to Hae Seong joining?

772
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:35,320
Not especially.

773
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:37,290
But Mom.

774
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,219
Why did you want Hae Seong on...

775
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:40,220
Why...

776
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:42,860
did I tell you to let him join the student council?

777
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:48,400
The reason I didn't tell you why, Ye Na...

778
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:52,800
is because you don't need to know why.

779
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:55,510
I'm sorry, Mom.

780
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:58,610
Why did you take Yu Jeong with you?

781
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:03,650
Did you think I wouldn't know?

782
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:05,220
Ye Na.

783
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:08,390
There's nothing I don't know about you.

784
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:12,590
I thought it would be awkward without her.

785
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,889
And the others could talk.

786
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:16,590
Weren't you trying to put her in her place?

787
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,300
There's a new council member,

788
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:21,170
and she took your number one spot.

789
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,670
You wanted to show her who was boss.

790
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:28,510
Ye Na.

791
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:32,640
I am so...

792
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:34,950
disappointed.

793
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:38,650
That is so incredibly childish.

794
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:40,250
I'm sorry.

795
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:42,619
I won't do it again.

796
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:45,020
Or maybe have her kicked out of school.

797
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:53,330
When your dog forgets its training and acts out...

798
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:59,070
It's best to just get rid of it.

799
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:01,840
Because one day...

800
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:05,140
it starts thinking it's human.

801
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:08,550

804
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:19,590
Promise me something.

805
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:24,400
Promise from now on, you will never let anyone...

806
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,830
take your spot.

807
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:31,800
Promise.

Haven't you been acting properly?

821
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:02,450
I'm sorry, sir.

822

who sent that note?

834

You must find them soon.

836
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,750
I'll check the school's CCTV tomorrow.

837
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:12,750

845
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:43,750
and we find your dad,

846
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:46,580
I'd be too ashamed to face him.

847
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:52,520

860
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:56,390
Where did they all go?

861
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:57,920
I don't know.

862
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:00,290
Is it because they checked the server yesterday?

863
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:03,030
But even so...

864
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,710

What do you think, Principal Park?

867
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:30,920
Why do you think they did that?

868
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:33,790
They want something from Jeong Hae Seong...

869
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:36,590
or want his help, maybe?

870
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,230

I'm beginning to wonder...

874
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:53,040
how much...

875
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:57,080
the person knows.

876
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:12,260
They checked the school server yesterday.

877
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:14,500
That's a suspicious coincidence.

878
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:19,770

880
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,380
Who could it be?

881
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,179
It smells strongly that someone deleted...

882
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:30,110
the CCTV footage on purpose.

883
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:32,250
It's the person who sent you the note...

884
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:34,080
or their accomplice.

887

or someone who doesn't want that person to be known.

889

891
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:50,630
