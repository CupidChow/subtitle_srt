1
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:11,239
(All places, organizations, characters,)

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,139
(incidents, and backstories in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:22,249
Where should I begin?

4
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:25,490
The secret operation...

5
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,529
that drastically changed my world of darkness.

6
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,270
It all began on that very day.

7
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,999
That night I had myself immersed in the operation...

8
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,440
like any other mission.

9
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,640
What are you gazing at me for?

10
00:00:43,509 --> 00:00:45,009
Is this a blind date?

11
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:48,380
As if you need to translate that.

12
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:50,949
Tell him to show me the money.

13
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,589
Is it in dollars?

14
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,720
Thank you.

15
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:01,990
The item.

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,300
He wants to see the item.

17
00:01:06,429 --> 00:01:08,030
Oh, sure.

18
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,940
He wasn't someone easy to escort here.

19
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,969
I breathed in all the dust at the museum...

20
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,910
just to have him accompany me.

21
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,080
Watch yourself.

22
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,669
I've confirmed the item.

23
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,440
Listen up. I say this again.

24
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,038
It's a national treasure we were barely able to locate...

25
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,340
by tracing transactions on the black market.

26
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:52,509
It cannot be damaged.

27
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,710
We are to arrest those involved,

28
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:58,380
but securing the cultural heritage is also a priority.

29
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,870
Darn, it's quite the drop.

30
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:45,759
What now?

31
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:48,669
Are you kidding me?

32
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,500
Who are you, darn it?

33
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,880
Next.

34
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,160
Why you...

35
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:23,100
Hands off.

36
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:27,870
What the...

37
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,039
You!

38
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,720
Keep your hands off what belongs to others.

39
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,590
I surrender.

40
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,299
Item secured.

41
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,739
Agent Jeong, I'll get going first.

42
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,710
Sure.

43
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,239
You're not going anywhere.

44
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,580
Don't you dare...

45
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:14,450
Sweet.

46
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,249
Agent Jeong!

47
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:28,400
Don't!

48
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,538
The next one will be for real.

49
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:38,678
Jeong Hae Seong, have you lost it?

50
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:40,439
Put it down unless you want a bullet to the brain.

51
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:41,748
You have three seconds.

52
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:43,710
- Three, two... - You!

53
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:50,049
Drive!

54
00:05:06,299 --> 00:05:07,499
Step on it.

55
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,010
That was electrifying.

56
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,149
Backup has arrived on scene.

57
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,918
They'll soon catch up with you, so keep on him.

58
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:20,949
There's no time.

59
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,089
He'll soon hit the main street and must be apprehended now.

60
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,219
That's an order.

61
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,260
Jeong Hae Seong, don't do anything dangerous and follow...

62
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,259
Hello?

63
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,260
We got disconnected.

64
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,150
What the...

65
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,419
Pull over, you punk.

66
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,919
Seriously? Knock him over!

67
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:01,760
Where did he go? Is he gone?

68
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:05,100
I guess he's gone.

69
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,429
Hey!

70
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,100
What?

71
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:19,579
What...

72
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,080
Rock the car side to side, darn it!

73
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:28,950
What now?

74
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,858
He's up there!

75
00:06:36,859 --> 00:06:39,299
Rock the car hard!

76
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,168
Keep it up.

77
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:47,668
Side to side!

78
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:49,239
Come on, side to side.

79
00:07:02,749 --> 00:07:04,720
No, don't.

80
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,460
Wait. Hey!

81
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:10,129
Darn!

82
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,070
What's with him?

83
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:17,939
Stop!

84
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,169
Are you out of your mind?

85
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,419
You're done for.

86
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:24,690
No...

87
00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:34,399
Hae Seong!

88
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,040
That's freaking awesome.

89
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,330
Mission complete.

90
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,289
What about Mr. Park and the Chinese broker?

91
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,690
They were turned over to the prosecution,

92
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,659
and Mr. Park has been hospitalized.

93
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,029
As well as the driver.

94
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:04,759
Prison food will knock some sense into them.

95
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:07,129
Anyway, good job on the mission.

96
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:09,070
And Yeong Hun...

97
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:11,540
You...

98
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,600
That was some good work.

99
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:18,509
Now, let's have a look.

100
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,879
How has Buddha been?

101
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,550
Goodness, I know...

102
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:28,320
it's been rough for you.

103
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:34,720
From here on out, we'll give you the royal treatment.

104
00:11:40,229 --> 00:11:42,930
(National Intelligence Service)

105
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,440
What... What happened to it?

106
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,940
This!

107
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,739
Where is the hand that his chin rests on?

108
00:11:55,109 --> 00:11:56,749
His arm...

109
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:00,820
Sir.

110
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,519
This...

111
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:12,529
This looks like a bullet.

112
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,399
A bullet?

113
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:18,499
Are you saying someone shot at a national treasure?

114
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:21,399
No one fired a shot at the scene.

115
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,739
The arm's been completely severed.

116
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,210
Which punk had the audacity to shoot...

117
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,119
Darn it.

118
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,930
(Serving in the shadows to light the way forward)

119
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:51,670
An Seok Ho!

120
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,440
What now?

121
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,369
How will you fix this?

122
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:01,440
- I'm sorry. - You think an apology will suffice?

123
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,649
Take a deep breath, Director.

124
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,190
Domestic Team Four may lack in many ways,

125
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:12,060
but I doubt this was on purpose.

126
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:16,960
Whatever.

127
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:19,499
I want Agent Jeong gone.

128
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,999
- Sorry? - Did I stutter?

129
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:23,829
One has to take the fall for his.

130
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:24,999
Should it be you instead?

131
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,739
Sir, hold on.

132
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:28,970
Not Agent Jeong, sir.

133
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,839
Please consider his devotion to this country.

134
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,809
I know Agent Jeong is one of the best we have...

135
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,719
and that he's wasting his time being on your moronic team.

136
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,779
But who are we?

137
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:41,519
The NIS.

138
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,590
A single mishap outweighs 100 successful missions.

139
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,758
Have him gone by tomorrow.

140
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:51,559
That's an order, Senior Agent An.

141
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,200
- Director, please... - Come on, Seok Ho.

142
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,528
No, let go of me.

143
00:13:57,529 --> 00:13:59,469
Director!

144
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:02,440
I'll do whatever you ask.

145
00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:05,710
- Let go! - Senior Agent Gong.

146
00:14:08,979 --> 00:14:10,050
Darn you.

147
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,190
Yes?

148
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,949
Are you sure you're willing to do anything?

149
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,159
Absolutely. Of course, sir.

150
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,810
My gosh.

151
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:45,649
How could a bullet ricochet like a ball on a pool table?

152
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
Give me a break.

153
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,790
There's being unlucky and then this.

154
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,560
I'm sorry.

155
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,729
I should've been more careful.

156
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,330
Was it necessary for the director to go this far?

157
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,799
It's not like Hae Seong shot it on purpose.

158
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,498
It happened in the line of duty.

159
00:15:02,499 --> 00:15:04,869
He shouldn't have to resign over this.

160
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:07,139
Sir, are you really going...

161
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,540
to let Hae Seong turn over his badge over this?

162
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:12,080
As if I have any power to stop it.

163
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:13,909
I'm also someone who follows orders.

164
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,050
But when the door closes, a window opens.

165
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:27,090
He gave us an assignment earlier today.

166
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,729
Hae Seong, it's the only way you'll get to keep your job.

167
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,600
There's this school in Seoul.

168
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,070
Byeongmun High School. I'm sure you've heard of it.

169
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,970
Hey, wait.

170
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:44,840
It's one of Korea's most prestigious private high schools.

171
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:50,180
The first chairman of the school was Seo Byeong Mun.

172
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,478
A traitor to our people who was never recorded in history...

173
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:55,420
and the keeper of Emperor Gojong's secret safe.

174
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:01,618
Ten tons of gold bars from the Emperor's treasury...

175
00:16:01,619 --> 00:16:02,789
were given to Seo Byeong Mun for safekeeping...

176
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,759
which was to fund the nation's independence movement.

177
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,129
The Emperor trusted Seo Byeong Mun,

178
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,200
but the latter had other plans.

179
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,279
He deemed the nation to be hopeless...

180
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,950
and pocketed all that gold which would be equivalent...

181
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,119
to over 800 million dollars today.

182
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:41,159
Hurrah for the independence of Korea!

183
00:16:41,629 --> 00:16:43,729
Hurrah for the independence of Korea.

184
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,128
- Hurrah for... - Hurrah for...

185
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,500
the independence of Korea!

186
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,510
Hurrah for the independence of Korea!

187
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,480
Hurrah for the independence of Korea!

188
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,448
Hurrah for the independence of Korea!

189
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:58,850
But when Japan fell,

190
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,449
Seo Byeong Mun had to go into hiding.

191
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:11,230
- In here! Come on! - Get him!

192
00:17:11,389 --> 00:17:13,299
- Go after him. - Search every inch!

193
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,030
All that gold he wasn't able to take with him...

194
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,570
is said to be in slumber somewhere...

195
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,310
awaiting the day to see the light.

196
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,879
That's more like an urban legend.

197
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,879
Exactly. That was my thought at first.

198
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:35,250
But then...

199
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,250
the director showed me this.

200
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:45,399
It's absolute proof that the gold bars exist.

201
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:47,698
With this as its lead,

202
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,570
the NIS once investigated the Byeongmun Foundation.

203
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,139
However, nothing was uncovered.

204
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,868
Where are the gold bars then if the foundation doesn't have them?

205
00:17:55,869 --> 00:17:58,540
The one place the NIS didn't think to investigate at the time.

206
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,280
Byeongmun High School.

207
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:07,119
Recently, the NIS received an anonymous tip.

208
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,418
We know that the gold bars hidden by Seo Byeong Mun...

209
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:10,590
are somewhere within the school,

210
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:14,490
and that the foundation will be smuggling them out of the country.

211
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,790
All of the remaining gold bars?

212
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,658
The whole 800 million dollars' worth?

213
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:21,398
If the gold leaves the country,

214
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:23,800
it will be a huge loss of state funds.

215
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,899
The ramifications it will have on the country will be catastrophic.

216
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,010
Hae Seong, what's your take on it?

217
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,879
Where should I start?

218
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,179
Here's the actual mission.

219
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,520
Hae Seong, you're going back to high school...

220
00:18:40,949 --> 00:18:43,188
as a student attending Byeongmun High.

221
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:45,089
Find the gold...

222
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,959
hidden by Seo Byeong Mun, the traitor to our people.

223
00:18:48,219 --> 00:18:49,760
This is Operation...

224
00:18:50,659 --> 00:18:53,800
Undercover High School.

225
00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:04,609
Have you lost your mind?

226
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:05,809
We don't have a lot of time.

227
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,438
The briefing will be tomorrow.

228
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,649
Just a second.

229
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,208
What is this nonsense?

230
00:19:10,209 --> 00:19:12,250
- How can I go back to school? - Don't worry.

231
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,448
You look incredibly young for your age.

232
00:19:14,449 --> 00:19:15,749
If anyone doubts your age,

233
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,749
say that your face aged rapidly from a bad batch of herbal medicine,

234
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,619
and stick to that story.

235
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,188
- Are you serious? - Yeong Hun, how old are you?

236
00:19:22,189 --> 00:19:23,990
- I'm 26. - You're in your 20s?

237
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,329
Why are you startled by that...

238
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,458
when I've been calling you my senior?

239
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:30,269
I only thought that because I joined the agency before you did.

240
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,040
I addressed you respectfully thinking you were older than...

241
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:35,869
me.

242
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:39,010
How old did you think I was?

243
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,679
I thought you were in your early 40s.

244
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,810
Was it the herbal medicine you had as a kid?

245
00:19:45,949 --> 00:19:48,480
- It was turtle extract. - He had turtle extract.

246
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:50,919
See?

247
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:53,159
How about this, then?

248
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,289
I'll go undercover as a teacher.

249
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,928
No, that won't work.

250
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,559
There aren't any available positions,

251
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,999
and the foundation would know.

252
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,069
- Still... - No, that's enough talking.

253
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,230
I promised the director I'd have you work this case.

254
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,869
(Have a Drink With Su A)

255
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,839
I can't do this. I won't.

256
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,939
Would you rather get the boot, then?

257
00:20:17,109 --> 00:20:20,250
Come on. There's no other way.

258
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,090
We're to take shelter first when it pours.

259
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,429
Let's work on this case, Hae Seong.

260
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,429
We'll arrest all those who are corrupt,

261
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,500
retrieve 800 million dollars in gold that belongs to the country,

262
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,570
and...

263
00:20:40,469 --> 00:20:41,600
make a triumphant return.

264
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:54,448
Did she come back because she missed me?

265
00:20:54,449 --> 00:20:57,448
Yes! Nice! I love that Kwang Du is here

266
00:20:57,449 --> 00:21:00,490
- I love you too! - The one I waited for is Kwang Du

267
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:05,290
Kwang Du, I love you so much

268
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:10,570
So much

269
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:16,510
Nice!

270
00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:25,749
- You're the best! - Thank you.

271
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,948
My gosh, Ms. Oh.

272
00:21:27,949 --> 00:21:29,648
You could be a singer.

273
00:21:29,649 --> 00:21:31,749
The spirit was alive in your song.

274
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,790
Come here and let me pour you a glass.

275
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,188
A drink from you, Vice-principal Baek,

276
00:21:36,189 --> 00:21:37,689
would be an honor.

277
00:21:38,459 --> 00:21:40,159
Happy birthday, sir!

278
00:21:40,459 --> 00:21:43,628
- Happy birthday, sir. - Happy birthday.

279
00:21:43,629 --> 00:21:45,569
- I'm the one who's grateful. - Move.

280
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,239
You held a party just for me.

281
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,810
I love you all.

282
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,579
He would've sulked all year if we hadn't thrown a party.

283
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,709
Like last year.

284
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,688
What a nutjob.

285
00:22:05,689 --> 00:22:07,319
This is how you drink these days.

286
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,689
Bottoms up!

287
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,359
All of it?

288
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:13,659
Come on. Are you going to ruin the mood like this?

289
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,229
That would definitely be upsetting.

290
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,168
I'm the man of the hour today.

291
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,340
How can you think of becoming a full-time teacher...

292
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:21,669
without listening to your superiors?

293
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,609
That would probably knock her out.

294
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,678
I was only joking.

295
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:31,979
Bottoms up.

296
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,849
- Bottoms up. - Bottoms up.

297
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,850
- Bottoms up. - Wait!

298
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,719
I'll drink it.

299
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,659
That was too loud.

300
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,760
Why would you drink it instead, Mr. Lee?

301
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,459
Well... I'll be her white knight.

302
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,270
Mr. Lee, are you here on a blind date?

303
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,869
Sit down.

304
00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:54,000
- Bottoms up. - I'll drink it.

305
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,209
I can hold my liquor like no other.

306
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:00,839
As if that makes any sense when you only drink coke.

307
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,909
Now, sit!

308
00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:03,479
Sit. Don't move. Sit.

309
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,878
Wait. Don't move.

310
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:06,449
Enough!

311
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:09,718
I, Oh Su A, homeroom teacher...

312
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:11,149
of Class 1 of Grade 11 at Byeongmun High,

313
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:13,688
will drink this and die today.

314
00:23:13,689 --> 00:23:14,719
That's the spirit.

315
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:18,259
Bottoms up!

316
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:21,229
There you go. It's going down.

317
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,168
You're doing great.

318
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:24,668
Good job.

319
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:27,638
In it goes. She's chugging it down.

320
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:30,509
No way. She's drinking it all. Goodness me.

321
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,939
She emptied it!

322
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,678
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

323
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,208
- Good night. - See you tomorrow.

324
00:23:36,209 --> 00:23:37,379
- Good night. - Let's go home.

325
00:23:37,609 --> 00:23:38,649
There's a cab.

326
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,050
Come on. You can't leave without a third round of drinks.

327
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,419
How about a club for round three?

328
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:45,990
Let's go clubbing!

329
00:23:46,219 --> 00:23:49,889
- Clubbing! - Ms. Oh, I'm sorry.

330
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,628
- I apologize. - No.

331
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:52,858
Mr. Lee, stop her, will you?

332
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:55,559
No, don't be sorry. Let's go clubbing!

333
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,570
Ms. Oh, you're drunk, so let's call it a day.

334
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,000
What? No way.

335
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:02,668
I'm not tipsy at all.

336
00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:04,069
Happy birthday, Mr. Baek.

337
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:06,579
- Good night, sir. - Thanks.

338
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,609
Stop! Vice-principal Baek!

339
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,659
My goodness.

340
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,500
That sobered me right up.

341
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,209
Darn it.

342
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,409
Darn.

343
00:24:57,389 --> 00:24:58,790
I'll get going, sir.

344
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:04,929
What...

345
00:25:07,469 --> 00:25:09,339
Sir, please step on it.

346
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,439
Now!

347
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,969
If Hae Seong refuses...

348
00:25:36,199 --> 00:25:38,230
The team could be dismantled?

349
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:42,070
I can't be sure, but that's what was implied.

350
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:46,040
They may call it that, but it's them forcing us out.

351
00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:49,810
They were waiting for the right excuse.

352
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,409
To be honest,

353
00:25:51,709 --> 00:25:54,080
we've been riding Hae Seong's coattails all this time.

354
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,520
Cheers.

355
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,530
(Have a Drink With Su A)

356
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:41,000
Ma'am, one bowl of hangover soup, please.

357
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,030
Unbelievable.

358
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,000
She crawled in here wasted again.

359
00:26:48,969 --> 00:26:51,040
Go home, you brat.

360
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:52,810
Unbelievable.

361
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:55,379
Did I open this restaurant to make a living...

362
00:26:56,409 --> 00:26:58,979
or to feed my daughter her hangover soup?

363
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,119
I'll pay.

364
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,218
It's not like you have a lot of customers.

365
00:27:03,219 --> 00:27:05,589
Always giving me the lip.

366
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,718
- Ma'am. - Yes?

367
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:07,990
- I'd like to get the check. - Sure.

368
00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:14,429
- Did you enjoy the food? - We did.

369
00:27:28,639 --> 00:27:30,750
That's one gorgeous face.

370
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,260
Are you a student?

371
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,969
University students?

372
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,829
No, we're in 11th grade.

373
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,639
We're 17.

374
00:27:53,969 --> 00:27:56,740
Come on. That can't be true.

375
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,009
I checked all your IDs.

376
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,708
Ma'am, you're too gullible.

377
00:28:01,709 --> 00:28:03,979
Fake IDs are easy to come by these days.

378
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,718
You know what'll happen...

379
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:09,550
if we report you for serving alcohol to minors.

380
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,419
- Thank you for the meal. - But...

381
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:14,859
But that's...

382
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,159
Hold up.

383
00:28:17,389 --> 00:28:18,459
What now?

384
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,368
I can't believe you're still trying to pull this...

385
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,399
when a new law has been implemented.

386
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,139
Which school do you attend?

387
00:28:31,469 --> 00:28:32,810
And who may you be, old lady?

388
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,010
Old lady?

389
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,178
I work here.

390
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:42,250
Seriously?

391
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:44,520
Then what happens to her isn't your concern.

392
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:48,520
Don't stick your nose in where it doesn't belong,

393
00:28:49,629 --> 00:28:51,529
- Goodness. - and clean the tables.

394
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,300
Kids these days don't let things like that fly.

395
00:28:54,629 --> 00:28:56,070
Take a step closer,

396
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,399
and I'll call the cops.

397
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:02,908
Hey. Who do you think you are?

398
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:04,839
Who are you...

399
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,080
to yap on about calling the cops on me?

400
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,679
Are you my mom or teacher?

401
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,879
Tell me.

402
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,020
Who do you think you are?

403
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,560
Who are you to...

404
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,859
That's enough.

405
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:27,760
What now, you punk?

406
00:29:28,459 --> 00:29:30,428
- Darn! - My gosh.

407
00:29:30,429 --> 00:29:32,330
Don't just stand there!

408
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You...

409
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,909
You punk!

410
00:29:37,969 --> 00:29:39,240
Hey!

411
00:29:42,109 --> 00:29:43,780
Why you...

412
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:45,810
Darn.

413
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,179
You!

414
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:51,790
What...

415
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,459
- That hurts. - Come on. Let's go.

416
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:57,730
Get up.

417
00:29:59,459 --> 00:30:00,898
Hey, pay up!

418
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,359
Pay before you go, you punk!

419
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,600
Yes, ma'am.

420
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,070
- Oh, no. - Hey, what the...

421
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,070
- He's paying. This guy here! - Hey!

422
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,639
Darn it.

423
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,408
Here, 50 dollars.

424
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:11,439
I'm sorry.

425
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,580
My goodness. Thank you very much.

426
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,779
Are you hurt? Are you all right?

427
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,780
I'm fine.

428
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:22,790
No!

429
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,418
Don't be silly.

430
00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:26,590
Please don't worry about it.

431
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:29,060
It's totally fine, so just get going.

432
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:30,358
Just give me some freebies next time.

433
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:31,389
No, but...

434
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,230
Well...

435
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:36,300
Then please come again.

436
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:39,199
I'll give you our large portion on the house.

437
00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:40,469
Thank you.

438
00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:43,240
My gosh. I should thank you.

439
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:53,820
Bye now.

440
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,560
I envy his mother for having a son like him.

441
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,289
Anyway, you!

442
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,458
Didn't you want to get a full-time teaching job?

443
00:31:04,459 --> 00:31:05,990
Don't be so reckless.

444
00:31:07,129 --> 00:31:08,129
Mom.

445
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:11,129
I have this fluttering feeling in my chest.

446
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:15,070
Your chest is flat. What's there to flutter?

447
00:31:15,469 --> 00:31:16,540
Mom!

448
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,040
Darn you!

449
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,510
(Jeong Si Hyun)

450
00:32:29,511 --> 00:32:31,879
This is the problem with orphans.

451
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,580
They need a beating to get their act together.

452
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:36,850
Seriously.

453
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,350
- Hey, let's go. - Okay.

454
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,320
Darn it.

455
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,619
Sir.

456
00:33:46,089 --> 00:33:47,420
I'll do it.

457
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,770
Byeongmun High School.

458
00:33:57,699 --> 00:33:58,729
Seo Byeong Mun,

459
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,599
the head of Internal Affairs of the Empire of Korea,

460
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,639
launched his eponymous foundation and founded the school.

461
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:05,068
The school was founded...

462
00:34:05,069 --> 00:34:06,778
under Japanese rule with the goal of...

463
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:08,339
achieving full Japanization of the Korean people.

464
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:12,080
At the time, the school was as highly regarded...

465
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,380
as Jedok High School, which was founded...

466
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,920
by the Japanese Governor-General of Korea.

467
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,618
It's a prestigious high school, and every year,

468
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:21,719
over a hundred of its students enter the top three universities in Korea.

469
00:34:22,089 --> 00:34:23,258
Many influential politicians,

470
00:34:23,259 --> 00:34:24,830
business leaders, legal professionals,

471
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,560
and media professionals are Byeongmun High graduates.

472
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,868
Using such strong connections...

473
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:31,600
as its weapon,

474
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,468
the school has formed a power cartel...

475
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:35,199
with some of the most influential people in the country.

476
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,638

(Donation from Byeongmun High School Alumni Association)

480
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,178
Ma'am.

481
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:46,149
The Minister of Education is here.

482
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,420
Oh, my.

483
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:49,949
Please come on in.

484
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,318
I know you're a busy man.

485
00:34:53,319 --> 00:34:54,920
- Thank you for coming. - It's my pleasure.

486
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,389
Please look kindly upon my daughter.

487
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,130
It's nice to meet you.

488
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:02,799
Please take a seat.

489
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:12,609
Byeongmun High's school culture...

490
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,739
is akin to military culture. It's all about discipline and rules,

491
00:35:14,909 --> 00:35:16,909
and the seniority among students is strictly respected.

492
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,218
Only the students in the top 0.1 percent...

493
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:28,560
are qualified to join the student council.

494
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,389
- Hey, you. - Yes?

495
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,529
- Are you a freshman? - Yes, I am.

496
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:36,130
I guess they didn't tell you at the entrance ceremony.

497
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,770
Here, first-year students aren't allowed to wear earrings.

498
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:41,838
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot.

499
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,469
- Be careful from now on. - I will.

500
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,779
The school is becoming lax on the rules.

501
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:48,779
Book a meeting with her homeroom teacher.

502
00:35:52,179 --> 00:35:54,250
They have so much power and authority...

503
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,888
that no one at the school...

504
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:59,960
can dare to mess with them.

505
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:02,860
Okay, so?

506
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,989
Do we have a detailed plan?

507
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,360
How are you going to make me look like a student?

508
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,000
- Agent Park. - Yes.

509
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:14,439
Here are your family relation certificate,

510
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,939
student record, and so on, which we put together...

511
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,509
based on your information and background.

512
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,909
(Family Relation Certificate, Transfer Application)

513
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:27,619
"Applicant category, socially disadvantaged?"

514
00:36:27,949 --> 00:36:29,448
- Me? Why? - Byeongmun High...

515
00:36:29,449 --> 00:36:31,819
doesn't welcome transfer students...

516
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:35,159
unless the student makes a donation to the school.

517
00:36:37,259 --> 00:36:38,589
I'll donate some money. How much?

518
00:36:38,759 --> 00:36:39,929
At least 100,000 dollars.

519
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,100
Do you have that kind of money?

520
00:36:43,699 --> 00:36:45,400
Someone's bluntly straightforward.

521
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,139
What's this?

522
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,069
I'm transferring from a school in Ttangkkeut Village, Haenam?

523
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,638
Most students will show...

524
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:55,610
a lot of interest in transfer students.

525
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,150
They'll definitely ask you about the school you transferred from.

526
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,678
To prevent the likelihood of them knowing someone at your old school,

527
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:03,290
I chose the farthest region.

528
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:07,819
It sounds absurd, but it makes sense.

529
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:11,230
You live in a rooftop room near the school.

530
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,629
Your uncle is your guardian, and he's a deep-sea fishing crewman.

531
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:16,100
So, you live alone in Seoul.

532
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,199
Next.

Memorize all of them.

540
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:34,779
You need to be able to have conversations with the students.

541
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,089
Tell me.

542
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:39,250
Who was your favorite girl group? The most recent one.

543
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:41,318
Girls' Generation?

544
00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:43,060
Girls' Generation? No, Wonder Girls is the best.

545
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:46,360
Study and memorize everything here.

546
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:48,529
And don't even mention Girls' Generation.

547
00:37:49,029 --> 00:37:50,170
Wonder Girls too.

548
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:52,900
Do not mention them.

549
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,100
As I said earlier,

550
00:37:54,101 --> 00:37:56,339
Byeongmun High is no ordinary high school.

551
00:37:57,009 --> 00:37:58,909
The same goes for its students and their parents.

552
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:01,779
You.

553
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,049
Don't get tangled up with any of the students.

554
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,678
Getting tangled up with any of them...

555
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:07,618
will only increase the likelihood of getting your cover blown.

556
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,179
- Do you understand? - Yes, sir.

557
00:38:10,589 --> 00:38:11,589
Those of us here...

558
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,819
and the director are the only ones who know about this operation.

559
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:15,860
The operation is on...

560
00:38:16,589 --> 00:38:17,989
until Agent Jeong Hae Seong...

561
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,000
finds the national treasure...

562
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:25,369
valued at 800 million dollars hidden somewhere in that building...

563
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:27,670
and returns it to the national coffers.

564
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:30,869
The operation will commence this coming Monday.

565
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,040
Get ready, all of you.

566
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:35,238
Any questions?

567
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:36,309
- No, sir. - No, sir.

568
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,509
- Then you're dismissed. - I have a question.

569
00:38:41,179 --> 00:38:42,179
But you're sure...

570
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,790
the gold bars do exist, right?

571
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,460
Well, we received a tip-off,

572
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,400
- so they must be there. - What?

573
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:57,000
What if this is a part of the director's bigger plan?

574
00:38:58,029 --> 00:39:00,569
To make us go after something that doesn't exist to fire us?

575
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,900
No.

576
00:39:03,469 --> 00:39:04,670
You all saw the picture.

577
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:06,469
They exist.

578
00:39:06,739 --> 00:39:08,040
I'm sure of it,

579
00:39:08,909 --> 00:39:10,049
so don't you worry.

580
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:11,909
All right. Dismissed.

581
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,520
What is this?

582
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,230
I don't think they exist.

583
00:39:24,759 --> 00:39:26,488
What choice do we have? We still have to do it.

584
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,529
(Senior Agent An Seok Ho)

585
00:39:32,029 --> 00:39:33,239
This just came in.

586
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,270
Your aunt will drop by shortly to check up on you.

587
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,379
From cleaning to the air quality in the house,

588
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,409
make sure everything's perfect at home.

589
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:43,679
You know what to do.

590
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,350
Your aunt is determined to make you...

591
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:47,920
move back home.

592
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,619
- I'll get ready. - Good.

593
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:03,000
The place looks pretty good.

594
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,468
- Mom. - Yes?

595
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:06,199
Come and join us. You're making him uncomfortable.

596
00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:08,100
Yes, that's enough.

597
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,868
The meat is all cooked now.

598
00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:10,909
All right.

599
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:13,679
Hey, Hae Seong.

600
00:40:14,009 --> 00:40:15,009
Are you...

601
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,449
not struggling to pay your monthly bills?

602
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:20,618
You won't have to worry about that if you move in with us.

603
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:21,719
Mom.

604
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,818
Okay, you little brat.

605
00:40:23,819 --> 00:40:26,589
Did I ask you to pay for his bills? Why are you yelling?

606
00:40:28,489 --> 00:40:32,029
Anyway, you're single, and you live alone.

607
00:40:32,589 --> 00:40:34,529
Your place is unbelievably clean.

608
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,469
Hey, that startled me.

609
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:40,469
I'm sad that you don't need my help.

610
00:40:41,969 --> 00:40:44,439
It's all thanks to you who raised me so well, Auntie.

611
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,710
My goodness. You're such a sweet talker.

612
00:40:46,909 --> 00:40:48,239
Here, Auntie. Open wide.

613
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,278
What an eyesore.

614
00:40:51,279 --> 00:40:52,909
Right, Dad?

615
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,980
What are you doing?

616
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,150
Nothing. Eat up.

617
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:00,089
Well...

618
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:03,290
Since the whole family is here,

619
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,130
we should make the announcement now.

620
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:09,159
Starting on Monday, Hae Seong will be sent...

621
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:12,698
to Byeongmun High School on an operation.

622
00:41:12,699 --> 00:41:14,369
To my school? Why would he come to my school?

623
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,440
It's top secret, so ask no more.

624
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,509
And watch your mouth at school.

625
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,880
Top secret, my foot.

626
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:24,109
If you put Hae Seong in danger again,

627
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:26,509
- I will cut you up like this. - Auntie, no!

628
00:41:27,279 --> 00:41:28,520
Calm down.

629
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:31,089
Put it down, all right?

630
00:41:31,449 --> 00:41:33,219
- Let me pour you one. - Okay.

631
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,560
Here.

632
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,489
Don't worry. I'm not a little boy, you know.

633
00:41:39,659 --> 00:41:41,859
You'll always be my little boy.

634
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,100
All right, come on.

635
00:41:43,429 --> 00:41:46,130
Let's drink, okay?

636
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,238
All right. Here's to the happiness and health of the family...

637
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:53,069
and to the success of Hae Seong's new operation.

638
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:55,009
- Cheers! - Cheers!

639
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:13,529
(Jeong Hae Seong)

640
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:21,929
See you later.

641
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:54,759
Get out of my way, will you?

642
00:43:58,330 --> 00:43:59,369
Me?

643
00:44:03,739 --> 00:44:05,040
Why can't she just go around me?

644
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,409
Who is he? A transfer student?

645
00:44:11,179 --> 00:44:12,210
I guess.

646
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,020
These brats.

647
00:44:25,389 --> 00:44:26,429
Ms. Oh?

648
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,500
Is Ms. Oh not here yet?

649
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:31,698
What time is it now? I can't believe she's not here yet!

650
00:44:31,699 --> 00:44:33,099
No wonder people say teachers have...

651
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,940
- no authority nowadays! - This is nuts.

652
00:44:35,299 --> 00:44:37,338
Teachers, will you keep this up?

653
00:44:37,339 --> 00:44:38,939
- Excuse me. - Hush.

654
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,509
Is she trying to shut the school down?

655
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:44,179
Ms. Oh?

656
00:44:44,909 --> 00:44:46,580
(Byeongmun High School)

657
00:44:48,549 --> 00:44:51,089
Goodness, you scared me. Where did she go?

658
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:53,420
Anyway, who are you?

659
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:55,318
I'm Jeong Hae Seong.

660
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:56,519
I'm a transfer student.

661
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,729
I see. I'm busy now. You can introduce yourself later.

662
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:00,198
Did you see the teacher who was here?

663
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:01,460
I swear, she was right here.

664
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,159
Right.

665
00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:05,069
Well...

666
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,000
She went that way.

667
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:11,069
Thank you. Ms. Oh!

668
00:45:13,069 --> 00:45:14,179
Ms. Oh!

669
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:16,580
Where did she go? Ms. Oh!

670
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,928
So, you're Hae Seong.

671
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:33,798
The transfer student joining my class.

672
00:45:33,799 --> 00:45:35,500
- Your class? - Nice to meet you.

673
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:37,899
I'm Oh Su A, your homeroom teacher.

674
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,329
I teach Korean History.

675
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:41,440
And please forget what you just saw.

676
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:44,239
It's nice to meet you.

677
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:48,509
You might find it hard to adapt to a new school environment at first.

678
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:51,548
If anything stresses you out, just come to me anytime.

679
00:45:51,549 --> 00:45:53,979
I'll do my best to help you as much as I can.

680
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:54,980
Okay.

681
00:46:02,819 --> 00:46:04,389
By any chance, have we met...

682
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,670
Wait, at the diner?

683
00:46:15,299 --> 00:46:16,299
Come here.

684
00:46:16,869 --> 00:46:19,109
- Are you out of your mind? - It hurts!

685
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,409
- Don't talk casually to me. - Ms. Oh!

686
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:23,238
- Hey, turn around! - It hurts!

687
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:25,449
- Come on, quick! - It really hurts!

688
00:46:26,279 --> 00:46:27,279
It hurts!

689
00:46:28,779 --> 00:46:29,779
Ms. Oh!

690
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:33,420
- It really hurts! - Shut it!

691
00:46:37,389 --> 00:46:39,129
I can't believe this.

692
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,799
How did you get around the ID check?

693
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,330
Right, you probably have a fake ID.

694
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,669
Were you at a funeral or something?

695
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:46,469
You were dressed in a suit!

696
00:46:47,139 --> 00:46:49,000
I'll let you off this time since you just transferred here,

697
00:46:49,369 --> 00:46:50,440
but watch out.

698
00:46:50,739 --> 00:46:53,709
If I catch you again, I'll send you straight to the counselor!

699
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:55,610
Goodness. I can't believe this.

700
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:57,779
Hey, you've done nothing to be proud of either.

701
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:00,250
"Hey?"

702
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,589
I mean, you shouldn't be so proud of what you did either, Ms. Oh.

703
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,259
Didn't you fight alongside me?

704
00:47:07,389 --> 00:47:10,388
I saw you ruthlessly beat up those kids.

705
00:47:10,389 --> 00:47:12,060
- Hey. - With a steel tray.

706
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:16,359
Hey, that was... I was just trying to save you!

707
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,600
I never asked you to save me.

708
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,039
I admit what I did was wrong,

709
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,338
so you should admit it too.

710
00:47:25,339 --> 00:47:27,678
Let's cut each other some slack and let it go, okay?

711
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:28,810
It's my first day here, you know.

712
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,609
Oh, the morning assembly will begin soon.

713
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:32,610
See? Here.

714
00:47:33,449 --> 00:47:34,719
Where's the classroom?

715
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:37,719
(Grade 11, Class 1)

716
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:41,060
Ye Na!

717
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,619
Hey, I'm seriously so jealous.

718
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:46,289
Your mom... I mean, can't you talk to Chairwoman Seo...

719
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:47,959
and take me with you to France on the exchange program?

720
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,299
Hey, I thought you were busy training for your idol debut.

721
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,368
Don't listen to her. Just take me with you. Please?

722
00:47:53,369 --> 00:47:56,040
I won't leave until the term ends. It's a long time away.

723
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:58,170
And I'm sorry to disappoint you girls.

724
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,309
I already decided who I want to take on the trip.

725
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:01,310
Who?

726
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:06,609
Me?

727
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:08,719
You know I can't live without you.

728
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,389
You'll come with me, right?

729
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:14,659
How much does it cost to join the exchange program?

730
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,020
I'm not sure.

731
00:48:17,759 --> 00:48:19,830
The school will take care of some of the expenses,

732
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:21,129
so I'd say 10,000 dollars?

733
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:22,630
What? Did you say 10,000 dollars?

734
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:25,599
Oh, my. It costs 10,000 dollars? Goodness.

735
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,639
- I see. - Good morning, Mr. Writer.

736
00:48:29,299 --> 00:48:30,369
My gosh.

737
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:33,170
Look at this loser scribbling away again.

738
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:34,480
Hey, Mr. Writer.

739
00:48:35,139 --> 00:48:37,810
Have you finished preparing for Tae Soo's performance assessment?

740
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,719
Sorry. I'll take care of it quickly.

741
00:48:43,949 --> 00:48:44,989
Hey, Dong Min.

742
00:48:47,259 --> 00:48:48,290
Be good.

743
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,830
You know I can be scary when I'm angry.

744
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,899
- Yes. - Hey, Ms. Oh is here!

745
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:54,900
Come on.

746
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,770
Quiet down! Get ready for your morning assembly.

747
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,239
We have a new student joining us as of today.

748
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:10,650
Come on in.

749
00:49:25,989 --> 00:49:27,060
- He's good-looking. - Hey, look.

750
00:49:31,929 --> 00:49:33,369
I've found my Prince Charming.

751
00:49:33,869 --> 00:49:35,868
I saw him by the main gate earlier.

752
00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:38,569
- Is he a celebrity or something? - My gosh!

753
00:49:39,639 --> 00:49:42,239
I'm Jung Hae Seong. Nice to meet you all.

754
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,480
Applause!

755
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:53,790
Let's see. Is there an empty desk?

756
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:55,920
You can sit there.

757
00:50:12,369 --> 00:50:15,540
All of you should help Hae Seong adjust to his new environment.

758
00:50:16,779 --> 00:50:17,880
I'll check attendance now.

759
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:19,949
Han Tae Hee.

760
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,879
- Hi. - Lee Yeon Jae.

761
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,048
I'm Lee Dong Min.

762
00:50:23,049 --> 00:50:24,619
- Jang Ki Yeon. - Nice to meet you.

763
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:25,989
- Let's be friends. - Jeong Sang Hun.

764
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,119
Kim Woo Jin.

765
00:50:36,929 --> 00:50:37,929
Hae Seong.

766
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:39,369
Come to the rooftop after this.

767
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:56,179
Hae Seong.

768
00:50:56,619 --> 00:50:57,749
Are you insane?

769
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,089
You're here as a student?

770
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:01,060
You can't call me "insane" when...

771
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,360
Goodness.

772
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:05,159
Stuff happened. Don't ask.

773
00:51:08,759 --> 00:51:10,599
There's no way you can be a student.

774
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,940
I thought you'd be a teacher or faculty member.

775
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,199
Do you think I want to be in this uniform?

776
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:18,139
See what it's like when you start working.

777
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:29,879
Forget everything else. I'll help as best I can.

778
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,819
Finish your mission and get out of here quickly.

779
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:33,889
And promise...

780
00:51:34,219 --> 00:51:37,060
you won't tell Mom and Dad how I'm doing at school.

781
00:51:38,529 --> 00:51:39,630
Is something wrong?

782
00:51:40,089 --> 00:51:42,699
Don't ask questions. Just do as I say.

783
00:51:44,199 --> 00:51:45,400
Okay. I promise.

784
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:48,069
- You promised. - Yes.

785
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,939
Break it, and I'll never see you again.

786
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:50,969
Fine.

787
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:20,330
Let's do this.

788
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,338
A year later, Emperor Gojong...

789
00:52:29,339 --> 00:52:32,279
moved from the Russian Legation to Gyeongungung Palace.

790
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,949
He came home.

791
00:52:37,049 --> 00:52:38,089
No way.

792
00:52:41,589 --> 00:52:42,659
I'm so sorry.

793
00:52:42,889 --> 00:52:44,389
How dare you try to hit my throat?

794
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:47,460
Sorry.

795
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:57,299
Hi, Transfer Student.

796
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,739
What's your social media handle?

797
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:00,069
I'll send you my AW.

798
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:01,508
"AW?"

799
00:53:01,509 --> 00:53:02,540
(An honest message sent anonymously)

800
00:53:02,739 --> 00:53:05,210
You don't know what "AW" means?

801
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:08,420
Are you a primitive, Hae Seong?

802
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:12,920
No. I know what it means.

803
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:17,659
I don't know what you want me to promise, but no thanks.

804
00:53:18,389 --> 00:53:20,460
That's fine. It's okay.

805
00:53:20,929 --> 00:53:22,359
You're a jokester.

806
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,129
- He's witty. - I'm kidding.

807
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:25,500
I knew it.

808
00:53:26,969 --> 00:53:28,699
You mean I look familiar.

809
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:33,869
It's not at all what I learned.

810
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,639
What the heck is an AW?

811
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:36,779
"AW?"

812
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,650
Weren't they saying "awww" because you're cute?

813
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:41,650
Why am I even asking you? Bye.

814
00:53:43,049 --> 00:53:44,119
Darn it.

815
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:46,919
Rock-paper-scissors.

816
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,960
Go!

817
00:53:48,389 --> 00:53:49,989
- Get out of the way. - Gosh.

818
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,960
- Okay. - Wait.

819
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:53,290
Hurry up.

820
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:54,699
Hey.

821
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,699
- Sorry. - It's my ball.

822
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,368
What do you want?

823
00:53:58,369 --> 00:53:59,469
You can't...

824
00:54:00,299 --> 00:54:02,169
- Hey. - Watch where you're going!

825
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:03,699
Let's keep streaming.

826
00:54:04,139 --> 00:54:08,540
(Jeong Hae Seong)

827
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:10,750
No, let's go over that move again.

828
00:54:11,009 --> 00:54:12,250
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

829
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:13,909
Hurry up.

830
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,819
I want to go home.

831
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:41,480
(Keep Out)

832
00:54:57,690 --> 00:54:59,360

(Electricity Meter)

837
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:52,610
Did you stuff your ears with something?

838
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:56,380
Hey. Lee Dong Min.

839
00:56:56,739 --> 00:56:58,448
We pay extra tuition...

840
00:56:58,449 --> 00:56:59,678
so you can study for free.

841
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:01,580
At least do as you're told.

842
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:02,920
Am I wrong?

843
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:04,819
Is it over if you don't bring it?

844
00:57:05,489 --> 00:57:07,790
Why do you want my grandma's ID?

845
00:57:08,819 --> 00:57:10,060
Are you being funny?

846
00:57:10,259 --> 00:57:11,859
Why do you need to know that?

847
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:15,100
Just do as you're told and bring it.

848
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:17,499
This isn't working.

849
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,029
You need a mental reboot.

850
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,630
Stand still.

851
00:57:20,969 --> 00:57:23,000
Don't move, okay?

852
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:30,679
What's that noise?

853
00:57:31,509 --> 00:57:32,509
Hey.

854
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:34,179
You!

855
00:57:34,819 --> 00:57:36,549
Stop and come on over.

856
00:57:44,529 --> 00:57:45,560
The transfer student?

857
00:57:46,489 --> 00:57:47,529
What are you doing here?

858
00:57:47,929 --> 00:57:49,100
How long were you here for?

859
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:50,799
I got here just now.

860
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:52,968
Where's the toilet?

861
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,339
The toilet? You idiot.

862
00:57:54,839 --> 00:57:57,469
A spectator should be made to pay.

863
00:57:58,369 --> 00:58:00,069
Get us some dumplings and fishcake skewers.

864
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:01,839
We'll pay for it...

865
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,610
later on.

867
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:12,290
What?

868
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:13,919
What do you want?

869
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,989
- So what if you glare at us? - So what?

870
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:17,960
Don't go too far.

871
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,290
I've been watching and this is too much.

872
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:22,230
Stop it and get back indoors.

873
00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:24,529
I'm saying this for your sake...

874
00:58:28,699 --> 00:58:30,000
Hae Seong.

875
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,710
You must hold back.

876
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:43,020
What happened? Why did he stop talking?

877
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:45,420
Is something over there?

878
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:49,319
So what?

879
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,130
You don't want to go?

880
00:58:54,699 --> 00:58:55,900
Shall I get sodas too?

881
00:58:57,330 --> 00:58:59,630
You startled me, you punk.

882
00:59:00,029 --> 00:59:02,139
- You darn eyes... - Okay. I'm off.

883
00:59:05,469 --> 00:59:06,968
Get going right now.

884
00:59:06,969 --> 00:59:08,338
- Get running. - Okay.

885
00:59:08,339 --> 00:59:09,980
Three, two, one!

886
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:12,080
- I can still see your feet. - You're pretty fast.

887
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:16,719
It must be nice to have a loser friend, Dong Min.

888
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:22,659
The transfer student was in a fight at your restaurant?

889
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:25,630
The face you're making is the face I made earlier.

890
00:59:26,489 --> 00:59:28,960
You have no idea how shocked I was.

891
00:59:29,929 --> 00:59:31,170
I hate problem students.

892
00:59:31,929 --> 00:59:34,670
Do you think he's covered in tattoos?

893
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:38,409
I never imagined he'd be in high school.

894
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:41,839
He was in a suit drinking alcohol.

895
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:44,339
Mom.

896
00:59:45,449 --> 00:59:47,380
I have this fluttering feeling in my chest.

897
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:53,690
Are you insane?

898
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,060
What's up with her?

899
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:02,000
This is the last time I let him off.

900
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,400
If I catch him doing anything,

901
01:00:04,699 --> 01:00:06,969
I'll make sure he pays.

902
01:00:11,869 --> 01:00:14,310
It was another long, hard day.

903
01:00:14,509 --> 01:00:16,610
Get home safe. I'll see you tomorrow.

904
01:00:16,839 --> 01:00:17,948
What's our class motto?

905
01:00:17,949 --> 01:00:19,049
Look at the blackboard...

906
01:00:19,409 --> 01:00:21,250
- As if it's BTS. - As if it's BTS.

907
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,750
(Class Motto: Look at the blackboard as if it's BTS.)

908
01:00:25,089 --> 01:00:26,190
Perfect. That's all.

909
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:44,639
- Was your name Dong Min? - What?

910
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:48,239
Yes. That's my name.

911
01:00:49,139 --> 01:00:51,980
Instead of just taking it, try fighting back next time.

912
01:00:52,409 --> 01:00:54,049
Holding back doesn't always work.

913
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:55,719
Okay?

914
01:00:57,049 --> 01:00:58,520
You couldn't fight back either...

915
01:00:58,949 --> 01:01:00,219
when Yoon Chul kicked you.

916
01:01:02,259 --> 01:01:03,560
My butt's firm, so it's fine.

917
01:01:03,759 --> 01:01:04,960
Let me ask you something.

918
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,230
What's the old building in the back?

919
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:10,500
The one that's out of bounds.

920
01:01:11,369 --> 01:01:12,400
That one?

921
01:01:13,569 --> 01:01:15,900
It's our old facility that we don't use anymore.

922
01:01:16,299 --> 01:01:17,969
It's so old that it could collapse.

923
01:01:18,409 --> 01:01:19,670
How old is it?

924
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:22,239
It was probably built during the Japanese colonial era.

925
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:25,009
It's the oldest of our school buildings.

926
01:01:26,009 --> 01:01:27,250
The Japanese colonial era?

927
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:29,380
Yes.

928
01:01:29,381 --> 01:01:31,448
There are rumors that it's haunted...

929
01:01:31,449 --> 01:01:33,350
and that bodies are buried inside.

930
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:36,589
I love spooky stories about our school.

931
01:01:37,159 --> 01:01:38,630

934
01:01:52,009 --> 01:01:54,239
(My deepest condolences)

935
01:02:10,389 --> 01:02:13,029
I offer my sincerest condolences.

936
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:16,259
Thank you for coming.

937
01:02:17,759 --> 01:02:18,830
I don't know...

938
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:22,369
if this will offer any comfort.

939
01:02:23,739 --> 01:02:25,170
Don't worry about your son.

940
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:28,610
Our Byeongmun Foundation will look after him.

941
01:02:34,049 --> 01:02:35,549
Thank you, chairwoman.

942
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:39,718
Make room for her son in our special class.

943
01:02:39,719 --> 01:02:41,089
Yes, chairwoman.

944
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:42,860
Thank you.

945
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,000
You never truly know someone.

946
01:02:52,429 --> 01:02:54,940
The man had some influence within the school.

947
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:57,339
Who'd have thought he'd hang himself?

948
01:02:58,409 --> 01:02:59,770
It's a shame.

949
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:04,850
He was at loggerheads with you over the Education City,

950
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:06,810
but he wasn't a bad guy.

951
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:10,479
Why did he upset you so much only to die like this?

952
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,149
Assemblyman Park Min Cheol.

953
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:13,150
Yes?

954
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:16,020
We're here to mourn him and send him off.

955
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:17,790
Talk about that later.

956
01:03:18,989 --> 01:03:20,460
I apologize.

957
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:23,159
I only meant to show my pity.

958
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:25,900
But all is not lost for him.

959
01:03:26,299 --> 01:03:29,400
You promised to look after his son.

960
01:03:30,069 --> 01:03:32,739
I'm sure Assemblyman Choi can rest in peace.

961
01:03:35,179 --> 01:03:36,210
He will, right?

962
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:40,610
I really hope so.

963
01:03:53,889 --> 01:03:55,529
Did you clean everything up?

964
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:57,699
The case was closed without an autopsy.

965
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:01,299
That's enough mourning.

966
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,969
We dealt with the headache.

967
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,210
Shall we get to work?

968
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:07,540
Sure.

969
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:10,279
Byeongmun High's old building?

970
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:13,980
It's not easy to keep so many gold bars in one place.

971
01:04:14,409 --> 01:04:16,449
That requires space, necessary security,

972
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,618
and a way to maintain temperature...

973
01:04:18,619 --> 01:04:19,889
and humidity to prevent discoloration.

974
01:04:20,049 --> 01:04:22,719
All that must be checked regularly.

975
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:24,119
So what?

976
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:26,630
What do you think is odd?

977
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,029
The electricity meter.

978
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:30,559
(Old building)

979
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:32,369
The building was neglected for a long time,

980
01:04:32,529 --> 01:04:34,068
but the meter was running.

981
01:04:34,069 --> 01:04:35,138
(Electricity Meter)

982
01:04:35,139 --> 01:04:37,569
People were told to keep out for safety reasons,

983
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:40,210
but if they truly cared about the students' safety,

984
01:04:40,569 --> 01:04:41,709
they'd have torn it down,

985
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:43,139
not left it up for this long.

986
01:04:44,810 --> 01:04:47,549
That's why you think it's the old building?

987
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:52,249
If the foundation is hiding the gold bars illegally?

988
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:53,650
I think it's worth checking out.

990
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:56,420

Last night, someone broke into the old building.

999
01:08:45,889 --> 01:08:46,919
The person will be back.

1000
01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:49,589
Let's see what they get up to.

1001
01:08:49,719 --> 01:08:51,089
Stay away from the old building.

1002
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:53,860
Did they hide gold and jewels under the floor?

1003
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:55,199
I'm warning you.

1004
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,599
You'd be better off staying away.

1005
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:57,929
Especially from the basement.

1006
01:08:57,999 --> 01:08:59,329
I should know. I went there.

1007
01:09:00,129 --> 01:09:02,299
Let's wrap up the mission today.

1008
01:09:02,469 --> 01:09:03,469

1009
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:05,440
Are you a thug? Are you into crime?

1010
01:09:05,669 --> 01:09:07,370
Is the punk out of his mind?

1011
01:09:07,639 --> 01:09:08,980
I'll keep an eye on you.

1012
