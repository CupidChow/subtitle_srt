1
00:00:00,328 --> 00:00:04,348
   

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,138
What do you mean there's no gold? 
    

3
00:00:10,357 --> 00:00:12,807
The radio went out, so I don't know the details.

4
00:00:12,807 --> 00:00:15,797
We'll know when Hae Seong comes out.

5
00:00:15,797 --> 00:00:20,007
Until we get back in touch with Hae Seong, we need to buy time.

6
00:00:20,007 --> 00:00:24,307
We can't let Seo Myeong Ju have this information.

7
00:00:24,307 --> 00:00:25,737
Got it.

8
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:30,537
What's that?

9
00:00:30,537 --> 00:00:32,427
We're here.

10
00:00:35,527 --> 00:00:37,527
It's happening now.

11
00:00:37,527 --> 00:00:39,377
What do we do?

12
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:48,050
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Undercover Love Team ðŸ’– @Viki.com 

13
00:00:49,437 --> 00:00:51,637
Let's stop playing right here.

14
00:00:51,637 --> 00:00:55,277
Or... why don't you take it all the way?

15
00:01:03,847 --> 00:01:08,137
Ms. Im, I think this is the end.

16
00:01:08,917 --> 00:01:10,977
Please make way.

17
00:01:17,967 --> 00:01:19,377
Stand by.

18
00:01:19,377 --> 00:01:21,027
 Yes, Sir! 

19
00:01:31,457 --> 00:01:33,097
Shit, what's this?

20
00:01:33,097 --> 00:01:34,557
Shit, what the?

21
00:01:34,557 --> 00:01:37,307
How can you just let her in?

22
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,010
   

23
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,887
What is this?

24
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,390
Where is my gold?

25
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,730
What is happening? Where is it?

26
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,890
My gold...

27
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,150
My gold! My gold!

28
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,220
My gold! Where is my gold?

29
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,840
My gold! Where is my gold?

30
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,500
Where is my gold?

31
00:03:22,597 --> 00:03:25,807
Chairwoman! Chairwoman!

32
00:04:04,997 --> 00:04:07,427
 If you leave now, when will you be back? 

33
00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:09,107
 It's my birthday tomorrow. 

34
00:04:09,107 --> 00:04:11,957
 You think I forgot about that? 

35
00:04:11,957 --> 00:04:14,180
 I'll be right back to wake you up. 

36
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,360
 Let's go to your favorite place, the observatory. 

37
00:04:16,367 --> 00:04:18,737
 Keep your promise this time. 

38
00:04:18,737 --> 00:04:22,187
 If not, I'm never talking to you again, Dad. 

39
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,217
 I promise. 

40
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,140
   

41
00:06:31,497 --> 00:06:33,187
Hae Seong.

42
00:06:34,587 --> 00:06:36,937
Let's eat something.

43
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:39,957
Or go get some rest for a minute.

44
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,667
Su Ah,

45
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,497
I'm okay.

46
00:06:46,497 --> 00:06:48,327
I'm at peace.

47
00:07:23,197 --> 00:07:25,927
Sunbae's father...

48
00:07:25,927 --> 00:07:28,757
It looks like it was a homicide, right?

49
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:33,287
We'll know more after the examination.

50
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,617
However, they found a bullet, so...

51
00:07:36,617 --> 00:07:40,297
We'll have to investigate why he was in there.

52
00:07:40,297 --> 00:07:42,777
What have we done?

53
00:07:42,777 --> 00:07:47,827
To find those damn gold bars, we worked so hard.

54
00:07:49,467 --> 00:07:52,157
For things to end up like this for Sunbae...

55
00:07:52,157 --> 00:07:54,697
Oh, no.

56
00:08:00,907 --> 00:08:03,117
We shouldn't do cheers.

57
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:16,637
If the gold bars were never there, what was the photo of the gold?

58
00:08:16,637 --> 00:08:18,487
We definitely checked.

59
00:08:18,487 --> 00:08:21,187
Maybe it was bait.

60
00:08:21,187 --> 00:08:26,177
Fake bait that the Director put out to place us into the operation.

61
00:08:26,177 --> 00:08:27,907
Gosh, anyway...

62
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:33,097
It's the last sendoff for his father and it's so empty in here.

63
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:36,047
It should be busier here

64
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:40,197
for our Hae Seong to feel comforted.

65
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,827
Oh, my.

66
00:08:52,697 --> 00:08:54,427
Hae Seong.

67
00:09:10,887 --> 00:09:13,217
How did you guys know?

68
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:17,717
They wanted to come, so I brought them.

69
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,007
Let's pay our respects to his father.

70
00:09:52,337 --> 00:09:56,537
 My dad... won't be lonely. 

71
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,117
Thank you for coming.

72
00:10:28,037 --> 00:10:29,897
You guys must be hungry.

73
00:10:35,507 --> 00:10:37,287
Thank you.

74
00:10:37,287 --> 00:10:39,897
Go ahead and eat. You must be hungry.

75
00:10:58,147 --> 00:11:00,997
   

76
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:02,767
   

77
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:04,887
   

78
00:11:05,427 --> 00:11:08,197
As you said, I avoided the director.

79
00:11:08,197 --> 00:11:12,237
It's the result from a private investigator, not the NIS.

80
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:16,307
   

81
00:11:16,307 --> 00:11:17,977
Glock 17.

82
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:23,597
Twenty-two years ago, only the NIS Team Leaders and above had that gun.

83
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,837
The team leader at that time...

84
00:11:31,027 --> 00:11:33,837
I checked it, too.

85
00:11:33,837 --> 00:11:37,357
October 2003, Director Kim

86
00:11:37,357 --> 00:11:40,307
reported a missing cartridge shell.

87
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,727
Hae Seong.

88
00:11:43,747 --> 00:11:48,007
I think Director Kim is the suspect.

89
00:11:51,497 --> 00:11:54,397
   

90
00:11:54,397 --> 00:11:58,457
   

91
00:12:19,887 --> 00:12:22,047
So my gold...

92
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:25,366
Where did it go?

93
00:12:28,017 --> 00:12:29,927
Chairwoman,

94
00:12:29,927 --> 00:12:31,437
according to the investigation results,

95
00:12:31,437 --> 00:12:35,867
that room was never a safe for the gold.

96
00:12:35,867 --> 00:12:38,437
The first chairman established it

97
00:12:38,437 --> 00:12:43,137
as a secret conference room for key figures.

98
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:49,047
Perhaps the gifts they gave the chairman

99
00:12:49,047 --> 00:12:51,967
were misreported as gold bars.

100
00:12:51,967 --> 00:12:54,657
The gold existed.

101
00:12:54,657 --> 00:12:58,737
I know for a fact there was gold.

102
00:13:01,017 --> 00:13:04,207
But where did that gold go?

103
00:13:04,207 --> 00:13:06,297
Who took it?

104
00:13:06,297 --> 00:13:07,667
Chairwoman...

105
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:09,227
The correct answer is Jeong Hae Seong.

106
00:13:09,227 --> 00:13:11,177
Bingo!

107
00:13:17,107 --> 00:13:19,737
He's so incredible.

108
00:13:19,737 --> 00:13:22,327
He is so talented.

109
00:13:22,327 --> 00:13:24,497
In that short period,

110
00:13:24,497 --> 00:13:29,737
where and how did he take all that gold?

111
00:13:29,737 --> 00:13:31,817
Chairwoman.

112
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,927
 Yes, Director. 

113
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,607
Get the Personnel Team together.

114
00:13:49,607 --> 00:13:55,047
The agenda is disciplinary action for Agent Jeong Hae Seong.

115
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:56,497
And the reason for the disciplinary action?

116
00:13:56,497 --> 00:13:59,557
He's gotten himself in trouble too many times.

117
00:13:59,557 --> 00:14:02,247
Including the incident at the school yesterday,

118
00:14:02,247 --> 00:14:04,177
a few of them should be enough.

119
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,597
 Got it. 

120
00:14:12,897 --> 00:14:14,947
Principal.

121
00:14:16,757 --> 00:14:19,117
Find my gold.

122
00:14:21,097 --> 00:14:24,367
You can kidnap Jeong Hae Seong or torture him.

123
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:27,387
Use whatever means you need.

124
00:14:29,397 --> 00:14:30,797
Chairwoman.

125
00:14:30,797 --> 00:14:32,827
Park Jae Moon.

126
00:14:32,827 --> 00:14:36,397
From this moment, you, Park Jae Moon...

127
00:14:37,387 --> 00:14:40,917
will need to prove your worth.

128
00:15:35,027 --> 00:15:42,237
   

129
00:15:51,927 --> 00:15:54,587
   

130
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,914
 What will you say when you find your father later? 

131
00:16:27,914 --> 00:16:31,044
 That you got fired during a mission? 

132
00:16:43,237 --> 00:16:44,977
Oh, my gosh!

133
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:49,127
Are you going somewhere?

134
00:16:49,127 --> 00:16:51,767
Yeah. What's up?

135
00:16:53,127 --> 00:16:56,007
Everyone is at the restaurant.

136
00:16:56,007 --> 00:16:59,317
Team Leader told me to bring you. Let's go eat.

137
00:17:02,007 --> 00:17:03,617
I'll eat later.

138
00:17:03,617 --> 00:17:05,777
Go ahead and eat.

139
00:17:07,957 --> 00:17:09,797
Hey, Hae Seong?

140
00:17:13,897 --> 00:17:16,327
You're really okay, right?

141
00:17:19,147 --> 00:17:20,897
Su Ah.

142
00:17:32,207 --> 00:17:34,207
Thank you for everything.

143
00:17:50,747 --> 00:17:54,647
You think the director is the owner of the bullet?

144
00:17:54,647 --> 00:17:56,557
Yeah.

145
00:17:56,557 --> 00:17:58,837
That's the conclusion so far.

146
00:18:03,347 --> 00:18:05,707
I'm here.

147
00:18:05,707 --> 00:18:08,277
W-W-Why are you alone? Where's Hae Seong?

148
00:18:08,277 --> 00:18:09,717
He has to go somewhere.

149
00:18:09,717 --> 00:18:13,007
Hey! You should've come together!

150
00:18:13,007 --> 00:18:15,517
He must feel drained after the wake.

151
00:18:15,517 --> 00:18:16,997
Why don't you call him, then?

152
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:19,667
I'm already so concerned.

153
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,987
Concerned about what?

154
00:18:21,987 --> 00:18:24,457
What Hae Seong last said to me.

155
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,797
He said, "Thank you."

156
00:18:26,797 --> 00:18:29,837
Like someone going far away.

157
00:18:29,837 --> 00:18:31,887
Team Leader,

158
00:18:31,887 --> 00:18:36,577
- could Sunbae be going to... 
 - No way. He wouldn't.

159
00:18:36,577 --> 00:18:40,897
No way he'd put a gun to the director's head.

160
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:47,157
My gosh!

161
00:18:47,157 --> 00:18:49,417
- Hey, hey! Oh, my! 
 - I'll be back!

162
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:51,487
Oh, no!

163
00:18:52,337 --> 00:18:53,897
Hey, Hae Seong.

164
00:18:53,897 --> 00:18:57,607
Let's meet and talk. Just calm down for a second.

165
00:18:57,607 --> 00:19:01,167
I'm sorry, Ahjussi. This is the only option.

166
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:03,567
Hey, man! You can't do this.

167
00:19:03,567 --> 00:19:06,057
Hey, you know you can't do this.

168
00:19:06,057 --> 00:19:08,217
Hey, Hae Seong. Turn the car around.

169
00:19:08,217 --> 00:19:10,997
Let's meet up and discuss this together.

170
00:19:10,997 --> 00:19:13,827
It's something I need to put an end to.

171
00:19:13,827 --> 00:19:15,647
Don't follow me.

172
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,027
Hey! Hello? Hello?

173
00:19:24,277 --> 00:19:25,527
Where is Director Kim?

174
00:19:25,527 --> 00:19:28,747
A hotel in Incheon for a defense security conference.

175
00:19:33,497 --> 00:19:35,597
   

176
00:19:42,637 --> 00:19:45,217
- Hello. 
 - Welcome. How can I help you?

177
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,467
My director left some documents behind.

178
00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:49,457
It's urgent, but he's not picking up.

179
00:19:49,457 --> 00:19:50,987
What's the name of the guest?

180
00:19:50,987 --> 00:19:52,257
Kim Hyeong Bae.

181
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,927
Mr. Kim Hyeong Bae.

182
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:58,107
Yes, I confirmed Mr. Kim Hyeong Bae. We'll deliver it to him.

183
00:19:58,107 --> 00:19:59,717
Thank you.

184
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,407
   

185
00:20:15,197 --> 00:20:19,277
- Yes. 
  - We have some documents to be delivered to Mr. Kim Hyeong Bae. 

186
00:20:19,277 --> 00:20:21,327
Oh, it's fromâ€“

187
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:30,707
I'll go downstairs for a second.

188
00:20:30,707 --> 00:20:32,147
Okay.

189
00:20:48,107 --> 00:20:49,600
   

190
00:20:56,467 --> 00:20:59,587
Why didn't he take his key card?

191
00:21:11,797 --> 00:21:14,637
Your bullet was found on my father.

192
00:21:19,547 --> 00:21:21,757
Why did you kill him?

193
00:21:21,757 --> 00:21:23,937
Why did you kill my father?

194
00:21:33,837 --> 00:21:35,507
Where did the person who brought this go?

195
00:21:35,507 --> 00:21:39,247
He disappeared so suddenly, we don't know...

196
00:21:47,637 --> 00:21:49,347
It's Room 1201.

197
00:21:49,347 --> 00:21:50,817
Wait.

198
00:21:52,467 --> 00:21:54,917
 H-H-How will you live with this? 

199
00:21:54,917 --> 00:21:56,587
 Agent Jeong Hae Seong! 

200
00:21:56,587 --> 00:21:59,167
 Calm down. Sit and talk calmly. 

201
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:00,807
Call security right now.

202
00:22:00,807 --> 00:22:02,137
Okay.

203
00:22:02,137 --> 00:22:05,277
This will only worsen the situation.

204
00:22:05,277 --> 00:22:07,217
Put the gun down!

205
00:22:13,807 --> 00:22:16,267
The night my father died.

206
00:22:16,267 --> 00:22:18,697
What happened that night?

207
00:22:19,837 --> 00:22:25,257
Why did my father have to take a bullet?

208
00:22:25,257 --> 00:22:27,627
Tell me everything.

209
00:22:27,627 --> 00:22:29,377
Hurry up!

210
00:22:32,627 --> 00:22:34,187
Get inside.

211
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,587
I think we're one step behind.

212
00:22:43,907 --> 00:22:46,277
It's not too late.

213
00:22:47,327 --> 00:22:48,897
Come to your senses.

214
00:22:48,897 --> 00:22:50,877
Let's talk through this calmly.

215
00:22:51,697 --> 00:22:53,957
Agent Jeong Hae Seong!

216
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:56,717
As a NIS agent, you vowed to the nation.

217
00:22:56,717 --> 00:22:58,367
- Three... 
 - Not three.

218
00:22:58,367 --> 00:23:00,537
Come to your senses. Think!

219
00:23:00,537 --> 00:23:02,757
Two...

220
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:05,237
I'll tell you! I'll tell you everything!

221
00:23:05,237 --> 00:23:07,137
I'll tell you everything.

222
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:08,517
Okay.

223
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:15,807
- That night... 
 - Jeong Hae Seong! Put the gun down!

224
00:23:17,677 --> 00:23:19,807
If not, we'll shoot.

225
00:23:19,807 --> 00:23:21,487
Put it down!

226
00:23:40,137 --> 00:23:42,327
Director, are you all right?

227
00:23:42,327 --> 00:23:44,377
Get him out of my sight.

228
00:23:44,377 --> 00:23:45,997
Take him away.

229
00:23:57,647 --> 00:24:00,407
Be ready to hand him over when the police arrive.

230
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:01,897
This bastard must be crazy.

231
00:24:01,897 --> 00:24:04,557
How dare you put a gun to the director's head?

232
00:24:05,697 --> 00:24:07,537
He's dangerous. Keep an eye on him.

233
00:24:07,537 --> 00:24:09,027
Take him away.

234
00:24:11,057 --> 00:24:13,417
Be vigilant!

235
00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:16,577
What do we do now?

236
00:24:16,577 --> 00:24:21,157
Let's think about the future later and get Hae Seong out first.

237
00:24:21,157 --> 00:24:23,597
We'll need to push that mountain gorilla aside.

238
00:24:23,597 --> 00:24:25,377
Can we do that?

239
00:24:25,377 --> 00:24:27,497
I should've packed a banana.

240
00:24:27,497 --> 00:24:29,717
What about this?

241
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:37,377
Hey, gorilla! Long time no see.

242
00:24:37,377 --> 00:24:39,707
Domestic 4, on standby order.

243
00:24:39,707 --> 00:24:41,437
What are you doing here?

244
00:24:41,437 --> 00:24:43,037
We were just going about.

245
00:24:43,037 --> 00:24:45,307
We heard there was a seminar here.

246
00:24:46,307 --> 00:24:49,677
Are you here to save Jeong Hae Seong?

247
00:24:49,677 --> 00:24:51,827
I was right.

248
00:24:51,827 --> 00:24:53,267
Security team.

249
00:24:53,267 --> 00:24:54,637
Huh?

250
00:24:54,637 --> 00:24:56,617
There's Song Hye Kyo.

251
00:24:57,067 --> 00:24:58,047
Where?

252
00:24:58,047 --> 00:25:00,727
Where? You dumbass!

253
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:06,997
â™«  It's chasing after me without stopping  â™«

254
00:25:06,997 --> 00:25:09,007
â™«  There is nowhere to hide  â™«

255
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,527
Ms. Oh!

256
00:25:10,527 --> 00:25:13,677
Now!

257
00:25:13,677 --> 00:25:17,587
â™«  Spectacularly, dramatically  â™«

258
00:25:17,587 --> 00:25:19,557
â™«  Is it a hopeless battle?  â™«

259
00:25:19,557 --> 00:25:21,367
â™«  Is it war without an enemy?  â™«

260
00:25:21,367 --> 00:25:22,937
â™«  Can't keep running every day  â™«

261
00:25:22,937 --> 00:25:24,847
â™«  But I still won't give up  â™«

262
00:25:24,847 --> 00:25:26,607
â™«  Either with evil or with force  â™«

263
00:25:26,607 --> 00:25:28,187
â™«  Even if I risk my fate  â™«

264
00:25:28,187 --> 00:25:31,217
â™«  Spectacularly, dramatically  â™«

265
00:25:31,217 --> 00:25:33,097
â™«  Hey, yo!  â™«

266
00:25:34,547 --> 00:25:36,417
â™«  Hey, yo!  â™«

267
00:25:37,967 --> 00:25:40,357
â™«  Hey, yo! I'm going to run  â™«

268
00:25:40,357 --> 00:25:41,817
â™«  I'll do it to the end  â™«

269
00:25:41,817 --> 00:25:43,997
â™«  What you gonna do?  â™«

270
00:25:43,997 --> 00:25:48,867
I've been wondering... Who is she?

271
00:25:50,777 --> 00:25:54,637
Our team's wild card.

272
00:25:55,437 --> 00:25:57,017
â™«  What you gonna do?  â™«

273
00:25:57,017 --> 00:25:58,487
Damn it!

274
00:25:58,487 --> 00:26:00,967
â™«  Hey, yo!  â™«

275
00:26:00,967 --> 00:26:02,427
Wait, wait.

276
00:26:03,317 --> 00:26:05,547
Can I run to the restroom before we go?

277
00:26:05,547 --> 00:26:09,347
Going to the restroom in these situations tends to cause trouble.

278
00:26:09,357 --> 00:26:12,007
Nonsense. Are we in a drama or something?

279
00:26:12,007 --> 00:26:14,687
It's urgent. Let me go. Just once.

280
00:26:16,917 --> 00:26:18,877
Stop right there!

281
00:26:20,637 --> 00:26:21,627
Hey, Su Ah!

282
00:26:21,627 --> 00:26:24,627
What? No, no, no!

283
00:26:31,877 --> 00:26:33,687
Damn it!

284
00:26:39,447 --> 00:26:41,427
W-W-Wait.

285
00:26:41,427 --> 00:26:43,837
Why are you here?

286
00:26:43,837 --> 00:26:45,467
Did Team Leader come, too?

287
00:26:45,467 --> 00:26:46,757
Is our whole team here?

288
00:26:46,757 --> 00:26:49,117
That's right, we are! We came to stop you.

289
00:26:49,117 --> 00:26:51,287
The whole team and I came together.

290
00:26:51,287 --> 00:26:53,157
Did you think this through or not?

291
00:26:53,157 --> 00:26:54,907
I know you're pissed, but still!

292
00:26:54,907 --> 00:26:56,897
How can you just storm in here?

293
00:26:56,897 --> 00:27:00,297
Geez. I'm going to go nuts! Really!

294
00:27:00,297 --> 00:27:03,457
I told you not to follow me. Why won't you listen?

295
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:04,957
What do you mean?

296
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,587
 - Where are they? 
 - They went down that way. 

297
00:27:06,587 --> 00:27:08,307
Let's run.

298
00:27:14,137 --> 00:27:16,017
Act normal.

299
00:27:21,017 --> 00:27:22,477
 A couple suspected of violence. 

300
00:27:22,477 --> 00:27:24,767
 On the run inside the hotel. 

301
00:27:26,717 --> 00:27:29,677
Excuse me. I need to check your identification.

302
00:27:44,607 --> 00:27:48,327
- We'll stop them. Go. 
 - Team Leader.

303
00:27:48,327 --> 00:27:52,277
We will pay you back for everything we owe you.

304
00:27:52,277 --> 00:27:54,397
- Young Hun. 
 - Don't worry.

305
00:27:54,397 --> 00:27:56,337
We'll protect you now, Sunbae.

306
00:27:56,337 --> 00:27:58,887
- Mi Jeong. 
 - What are you doing? Go!

307
00:27:58,887 --> 00:28:01,167
Hurry up!

308
00:28:04,277 --> 00:28:06,427
Wow, they actually left.

309
00:28:06,427 --> 00:28:09,117
Hey! Can we actually leave?

310
00:28:09,117 --> 00:28:11,147
If it's the team I know,

311
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:13,307
you know what makes our team unique?

312
00:28:13,307 --> 00:28:15,437
As individuals, we're a bit iffy.

313
00:28:15,437 --> 00:28:19,427
But together, we're superhuman.

314
00:28:40,767 --> 00:28:42,327
Get them!

315
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:03,617
Mi Jeong!

316
00:29:08,587 --> 00:29:09,857
Oppa?

317
00:29:09,857 --> 00:29:11,497
â™«  I love you  â™«

318
00:29:11,497 --> 00:29:15,427
â™«  Don't forget even for a moment  â™«

319
00:29:15,427 --> 00:29:19,217
â™«  You're the only one I love  â™«

320
00:29:19,217 --> 00:29:22,567
â™«  It's always you  â™«

321
00:29:22,567 --> 00:29:25,937
â™«  Loving you, loving you  â™«

322
00:29:25,937 --> 00:29:29,977
â™«  Don't you worry  â™«

323
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:34,617
â™«  Even if sadness comes  â™«

324
00:29:34,617 --> 00:29:36,477
Are you okay?

325
00:29:36,477 --> 00:29:38,557
Young Hun!

326
00:29:38,557 --> 00:29:41,197
â™«  It's me  â™«

327
00:30:08,227 --> 00:30:12,077
The entirety of our scholarship system,

328
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:14,837
and financial aid for underprivileged students.

329
00:30:14,837 --> 00:30:17,137
Abolish all of them.

330
00:30:17,137 --> 00:30:20,577
Increase tuition by 50%.

331
00:30:20,577 --> 00:30:22,307
Chairwoman.

332
00:30:22,307 --> 00:30:26,617
Then, starting next semester, many students can't attend school.

333
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:29,267
The board will no doubt raise issues.

334
00:30:29,267 --> 00:30:32,657
Those kids won't transfer to Edu-City anyway. They'll drop out anyway.

335
00:30:32,657 --> 00:30:35,137
Let's just get them out of the mix early on.

336
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:37,787
Chairwoman, I may be out of line,

337
00:30:37,787 --> 00:30:43,227
but if this is about getting the Edu-City funds,

338
00:30:43,227 --> 00:30:46,907
maybe you should take a step back.

339
00:30:46,907 --> 00:30:52,017
Public opinion and the National Assembly aren't great right now.

340
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:55,797
You can seek another opportunity down the line.

341
00:30:55,797 --> 00:30:58,127
If we can find the gold, everything is solved.

342
00:30:58,127 --> 00:31:00,317
What are you talking about?

343
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:03,077
Down the line? Take a step back?

344
00:31:03,077 --> 00:31:05,797
Who are you to be so weak?

345
00:31:06,377 --> 00:31:08,627
If we made a plan,

346
00:31:08,627 --> 00:31:13,307
we need to see it through no matter what means we use!

347
00:31:15,367 --> 00:31:16,837
Principal,

348
00:31:16,837 --> 00:31:19,237
what are you doing here?

349
00:31:19,237 --> 00:31:21,307
Go find the gold.

350
00:31:23,277 --> 00:31:25,977
Go find the gold.

351
00:31:26,827 --> 00:31:29,237
Go find the gold!

352
00:31:29,237 --> 00:31:30,937
Go find the gold!

353
00:31:30,937 --> 00:31:32,887
Chairwoman!

354
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,067
I can find the gold.

355
00:31:51,067 --> 00:31:52,917
I can beat Jeong Hae Seong.

356
00:31:52,917 --> 00:31:55,687
I will become the owner of Edu-City.

357
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,597
I can find the gold.

358
00:31:58,597 --> 00:32:00,307
I can beat Jeong Hae Seong

359
00:32:00,307 --> 00:32:04,437
and become the owner of Edu-City.

360
00:32:08,997 --> 00:32:11,177
So what you guys are saying is...

361
00:32:12,147 --> 00:32:15,777
that I tried to put a bullet through Director's head?

362
00:32:15,777 --> 00:32:20,387
That's why you all barged in and made a big scene?

363
00:32:23,337 --> 00:32:26,187
You think I'm that stupid?

364
00:32:26,187 --> 00:32:28,057
I came in 10th place in school!

365
00:32:28,057 --> 00:32:31,697
I mean, we thought you were really going to.

366
00:32:31,697 --> 00:32:35,437
Then you shouldn't have said it like that.

367
00:32:35,437 --> 00:32:38,317
Wh-What? What did I say?

368
00:32:40,117 --> 00:32:41,717
 Su Ah, 

369
00:32:42,547 --> 00:32:44,427
 thank you for everything. 

370
00:32:47,607 --> 00:32:49,717
Do you think I'm an actor or something?

371
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:54,007
I meant to say thanks for helping with my father's funeral.

372
00:32:57,437 --> 00:32:59,417
Then, you should've said that!

373
00:32:59,417 --> 00:33:03,007
If you talk in a low voice, it's confusing! Right?

374
00:33:03,007 --> 00:33:04,837
So you're saying it's all my fault?

375
00:33:04,837 --> 00:33:06,397
I don't think it's my fault.

376
00:33:06,397 --> 00:33:08,297
Wow...

377
00:33:09,517 --> 00:33:11,647
Wow. For real?

378
00:33:11,647 --> 00:33:13,157
This is ridiculous.

379
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,757
Fine, fine! Enough!

380
00:33:15,757 --> 00:33:19,437
Why did you go see Director?

381
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:23,587
At the scene where my father was,

382
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:27,447
Director Kim's bullet was discovered. But one thing still feels off.

383
00:33:28,627 --> 00:33:30,797
One thing that feels off?

384
00:33:31,697 --> 00:33:33,877
Seo Myeong Ju.

385
00:33:33,877 --> 00:33:37,177
My father's notebook that the late Kim Hyeon Ho had

386
00:33:37,177 --> 00:33:39,797
and my father's death.

387
00:33:39,797 --> 00:33:42,787
Everything happened at Byeongmun High School.

388
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:47,097
The people who put me on this operation are also Seo Myeong Ju and Director Kim.

389
00:33:47,097 --> 00:33:52,867
Maybe the two of them also put my father in the operation.

390
00:33:52,887 --> 00:33:57,357
Perhaps... Seo Myeong Ju...

391
00:33:58,197 --> 00:34:01,307
was involved in my father's death.

392
00:34:04,777 --> 00:34:09,447
I wanted to confirm that before arresting Director Kim.

393
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:12,077
 Your bullet was found on my father. 

394
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:14,697
 Why did you kill him? 

395
00:34:15,937 --> 00:34:18,087
 Why did you kill my father? 

396
00:34:22,377 --> 00:34:25,627
 This will only worsen the situation. 

397
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:38,327
 What happened that night? Tell me everything. 

398
00:34:45,587 --> 00:34:49,147
Turning Director Kim's cell into a zombie phone?

399
00:34:49,147 --> 00:34:53,397
I want to control the wiretapping and location tracking.

400
00:34:53,397 --> 00:34:58,097
This was the only way to find out about his relationship with Seo Myeong Ju

401
00:34:58,097 --> 00:35:00,687
and what exactly happened that day.

402
00:35:00,687 --> 00:35:05,367
Hey, but do you think Director Kim will do what we want?

403
00:35:05,367 --> 00:35:08,837
The discovery of the bullet lit a fire under him.

404
00:35:08,837 --> 00:35:11,467
I'm sure he'll want to put the fire out.

405
00:35:12,207 --> 00:35:14,157
We'll find out something.

406
00:35:35,397 --> 00:35:37,737
Yes, it's me.

407
00:35:37,737 --> 00:35:40,417
Cancel my seminar schedule tomorrow.

408
00:35:44,727 --> 00:35:46,647
You look exhausted.

409
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:48,277
Didn't you rest over the weekend?

410
00:35:48,277 --> 00:35:51,087
Something major happened.

411
00:35:51,087 --> 00:35:55,077
I couldn't sleep after an all-day dopamine high.

412
00:35:55,077 --> 00:35:57,557
I'm smelling something.

413
00:35:57,557 --> 00:36:00,247
Something happened with Mr. Jeong Hae Seong, huh?

414
00:36:00,247 --> 00:36:01,457
"Mister" all of a sudden?

415
00:36:01,457 --> 00:36:04,587
You said he's 31.

416
00:36:04,587 --> 00:36:07,877
I dream about his public confession of feelings.

417
00:36:07,877 --> 00:36:10,417
"I like you." "A lot."

418
00:36:10,417 --> 00:36:12,477
"Shall we kiss?"

419
00:36:14,727 --> 00:36:17,457
That last part is a gross exaggeration.

420
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:20,307
Why are you dreaming about Hae Seong?

421
00:36:20,307 --> 00:36:22,237
I can dream about whomever.

422
00:36:22,237 --> 00:36:24,687
Are you jealous?

423
00:36:24,687 --> 00:36:27,437
- Don't dream about him. 
 - Oh, no...

424
00:36:27,437 --> 00:36:29,617
- "Don't dream." 
 - Attention, teachers.

425
00:36:29,617 --> 00:36:33,287
We have a special directive from the chairwoman.

426
00:36:33,287 --> 00:36:35,217
This makes no sense.

427
00:36:35,217 --> 00:36:38,847
How can the school do this out of nowhere?

428
00:36:38,847 --> 00:36:41,997
Hey, Lee Dong Min, will you be okay?

429
00:36:41,997 --> 00:36:43,727
No.

430
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:46,397
I think I'm in trouble.

431
00:36:47,317 --> 00:36:50,167
We're all in trouble. Not just you.

432
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:53,237
We're about to become refugees next semester.

433
00:36:54,527 --> 00:36:57,807
They're freaking out about a 50% tuition increase.

434
00:36:57,807 --> 00:37:00,477
Chae Rin, read the room.

435
00:37:02,927 --> 00:37:06,107
That's not what I meant.

436
00:37:10,697 --> 00:37:12,937
Don't worry.

437
00:37:14,017 --> 00:37:15,397
Okay.

438
00:37:23,527 --> 00:37:26,917
Ms. Su Ah, I'm saying this out of concern.

439
00:37:26,917 --> 00:37:30,607
You won't go to the chairwoman about this, right?

440
00:37:32,637 --> 00:37:33,997
Ms. Oh!

441
00:37:33,997 --> 00:37:36,007
Where are you going now?

442
00:37:47,707 --> 00:37:51,357
At this rate, at least 150 students will become

443
00:37:51,357 --> 00:37:54,297
educational refugees next semester.

444
00:37:54,297 --> 00:37:57,657
No school in our district can take in all of them.

445
00:37:57,657 --> 00:38:00,557
Did we have an appointment?

446
00:38:04,257 --> 00:38:06,057
This is a school.

447
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:10,117
A school is supposed to give everyone an equal opportunityâ€”

448
00:38:10,117 --> 00:38:12,177
Equal opportunity, my foot.

449
00:38:12,177 --> 00:38:15,027
You know the world is unfair.

450
00:38:15,027 --> 00:38:17,997
Whenever they differentiate between part-time and full-time in the same officeâ€”

451
00:38:17,997 --> 00:38:22,687
A school should lead them to a better direction through education!

452
00:38:22,687 --> 00:38:24,817
You're too loud.

453
00:38:27,547 --> 00:38:29,037
When I decided to become an educator...

454
00:38:29,037 --> 00:38:31,467
Gosh, so boring.

455
00:38:31,467 --> 00:38:35,900
- I made a promise to myself. 
 - You hypocrite!

456
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,120
Planting so-called equality in the kids' minds.

457
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,440
It's not like you'll care for them forever.

458
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,500
Spewing promises you can't keep...

459
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,730
You hypocrite!

460
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:47,770
Let's not become a crazy educator and exploit kids for your own gain!

461
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:49,170
Get the f*** out!

462
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:52,500
You narcissist! You hypocrite!

463
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,820
You must be so lonely.

464
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:46,300
Ms. Su Ah.

465
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,570
Where are you going, Ms. Su Ah?

466
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:52,270
   

467
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,140
Hello.

468
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,050
I'm here to share something with the board.

469
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,420
About Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju.

470
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,240
 What brings you here without a word? 

471
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:52,350
 My bullet was found in Jeong Jae Hyeon's body. 

472
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:55,330
I see.

473
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:58,600
Now that it's evident that it was murder, Jeong Hae Seong won't stay quiet.

474
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,270
We'd better get rid of Jeong Hae Seong first.

475
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,070
No way.

476
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,950
No way.

477
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:09,390
Not before we find my gold. Don't.

478
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,850
You're putting me in a tough situation.

479
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:13,100
You're old enough.

480
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,860
You should fend for yourself.

481
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:18,120
I'll take care of Jeong Hae Seong.

482
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,790
You take care of the bullet.

483
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,740
You can't do this to me.

484
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,560
You really can't do this to me.

485
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,820
Do what?

486
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:37,270
You killed Jae Hyeon.

487
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,950
 You killed Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon! 

488
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:42,700
 You forgot. You're the one who fired the gun! 

489
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,470
 You killed Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon! 

490
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,230
 Dad! 

491
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,250
 Yeah? 

492
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,810
 You need to take this with you. 

493
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:52,680
 Your notebook. 

494
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,470
 Thank you, son. 

495
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,690
 Bye! 

496
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,510
 I'll be right back. 

497
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,390
 Jae Hyeon. 

498
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,100
 What brings you here? 

499
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,810
 Just because. 

500
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:26,820
 I wanted to chat with you in a quiet place. 

501
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,850
 Is it you, Hyung? 

502
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,820
 Are you the one colluding with Seo Myeong Ju? 

503
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,400
 Life works in strange ways. 

504
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,240
 Only money lasts. 

505
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:47,050
 I hope you understand given the amount of gold bars. 

506
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,700
 Hello, Mr. Kim Jae Yeong. 

507
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:59,520
 Oh, right, you're Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon today. 

508
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,560
 It's nice to say hello. 

509
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,910
 Get straight to business. 

510
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:07,790
 Where's my gold? 

511
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:09,660
 Gold? 

512
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,310
 Just say where it is, Jae Hyeon. 

513
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:13,450
 Let's make this easy. 

514
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:15,600
 The gold never existed. 

515
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:20,640
 There was never anything inside the Founding Chairman Seo Byeong Mun's safe. 

516
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,650
 Your crazy delusions fabricatedâ€” 

517
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:25,840
 Jeong Si Hyeon. That's your son's name, right? 

518
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,890
 Don't you dare hurt Si Hyeon. 

519
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:31,250
 Don't you dare hurt my son! 

520
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,380
 So scary. 

521
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,100
 Let me ask you one last time. 

522
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,770
 Where is it? 

523
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,210
 Chairwoman. 

524
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,430
 Then, give me one thing I want. 

525
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:52,600
 Tell me. 

526
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,960
 I want only one thing. 

527
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,890
 For the world to know about your dirty deal. 

528
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:01,740
 What are you doing? 

529
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:04,540
 What you want more than anything. 

530
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:07,500
 Don't shoot! Don't shoot! 

531
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,540
 You'll never find it. 

532
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:13,080
 Chairwoman... 

533
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,260
 What are you doing? 

534
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,090
 Are you going to kill him? 

535
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:31,840
 That's why I shot. 

536
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:35,860
 The gold is inside the school, anyway. 

537
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:38,160
 Instead of the government confiscating the gold, 

538
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,180
 I'd rather... end his life. 

539
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:34,860
 - Did you find him? 
 - I'm sorry. 

540
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:37,470
 I'm sure he came this way. 

541
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:39,740
 - Find him! 
 - Yes, Sir. 

542
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,160
 Look everywhere! 

543
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,270
 - Go upstairs. 
 - Yes, Sir. 

544
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:26,940
 Son... 

545
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:33,830
 I'm sorry I wasn't able to keep my promise. 

546
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:37,530
 I'm sorry... 

547
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:49,590
 Happy birthday... 

548
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:13,190
 You want me to take the fall for killing Jae Hyeon? 

549
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:15,530
That won't happen.

550
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,810
You got evidence?

551
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:26,280
Do you have evidence I shot Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon?

552
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:30,690
Director Kim, do you have it?

553
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,340
I don't have evidence.

554
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,330
But I do have one thing.

555
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:41,040
A living witness's testimony.

556
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:45,370
What's the point of finding the gold?

557
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:48,280
Could a murderer really see Edu-City to fruition?

558
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,520
I guess that sounds interesting.

559
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:58,520
Jeong Hae Seong was very curious about how his dad died.

560
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:02,040
I plan to tell him bit by bit.

561
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,580
I think we found a way.

562
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:34,830
To make Jeong Hae Seong talk.

563
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:13,600
   

564
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:20,460
What's up?

565
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:23,230
How does it feel to be discarded by Seo Myeong Ju?

566
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:25,360
What do you mean, out of the blue?

567
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,540
   

568
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:31,670
 With your testimony, we can put a stop to Seo Myeong Ju. 

569
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:35,340
I hope you'll show a shred of human decency.

570
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,840
Let's talk in person.

571
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,420
I have a lot to tell you.

572
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:16,490
Director.

573
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:49,140
   

574
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:11,450
   

575
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:16,400
     

576
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,450
   

577
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:23,200
   

578
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:32,840
 Hey, open the door. 

579
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,730
 Open the door right now. 

580
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:38,360
Pull him out.

581
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,440
Come out.

582
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,960
Come out!

583
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,440
Pull him out.

584
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,230
You're under arrest for killing Kim Hyeong Bae.

585
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:51,410
You can hire a lawyer, explain why you did

586
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:54,900
or refuse to say anything.

587
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:24,350
The finals are coming up.

588
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:26,680
Make sure the students stay focused.

589
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:30,300
Please take good care of them.

590
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,430
- This month's staff dinner... 
 - Ms. Oh.

591
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:42,360
Y-Yu Jeong.

592
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,820
 This morning, Jeong, a former NIS agent, 

593
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:51,740
 was arrested on site for the murder of his superior, Kim, with a deadly weapon. 

594
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:55,940
 Regarding his recent dismissal, Jeong had held a grudge against Kim. 

595
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:59,160
 In a heated argument last night, Jeong is suspected of murdering Kim 

596
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:03,120
 - with a weapon he prepared in advance.  
 - No way...

597
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:06,260
- What? 
  - For the cause of his death, 

598
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:08,710
 National Forensic Service is conducting an autopsy. 

599
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:13,810
- How is this... 
  - They plan to issue Jeong a warrant. 

600
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:22,390
Find any and all alibi surrounding his whereabouts last night.

601
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:26,660
Something must've happened last night that put Hae Seong in that situation.

602
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:29,090
- Move. 
 - Okay.

603
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,610
Team Leader!

604
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:53,160
Hey, Young Hun.

605
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,750
 Yes! 

606
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:55,840
Did you find anything?

607
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,760
A recording file.

608
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:03,480
 You killed Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon! 

609
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,090
 You forgot. You're the one who fired the gun! 

610
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:09,000
 You killed Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon! 

611
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,010
 You got evidence? 

612
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:18,600
Here.

613
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,120
I can guess what happened.

614
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,330
He went to see Director Kim after hearing this.

615
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:29,850
And fell into a trap there...

616
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:32,940
 Block this area off. 

617
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,350
 Gather information quickly. 

618
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:35,380
 Yes, Sir. 

619
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:37,160
Grab the recording of Seo Myeong Ju.

620
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,710
Come. Hurry.

621
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:46,270
We will conduct a search and seizure of Jeong Hae Seong's home for Kim Hyeong Bae's murder.

622
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:49,210
Three of you, come with us as material witnesses.

623
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:51,850
- Begin. 
 - J-Just a moment.

624
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:54,170
Why are you in such a hurry?

625
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:56,080
 You brought so many boxes. 

626
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,250
Let me help. This way.

627
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:59,440
You're obstructing official business.

628
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,670
Begin.

629
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:02,450
- I want to help. 
 - Please cooperate.

630
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:04,270
 Let me pass. 

631
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:06,400
Let me pass...

632
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,080
Step aside. Go inside.

633
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:13,610
I have leg cramps...

634
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,560
Freeze.

635
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,320
Hey...

636
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:32,890
Leave now. Go.

637
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:35,470
Look everywhere throughout the two floors.

638
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:36,830
 Yes. 

639
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:38,330
Go now.

640
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,080
Let's go.

641
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,650
Let's head to the station.

642
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:50,130
We found this while searching Jeong Hae Seong's home.

643
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:57,810
It's a recording of your conversation with Director Kim.

644
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:04,290
I really can't let my guard down with him.

645
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:05,980
Tell Detective Jo he did well.

646
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:08,660
Pay him a generous sum for his work.

647
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:17,520
What do you plan to do with Jeong Hae Seong?

648
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,330
I caught him in a trap.

649
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:22,740
Now, I'll cut him open.

650
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:27,500
And see if I find my gold or not.

651
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,680
I'm hungry.

652
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,590
Give me food.

653
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,130
Oxbone soup.

654
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:16,910
That nutjob.

655
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:20,540
Hey. Order him an oxbone soup.

656
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:25,260
Hae Seong?

657
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:28,050
He's under police investigation.

658
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:31,160
Mom, do you know anyone in the police?

659
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,200
Who are you calling?

660
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,820
We can't sit still.

661
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:36,700
Better shake up the police station or something.

662
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,180
Yeah. It's me.

663
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:40,880
Round up everyone. Right now!

664
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,640
Let's move on from violence.

665
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,300
What are we supposed to do?

666
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,900
Let Hae Seong get framed like this?

667
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:58,690
You should've come sooner.

668
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:00,970
We could've eaten together.

669
00:59:03,070 --> 00:59:05,750
I can't believe we'll see each other again so soon.

670
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:11,570
You seem...

671
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:14,440
totally fine.

672
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,510
I'm not easily phased.

673
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:19,080
- And full of fighting spirit. 
 - Because I'm innocent.

674
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,860
You know that.

675
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:25,790
Too much hope leads to unhappiness.

676
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:27,840
"It'll work out. There's no problem.

677
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:31,160
I'll win as long as I don't give up."

678
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:34,240
Hope is evil.

679
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,130
It extends pain.

680
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:41,700
It's the worst of all evils.

681
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,770
I used to know...

682
00:59:47,770 --> 00:59:51,360
someone who was just like you.

683
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:54,780
He acted stubbornly for no reason

684
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:57,550
and croaked inside a safe.

685
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,880
How dare you speak of my father!

686
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,960
Where did you stash away my gold?

687
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,550
Tell me.

688
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:09,420
Want to be branded a murderer forever?

689
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:17,300
Why do you think I have it?

690
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:19,990
Because you have it.

691
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:26,950
Chairwoman, you've become a monster.

692
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:29,060
What made you that way?

693
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:32,110
The chosen ones have

694
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:36,810
a duty to carry Korean education on their backs.

695
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:41,990
I will cultivate the talent who will lead our country for the next 100 years.

696
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:43,020
That's my dream.

697
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:45,430
How about those who died for your bullshit dream?

698
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:49,620
Those are just casualties along the long journey.

699
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:51,680
That's not a dream.

700
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,310
That's greed and obsession.

701
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:56,080
You pathetic person.

702
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:59,930
Who's pitying whom when you're sitting in that seat?

703
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:02,420
Let me ask you again.

704
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:08,560
Where did you stash away my gold?

705
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:11,170
Inside your delusion.

706
01:01:15,010 --> 01:01:17,500
Blood is thicker than water.

707
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:22,860
Evil gets passed down through genetics.

708
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:26,800
Fine. Where do you think I'll go first when I leave?

709
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,340
I'll go to Yu Jeong.

710
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:30,750
I'll cut off her finger and send it to you.

711
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:34,370
Then, you'll call me, crying. Begging me to stop. To meet with you.

712
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:38,020
Say you'll answer any questions. But I won't stop.

713
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:43,550
Until I bring everyone you care about misfortune.

714
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:44,890
Don't you dare mess with people.

715
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:48,210
You'd already be dead if I messed with you.

716
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:52,510
I will catch you for sure.

717
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:00,100
Since you and I have become friends over time,

718
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:02,230
I'll give you one more day.

719
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:06,550
Give it careful thought tonight. And call me.

720
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:09,560
My number is still the same.

721
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,310
Let's grab food together when you're out.

722
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:28,920
   

723
01:02:57,710 --> 01:02:59,430
I'm sorry.

724
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:03,910
It will hurt.

725
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:05,350
What?

726
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:09,540
You bastard...

727
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:12,520
You bastard!

728
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,150
You bastard!

729
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:30,710
You bastard!

730
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,010
Stop the car.

731
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:42,130
I said stop the car.

732
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:32,860
But how!

733
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:35,480
Got it.

734
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:52,920
I'm leaving.

735
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:01,440
   

736
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,230
   

737
01:06:04,970 --> 01:06:06,900
Yes, hello.

738
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:09,870
 It's me. 

739
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:11,570
Hae Seong, is that you?

740
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:15,160
Where are you right now?

741
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:17,290
What's going on? Are you out?

742
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:18,750
Su Ah.

743
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,550
I'm sorry, but...

744
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:24,580
can you please help me?

745
01:06:27,030 --> 01:06:29,190
 Hae Seong, where are you? 

746
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:30,500
I'll come.

747
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:31,950
 Where are you? 

748
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:35,300
 Hae Seong. Hae Seong! 

749
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:36,990
 Hae Seong! 

750
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:49,450
   

751
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:11,860
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Undercover Love Team ðŸ’– @Viki.com 

752
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,820
 I don't know what she'd do to people around me. 

753
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:20,850
 I'm going to go and get Seo Myeong Ju. 

754
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:23,900
 There's only one fair thing in life. 

755
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:26,120
 Do you know what that is? 

756
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:27,080
 Death. 

757
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,470
 You said you'll protect the kids. 

758
01:07:28,470 --> 01:07:30,030
 Go and protect the kids. 

759
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:31,710
 On one condition. 

760
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:33,550
 I will voluntarily resign. 

761
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:36,190
 We're revolting to protect ourselves. 

762
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:38,480
 You inferior beings... 

763
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,040
 We'll all die. 

764
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,270
 What are you doing right now? 

765
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:43,040
 No. Seo Myeong Ju! 

766
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:45,210
 Hae Seong, what's going on? Hae Seong! 

767
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:47,830
 I came to tell you this. 

768
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:50,330
 I'm going to miss you. 

769
01:07:50,330 --> 01:07:54,420
â™«  When I run and reach out my hand  â™«
