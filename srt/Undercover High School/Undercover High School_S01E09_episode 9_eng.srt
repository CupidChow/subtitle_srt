00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,480
Who are you?

5
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,310
Who are you, and why are you here?

6
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,070
Let go! Let go of me!

7
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,280
Su Ah.

8
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,350
Su Ah!

9
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,890
Su Ah! Su Ah, wake up!

10
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,050
Su Ah!

11
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,510
Su Ah, wake up! Su Ah!

12
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,830
Doctor, over here!

13
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,870
Prepare for surgery and secure the ICU. Now!

14
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,730
Moving now.

15
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,570
Guardian, please stay here.

16
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,860
Don't worry too much.

17
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:25,150
My Su Ah is strong.

18
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,510
She'll get back up soon.

19
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,670
If she's the Su Ah I know...

20
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,720
Sunbae.

21
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,410
How is Ms. Oh Su Ah?

22
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,200
Thankfully, it wasn't a fatal injury.

23
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,460
She's not conscious yet.

24
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,720
Have you investigated yet?

25
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,170
We finished inspecting the site.

26
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:02,010
The perp must be a newbie. His DNA is everywhere.

27
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,420
- Let me know when the results come back. 
 - Okay.

28
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,610
Go and get some sleep somewhere.

29
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,000
You look exhausted.

30
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,740
It's fine. I can't fall asleep anyway.

31
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,260
Hey. Where's Ms. Oh Su Ah?

32
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,950
Is she all right?

33
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,390
Yes. The surgery was successful.

34
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,360
I'll get some fresh air. Go and see Su Ah.

35
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,540
Room 503.

36
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,350
See you later.

37
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,640
Are you all right?

38
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,370
We'll stay here.

39
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,890
Go home and get some rest.

40
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:10,270
- I'm okay. 
 - I can see you haven't slept a wink.

41
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,930
Don't be like that. Do what I tell youâ€”

42
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,870
It's fine! Please...

43
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,010
Team Leader.

44
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,570
Never mind.

45
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,960
Don't worry about it. Please go.

46
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,060
Okay.

47
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,450
Come downstairs in a bit.

48
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,510
Hae Seong is late today.

49
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:18,780
Absence? Lateness? He's kind of a slacker.

50
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,160
That makes him more attractive.

51
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,300
Hey, kids, let's start the morning assembly.

52
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,870
Ms. Kim, where's Ms. Oh?

53
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,480
Ms. Oh?

54
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,190
She has some personal stuff going on.

55
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,540
So, today, I'll be your substitute homeroom teacher.

56
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,380
What personal stuff does Ms. Oh have?

57
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,710
Is it going to take a while?

58
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,640
You brats. As if you have shown an interest in your teacher's life.

59
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,940
I'm going to call attendance.

60
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,840
 Are you feeling all right? 

61
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,530
Yes. I'm sorry I didn't call earlier.

62
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,000
Ms. Oh isn't feeling well, either.

63
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,400
I guess the flu is really going around.

64
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,730
Take care of yourself.

65
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:01,050
Get a doctor's note so I can mark it as excused.

66
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,560
Got it.

67
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,310
I'm sorry.

68
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,420
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

69
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,140
What? Ms. Oh is in the hospital?

70
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,260
She was rushed to my dad's hospital last night.

71
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,410
She's hospitalized now.

72
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:43,450
Why was she hospitalized? Is she really sick?

73
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,950
That's personal information. So, I don't know.

74
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,420
But you know what's really amazing?

75
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,030
Hae Seong brought Ms. Oh to the hospital.

76
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,510
Oh, my gosh!

77
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,530
Is Hae Seong not here today because of Ms. Oh?

78
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,840
Very possible.

79
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,940
They've been attached at the hip these days.

80
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,020
She's a teacher, and he's a student.

81
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,660
Stop spreading weird rumors.

82
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,580
Watch your mouth.

83
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,180
I agree with Ye Na.

84
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,800
We don't know why they went to the hospital.

85
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,030
What if weird rumors spread because of you two?

86
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,170
Sorry.

87
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,230
Those girls are so ridiculous.

88
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,390
What's wrong with taking her to the hospital? It's not a big deal.

89
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,590
Maybe it was a coincidence.

90
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,410
They could've run into each other there. Right?

91
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,920
Right. Very possible. Right.

92
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,810
You don't need to do that.

93
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,530
What?

94
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,690
I know you're doing that for me.

95
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,860
You don't need to.

96
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,530
Doing this for you?

97
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,010
Aren't you?

98
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,830
I am.

99
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:04,720
Do you still like Hae Seong?

100
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,850
I did, but I'm going to move on.

101
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,430
He doesn't seem interested in me.

102
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,230
That's a relief.

103
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,220
What are you doing after school? Want to go to a movie together?

104
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,690
I want to, but I need to get home.

105
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,700
The math competition is coming up soon.

106
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,050
The math competition?

107
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,360
Yes.

108
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,150
You applied, too. Right, Ye Na?

109
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:32,750
- Yes. 
 - I've been working so hard for it.

110
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,570
You'll need to do your best to beat me.

111
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,480
If you're that sorry...

112
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,250
be nice to me.

113
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,780
Are you okay?

114
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,150
I've been worried.

115
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,940
What a relief.

116
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,810
Mr. Lee Jun Ho carried out the GPA tampering.

117
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,470
Lee Jun Ho?

118
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:42,090
Mr. Lee was the proctor for all of the manipulated competitions.

119
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,490
Don't think about anything right now.

120
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,010
I'll handle it from here.

121
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,960
You literally just got up. You're already...

122
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,660
- Hey, Young Hun. 
  - Yes, Sunbae. 

123
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,360
 The DNA results from the scene came back. 

124
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:00,260
But what's a little strange is that it says the person at the scene

125
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,970
 was Lee Jun Ho. 

126
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,940
The person at my house was Lee Jun Ho?

127
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:09,420
 Yes. Byeongmun High math teacher. Lee Jun Ho. 

128
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:14,200
Why would this person go to your house, Sunbae?

129
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,880
Keep a close watch on Lee Jun Ho.

130
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,860
 Got it. Should I tell Team Leader? 

131
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,560
Don't.

132
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,250
I'll tell him.

133
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,520
 He used a fruit knife he found at home. 

134
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,340
 The fact that he didn't bring a weapon 

135
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:03,430
 means Lee Jun Ho's objective wasn't to attack Su Ah or me. 

136
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,730
 It means he was looking for something. 

137
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,150
 If not the GPA tampering evidence, 

138
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,100
 what was Mr. Lee Jun Ho looking for? 

139
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,570
 The person who wants the notebook from me... 

140
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,790
 Seo Myeong Ju. 

141
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,360
Great work.

142
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:15,530
But I heard there was an accident last night.

143
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,100
How are you going to take care of it?

144
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,030
Please keep your promise.

145
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,070
You promised if I did as I was told,

146
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:32,020
my name wouldn't come up in the tampering case.

147
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,770
And you also promised that...

148
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:37,430
you wouldn't ask me to tamper with their grades again.

149
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:40,710
What promise? You stabbed someone.

150
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,850
Mr. Lee, are you a psychopath or something?

151
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:48,100
I won't ask what the notebook is or who Jeong Hae Seong really is.

152
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,770
Instead...

153
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,360
I trust that you will protect me.

154
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,220
Why would I?

155
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:02,540
If I get arrested, you will be in a tough spot.

156
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,230
Oh, I see. That's what happens.

157
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,750
Fine. Mr. Lee Jun Ho, I think we're done here.

158
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,390
You should go now. Don't you need to prep for class?

159
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,270
I will trust you, Chairwoman.

160
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,710
Mr. Lee Jun Ho?

161
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,000
Thanks for all your hard work.

162
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,960
   

163
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,390
   

164
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,950
   

165
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,400
The fourth urban legend.

166
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,470
I keep asking around, but no one...

167
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,780
knows.

168
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:13,310
 Has our school gym ever been remodeled? 

169
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,320
So...

170
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,730
he's the only one with the answer.

171
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,650
 Mr. Lee Jun Ho took the notebook? 

172
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,720
I think that's what he was after.

173
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,140
He happened to run into you in the process.

174
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,680
He's being used by the chairwoman.

175
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,090
 We need to catch him and make him testify 

176
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,470
to catch Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju,

177
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,720
who made a mockery of the students and me.

178
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:01,480
Find out what the fourth legend is, no matter what.

179
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:07,400
Under these circumstances, it would be much too dangerous for Jeong Hae Seong to stay in school.

180
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,270
Okay. Got it.

181
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,350
What's going on, Ye Na?

182
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,910
The upcoming school math competition.

183
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:31,610
Am I the designated first-place winner?

184
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,440
If I say yes?

185
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:42,390
Is that all you wanted to say?

186
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:45,300
I want to take the test properly this time.

187
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,120
I'll win first place with my own skill.

188
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,950
I promise.

189
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:54,100
So, Mom, this timeâ€”

190
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,990
I am so frustrated.

191
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:06,690
Why do you keep making yourself anxious?

192
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,720
You have a safe path right in front of you.

193
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,600
I don't want to be ashamed.

194
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:22,790
I want to be proud to be your daughter.

195
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,600
Please say yes, Mom.

196
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,680
Excuse me, Chairwoman.

197
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:53,030
Maybe you should honor Ye Na's wishes this time.

198
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:58,750
It's the first time she's asked you for anything.

199
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:02,260
It must not have been easy for her to ask that.

200
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,760
I know you want a lot from Ye Na,

201
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:11,810
as your late father wanted a lot from you, but...

202
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,520
Please don't bring up my father.

203
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,770
I'm sorry. I was out of line.

204
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,500
Proceed with Ye Na winning the contest as planned.

205
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,530
Find a replacement for Mr. Lee Jun Ho.

206
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,190
Yes. Got it.

207
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,010
What do you think, Sunbae?

208
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,470
About what?

209
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:55,690
Team Leader and Jeong Sunbae.

210
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:58,450
Isn't it way too icy between them?

211
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,270
They're probably in a fight.

212
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,810
I think it's way more than that.

213
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:07,340
Did something really happen between them?

214
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,050
Hey, look in front of you. There.

215
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,000
That's the principal, right?

216
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,750
Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju's henchman.

217
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,360
Hey, Sunbae.

218
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,730
Park Jae Moon is here to see Mr. Lee Jun Ho.

219
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,730
They're moving faster than I expected.

220
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,370
Where are they now?

221
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,940
He's getting in.

222
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,700
Going for a drive in Park Jae Moon's car.

223
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,500
- We need Lee Jun Ho alive. Follow them. 
  - Got it. 

224
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,820
   

225
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,120
Where are we going?

226
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,600
Why are we here right now?

227
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,170
Over there...

228
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,640
Get him out.

229
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:48,510
Put him in a car and throw him in.

230
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:02,960
They're trying to bury him alive, right?

231
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,250
It'll be a while until Sunbae gets here.

232
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,290
We should stop it.

233
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:10,540
How? We're far outnumbered!

234
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,750
Then, do we do nothing?

235
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,140
Remember the NIS martial arts classes?

236
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,610
I'll lead.

237
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,750
I'm sorry, Sunbae.

238
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,070
I showed you my cowardly side.

239
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,360
Let's go together.

240
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,630
All right.

241
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,760
I told you the two of us couldn't do it!

242
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,580
Stop talking down to me!

243
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,950
 Help us! 

244
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,860
Help! Help!

245
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,780
Help us!

246
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,890
- Mr. Lee! 
 - Don't!

247
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,510
- Mr. Lee! 
 - Why are you sleeping?

248
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,350
- Help us! 
 - What do we do? What!

249
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:38,170
Hey! Park Jae Moon!

250
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:40,160
You're going to regret this!

251
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,110
This is murder!

252
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:47,090
Our people will not let this go!

253
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,810
Where are we going?

254
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:51,280
Stop! Stop!

255
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,620
No, no, no! Hold on!

256
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,110
Stop!

257
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,470
No! No!

258
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,980
No!

259
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,910
- No! 
 - No!

260
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:05,250
No!

261
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,230
- Sunbae! 
 - Sunbae!

262
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:42,150
Is this part of the principal's job description?

263
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:44,050
Sure seems like an extreme job.

264
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,390
We've met, right?

265
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,400
Don't run away this time.

266
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,550
I was hoping we wouldn't have trouble.

267
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,330
Get rid of him!

268
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,520
He pressed it!

269
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,530
He pressed it...

270
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,460
Oh, no...

271
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,060
Oh, no, no...

272
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:17,260
Don't worry, Sunbae.

273
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:20,840
I'm going to protect you somehow.

274
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,970
Young Hun...

275
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,590
Sunbae.

276
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,800
Young Hun!

277
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:52,180
I'm scared!

278
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,920
You son of a bitch!

279
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,300
How are you going to protect me?

280
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,290
Hey, Lee Jun Ho! Get up!

281
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,880
All because of you...

282
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,950
Wake up!

283
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,390
Wake up, man! We're here because of you!

284
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:40,130
- Sunbae! 
 - Open your eyes!

285
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,640
Open your eyes!

286
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,560
Don't cry!

287
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,990
Lie down!

288
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:50,850
Lie down! Lie down!

289
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,880
Please save us, merciful Buddha...

290
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,920
- No, no... 
 - We're all going to die...

291
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:17,600
No, no...

292
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,740
No, no!

293
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,180
No...

294
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:28,820
We're going to die!

295
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,470
We're alive.

296
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,050
Sunbae!

297
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,590
 The phone is turned off. After the beep, you'll be connected to the voicemail 

298
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:41,130
 and there will be a charge. 

299
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,260
Why did you do it?

300
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,440
Even if what you did to me was a mistake,

301
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,840
what you've been doing at school isn't.

302
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,730
How did you know?

303
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,140
Seo Myeong Ju made me do it. I had no choiceâ€”

304
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,250
How about the kids impacted by your actions?

305
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:37,020
The kids who smiled and bowed to you.

306
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,980
How could you stand to look at them?

307
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:44,540
You've got a chance to make up for your mistakes.

308
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,980
Please don't miss it.

309
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,940
- Hey, Young Hun. 
  - Sunbae. 

310
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,930
 I handed the principal over to the police. 

311
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:14,370
 What will you do with Mr. Lee Jun Ho? 

312
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,870
I'll hand him over myself.

313
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,940
I'll report to Team Leader, too.

314
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,960
 Oh, okay, Sunbae. 

315
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,960
Stay here until tomorrow.

316
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,460
Don't even think about leaving.

317
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,910
Your phone.

318
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,660
Why do you need that?

319
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,190
Seo Myeong Ju may be tracking you.

320
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,850
You can go.

321
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:52,360
Let me ask you one thing before I go.

322
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,760
Who are you?

323
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,520
A high school student.

324
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,100
Hey, Hae Seong.

325
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,330
Seo Myeong Ju's GPA tampering.

326
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,730
I think I can prove it.

327
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,380
How?

328
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:40,210
The accomplice to the GPA tampering is the same guy who stabbed Su Ah.

329
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,900
 Mr. Lee Jun Ho from Byeongmun High. 

330
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,950
He's under our protection at the safe house.

331
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,770
Mr. Lee Jun Ho is at the safe house?

332
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:49,190
Until 7:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

333
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,070
 When the police speak to him tomorrow, 

334
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,440
Seo Myeong Ju will be subpoenaed eventually.

335
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,940
- Yes. 
  - If the tampering is revealed, 

336
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:02,060
the VIP parents will drop out of Seo's project and it will be over for her and Edu-City.

337
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,140
- Ahjussi. 
 - Yeah?

338
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,960
I'm...

339
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:15,140
going to get some rest at home.

340
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:03,120
   

341
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:16,200
   

342
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,390
 Gosh, I found you at last. 

343
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,210
 Hold these. 

344
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,100
 Hey, you. 

345
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,910
 Why did you run away without a word? 

346
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:31,890
 Auntie and I looked for you all day. 

347
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,150
   

348
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,900
 Done. 

349
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,710
 You must be hungry. 

350
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,780
 Let's go eat. 

351
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:45,170
   

352
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,570
 Here, eat up. 

353
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:01,400
 It's not poisoned. Look. 

354
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,370
 So delicious. 

355
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,390
 It's okay. Eat. 

356
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,920
 Thank you for the food. 

357
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,430
 Sure. 

358
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,150
 Si Hyeon. 

359
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,020
 Do you hate our house? 

360
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,420
 You keep disappearing without a word. 

361
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,850
 That's not my house. 

362
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:29,520
 Don't look for me anymore. 

363
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,170
 I'm an orphan, so I need to do everything myself. 

364
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:37,950
 Gosh, I don't know about that. 

365
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,850
 Why would you be an orphan, Si Hyeon? 

366
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:43,220
 I don't have a mom or a dad. 

367
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,820
 My mom passed away, 

368
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,350
 and my dad... 

369
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:51,280
 my dad... 

370
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,640
 I'm sure your dad will be back. 

371
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,040
 Until then, 

372
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:06,590
 I'll be... your dad, Si Hyeon. 

373
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,100
 Don't cry. 

374
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,060
 Don't cry... 

375
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,830
 It's okay. 

376
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,250
 Don't cry. 

377
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,570
 It's okay, it's okay. 

378
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,720
 Don't cry... 

379
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,530
 Yes, Hae Seong. 

380
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,720
Where are you?

381
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,370
 I'm on my way to work. What's up? 

382
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,760
 Hello? 

383
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,070
Hello? Hae Seong?

384
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:29,050
 Ahjussi... 

385
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:32,020
I need to apologize to you about something.

386
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,210
Actually, Iâ€”

387
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:40,490
 I already know. 

388
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,770
We've spent over 20 years together.

389
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:45,100
Do you think I don't know you?

390
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,760
I'm sorry.

391
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,410
Let's get some unagi and soju later.

392
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,500
You're buying, of course.

393
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,420
 I'm busy right now. 

394
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,340
Hang up and get ready for school.

395
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,640
Aren't you going to school?

396
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,980
See you later.

397
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,980
Have a good one.

398
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,340
Ms. Su Ah!

399
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,050
You're here.

400
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:45,110
Gosh, look at you. Your tiny face is tinier than usual.

401
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,800
How are you feeling?

402
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,460
I'm a little under the weather, but I'm okay.

403
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,690
Right, Mr. Jun Ho.

404
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:58,670
While you were away, Mr. Jun Ho worried a lot.

405
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,830
- How come he's not picking up? 
  - The call is not... 

406
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,590
   

407
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:21,070
You invited me to visit any time.

408
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:31,100
Still, you should've made an appointment. That would've been polite.

409
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,300
Since we both know everything there is to know,

410
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,300
let me ask you one thing.

411
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,510
You know a lot about me.

412
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,720
I know a lot about you, too.

413
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,670
I know your rat within the NIS,

414
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:53,930
what you plan to do with King Gojong's gold, and what you hope to accomplish.

415
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:56,050
I know everything.

416
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,820
But I can't figure out one thing.

417
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,120
Why me?

418
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:10,890
Why did you put me on this mission?

419
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,650
What happened to my father?

420
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:16,410
Why are you...

421
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:18,560
asking me that?

422
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,570
I didn't expect an answer...

423
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,410
Let's get to business.

424
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:29,500
 Byeongmun, a prestigious Korean private school. 

425
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:34,360
 Today, internal staff announced his intent to expose the GPA tampering. 

426
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:38,140
 - Stop filming! 
 - I said stop filming! 

427
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,310
   

428
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,850
 Will you really expose their GPA tampering? 

429
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:43,890
 I commit to sharing details with the police. 

430
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:47,290
 We hear the Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju threatened your life to shut you up. 

431
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:48,990
 I will share more during the investigation. 

432
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,440
 Please, one more thing! 

433
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,070
How do you feel?

434
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,930
So boring.

435
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:04,880
And you're so amateurish.

436
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,360
You think a mere teacher's testimony will affect me so much thatâ€”

437
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,100
Do you think?

438
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,980
Here's the evidence Mr. Lee Jun Ho gave me.

439
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,530
 Here. 

440
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,900
 What is this? 

441
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,490
Proof that you directed the entire grading scheme.

442
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:33,630
GPA tampering and soliciting murder.

443
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:36,980
We'll trace the Kim Hyeon Ho case back to you.

444
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,930
Congratulations.

445
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:41,230
You'll rot in there for at least ten years.

446
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,970
Sounds like an urgent call. Better answer.

447
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:50,290
Soon, the police will arrive. Brace yourself.

448
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,230
Oh, also.

449
00:40:56,230 --> 00:41:01,040
You should offer your guests tea or something.

450
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,140
That would be polite.

451
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,790
   

452
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:20,800
What?

453
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,680
Hey, let's go in.

454
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,380
â™«  It's chasing after me without stopping  â™«

455
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,830
â™«  There is nowhere to hide  â™«

456
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:35,160
Whoa! Guys! Daebak! Daebak incident!

457
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,800
Look what's going on at school!

458
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,690
 This is causing ripples. 

459
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:41,930
 According to Mr. Lee, who made the report, 

460
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:44,970
 they have manipulated student transcripts... 

461
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:47,600
We are currently looking into it.

462
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:52,840
 Award winners are pre-determined as well, as part of a total GPA tampering scheme. 

463
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:57,510
 The VIP parents and children are behind the tampering, 

464
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:01,790
 and Lee, who reported the incident, admitted to partaking. 

465
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:07,120
Dad, you told me nothing would happen.

466
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,160
Study abroad? Howâ€”

467
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,760
How can I study abroad when I don't speak English?

468
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,020
You said you'd take care of it!

469
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:18,120
You said nothing would happen... Geez!

470
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,340
â™«  Hey, yo! â™«

471
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:22,420
Please explain yourself.

472
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,350
 Please move! 

473
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:29,630
 What's more shocking is Lee's testimony that Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju tried to kill him. 

474
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:33,930
 Lee whistleblew Byeongmun's GPA tampering and Seo Myeong Ju suspected of soliciting murder. 

475
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:38,810
 The future of Edu-City, a Byeongmun Foundation project, is unclear. 

476
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:43,040
 The focus is on how the school will respond. 

477
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,630
 This is Joo Gi Jin, MBS. 

478
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,860
â™«  Hey, yo! â™«

479
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:03,450
Su Ah.

480
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,840
Yeah?

481
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,350
You saved this school.

482
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:13,740
Without you, this place wouldn't have changed.

483
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:18,540
Thank you, Ms. Oh.

484
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:21,440
Thanks.

485
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:09,370
It's not looking great, Chairwoman.

486
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:12,440
Edu-City is no longer on the horizon.

487
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:16,070
The parents are distancing themselves.

488
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,290
And the chairwoman position...

489
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:25,280
Do you have a solution to this quagmire?

490
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,030
No solutions...

491
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:36,810
No plans to keep our promise...

492
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:39,350
Looks like this is it for me.

493
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:45,550
This is a skilled attorney that I know.

494
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:48,200
He's good at ghostwriting letters of apology.

495
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:53,020
Try giving him a call if you'd like.

496
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,960
You have no idea how far a crazy bitch...

497
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:34,830
with nothing to lose is willing to go.

498
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:38,590
How can you be so fearless?

499
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:48,720
Here. Great work on the Seo Myeong Ju case.

00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:57,970
What were you about to apologize to me for this morning?

501
00:45:57,970 --> 00:45:59,900
What?

502
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:00,890
You said you know.

503
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:06,580
It just felt like I should pretend that I knew.

504
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:10,040
Hey, come on.

505
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:13,430
It's okay. Be honest with me.

506
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:17,260
You got into trouble again at school, didn't you?

507
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:21,790
Wow, you're driving me crazy.

508
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:27,330
I...

509
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:29,880
I...

510
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,350
I actually suspected you, Ahjussi.

511
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:37,040
Did you suspect me?

512
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,080
Why?

513
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:41,170
A-About what?

514
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:46,120
I found my NIS file and our confidential mission in the chairwoman's room.

515
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:50,030
I wondered if you were Seo Myeong Ju's rat.

516
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:52,100
That's what I thought.

517
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:56,450
No wonder you've been so irritable lately.

518
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:59,340
That's why...

519
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:03,470
Why didn't you ask me about it?

520
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,990
Because we're family.

521
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:10,050
I figured you had a lot going on.

522
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:12,010
I was giving you time.

523
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:16,260
You just wait and trust like that.

524
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,380
That's what families do.

525
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,360
Whatever.

526
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,780
Drink up.

527
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,850
So, did you figure out who the rat is?

528
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:43,090
It's just one person.

529
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:45,350
Is it Director Kim by chance?

530
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:49,140
How did you know?

531
00:47:56,430 --> 00:48:03,350
Twenty-two years ago, your dad called me on the day he went missing.

532
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:07,460
"I have something to say about Director Kim.

533
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:09,510
Let's meet up right now."

534
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:13,520
I wracked my brain after receiving his call.

535
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:21,310
Should I report this to the higher-ups or not?

536
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:25,180
I had no idea what mission Jae Hyeon was on.

537
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:29,340
When I got to the meeting spot late, he wasn't there.

538
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:32,300
I've lived...

539
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:36,060
with that this whole time.

540
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:45,190
Why haven't you ever told me?

541
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:49,090
Because I was afraid it was my fault.

542
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:53,550
What if that happened to your dad...

543
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:58,660
because I couldn't trust him?

544
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,460
Because I got there late?

545
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,110
And if you found that outâ€”

546
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,610
You were worried I'd hate you?

547
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:17,920
Ahjussi.

548
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:24,000
We've spent more than 20 years together.

549
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,530
We've been together too long for me to hate you.

550
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:34,670
Agent Jeong Jae Hyeon's mission from 22 years ago.

551
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,630
I will complete it.

552
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,310
I will find everything.

553
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,270
The gold bars...

554
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:49,240
and my father.

555
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:54,640
So, don't cry.

556
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:01,790
You look really ugly when you cry, Ahjussi.

557
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:08,310
I'm not crying.

558
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:13,100
I didn't bring my wallet.

559
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:15,790
You buy.

560
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:17,270
Are you kidding me?

561
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:18,880
I always buy!

562
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,110
You get paid more than me!

563
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:24,100
My salary goes straight to your auntie's account.

564
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,520
You buy.

565
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,580
You need to buy at least once!

566
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:30,420
You buy, like you always do.

567
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,740
They're fighting again.

568
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,430
Wow.

569
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:36,130
Why are you fighting again? I told you to make up.

570
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:37,750
He's telling me to pay up again!

571
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:39,200
It's your fault, Team Leader.

572
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,260
Stop it. You get paid a lot.

573
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:44,700
Sunbae, I left my wallet behind.

574
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,240
- How dare you... 
 - I'm sorry.

575
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,350
- We'll take two! 
  - Okay. 

576
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:51,450
Team Leader, did you cry?

577
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:53,900
- Hey, I have dry eyes. 
 - He really cried.

578
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,670
I think he did.

579
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:58,930
 - You look ugly as hell. 
 - I think you cried. 

580
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:08,930
"The bead shall shine like gold in the red sun"?

581
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:10,920
What is this?

582
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,840
You don't know?

583
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:16,070
- I don't know. 
 - How can you not know!

584
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:17,720
You said you like urban legends.

585
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,030
How is that related to this?

586
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:22,800
Why are you lashing out at me?

587
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,930
I'm leaving!

588
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:27,660
Hey, hey, okay. Sorry, sorry.

589
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:32,480
Did you find out anything about the last urban legend?

590
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,900
- No. 
 - Geez!

591
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,570
Wait.

592
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:40,660
There's one thing.

593
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:44,480
What happens to the person when you learn about the last urban legend?

594
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,580
What happens?

595
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:50,720
Of course, this makes no sense, but...

596
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,060
they'll be cursed by the school.

597
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:56,240
The person who finds out about the last story.

598
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,080
Is that right?

599
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,450
Sure.

600
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:02,110
The vanishing phenomenon.

601
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:06,790
They disappear without a trace.

602
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,910
Out of the blue.

603
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,760
As you all know, a major incident occurred at our school recently.

604
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:22,950
People are asking who the VIP parents are and which students benefited from the tampering.

605
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:26,260
The school is upside down.

606
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:29,380
I'm still shocked that Mr. Jun Ho participated.

607
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:32,070
- Me, too. 
 - The police will be investigating,

608
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:35,500
so please make sure there's no witch-hunting

609
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,840
or rumors amongst the students.

610
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:43,900
Also, a superintendent will be visiting us tomorrow.

611
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,240
You know what that means, right?

612
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:50,530
Who among you will prepare and manage the visit?

613
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:52,800
Come on...

614
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,030
Seriously, teachers?

615
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:58,110
The meeting will go on like this, then.

616
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:00,880
 Wait and see. I won't take it on this time. 

617
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,140
Fine. Let's do this this time.

618
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:07,140
Who here doesn't want to do it?

619
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:09,550
It was stand up if you don't want to last time.

620
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:10,660
Right.

621
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,740
Who here doesn't want to do it?

622
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,030
Me!

623
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:15,830
Take a seat.

624
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:19,380
Sure, Ms. Oh. You will do it. It's decided.

625
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,110
Great!

626
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:31,970
Better hear out the full sentence.

627
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:34,250
But last time, he said stand up if you don't want!

628
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:37,060
I thought I was reading the room!

629
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:38,710
   

630
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:44,710
Hey, have you heard?

631
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:47,790
Han Seung Jae in Homeroom 2 quit school to go study abroad.

632
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:50,020
He must be guilty of GPA tampering.

633
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:52,500
I can't believe this happened at our school.

634
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,250
What about Seo Myeong Ju and the murder solicitation?

635
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:56,290
Right?

636
00:53:56,290 --> 00:53:59,420
Yet Ye Na is acting like nothing is wrong.

637
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:01,180
After what happened to her mom...

638
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:05,070
I'm sure she's involved in GPA tampering, too.

639
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:06,620
Think about it.

640
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:09,400
Would the chairwoman leave her daughter out?

641
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,930
Right on.

642
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:15,360
What are you chatting about?

643
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,450
You're not talking crap about someone, are you?

644
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:20,040
Of course not, Ms. Oh. No way.

645
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,340
- Right? 
 - Never ever.

646
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:28,710
Of course. Ho Jin, you would never do something idiotic like that. Right?

647
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:53,420
It hurts if you scratch like that.

648
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,600
It's tough these days, huh?

649
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,590
I'm okay.

650
00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:14,000
I know what my mom did was wrong.

651
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,860
Even if I didn't know about the GPA tampering,

652
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,570
since I'm the chairwoman's daughter,

653
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:24,040
I know that I'm not completely innocent.

654
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:27,680
I understand why the kids are badmouthing me.

655
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,550
I'm okay.

656
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:31,760
It's not tough at all.

657
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:37,170
From my perspective, I think it's okay to be struggling.

658
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:41,500
It's okay to cry,

659
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,770
and it's okay to hurt.

660
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:46,880
Don't take responsibility for adults' mistakes.

661
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,900
It's not your fault.

662
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,930
It's okay, Ye Na.

663
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:06,820
Want some candy?

664
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:12,970
What is this, out of the blue?

665
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:15,580
My emergency food supply.

666
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:18,390
Sweets are the best mood boosters.

667
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:21,350
Here.

668
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:27,630
Want me to peel it for you?

669
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:29,200
No?

670
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,500
You're not scared?

671
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,660
I can see you.

672
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:49,320
You caused all this trouble at school, right?

673
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,590
Why do you always blame me for everything?

674
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:53,270
Is that so?

675
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:56,200
Let that person know when you find out who.

676
00:56:56,200 --> 00:57:00,820
That he made our school a better place.

677
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,440
What are you reading?

678
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:11,610
Do you know about the last urban legend of your school?

679
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:12,810
You're top of the class.

680
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:14,120
I have no idea.

681
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,660
You're so not helpful.

682
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,390
Isn't it about time you told me about the mission?

683
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:23,540
I'm not telling you.

684
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:24,710
Tell me!

685
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:27,180
Your little sister is begging you!

686
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:33,410
What's up now?

687
00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:35,190
Hwi, as in to hide...

688
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:37,030
Gyeong, as in bead.

689
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:38,260
- Right? 
 - Yes.

690
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,980
"Hwi gyeong." To hide a bead.

691
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:43,420
Hide a bead...

692
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:47,020
Beholder of the bead...

693
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:48,940
What are you talking about?

694
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:52,210
- I'm leaving. 
 - W-Wait...

695
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:55,720
He always just takes off when he's done talking.

696
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,950
Hwi gyeong...

697
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:00,400
Hwi gyeong.

698
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:08,560
Team Leader, the first part of the evidence.

699
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,170
The beholder of the bead.

700
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:11,800
That refers to Seo Byeong Mun himself.

701
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,760
Okay! You figured out one thing.

702
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:16,600
Hey.

703
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,050
What do you mean that refers to Seo Byeong Mun?

704
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:23,670
When he faces the red sun, the gold reveals itself.

705
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:26,140
Let me look into it.

706
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:30,830
Yes. Okay, honey.

707
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:32,980
I'll be home late today.

708
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,770
That weasel.

709
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:39,700
That wasn't for you.

710
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:41,430
And?

711
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:44,780
You heard the superintendent is coming tomorrow?

712
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:47,140
 - Yes. 
 - Yes. 

713
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:49,280
Don't be nervous.

714
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,930
They're coming to check if our school is okay since the chairwoman left.

715
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:55,140
Our school, my foot.

716
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:59,630
Right, no school of mine does GPA tampering.

717
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:01,590
What if they never got caught?

718
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:03,070
This place is far gone.

719
00:59:03,070 --> 00:59:05,860
 How could a school be like this? 

720
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:08,700
 Seriously... 

721
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,910
I will...

722
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:14,460
I will apologize on behalf of the school.

723
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:17,120
The school shouldn't have done this to you.

724
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:20,600
I'm sorry, guys.

725
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,420
But I promise.

726
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:25,100
This will never happen again.

727
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:29,330
I will try my best so that you can love your school again,

728
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:33,700
and that you can remember this school and this classroom fondly.

729
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:36,770
I will do my very best.

730
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:39,400
But you're a temp...

731
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:43,770
I'm still a teacher, even if I'm contracted.

732
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:49,120
Another day of great work. Any questions?

733
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:52,480
Are you preparing for the superintendent's visit?

734
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,390
- Yes, I am. 
 - What about the cleaning?

735
00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:57,130
That's all on you, too?

736
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:58,940
I guess so.

737
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:02,820
I've been tasked with fixing the school's image.

738
01:00:03,490 --> 01:00:05,200
Any other questions?

739
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,650
In that case, that's all for today.

740
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:12,150
Great work today, and see you tomorrow with all smiles. That's all.

741
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:14,340
I'll do it with you.

742
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:18,800
This is our school.

743
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,170
They say a school belongs to its students.

744
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:25,460
I want to help.

745
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:31,080
It's not like I've got plans. I'll join.

746
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,630
Me, too.

747
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:34,630
- We shall protect... 
 - Our turf!

748
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:36,990
The school itself is not bad.

749
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:38,300
 I'll help, too. 

750
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,010
- Me, too! 
 - Me, too!

751
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:42,610
Me, too.

752
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:46,940
â™«  When I open a small window  â™«

753
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:49,420
â™«  The starlight that brightens the room shines on me  â™«

754
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:51,990
You've never cleaned before, have you?

755
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:54,390
So dusty!

756
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:00,040
â™«  If I send my heart with the wind  â™«

757
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:04,030
â™«  Will it reach you?  â™«

758
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:06,800

760
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:11,620
Guys!

761
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:15,400
â™«  A night filled with falling stars  â™«

762
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,990
Let me see!

763
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:19,500
My eyes are closed!

764
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:20,890
You look better here than in real life.

765
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:22,280
No, no. Take it again.

766
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,860
Hey, Jeong Hae Seong.

767
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:26,210
You guys just take it.

768
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:28,670
No way. Get in the photo!

769
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:31,460
Let's take one together!

770
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:32,930
 Again! 

771
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:34,550
Let us get in on it!

772
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:36,500
Hey, let me join!

773
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:39,210
â™«  When I run and reach out my hand  â™«

774
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,640
- Just a second! 
 - Hurry! Hurry!

775
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,590
Taking it now.

776
01:01:45,590 --> 01:01:48,190
One, two, three.

777
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:55,580
â™«  Call my name  â™«

778
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,910
O-Okay, i-it's okay.

779
01:01:57,910 --> 01:02:02,040
Don't get too nervous about the superintendents.

780
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,760
What should I say? Just trust me.

781
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,510
Business as usual, got it? Business as usual.

782
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:09,440
Got it? Just as you've been doing.

783
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:40,030
Superintendents, welcome.

784
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:42,220
Come this way. This way, please.

785
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:44,330
Yes... this way...

786
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,870
Guys!

787
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:16,690
Crazy! Daebak!

788
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:18,630
Gosh, he always says daebak.

789
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:20,850
What? Why?

790
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:30,980
I heard.

791
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:33,450
You almost died?

792
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:40,180
You'd better be extra careful from now on.

793
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:05,890
Our paths are crossing often lately.

794
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,870
The school uniform suits you.

795
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:16,650
But unfortunately,

796
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,820
it's time to...

797
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,740
stop playing student.

 From now on, it's a speed game.

 If we don't find the gold tonight, Seo Myeong Ju might snatch it away. 

807
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:38,400
 Tell me before I crush you. 

808
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,490
 You can't find the gold without me. 

809
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:42,310
 Even if it's Ms. Oh Su Ah next?

 Why don't you take it all the way? 

811
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:46,450
 I hope you get my point. 

812

 Aren't you scared? 

813
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:49,640
 I am, but I'm sticking through.
