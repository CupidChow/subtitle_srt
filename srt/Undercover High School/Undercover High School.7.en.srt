Wait. Come on.

4
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,550
Who was it? Tell me.

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,320
Why do you even want to know?

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,619
Don't be like that and tell me.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,290
I can't sleep with this hanging over my head.

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,190
Wait, it's raining.

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,560
What...

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,299
Oh Bong Ja, take this umbrella.

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,070
I told you not to call me by that name!

12
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,500
Just a second.

13
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,640
Mom, I don't go by Oh Bong Ja anymore.

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,140
Why is there only one umbrella?

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,510
That's me being smart.

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,980
- Don't leave him hanging and go! - What?

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,420
All right, fine.

18
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:54,950
What were you going on about?

19
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,190
(Have a Drink With Su A)

20
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,030
Sorry about that. We only had one umbrella.

21
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,160
Shall we? Where do you live?

22
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,430
Have you lost it?

23
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,910
Is Bong Ja your name?

24
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,940
Oh Bong Ja?

25
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,510
Yes, that's what I went by.

26
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,349
Who are you to smirk at someone else's name?

27
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,619
It's not that. You're totally mistaken.

28
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,449
I know the name is old-fashioned,

29
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,790
but it's rude to laugh in front of me.

30
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,620
So much for walking you home.

31
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,090
- Get home yourself. - But...

32
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,160
How annoying.

33
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,819
Why are you already back?

34
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,790
Why didn't you go with that handsome young man?

35
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,460
What is it? What's wrong?

Let's get married.

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,070
You like me,

39
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,240
and I like you too, so let's get married.

40
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,820
You kind of look like him.

41
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,389
Who?

42
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,020
Just someone. Someone who's like my sworn enemy.

43
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,390
Was she talking about me?

44
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,030

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,509
Meanwhile, those are the parents in the academic management program.

Mom.

52
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,890
Hey, you're here.

53
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,659
Let them know we'll gather separately for tea...

54
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,859
during the event.

55
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,530
Yes, ma'am. I'll relay the message.

56
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,770
Have a good evening.

57
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,520
I heard something happened earlier at school today.

58
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,460
When were you going to tell me?

59
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,030
My Ye Na,

60
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,670
you are to be the face of the school.

61
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,830
But someone like that...

62
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,700
is cutting herself?

63
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,940
If word gets out,

64
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,380
I'll...

65
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,750
I'll be mortified.

66
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,190
I'm sorry, Mom.

67
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,220
I want my Ye Na...

68
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,160
to be strong.

69
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,299
Mom. Gosh, Mom...

70
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,939
Strong enough to know...

71
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,069
Mom...

72
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,380
that even cutting yourself won't change anything.

73
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,980
An important event awaits us.

74
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,350
Let's both cut ourselves all we want...

75
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,590
and shed all our tears.

76
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,220
Now that we're done,

77
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:00,920
we'll smile.

78
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,500
Whose daughter are you?

79
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,130
Yours, Mom.

80
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,070
Now, eat.

81
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:47,240
I didn't mean what I said

82
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:52,139
I was worried

83
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,149
You might see how I felt about you

84
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,380
That's all

85
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,920
My darling

86
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,990
I only have eyes for you

87
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,459
Please just focus on me, babe

88
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,659
Pretend you didn't

89
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,830
And I'll fake it too

90
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,330
Yes!

91
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,820
What were you doing?

92
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,450
When did you get here?

93
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,050
A second ago.

94
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,960
You could've announced yourself.

95
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,989
Do you normally come to school this early?

96
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,460
I couldn't sleep properly last night.

97
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,330
Since I was up, I figured...

98
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,369
Has the mission been compromised?

99
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,500
Of course not.

100
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,480
Anyway,

101
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,210
it's about that sworn enemy you once mentioned.

102
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,210
What about him?

103
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,180
Well...

104
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,990
It's nothing.

105
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,689
Why are you cleaning first thing in the morning?

106
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,420
Don't they have cleaning ladies?

107
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:15,790
Well,

108
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,729
this is me investing in myself.

109
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,429
You never know.

110
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,299
Someone might post a photo of my love of the school...

111
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,829
on the school bulletin board.

112
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,239
That will give me additional points...

113
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,640
when I'm being evaluated to become a full-time teacher.

114
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,069
I see you work hard.

115
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,380
Right? I work extremely hard.

116
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,180
It's admirable.

117
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,710
You'll get the job for sure.

118
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,080
I'll be rooting for you.

119
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,860
That was unexpected.

120
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,880
Is something up at home?

121
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,850

Ms. Kim.

124
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,860
This happened to a friend.

125
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,099
On a rainy day,

126
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,830
some guy pulled her toward him right in his arms...

127
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,070
to save her from being hit by a motorcycle.

128
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,270
Is her name Oh Su A by any chance?

129
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,540
Gosh, no. Keep listening.

130
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,149
And then, he went on to shower her...

131
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,780
with words of encouragement.

132
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,450
"You work hard."

133
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,420
"It's admirable." Like that.

134
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,890
What do you think? Didn't he give her the green light?

135
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,160
What's the relationship between this friend...

136
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,390
and the guy?

137
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,830
They're acquaintances...

138
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,600
with an eventful history.

139
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,670
They're just acquaintances and not in a fling?

140
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,870
It's nothing.

141
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Ms. Oh, here goes.

142
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,249
There's something...

143
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,819
that must be kept in mind by those like your friend...

144
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,380
who have never had a boyfriend before.

145
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,550
Don't mistake friendliness for romantic gestures.

146
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,419
I've seen many people be humiliated...

147
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,190
because they forgot that cardinal rule.

148
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,390
Tell your friend...

149
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,860
to be careful.

150
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,440
Teachers, gather around.

151
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,940
Over here.

152
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,349
We now have to decide on the face of Byeongmun High.

153
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,250
Look at the photos and openly voice...

154
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,119
- your personal opinions. - Sure.

155
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,390
I think Ye Na will represent the school quite nicely.

156
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,959
What do you think?

157
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,989
I like Ye Na for this too.

158
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,859
- Of course, it should be Ye Na. - Absolutely.

159
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,829
Good. Then that's it for the female student.

160
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,369
Let's move on to the male student.

161
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,169
Goodness. Look how handsome he is.

162
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,570
- He is a handsome one. - Right?

163
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,870
His parents must be proud because he is one handsome young man.

164
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,680
What do you think?

165
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,809
If no one objects,

166
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,949
Hyeon Joon will be chosen as...

167
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,020
A vote!

168
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,490
Let's put it to a vote.

169
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,490
Would that be necessary?

170
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,030
They say that voting is the key element of democracy.

171
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,560
And honouring that...

172
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,300
is how we show respect to the fighters of democracy.

173
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,600
It is also our duty as their decedents.

174
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,000
Why does choosing a model have to be a grand process?

175
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,840
Being sloppy for even a second...

176
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,740
could cause us to fall right back into a dictatorship.

177
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,009
As a teacher of Korean history...

178
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,550
who preaches about learning from the past,

179
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,790
I am deeply worried...

180
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:06,020
about this process.

181
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,819
Fine. We'll vote.

182
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,290
Put it to a vote.

183
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,700
Thank you.

184
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,270
Hurry up, will you? What's taking you so long?

185
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,900

00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,410
Oh, no.

188
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,640
Darn it.

189
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,310
Let's count the votes.

190
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:28,880
Ji Hyeon Joon.

191
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,150
Jeong Hae Seong.

192
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,190
(Jeong Hae Seong: 4, Ji Hyeon Joon: 4)

193
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,220
- Ji Hyeon Joon. - That's it.

194
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,930
Jeong Hae Seong.

195
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,000
(Jeong Hae Seong: 5, Ji Hyeon Joon: 5)

196
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,570
This is the last vote.

197
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,040
(Votes, Male Face of Byeongmun)

198
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,080
Please...

199
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,430
The results must be out by now.

200
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,499
I'm even more nervous now...

201
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,830
than I was before I took that beating from you.

202
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,430
Hae Seong will win, right?

203
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,070
I had a lucky dream last night.

204
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,070
Hae Seong will win for sure.

205
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,610
Guys, the faces of Byeongmun have been posted!

206
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,080
Hey!

207
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,690
Shoot.

208
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,050
Did you hear...

209
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,019
- about the face of Byeongmun? - Who won?

210
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,689
Jeong Hae Seong!

211
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,290
(The Faces of Byeongmun: Lee Ye Na, Jeong Hae Seong)

212
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,630
What a relief.

213
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,270
Thank you, Dad!

214
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,800
Hyeon Joon's Mom, of course.

215
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,209
I'm truly sorry about this.

216
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,639
I tried my best but...

217
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,580
That's it!

218
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,309
- Snacks are on me. - Snacks!

219
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,609
- Let's go. - Come on.

220
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,110
- Let's go! - This way!

221
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,280
It's his treat!

222
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,790
Nice!

223
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,059
Let's take a rain check on the snacks.

224
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,989
What? But you said you'd treat us.

225
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,229
I'm really sorry about this.

226
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,290
Hey!

227
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,500
Where are you headed?

228
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,170
- The library. - The library. Sure.

229
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,649
You read a lot of fancy books.

230
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,920
No wonder you have the highest grades.

231
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,190
All high school students are required to read these.

232
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,390
Try reading sometime.

233
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,730
Oh, this one.

234
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,620
Goodness.

235
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,620
Why are you following me?

236
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,650
I wasn't following you.

237
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:24,990
I was going my way.

238
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,530
Even a kid wouldn't be this childish.

239
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,700
Five minutes.

240
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,570
I have to get to class, so no more.

241
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,510
First of all,

242
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,550
I'll start with an apology.

243
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,820
I meddled in your life...

244
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,060
when I didn't know anything about it.

245
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,160
Sorry.

246
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,860
Were you tutored by someone?

247
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,160
What's gotten into you?

248
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,930
That's just how I feel.

249
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I...

250
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,770
don't want to see you hurting.

251
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:23,980
Ye Na...

252
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,050
isn't the mean girl you peg her to be.

253
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,520
She has it rough, that's all.

254
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,619
Her life is tough,

255
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,460
and I'm the only one who can take her crap.

256
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,260
She's only venting, so don't hate her too much.

257
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:43,970
Got it.

258
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,440
Your five minutes is up, so I'm off.

259
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,819
- Hey. - We're done...

260
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,360
looking into the detective on Kim Hyeon Ho's case,

261
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,790
but you need to hear this in person.

262
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,730
That's the bell, guys. Get to class!

263
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

264
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,539
Leaving school early. Cooperation requested.

265
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,970
What the...

266
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,939
How old is this jerk?

267
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,010
(Leaving school early, Cooperation requested)

268
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,240
Cooperation, my foot.

269
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,710
The detective on Kim Hyeon Ho's case...

270
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,319
We looked into everything from his accounts to his assets,

271
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,849
but nothing was out of the ordinary.

272
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,089
Then what was flagged?

273
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,220
The detective has a daughter.

274
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,519
She's been hospitalized for chronic kidney disease,

275
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,259
but she was recently moved to a hospital owned...

276
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,260
by the Byeongmun Foundation.

277
00:17:44,261 --> 00:17:47,000
The foundation is footing her medical bill.

278
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,870
"Recommendations made by Park Jae Mun,"

279
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,499
"Principal of Byeongmun High School."

280
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,630
The question is this.

281
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,139
Why did the principal have her admitted...

282
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,910
when he doesn't know the detective?

283
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,140
To hide the fact that he's the culprit.

284
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,210
By wrapping up the case as a suicide.

285
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,020
The archives in the basement of the old building...

286
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,690
were put up by my dad and not the chairwoman.

287
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,259
At first, I wondered if the chairwoman...

288
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,560
was also looking for the gold bars...

289
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,000
and thought that they could already be in her possession.

290
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,800
If Park Jae Mun was the one after the notebook,

291
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,810
it'd be safe to assume that the chairwoman...

292
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,810
hasn't found them yet.

293
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,550
If, and this is a big if.

294
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,249
Could Seo Myeong Ju have anything to do...

295
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,950
with your father's disappearance?

296
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,260
We'll soon find out.

297
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,100
(Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju)

298
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,220
For now, let's focus on the third ghost story.

299
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,290
- Mi Jeong. - Yes, sir.

300
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,489
I compared Byeongmun High's school song...

301
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,630
to the song Hae Seong recorded.

302
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,059
As you can see,

303
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,330
it's the same song but with different waveforms.

304
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,440
Judging by the spread of the notes and the number of them,

305
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,769
the school song you recorded...

306
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,769
has to be a piano four hands.

307
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:37,870
A piano four hands.

308
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,939
Two people must play the school song together.

309
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,509
Once you play the piece,

310
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,610
we'll get a clue about the last ghost story.

311
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,220
Who here can play the piano?

312
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,390
So much for things going smoothly.

313
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:01,960
Getting into the chairwoman's office wasn't our only obstacle.

314
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,540
Come on, you brats. What are you going to do about this?

315
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,840
I'll do it.

316
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,010
Ms. Oh?

317
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,510
Why do you keep entering while making a declaration?

318
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,580
Because it's cool.

319
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,420
Outside, I heard everything you said.

320
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,920
(Master Czerny)

321
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,160
Czerny that comes after Beyer?

322
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,890
The school song isn't that difficult to play.

323
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:34,299
Even with all thumbs, anyone will be able to play it...

324
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,869
after a few hours of practice.

325
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:36,930
Hold on.

326
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,670
This isn't a game.

327
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,239
If you get caught in the chairwoman's office,

328
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,609
you could get fired.

329
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:43,610
Really?

330
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,710
- Then I won't do it. - What?

331
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,779
That was unexpected.

332
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,149
Good thinking.

333
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,010
- Let's continue... - Wait.

334
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,019
- Ms. Oh will do it. - What?

335
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,420
A twist upon a twist.

336
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,190
We can't officially ask for assistance...

337
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,890
with this being a secret mission.

338
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,930
As of now, Ms. Oh is our best bet.

339
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,200
I'm sorry, but I don't want to.

340
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,540
No.

341
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,540
You can do this.

342
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,480
Because you are the one and only partner...

343
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,510
of NIS' finest agent Jeong Hae Seong...

344
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,320
and the honorary field agent...

345
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,490
of Domestic Team Four.

346
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,460
An honorary field...

347
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,560
agent?

348
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,030
What are you two doing?

349
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,529
What are you saying?

350
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:42,600
I'll do it.

351
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,170
I'm an honorary field agent, after all.

352
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,780
That's Ms. Oh for you.

353
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,780
She's our team's wild card.

354
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,309
Have you lost it?

355
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:01,080
I need you to promise me something in return.

356
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,119
(I, Senior Agent An Seok Ho of the NIS, will provide...)

357
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,360
(state-level support for Oh Su A's full-time teaching position...)

358
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,170
(November 10, 2025, An Seok Ho)

359
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,320
Nice.

360
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,120
Just a second.

361
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,290
- Come with me. - What?

362
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,630
I won't say this twice. Don't do it.

363
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,330
- Why not? - Because it's dangerous.

364
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,630
As if you need to ask.

365
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,970
Either way, you can't do this.

366
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,809
All faculty members of Byeongmun High...

367
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,940
are expected to be at the event anyway.

368
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,809
Anyway, it's already been decided,

369
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,280
so let's just focus on the mission at hand.

370
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
This.

371
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,090
Why are you hell bent on becoming a full-time teacher?

372
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,420
As if I need a reason.

373
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,890
No one wants to stay a temp.

374
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:23,730
But not everyone...

375
00:23:23,731 --> 00:23:25,430
willingly puts themselves in danger to achieve it.

376
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,240
So be honest with me.

377
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,580
I have to do it for someone.

378
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,160
This is what I like.

379
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,070
She was one of my first students,

380
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,770
and I made her a promise.

381
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,540
That I'd become a full-time teacher.

382
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:10,210
Darn.

383
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,050
That made things weird and killed the vibe.

384
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,749
Anyway, I have to become a full-time teacher...

385
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,489
and am ready to risk everything for it.

386
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,620
So please don't stop me.

387
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,860
What's life without a little risk?

388
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,070
Stay right beside me.

389
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,410
- Unbelievable. - Thanks.

390
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,320
This is wrong in every way.

391
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,620
You really are clueless.

392
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,719
Are you knowingly turning a blind eye...

393
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,390
or are you just dense?

394
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:57,730
Ms. Oh,

395
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,930
do you even care about your students?

396
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:05,270
Why was I so blunt with her that day?

397
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,540
Hold on.

398
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,440
Don't worry about it.

399
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,640
It can happen.

400
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,410
Why would you even care?

401
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,050
(Ms. Oh Su A)

402
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:24,720
This is Jeong Hae Seong.

403
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,920
Why are you speaking in a deeper voice?

404
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,400
What's up?

405
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,400
Principal Park showed up at the library!

406
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,980
Only two people can deactivate the security system.

407
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,250
Chairwoman Seo Myeong Ju and Principal Park Jae Mun.

408
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,350
The door can only be unlocked with their fingerprints.

409
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,290
Principal Park, hello.

410
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,699
Right. Hello, there.

("Love Everything")

412
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,170
Is that the book you're checking out?

413
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,980
That's actually what I came here to borrow.

414
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,410
Oh, dear. What do I do?

415
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,750
I really wanted to read that book today.

416
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,960
Take it first, then.

417
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,130
Really? Thank you.

418
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,630
(Byeongmun High School)

419
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:45,970
Thank you.

420
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,690
("Love Everything")

421
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
What's wrong?

422
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,440
It's nothing.

423
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,180
Are you stupid?

424
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,950
Do, sol.

425
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,580
Do, sol.

426
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,420
Do, sol. That's it.

427
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,350
You can't even memorize that?

428
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,160
Sorry.

429
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,390
(Meditation)

430
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,730
(Meditation)

431
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:29,410
("I Don't Understand My Own Mind," "Why Do I Feel This Way?")

432
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:36,350
Hello, this is about a friend of mine.

433
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:39,779
He's been acting weird. What is wrong with him?

434
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,850
(Question)

435
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,950
We will be prepared,

436
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,360
but we have no idea what could happen inside.

437
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,820
You need to be able to protect yourself...

438
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,260
in case I can't help you.

439
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,529
I can do the shoulder throw,

440
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,660
and I have a gas gun.

441
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,000
Weapons aren't allowed at the event venue.

442
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,570
I'll show you a few moves. Watch and learn.

443
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,040
All right.

444
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:05,070
When someone grabs your shoulder,

445
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,310
use your elbow on the other side like this...

446
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:09,850
and push their arm down.

447
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,980
Easy, right? Now, try it.

448
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,320
You're grabbing my shoulder.

449
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:17,190
- Use my elbow like this. - Yes, that's it.

450
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,560
- And push it down! - Ouch, hold on!

451
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,420
That really worked.

452
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,790
Okay, show me the next one. Show me something else.

453
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,429
It's an extension of what I showed you.

454
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,569
When someone grabs your shoulder like this,

455
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,400
use your elbow in the same manner...

456
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,300
to take them down...

457
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,650
That's it?

458
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,780
Well, there must be something else after this.

459
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,750
Try to get out of my grip if you can!

460
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,730
That's it for today's class.

461
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,710
- We're done already? - Ask no questions.

462
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,210
Today, I...

463
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,510
I have a lot on my mind today. I have to go.

464
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,080
What's with him?

465
00:30:20,081 --> 00:30:22,250
Jeong Hae Seong, you're acting so weird today.

466
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:23,720
Snap out of it.

467
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,860
Snap out of it!

468
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,900
Oh, my.

469
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,770
So, this is an NIS office?

470
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,240
Since you're now our honorary field agent,

471
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,080
we made an exception for you and brought you to our office.

472
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,310
Thank you.

473
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,750
My gosh.

474
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,520
- We closed the shop. - What?

475
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,360
The owner couple got into a fight in the US.

476
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,790
They returned earlier than expected.

477
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,790
What? Everything is happening so suddenly...

478
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,660
Do you have a cold?

479
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,430
Don't ask. I have a lot on my mind now.

480
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:12,570
Goodness.

481
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,020
Sir!

482
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,060
- It's a hot mess. - Why?

483
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,190
There's a civilian in Seok Ho's office.

484
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,460
I should have a word with him, right?

485
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:40,260
She's helping them with the mission. He told me earlier.

486
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,200
But I'm his manager.

487
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,200
He went over my head and told you?

488
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:52,840
Do you want some coffee-flavoured milk?

489
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:54,940
Come on. Let's go.

490
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:57,810
- Come on. - An Seok Ho, that little...

491
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,850
The Night for Byeongmunites will take place...

492
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,220
in the banquet hall on the first floor.

493
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,549
To solve the puzzle behind...

494
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,720
the third story, we must enter the chairwoman's office,

495
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,690
which is on the third floor of the annex.

496
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,490
The annex will be open for this special occasion,

497
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,030
but only registered guests can enter.

498
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,270
Hae Seong and Ms. Oh might struggle...

499
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,970
to pull off the operation if it's just the two of them.

500
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,439
So I want you to go inside with them, Yeong Hun.

501
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,770
- Yes, sir. - If needed,

502
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,710
Mi Jeong and I can back you guys up too,

503
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:30,780
but the students have already seen our faces,

504
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,020
so it'll be safer not to be seen together.

505
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,819
(Byeongmun High School, Annex Floor Plan)

506
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,190
(Annex 1st Floor, 2nd Floor, 3rd Floor)

507
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,990
During the operation, never forget...

508
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,060
that there are security cameras all over the annex...

509
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,960
and that there will be security guards in every corner.

510
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,300
Then how can we get to the chairwoman's office?

511
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,369
You'll have to go up to the third floor...

512
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:56,740
through the central staircase in the lobby.

513
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,070
The central staircase?

514
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,110
A teacher walking up the stairs in the annex...

515
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,180
with two students...

516
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,610
That will look very suspicious.

517
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:09,150
I'll try to figure out a way to distract everyone.

518
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,349
Okay.

519
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,090
Every year, the chairwoman has a tea session...

520
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,959
with the parents in the reception room...

521
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,230
halfway through the event.

522
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,530
Which means, she'll need to step out of her office for that.

523
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,400
That will be our golden chance.

524
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,300
Her office only has one door.

525
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,670
We have a fingerprint to open the door.

526
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,010
However, as soon as the door opens,

527
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,840
the entry record will automatically be sent to Seo Myeong Ju,

528
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,380
and it'll be saved on the server as well.

529
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,720
Even if you manage to get to the piano,

530
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,290
both you and Hae Seong will be expelled from the school...

531
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:53,560
if they find out that the two of you...

532
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,570
broke into the chairwoman's office, so brace yourselves.

533
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:57,670
What?

534
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,439
- What? - When you get to the door,

535
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,969
I'll step in remotely to make sure Seo Myeong Ju won't get the record,

536
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:04,970
so don't worry about that.

537
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:07,739
But anything saved on the offline server...

538
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,950
should be deleted manually in the chairwoman's office.

539
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,950
It's hard to make an exact duplicate of anyone's fingerprint,

540
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,590
but I tried my best to keep the error range to a minimum.

541
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,090
All right.

542
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,490
The operation will commence...

543
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,790
when the event begins at 8pm tomorrow.

544
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,330
Let's all...

545
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,400
do a good job and not make any mistakes.

546
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,500

arrive at the switchboard room.

How could you...

How many times have I told you to just come to me instead of...

687
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:15,180
Why do you care?

So, if you treat me like this...

695

I pity you.

At school, you act like...

702
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,149
you fear nothing as the student council president.

703
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:54,190
But in reality, you are...

704
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:12,640
Honestly, I don't even know anymore.

705

00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:40,499
Fortunately or not,

727
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,670
that day has not yet come, and I inherited the liquor.

728
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:46,130
My plan...

729
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:49,000
is to share this liquor with you...

730
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:52,239
to commemorate the day...

731
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,740
Edu-City is completed...

732
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:57,280
and a new era truly begins.

733
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:00,320
That would be a glorious day.

734
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:04,020
I think a child's potential is decided the moment they're born.

735
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:08,320
Even when we buy a mutt in the corner of a market,

736
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:09,990
we pick the healthiest one.

737
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:12,260
We're even more choosy with people.

738
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,000
Students with no hope or future...

739
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:18,800
should be made to give up sooner.

740
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:23,840
Looking out for such kids and forcing them to study...

741
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:27,009
by giving them a fair chance for the sake of equality of outcome?

742
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,410
I think that's a waste.

743
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,610
We're already short on taxes.

744
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:38,690
One genius supports tens of thousands of people.

745
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,720
The world is led by the elite one percent,

746
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:44,260
and my plan is to fill that one percent...

747
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:47,930
with Byeongmun graduates.

748
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:53,230
More accomplished graduates ready to lead the new era.

749
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:55,470
Just hearing that got me excited.

750
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:58,910
Congratulations in advance on your new Edu-City.

751
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:00,880
Thank you so much, ma'am.

752
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:03,640
But you know, it may look like...

753
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:07,480
the new era is at our doorstep.

754
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:10,490
But until the very last moment,

755
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:12,850
we must all give our best efforts...

756
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,520
to ensure what we want comes true.

757
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:18,060
Or that time will never come.

758
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,660
Until the day the world of the one percent comes,

759
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,000
could you all please...

760
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:27,299
give one percent more?

761
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,940
We'll do everything in our power...

762
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:31,339
so you accomplish what you set out to.

763
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,470
Thank you so much.

764
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:34,509
How about a toast?

765
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:35,640
Why not?

766
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:40,080
For our own one percent.

767
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,079
For Edu-City.

768
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,190
For Byeongmun Foundation.

769
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,020
- Cheers. - Cheers.

770
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:51,930
Thank you.

771
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,640
How about we discuss...

772
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,070
the program for our kids?

773
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,380
I'm sorry. I droned on.

774
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:08,939
That's fine.

775
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,110
Principal Park?

776
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,489
Bravo, bravo

777
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:27,900
To my very own life

778
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:32,599
To our brilliant future

779
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,800
If you're ready, let's begin.

780
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,640
Yeong Hun.

781
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:39,110
I'm outside the switchboard room.

782
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,610
Hae Seong and Ms. Oh.

783
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:42,080
We're ready.

784
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:45,980
Okay. Let's do this.

785
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,720
Power cut, counting down. Three,

786
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:49,980
two,

787
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:52,090
one.

788
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:53,960
(Annex, Power)

789
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:55,989
(The 24th Anniversary of Byeongmun High School)

790
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:57,430
- What happened? - What's wrong?

791
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:58,729
Where's the staff?

792
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:00,929
Everyone! I'm sure it's nothing.

793
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:01,930
Calm down.

794
00:50:01,931 --> 00:50:03,129
Calm down, kids.

795
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:05,200
- What's going on? - What's happening?

796
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,240
I don't know.

797
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:09,400
Go check it out.

798
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,280
It's a temporary power outage.

799
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,479
Quickly find out what happened.

800
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,510
Yes, ma'am.

801
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:20,680
Principal Park.

802
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:23,080
It's not a technical issue. It's an electrical malfunction.

803
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,590
It must be the switchboard room.

804
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,089
I'll check the switchboard room.

805
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:28,920
You secure the chairwoman's office.

806
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:55,920
Nice one, NIS.

807
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,350
- I didn't even see that. - We had no time.

808
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,560
We're heading to the chairwoman's office.

809
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:09,999
- Oh, good. - The power's back.

810
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,030
My gosh.

811
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:13,730
I'm sorry for the confusion. Shall we go downstairs?

812
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:20,640
The power shouldn't be back already.

813
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,479
- Go ahead. - Okay.

814
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,510
Excuse me.

815
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:29,920
Hello?

816
00:51:29,921 --> 00:51:31,290
The power is back on.

817
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,589
(Flowing electric current)

818
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:35,620
Okay.

819
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,830
What's this?

820
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:40,930
What happened?

821
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,660
You said it would take him three minutes to get there!

822
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,669
I didn't know he walked so fast.

823
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:47,030
This is madness.

824
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:51,010
Don't worry, sir.

825
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:52,940
We still have...

826
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,740
a hidden card for emergencies.

827
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:02,620
Who's in charge here?

828
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:07,920
Sorry. Who are you?

829
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,390
Me?

830
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,860
What's his name?

831
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:14,100
I'm some student's dad.

832
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:18,830
How could there be a power outage during such a big event?

833
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:22,140
I fell down the stairs and almost broke every bone!

834
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,240
You look just fine, sir.

835
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,150
My back.

836
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:38,190
The fourth lumbar vertebrae!

837
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,430
No, wait.

838
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:54,440
Now we can go.

839
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,430
It didn't work?

840
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,000
Yeong Hun, I need more time.

841
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:32,170
I get it, sir.

842
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:35,440
Instead of freaking out here, why not go to a hospital?

843
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,519
Is this how you react when a parent says...

844
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,720
he fell down the stairs?

845
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:44,850
You!

846
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:46,719
Do you know who I am?

847
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,889
You took my boss to eat, bathe, play soccer, play basketball,

848
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:52,189
play baseball, and jogged with him too, right?

849
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:54,330
- You can go. - Come on. Get going.

850
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:57,870
Okay, fine. I'll leave.

851
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:00,269
Even if I must...

852
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,800
You can't smoke indoors.

853
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,469
It's a perfect day to smoke outside.

854
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:07,010
- Get out. - Leave.

855
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:08,579
Wait. Who are you?

856
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:09,609
- Leave. - Wait!

857
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:11,680
Darn you!

858
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:21,160
How could you do this to me?

859
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,590
What about the baby I'm carrying?

860
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:29,400
Go that way.

861
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,130
Hurry!

862
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,010
Who are you?

863
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:39,940
Stay close.

864
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,379
Be prepared to use what I gave you.

865
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,580
You want me to poke someone with it?

866
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:45,610
An honorary field agent should.

867
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,620
Enough talking. Moving in.

868
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,620
- Darn you. - You punk.

869
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,260
Move.

870
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,300
Sorry.

871
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,670
Come here!

872
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,350
Behind you!

873
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,430
What was I to you?

874
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,730
Was I just a one-night stand?

875
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,760
We only kissed.

876
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:38,030
You said...

877
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:40,100
you didn't like me.

878
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,440
You fool! Don't you see how I feel?

879
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,330
You tried.

880
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,650
What's wrong with me?

881
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:42,600
Good job. Thanks.

882
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:47,130
Yeong Hun, clean up for me.

883
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:57,750
Going in.

884
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:05,050
Agent Jeong. Over there.

885
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,470
- What? - Never mind.

886
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:36,350
Next, we'll sing Byeongmun High School's song.

887
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:38,920
Please stand up.

888
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,419
Let's sing the school song.

889
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:46,530
(The 24th Anniversary of Byeongmun High School)

890
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:48,529
The event's continuing. Now's your chance.

891
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:50,060
Shall we begin?

892
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:51,700
Let's begin.

893
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,200
Three, four.

894
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:08,520
What's wrong?

895
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,390
This key isn't working.

896
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:13,190
Is it broken? Then...

897
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:15,660
there's no point in playing.

898
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,360
Let's keep going.

899
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:20,060
Something might happen at the end.

900
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,230
Okay. Let's start over.

901
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:42,480
Our country shines bright

902
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:46,920
And so does Byeongmun High

903
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:53,060
So does Byeongmun High

904
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,100
Nothing happened.

905
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,510
What now?

906
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:20,790
Hae Seong, leave for now.

907
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:22,590
It's dangerous for you to stay.

908
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:28,160
Delete your entry record and get out of there!

909
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:29,860
We're leaving.

910
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:59,060
(Command prompt)

919
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:11,370
Welcome to the NIS, Jeong Si Hyun.

920
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:15,870
Thank you.

921
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,170
You're a field agent,

922
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,440
so you need an alias.

923
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:24,880
A name our colleagues and I will call you by.

924
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:27,050
Have you thought of one?

925
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:34,790
- Si Hyun, let's eat. - Dad.

926
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,659
It says Liu Bei's other name was "Xuande."

927
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:38,760
What's the other name for?

928
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:45,329
("Romance of the Three Kingdoms")

929
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:46,530
To put it simply,

930
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:49,270
it's the name others call you by.

931
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:52,669
Long ago, it was rude for others to use the name...

932
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:54,370
your parents gave you.

933
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:56,010
I see.

934
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:58,610
- I want one too. - What?

935
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,650
I like stars, so I'll be called "Hae Seong."

936
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:03,079
"Hae Seong?"

937
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,190
You know, the word they use for comets.

938
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,320
It passes by our earth.

939
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:11,430
(Hae Seong)

940
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:12,690
Here.

941
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,860
This is it? You won't regret it?

942
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:18,770
No.

943
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,130
You can call me "Hae Seong" now.

944
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,300
Hae Seong.

945
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:28,040
Jeong Hae Seong.

946
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,379
I had no idea there was this side to her project.

947
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:07,149
Did you give up becoming a full-time teacher?

948
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:10,180
How many times did I tell you to leave the council members alone?

949
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:12,150
Could you help?

950
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:13,549
We must stop them somehow.

951
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:14,890
Let's go. Do it with me.

952
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:16,359
Did you forget what the mission was?

953
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,289
What have you been thinking since you were in...

954
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:19,730
the chairwoman's office?

955
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:22,929
It was Seo Myeong Ju who put me on this mission.

956
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:25,130
Jeong Hae Seong has been crossing the line these days.

957
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,029
Why does it feel like you're obsessed with the gold bars?

958
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:28,940
You could really die.

959
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:34,170
(A bonus clip is coming up.)

960
01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:51,690
Are you stupid?

961
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:55,130
Do, sol.

962
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,330
Do, sol.

963
01:03:57,530 --> 01:03:58,670
Do, sol. That's it.

964
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:00,700
You can't even memorize that?

965
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:03,670
Sorry.

966
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:07,870
- Can we get through it once? - Okay.

967
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:11,310
Let's try again. Ready, and go.

968
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:24,020
Do.

969
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:25,430
Yes.

970
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:27,990
- Is that right? - Yes.
