1
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:16,375
Sue, come here.

2
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,750
Look. Is this your teacher?

3
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:03,333
THE BELIEVERS 2

4
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:07,833
JANUARY 1, 2024

5
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:22,291
Hello. Are you Mr. Win?

6
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,833
Let's go for a test drive.

7
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:28,041
The doors open automatically
when you approach.

8
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:33,708
Mr. Win, this car is 100% electric.

9
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,541
It's app-controlled.

10
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:40,291
With just a 31-minute charge,
you can drive up to 770 kilometers.

11
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:44,583
It comes with the Burmester audio system
and the MBUX Hyperscreen.

12
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,375
Any cash discount?

13
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:50,875
Sure. I'll check for you.

14
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,958
<i>It's a Rolex Day-Date 36.</i>

15
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:15,666
Yellow gold with an onyx dial,
R-series, 1989.

16
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,791
It has become rare in Thailand.
There are very few of this model.

17
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:23,083
It's priced at 1,799,000 baht.

18
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,583
Anything more expensive?

19
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:28,750
One moment, please.

20
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,916
Shit, what are you hammering for?
It's so annoying.

21
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:56,583
I'm sorry

22
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,208
for making so much noise.

23
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,916
Oh, Father. Please excuse me.

24
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,916
Game, you fucking idiot.

25
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,666
I'm sorry. I didn't know it was you.

26
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:19,458
No matter who it is, you shouldn't swear.

27
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:21,958
Right.

28
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:28,958
Why don't you ask someone
to help with the repair?

29
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:33,458
It's a trivial thing.
We should do it ourselves if we can.

30
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,000
Did you use to be a handyman?

31
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,375
That's not always how it works.

32
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:45,583
Just because someone can fix things,
it doesn't mean they're a handyman.

33
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:51,791
So… what did you do
before you became a monk?

34
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,250
Finance.

35
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:55,958
Oh.

36
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,958
Then why did you become a monk?

37
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,166
<i>Tom Yum Kung.</i>

38
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,041
Your favorite food?

39
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,583
It was a joke.

40
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,750
To break the ice.

41
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,166
The 1997 crisis hit you hard?

42
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,500
Not exactly.

43
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:30,000
My business didn't go bankrupt.

44
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,541
I survived it.

45
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:36,916
But there were people
who suffered a lot because of me.

46
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,958
Some lost money.

47
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,291
Some even took their own lives.

48
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:59,333
So what's the scripture library for?

49
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,750
You work at a temple.
You don't know what it's for?

50
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,083
No, I don't.

51
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,791
It's like a library.

52
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:15,541
A place for storing
the Tipitaka and Buddhist scriptures.

53
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,750
They used to be built over water
to keep ants and termites away.

54
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,166
-I see.
-Okay.

55
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,875
Since you're here, help me lift this up.

56
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,791
-Okay.
-Come on.

57
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,291
One, two, three.

58
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,583
<i>Any more offerings of everyday items?</i>

59
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:42,750
<i>Forest robes or everyday items?</i>
<i>Come this way, please.</i>

60
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:46,375
<i>Enter on the left, exit on the right.</i>

61
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,416
<i>Enter left, exit right.</i>

62
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,125
<i>Please come this way.</i>

63
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,291
<i>Next, please…</i>

64
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,375
Please excuse me.

65
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:56,916
Hello.

66
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,875
I'm at the temple. What's up?

67
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,958
Can we use the old file?
Just make the changes.

68
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,500
Well, there's no time.
Will that one be ready in time?

69
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,833
Ask him when he sent it.

70
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,291
What do you want?

71
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,833
Do you believe in heaven and hell?

72
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,916
I think what you did

73
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,208
will send you to hell.

74
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:50,750
But I can offer you
a way to fix your karma.

75
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,916
200,000 baht, Venerable Brother.

76
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,166
Transfer it to me.

77
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,166
And what you did will disappear.
Abracadabra.

78
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,083
What are you talking about?

79
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,916
Normally,

80
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,541
laypeople make merit
with monks, don't they?

81
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,625
But this time,

82
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:18,958
it's your turn
to make merit with a layperson.

83
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:22,958
All your wishes will be fulfilled.

84
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,041
If you refuse,

85
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,833
you might never become a senior monk.

86
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:04,083
Where have you been?
You didn't answer the phone.

87
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:08,083
The slot's taken.
I'm not sure when we can reschedule.

88
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,291
Hello?

89
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,833
Do you have any free slots next week?

90
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,583
To meet with the master.

91
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,458
Any time will do.

92
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,333
I transferred money for the expenses.

93
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,000
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

94
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,708
How's the feedback? Good?

95
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:10,791
So good.

96
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,666
-Better than I expected.
-Good.

97
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,916
How was the course?

98
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,500
Any feedback? We can use it to improve.

99
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,583
-Overall, it was good.
-Yes.

100
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,333
-I loved it.
-So much fun.

101
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,875
Ms. May, how are you getting home?

102
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,958
Someone from home will pick me up.

103
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,458
You're from around here?

104
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,375
Yes.

105
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,291
Wow, I'm so jealous.

106
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,041
I really love Samui.

107
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,250
Nice views. And the food is great.

108
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,583
When I was here scouting locations,

109
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,791
I stayed at a hotel with an amazing view.

110
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,500
Really? Which hotel?

111
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:43,375
It was called Maytara Paradise,
by the river.

112
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,208
Oh, that's my family's hotel.

113
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,500
Are you serious?

114
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,750
-Yes.
-Wow, I really loved the hotel.

115
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:49,666
So beautiful.

116
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,250
I wanted to host the course there.

117
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,708
What changed your mind?
Who did you talk to?

118
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,000
The price was too high for me.

119
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:01,916
Next time, just let me know.
I can offer the venue free of charge.

120
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,375
Thank you.

121
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,208
Hello?

122
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,041
My ride's here.

123
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:15,041
Well, you can let me know anytime.

124
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:18,250
-I will.
-I'll… take care of the venue for you.

125
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,958
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

126
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,583
-Get home safely.
-I will.

127
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:22,708
See you.

128
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:33,208
DOCK PAVILION, WAT NONG KHAN FOUNDATION

129
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,166
Hello?

130
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,916
I called a bunch of times.
You never answered.

131
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,458
How are you?

132
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,000
Who is this?

133
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:13,541
Why isn't the owner of this number
talking to me herself?

134
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,500
When you were a monk,

135
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,625
did you ever eat at night?

136
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:33,833
Seriously?

137
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,833
What if you got hungry?

138
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,250
Well… I just practiced self-restraint,

139
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,333
meditated,

140
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,708
and drank lots of water.

141
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,125
Can you cook?

142
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,250
A little.

143
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,333
If boiling eggs counts.

144
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:03,666
Can you drive?

145
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:05,916
Swim?

146
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,625
This is like a job interview.

147
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,125
Dear.

148
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,750
Why do you pay people to join the course?

149
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,750
We have to do a little promotion.

150
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,458
Word-of-mouth alone could be too slow.

151
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,625
But don't worry.

152
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,250
What you're teaching is great.

153
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,416
I'm sorry

154
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:55,166
for all the trouble I caused before.

155
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,083
And now,

156
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,208
is all that over?

157
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:07,708
It's over.

158
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,250
That's good.

159
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:20,375
I'm still not sure
I made the right decision coming here.

160
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,750
But if you say

161
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,166
it's all over and done with…

162
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,166
let's leave it in the past.

163
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,625
Let's try to do our best now.

164
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,625
Before this,

165
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,333
where did you go?

166
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,708
I visited my dad in the US.

167
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,000
Why didn't you stay there?

168
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,875
Why did you come back?

169
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,708
Are you serious about this career?

170
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,500
I guess so.

171
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,208
If I am, are you with me?

172
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,416
I'm not sure if this is who I am.

173
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,125
But I've been feeling good so far.

174
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:25,333
Seeing people come here
and learn something.

175
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,875
I never thought this could be a career.

176
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:35,083
So is that a… yes?

177
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,333
Hope I'm not making another mistake.

178
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,083
This room.

179
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,000
Are you Akkarachai?

180
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,625
Go and talk to her.

181
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,875
Since she was arrested,
she hasn't said a word.

182
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,916
-Go on.
-Wait.

183
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,791
What did she do?

184
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,541
Stabbed her husband to death.

185
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,958
Go on, kid. Help us out.

186
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,708
What happened?

187
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,416
Game.

188
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,416
Am I still going to heaven?

189
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,166
Why are you bringing up heaven?

190
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,791
I made merit with you.

191
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,083
I tried to do good things.

192
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,166
Isn't it the intention that counts?

193
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,583
My husband got mad at me…

194
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,916
for donating money to the temple.

195
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,125
So he…

196
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,833
He beat me up.

197
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,208
But it was my money.

198
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,833
Yes, he gave me the funding.

199
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,500
But I already paid him back in full.

200
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,875
Was I wrong, Game?

201
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,291
You didn't have to donate that much.

202
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,541
I have cancer.

203
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,541
I tried

204
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,541
getting it treated many times.

205
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,125
Last time, the doctor said

206
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,208
it's back.

207
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,833
I can't do this anymore.

208
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:12,000
So I just wished to go to a good place…

209
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,583
and be done with it.

210
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,333
Excuse me. I'm Ms. Jeerinya's lawyer.

211
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,625
I'd like to speak with my client.

212
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,000
Hey, kid.

213
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,875
I need to talk to you too. Come with me.

214
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,375
Lieutenant, take it from here.

215
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,333
You know the suspect, don't you?

216
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,375
Let's talk in that room.

217
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:05,416
NAME AND SURNAME: L
WISH: "TO GO TO A GOOD PLACE"

218
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,041
The groundbreaking is set
for January 25th.

219
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,041
Invite your mom.

220
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,500
I don't see our project
as just national level.

221
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,625
At this scale,
we can tap into the Asian market.

222
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:46,375
Tourists from China, Taiwan, Singapore,
other Southeast Asian countries,

223
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,666
they're rich and love spiritual stuff.

224
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,833
If you have any ideas, let me know.

225
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,333
Expand the product line
with more souvenirs.

226
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:00,125
They'll feel like they have to buy
something for people back home.

227
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,333
Sounds too ordinary coming from you.

228
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,166
Any other ideas?

229
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:14,041
Create a communication plan,
promoting wellness.

230
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,166
The global population is aging.

231
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,250
People are living longer.
Everyone wants to stay healthy.

232
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,125
It's probably a global trend.

233
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,958
That's a good one. I like it.

234
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:29,416
Have you ever thought
about going into politics?

235
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,875
I'm moving to a new party.

236
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,041
I can recommend you.

237
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,875
They probably need
a young person like you.

238
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,583
Have you talked to Game?

239
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,458
Try to convince him.

240
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,041
I still want both of you working with me.

241
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,291
ABBOT'S RESIDENCE
MONK VEERA ITSAVARO

242
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,333
Venerable Brother.

243
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:43,416
Why are you here?

244
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,583
I came to get something I left behind.

245
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,500
How could you have left it here?

246
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,541
How have you been? It's been a while.

247
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,083
I've been all right.

248
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,333
And how is your mother?

249
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,333
How old is she this year?

250
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,083
She passed a long time ago.

251
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,458
Who do you live with?

252
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,500
Any family around?

253
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,208
I just live here. No other family.

254
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:22,250
Someone said she's your relative, Note.

255
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:24,916
Do you know her?

256
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:36,166
She's not my relative. That's Auntie Jum.
She sells Chinese medicine at the market.

257
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,166
You sent me there
to buy medicine for Father Kiw.

258
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:44,083
And… where is her shop?

259
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:04,041
-Ms. Dear.
-Yes?

260
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:06,125
How's everything? All good?

261
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:07,666
Very good.

262
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:09,500
I've arranged some…

263
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:10,791
<i>Inside us,</i>

264
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,041
there may be deep wounds

265
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,375
waiting to be healed.

266
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:22,208
But as we grow up

267
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:25,291
and think we can take care of ourselves,

268
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:28,416
we forget.

269
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:31,583
We forget to explore them.

270
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,000
But whenever

271
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,583
we feel afraid,

272
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:42,875
hopeless,

273
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,916
or unable to cope,

274
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:51,125
just let those feelings surface

275
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,541
and face those wounds.

276
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:02,750
Dol!

277
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,125
You can't swim. Why go in the water?

278
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:37,708
I wanted to try.

279
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:40,250
But it almost killed me.

280
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:44,750
Are you okay? Get some rest.

281
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:46,000
I'm fine.

282
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:47,541
Don't worry.

283
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:04,208
Right now,
our party's membership isn't very strong.

284
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:07,833
With Ae on board,
our voter base could get a real boost,

285
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:09,708
and we'll surely win a seat.

286
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:11,750
NATIONAL VICTORY PARTY

287
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:14,291
Has she talked to her dad and brother?

288
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:17,458
We don't want them shooting at us.

289
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:22,166
If we want to build our image as a party
of a new generation with integrity,

290
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,750
we shouldn't have members
with a checkered past.

291
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:30,375
What's the point of having good policies
if we don't win a seat?

292
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,958
Someone who lost should understand that.

293
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:33,875
Go ahead.

294
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:35,291
You already decided.

295
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:37,458
Why bother with the damn meeting?

296
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:47,000
Okay, let's begin the meeting.

297
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:49,875
Today, I have a new idea to share.

298
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:53,708
I'm sure you've heard
about my Wat Nong Khan Hospital project.

299
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:56,250
Excuse me.

300
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:32,583
What are you doing?

301
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:34,000
Don't go down there!

302
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,916
Help me get her out!

303
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:39,208
Come help me!

304
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:02,833
Hi.

305
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:04,333
How is Ms. May?

306
00:30:04,416 --> 00:30:06,791
May's safe, but…

307
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:11,291
I think you should go.
Leave this to the doctors.

308
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,166
What May is experiencing

309
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,666
should be handled by a psychiatrist
who's trained for this.

310
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,125
Not just anyone.

311
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:20,958
You kids should leave.

312
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:24,500
Hey. You two are running
this course or whatever.

313
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:27,083
Do you have a license? Are you scammers?

314
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:28,541
Of course we do.

315
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:30,416
Why make such accusations?

316
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:33,916
What did you do?
Why'd she end up like this?

317
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,333
We don't know what she's been through.

318
00:30:36,416 --> 00:30:39,375
Is it our fault it happened
while she was with us?

319
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:41,208
-Let's go.
-How could you say that?

320
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:42,208
Relax, honey.

321
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:45,041
-I'm sorry.
-Pack up and get out of my hotel.

322
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:47,958
Right now. Go.

323
00:30:56,916 --> 00:30:59,041
<i>We don't have the license.</i>

324
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:02,958
Why didn't you tell him that?

325
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:18,291
Can we cancel
all the remaining courses for now?

326
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Why?

327
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,958
We did nothing wrong.

328
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:26,041
I can just get the license right away.

329
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:27,833
But what if she did that…

330
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:33,333
because we triggered something inside her?

331
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:37,625
It's impossible to know.

332
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:41,083
People do something like that
for countless reasons.

333
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:42,833
But we made a mistake

334
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:46,458
by not asking about her past.

335
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:48,708
There's no point in that.

336
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:51,250
She could have lied.

337
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:54,125
Stop blaming yourself.

338
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:57,875
But she almost lost her life.

339
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,375
I can't just stop caring.

340
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:02,458
I can't do it.

341
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:06,458
I'm sorry…

342
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:11,916
if this is going to affect
your work or your reputation.

343
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:24,000
My friends in the US want me
to run a wellness center with them.

344
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:30,541
I want to save up some funds
and start a new life over there.

345
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:34,541
I was gonna ask you to come with me.

346
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,708
But if you're leaving, I can't stop you.

347
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,375
Please just think it over, okay?

348
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:35,541
JANUARY 9, 2024

349
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:06,166
Dear.

350
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:11,208
How did you get here?

351
00:34:14,708 --> 00:34:16,250
Still want your share?

352
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:21,791
I need your help.

353
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:24,583
What is it now?

354
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:31,000
Ae made me do a billion-baht project,
holding my mom and Game's family hostage.

355
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,125
All the donation money's in the account
of the Wat Nong Khan Hospital Foundation.

356
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,875
Withdrawing the money
needs three approvals.

357
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:08,875
Excuse me.

358
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:10,291

368
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:31,958
My apologies.

369
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:34,541
<i>I've hacked Ae's and the abbot's phones.</i>

370
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:36,000
<i>I can operate everything.</i>

371
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:39,916
I'll transfer all the money
to the fake account I made.

372
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:47,708
The next part's on you.
Your main job's to help my mom escape.

Groundbreaking Day.

377
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:15,375
<i>Ae and her people will be too busy</i>
<i>to check the account.</i>

378
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,416
<i>On that day…</i>

379
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:31,625
<i>I'll arrange a checkup for Mom</i>
<i>at a hospital.</i>

380
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:37,875
Go there and ask where her exam room is.

381
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:40,458
Mrs. Nuchanard Luckngam's here
for a checkup.

382
00:36:40,541 --> 00:36:41,625
<i>Which room is she in?</i>

383
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:55,041
-Mrs. Nuchanard Luckngam?
-Yes.

384
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:56,833
-Please come in.
-Wait here.

385
00:36:58,208 --> 00:36:59,750
<i>Wait until she goes in.</i>

386
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:03,958
That's the only time Ple,
Ae's hired gun, won't follow her.

387
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:09,958
<i>Tell security Ple has a gun in her bag.</i>

388
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:11,041
Excuse me.

389
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:13,625
The woman in the purple top
has a gun in her bag.

390
00:37:14,125 --> 00:37:15,291
All right. I'm on it.

391
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:18,583
Suspicious person. Send backup.

392
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:23,000
<i>If she doesn't run, they'll detain her.</i>
<i>That should buy us time.</i>

393
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:25,333
May I search your bag?

394
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:26,833
Excuse me?

395
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:30,041
Dear?

396
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:31,375
-Come on.
-Why are you here?

397
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:33,208
Disguise yourself and get her out.

398
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:34,500
Come this way.

399
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:36,083
Please.

400
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:42,416
<i>We'll have less than an hour before</i>
<i>all the money is transferred to my account</i>

401
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,541
<i>and Ae finds out.</i>

402
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:45,000
Why do I have to do it?

403
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:51,166
I can't do it alone.

404
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,500
The only person my mom will trust

405
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:56,625
is you.

406
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:12,291
<i>Take her to our old school.</i>

<i>Use my mom's phone to unlock it.</i>

409
00:38:17,416 --> 00:38:18,500
Auntie, your phone.

410
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:21,000
The passcode is my birthday.

411
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:22,583
ENTER PASSCODE

412
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:27,000
Drive to the preset location.

MEANWHILE

414
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:36,541
<i>Ae will be opening the ceremony by then.</i>

415
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:45,125
I'll get the evidence to bring Ae down.

00:39:43,541 --> 00:39:45,750

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,916
<i>He'll give you a laptop</i>
<i>and my mom's passport.</i>

424
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,291
This part is crucial.

425
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:29,375
Listen carefully.

426
00:40:31,166 --> 00:40:33,708
Ask my mom for the New Year's card
I gave her.

427
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:39,875
This is yours.

428
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:48,041
The emojis are the seed phrase
for you and Mom.

429
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:51,333
Alternate them and use all 24.

430
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:52,791
<i>Fill them in.</i>

431
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:57,666
<i>When you reach the last one, call me.</i>

432
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:00,125
Once I get out, I'll tell you.

433
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:03,375
The 100 million baht in there
is your share.

434
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:10,458
<i>The ship will dock in Hong Kong.</i>

435
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,875
<i>I'll meet you and Mom there.</i>

436
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:23,250
You've gone way further than I imagined.

437
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:29,708
I know you're smart

438
00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:32,166
and a real piece of shit.

439
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:35,000
But I didn't expect you to go this far.

440
00:41:36,916 --> 00:41:39,791
When I needed your help,
where the hell were you?

441
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:45,166
And when you need my help,
you just ask like it's no big deal?

442
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:47,833
Isn't that a dick move?

443
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:52,125
I used to think I needed you.

444
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:55,625
But now I'm fucking done.

445
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,833
What about Game?

446
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:06,541
You didn't even mention him.

447
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:13,458
I'm giving you 100 million.

448
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,125
You have a US passport.

449
00:42:16,625 --> 00:42:17,958
Just go your own way.

450
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,041
I gotta catch my flight.

451
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:48,083
<i>Stay here!</i>

452
00:42:53,416 --> 00:42:54,250
<i>Venerable Father!</i>

453
00:42:56,083 --> 00:42:57,375
Father!

454
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,916
Come and get it!

455
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:40,708
<i>Come on!</i>

456
00:43:41,208 --> 00:43:42,500
<i>Come on, shorty!</i>

457
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:45,041
Come and get it!

458
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,375
Hey!

459
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:50,958
Come on. How's that, asshole?

460
00:44:05,458 --> 00:44:06,791
<i>Ouch.</i>

461
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:08,250
It hurts.

462
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:10,583
Ouch.

463
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:15,041
Ouch. It hurts.

464
00:44:21,416 --> 00:44:22,333
Hey.

465
00:44:36,791 --> 00:44:41,583
RICH LIPSTICK BRAND OWNER KILLS HUSBAND
AFTER 100-MILLION-BAHT TEMPLE DONATION

466
00:44:44,375 --> 00:44:45,833
Hold this.

467
00:44:51,416 --> 00:44:53,208
Aren't people crazy these days?

468
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:56,916
Donating 100 million baht
and then killing someone.

469
00:44:57,625 --> 00:44:59,916
If I were her husband, I'd be pissed too.

470
00:45:00,416 --> 00:45:03,166
All the hard-earned money
just went to a temple.

471
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,083
What about their kids?

472
00:45:06,125 --> 00:45:07,791
Stop with the yapping.

473
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:10,916
We don't even know why she did it.

474
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:13,791
Why are you getting worked up?

475
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:15,958
Right?

476
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:22,583
So…

477
00:45:23,125 --> 00:45:25,625
Have you found a new nanny?

478
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,458
A lot of people applied.

479
00:45:29,541 --> 00:45:30,958
Here, take a look.

480
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:36,916
How can I tell by looking at their faces?

481
00:45:37,416 --> 00:45:39,000
Their face feng shui.

482
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:41,750
Like, do they have a kind forehead?

483
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:57,166
Win.

484
00:45:59,708 --> 00:46:01,125
We're hitting the target.

485
00:46:01,916 --> 00:46:03,500
You're not changing your mind?

486
00:46:06,708 --> 00:46:07,541
No.

487
00:46:08,125 --> 00:46:11,000
Is this your way out?
Working for that piece of shit?

488
00:46:14,083 --> 00:46:17,666
You know she's never gonna let us go.

489
00:46:21,666 --> 00:46:23,541
If you're doing it for Dear and me,

490
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:24,875
don't.

491
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,958
Namaskar.

492
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:49,541
Blessings.

493
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:51,750
Many people came here today.

494
00:46:52,875 --> 00:46:55,708
When you two first presented this idea,

495
00:46:56,416 --> 00:46:58,916
I thought it would take a long time.

496
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,250
It's unbelievable
that it's almost finished.

497
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:10,541
<i>From now on, the people will benefit</i>
<i>from what you two have built.</i>

498
00:47:30,958 --> 00:47:33,625
<i>This is truly a great act of merit.</i>

499
00:47:38,583 --> 00:47:40,583
I rejoice in your good deeds.

500
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:42,875
May the both of you prosper.

501
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:45,375
May it be so.

502
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,625
Please let Win know too.

503
00:47:49,458 --> 00:47:50,375
I will.

504
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:52,833
-Good job.
-Thank you.

505
00:47:52,916 --> 00:47:55,041
<i>May the power of this merit and virtue</i>
