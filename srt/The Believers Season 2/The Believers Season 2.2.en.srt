1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,541
Grandpa, isn't this cool?

2
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,333
Hey.

3
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,291
THE BELIEVERS 2

4
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:19,916
<i>All right.</i>

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,541
This is our fundraising project
for Wat Nong Khan Hospital,

6
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:27,416
a simulator game
where players help build the hospital.

7
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,500
You've played sim games before, right?

8
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:39,500
Oh, you guys are monks.

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,833
You probably can't play. Sorry.

10
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:44,375
Building stuff…

11
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:47,541
As all of you may know,

12
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:52,083
one pain point with donations is
once people have donated,

13
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:55,083
they often don't know
how their money is used.

14
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,416
<i>But with this model,</i>

15
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,833
<i>we're creating a donation simulation</i>

16
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:03,625
<i>so donors can see real-time updates.</i>

17
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,458
And this is the "Phoken."

18
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:07,583
This is too much.

19
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:10,750
It's like a game token.

20
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,500
The Phoken comes in

21
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:14,541
a few colors and styles.

22
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,041
Ninety-nine baht.

23
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,708
This one is 999 baht.

24
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:23,166
And this one is 9,999 baht.

25
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:29,916
<i>People who buy our Phokens</i>
<i>can scan the QR code on the back.</i>

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,458
<i>It links to the website we made.</i>

27
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:36,333
<i>The donations can then be turned</i>
<i>into virtual items for the hospital.</i>

28
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,958
<i>We're making merit-making more tangible.</i>

29
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:42,125
But for those uncomfortable
with the online process,

30
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:45,291
there is also an on-site option.

31
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,833
<i>We'll build a giant Pho tree</i>

32
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:51,125
<i>where donors can place the Phokens.</i>

33
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:54,083
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>we'll make merit-making tangible</i>

34
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,333
<i>with both the website and the tree.</i>

35
00:02:56,416 --> 00:03:00,666
This allows us to reach all target groups,
regardless of gender or age.

36
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,666
<i>The Pho tree will be the centerpiece</i>
<i>of the fundraising campaign.</i>

37
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,000
<i>We'll install it</i>
<i>at the center of the hospital.</i>

38
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:12,500
<i>As donations grow, this giant Pho tree</i>

39
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:16,458
<i>will become the largest</i>
<i>gold and silver Pho tree in the world.</i>

40
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:23,208
<i>This is the fundraising,</i>
<i>merit-raising plan for this megaproject</i>

41
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,583
of the greatest meritorious deed.

42
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,750
PRESIDENT
WAT NONG KHAN HOSPITAL FOUNDATION

43
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:43,708
Personally,

44
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,750
I don't see the need
for something so extravagant.

45
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,333
The website, the giant tree, the game.

46
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,916
We just need people to make merit with us.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,041
Isn't this too much?

48
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,166
But I think

49
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,916
in today's content-saturated world,

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,791
if we do things the old way,
it won't work.

51
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,833
You're building a huge structure
at the temple.

52
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,208
What about safety?

53
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,333
Have you considered that at all?

54
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,083
You know my team is professional.

55
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,083
We don't do lousy work.

56
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,333
Personally, I disagree.

57
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,916
Abbot, how about you?

58
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:30,375
Can we put up a screen near the Pho tree?

59
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:36,416
So the visitors can see
the images on the website.

60
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,208
Also, right now,

61
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:42,458
we're only targeting B2C.

62
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,541
If we want to reach B2B as well,

63
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,208
what do we do?

64
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,875
We'll look into it.

65
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:53,291
This is clearly a pipe dream.
Do you really trust these kids?

66
00:04:55,416 --> 00:05:00,041
And the politicians are only after
their own interests. Can't you see?

67
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,041
Deputy Abbot.

68
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,458
I saw you.

69
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,125
You snuck out on your motorcycle,
delivering water.

70
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,333
Really? What's going on?

71
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,291
-What will happen now?
-This isn't right.

72
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,041
Could you bring the monk's assistant here?

73
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,041
This is Korn.

74
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,166
He's the monk's assistant.

75
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,208
And older brother of Deputy Abbot Kit.

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,541
I guess they don't look that similar.

77
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,416
Shit.

78
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,666
How was I supposed to know
he had a brother?

79
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,875
Fucking two peas in a pod.

80
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,541
Next time, you can ask me first.

81
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,125
Your project plan does sound over the top.

82
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,250
But in a good way. I like it.

83
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:24,250
What about cash flow?
They won't let us near temple accounts.

84
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:30,041
How about this? My company will cover
the construction costs upfront.

85
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,541
Here's the new total.

86
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,041
Are you serious?

87
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:54,958
Let's get to work.

88
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:02,541
BOON TO
CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR

89
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,750
Fuck.

90
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:13,541
We have to take a loan from her company?
It's her fucking project.

91
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,333
Where's our profit from Phummaram?

92
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:19,916
Seized by the cops.

93
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:25,958
Whatever.

94
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,250
As if I can trust you anyway.

95
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,166
Can I help you?

96
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:36,000
Step away from the computer.
The audit team's here to check it.

97
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:47,666
Password?

98
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Whatever you got away with elsewhere,

99
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,416
don't think you can try it here.

100
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,208
Hey. Where are you going?

101
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,583
Are you running away?

102
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,958
I'm going to pee. Check whatever you want.

103
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,083
So far,

104
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,833
we've found nothing suspicious.

105
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,208
Are you done? So I can get back to work.

106
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,708
I can always come
to check again and again.

107
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,375
So don't slip up.

108
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,791
This way, Venerable Master.

109
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,791
Please come this way, Venerable Brother.

110
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,791
Please come this way.

111
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:35,458
-Hello. How are you?
-I'm well.

112
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,416
Hello.

113
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,708
WAT NONG KHAN FOUNDATION

114
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:41,958
Council Member?

115
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:46,958
An auspicious event should have
an odd number of monks. We invited eight.

116
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,833
It's okay. I know.
Another monk is on his way.

117
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,166
I see.

118
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,125
Please come this way.

119
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,083
After you. Please, go ahead.

120
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:18,791
Let's go inside.

121
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,625
Can you guide us a little?

122
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,916
Not even a little?
Okay, never mind. We'll figure it out.

123
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,250
<i>Please join us…</i>

124
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,333

Well?

134
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:22,541
What should we do?

135
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,875
We've promoted it via all channels.

136
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:31,750
The tree isn't finished,
so people don't know what it'll look like.

137
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:37,708
-Will it be ready before we break ground?
-If all goes as planned, yes.

138
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:41,875
We didn't account for people
getting in our way and causing delays.

139
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,125
I don't need excuses. I need answers.

140
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,333
Figure it out.

141
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,125
Shit.

142
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,750

Hey, kid. Want the jackpot?

151

If that's the winning ticket,
why don't you just keep it?

152
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,583
Give me the winning two digits.

153
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,333
Sure thing.

154
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,750
Right here, kid. Here you go.

155
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,458
-How much?
-One hundred.

156
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,000
May you get rich.

157
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,041
What do you think merit makers want?

158
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,333
To go to heaven.

159
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:12,541
That's half right.
But today's heaven means money.

160
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,041
Merit makers all hope to be rich.

161
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:22,958
To get people to donate to our tree,
we should offer more than merit and peace.

162
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,583
We should give back to customers.

163
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:28,916
With what?

164
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:30,666
The lottery.

Where to?

171
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:11,875
They're taking Venerable Father
to a Thai temple in Switzerland in March.

172
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,750
Dad is so damn devoted.

173

Nope. Personal leave.

Personal leave?

179
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,625
To play games at home?

180
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,208
You're on payroll.

181
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,833
-The mic's picking up your voice.
<i>-Damn it! You suck!</i>

182
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,416
Yeah, yeah.

183
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,000
Tell the maid to serve you food.

184
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,333
I'm good. You go ahead.

185
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,833
Then why are you here?

186
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,125
The hospital project's a hit.

187
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,541
We got a lot of donors,
probably voters too.

188
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,958
I eat vegetarian today. No meat!

189
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,166
About the road construction,
have you talked to the department?

190
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,666
-Aun!
<i>-Yo, whose voice was that?</i>

191
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,708
Yes, Dad.

192
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,833
<i>Shoot! Get in there, Aun!</i>

193
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:02,416
-Yo, I gotta go.
<i>-Dude!</i>

194
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,000
Why are you skipping dinner?

195
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,458
You look like a twig.

196
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,500
Whatever, Dad.

197
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,541
-About the road, you have to talk--
-Later. We'll talk later.

198
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,250
Hey, Dad.

199
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:23,083
Ae gets to build a hospital.
Can I run a car tuning shop?

200
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,416
How many times have you failed?

201
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,708
The bar you just opened went bust,
and you haven't learned?

202
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,541
I'm buying experience.

203
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,000
Gotta learn some way.

204
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,708
-How many millions already?
-See?

205
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,583
You're so discouraging.

206
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:42,666
When I do nothing, I'm lazy.
When I do stuff, you never support me.

207
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,541
Get your factory going first.

208
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,625
I am. Don't talk when you don't know shit.

209
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,958
You're all talk, Aun.

210
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:55,708
You haven't accomplished shit.
I've seen nothing but failures.

211
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,333
If you're so great, you do it.

212
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:00,916
If I take over, what'll you be left with?
That car tuning shop?

213
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,708
Or what? Just stay home
playing games and leeching off Dad?

214
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,083
If my company wasn't funding your factory,

215
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,083
you'd be out.

216
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:12,083
-My life isn't your business.
-It's my burden.

217
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:02,083
It's 4,000 baht per month.

218
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:06,291
Two months' deposit in advance.
Electricity is eight baht per unit.

219
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:08,791
Water is a flat fee of 150 baht.

220
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,625
What are you studying, son?

221
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:15,708
Law.

222
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:18,208
Oh, that's great!

223
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:20,708
My son graduated from law school.

224
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:26,000
He's waiting to take the prosecutor exam.
But it's so hard.

225
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:28,708
Unpack and go down to sign the documents.

226
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:29,625
Okay.

227
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:53,583
LOTTERY DRAW DAY, NOVEMBER 16

228
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:57,666
<i>The second, third, fourth,</i>
<i>and fifth prizes have been announced.</i>

229
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:02,416
<i>Next, we will draw</i>
<i>the three-digit prefix twice,</i>

230
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,708
<i>the three-digit suffix twice,</i>
<i>the two-digit suffix once,</i>

231
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:10,333
<i>and the first prize,</i>
<i>using another type of equipment.</i>

232
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:11,333
<i>And now…</i>

233
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,041
PHILIP MAGIC SCHOOL
WELCOME

234
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:25,791
<i>We will now place them inside the wheel</i>
<i>and invite committee members…</i>

235
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:26,916
Hey!

236
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:29,416
You called earlier, right?

237
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:31,791
Hi there, Philip.

238
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:35,041
All right. Come on.

239
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:38,041
Come on up.

240
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:39,416
Okay.

241
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:45,666
<i>The aforementioned equipment</i>
<i>will be used with ten balls,</i>

242
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,333
<i>numbered zero through nine.</i>

243
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:51,500
<i>They will be placed</i>
<i>inside a spherical container,</i>

244
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:54,500
<i>where they will then be mixed.</i>

245
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:57,583
<i>After the chairman has reviewed…</i>

246
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:08,833
<i>All right.</i>

247
00:25:08,916 --> 00:25:12,458
<i>Are you ready to enter the world of magic?</i>

248
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:14,083
Yes, I am.

249
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:46,708
Do you have a trick to switch out balls?

250
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:50,000
Balls? What fucking balls?

251
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,958
<i>These ten balls</i>

252
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:56,000
<i>will be placed</i>
<i>inside an opaque spherical container.</i>

253
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:59,041
<i>After we've closed the container,</i>

254
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:02,083
<i>we'll place it</i>
<i>in a piece of special equipment.</i>

255
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:06,875
<i>Following that,</i>
<i>I'd like to invite the committee members</i>

256
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:13,625
<i>to spin the equipment so the ten numbers…</i>

257
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:18,208
Can you draw the balls
at the Lottery Division?

258
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:20,875
Come and take this container

259
00:26:20,958 --> 00:26:24,291
and open it to reveal the number inside.

260
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,916
LINDA YOOAMNUAY
PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICER

261
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:32,791
LINDA YOOAMNUAY

262
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:35,916
What?

263
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,416
The lottery balls.

264
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,958
Rig them.

265
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:44,958
Damn it. I thought
you wanted to be my student.

266
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:47,625
Turns out you're a criminal.

267
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:49,333
Two million.

268
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,875
Are you crazy?

269
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:03,583
Do you really think they'd let a magician
draw the lottery balls?

270
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:20,666
-Hey!
-What?

271
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:23,541
But I can teach you.

272
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:38,250
Excuse me. Are you Kao Hom's mother?

273
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:39,166
That's me.

274
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,875
I'm Saint's father.

275
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:44,125
Saint talks about Kao Hom all the time.

276
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:45,041
I see.

277
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,708
So which elementary school do you want
Kao Hom to go to for first grade?

278
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:57,000
We hope for the Demonstration School,
but it's hard to get in.

279
00:27:57,541 --> 00:27:58,666
Same with us.

280
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:01,916
But I'm lucky to have a quota spot.

281
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,375
I might be able to help Kao Hom get in.

282
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:09,166
But I'd like to ask you

283
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:12,041
for a small favor in return.

284
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,958
<i>If you get a chance</i>
<i>to make merit with monks,</i>

285
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:20,083
<i>it's also worth finding time</i>
<i>to listen to Dharma.</i>

286
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:24,125
Do you need this one? This side?

287
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:27,125
Yes. Just a moment.

288
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:28,916
Can you drive?

289
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:33,208
-No, I can't.
-Go check aisle 14.

290
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:35,250
Any computer skills?

291
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:38,041
I can use Word a bit.

292
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:42,083
Besides teaching Dharma,

293
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:46,125
what skills do you have
that would make me hire you?

294
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:07,541
Nothing else? Too ordinary.

295
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:09,291
Okay. I'll make a new one.

296
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:17,250
What now?

297
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:20,333
People filed a complaint with a lawyer,

298
00:29:20,416 --> 00:29:24,333
saying the construction noises
are disturbing them.

299
00:29:24,916 --> 00:29:28,458
How? My team talked to everyone.
The municipality gave us permission.

300
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:29,541
I don't know.

301
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:34,958
My job is to bring you
the lawyer's documents.

302
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:36,708
As for you,

303
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:39,958
your job is to clear things up
with those people.

304
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:41,791
One more thing.

305
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:43,958
About the construction materials,

306
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:49,625
put them all away
and move them out of the temple grounds.

307
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:51,208
Take it.

308
00:29:59,416 --> 00:30:03,333
PHILIP MAGIC SCHOOL

309
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:09,000
Oh, hi there.

310
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:10,958
Philip.

311
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:12,666
-Yes?
-This is Linda.

312
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,291
-Hi.
-And this is Philip.

313
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:15,208
Hi.

314
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:19,000
What's your name again? I forgot.

315
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,708
It's Jack.

316
00:30:20,791 --> 00:30:22,125
Oh, got it.

317
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:26,541
This is Wichai. He'll learn
the ball-switching trick today.

318
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:29,083
-He'll be the one who draws.
-I see.

319
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:31,958
And these are the actual balls.

320
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:43,625
LOTTERY DIVISION

321
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:46,375
Wow.

322
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:01,916
Shall we begin?

323
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,625
Yes, let's do it.

324
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:05,916
-I'll start with the basics.
-Okay.

325
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,875
-How to hold the ball naturally.
-Right.

326
00:31:08,958 --> 00:31:10,791
-The hand positioning.
-Okay.

327
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:14,625
Use your thumb
and index finger to hold it.

328
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:16,500
-Like this?
-Exactly.

329
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,083
-Hold it like this.
-Okay.

330
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:19,958
To switch numbers,

331
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:21,750
you need practice.

332
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:22,666
I see.

333
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:25,416
Yeah, hello. What's up?

334
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:27,375
<i>Construction's suspended.</i>

335
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,041
-What?
<i>-People filed a complaint.</i>

336
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:31,875
Did you sort it out, you dick?

337
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:35,208
<i>-I'm not following.</i>
-Come back and fix this.

338
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:38,125
Fix what?
I sorted it out with the village head.

339
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:39,750
Gave him loads of money.

340
00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:42,625
Then why are we getting hit?

341
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,916
Beats me.

342
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:55,791
Win,

343
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,583
I'll leave that to you for now.

344
00:32:01,791 --> 00:32:02,958
-Hello.
-Hi.

345
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:05,333
-Which one?
-In the black shirt.

346
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:50,541
-Hi.
-Scared the life out of me.

347
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:52,958
Son of a bitch.

348
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:57,541
Let's go.

349
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:01,208
Get on the truck.

350
00:33:02,416 --> 00:33:03,541
Get on.

351
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:06,083
Yes. And sit tight.

352
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,583
Shit.

353
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:15,166
-Hello there.
-Hi.

354
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,750
-Hello.
-I'm Dear.

355
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:19,458
-I'm here for the interview.
-Oh, okay.

356
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:21,750
Please follow me this way.

357
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:22,791
Sure.

358
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:26,666
You can leave your luggage here.

359
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,625
Okay.

360
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,791
This is our retreat area.

361
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:51,708
I see.

362
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:54,458
Let's discuss the details inside.

363
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:55,958
Sure.

364
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:04,083
Any experience working in retreats?

365
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:07,291
Well… yes, I have some experience.

366
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:09,000
I see. That's good.

367
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:46,416
IMNOTDEAR:
GAME, HOW ARE THINGS WITH YOU AND WIN?

368
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:31,125
Hey.

369
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:34,750
I saw it. The world's largest Pho tree.

370
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,375
It's pretty badass.

371
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:38,875
Want me to donate too?

372
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:46,875
I checked it out.

373
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,333
The list of board members
of the savings and credit co-op.

374
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:52,583
Your dad's one of them.

375
00:35:53,458 --> 00:35:56,916
The other is the lady who disappeared
with your dad from the phone shop.

376
00:36:00,416 --> 00:36:01,666
The last person

377
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:05,250
got sick and died
about the same time your dad disappeared.

378
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:10,875
Don't take this the wrong way,
but two people disappeared.

379
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:12,541
And one died.

380
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,916
If your dad didn't run off
with a mistress,

381
00:36:17,416 --> 00:36:19,833
what do you think happened?

382
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:21,666
And the chairman?

383
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:25,541
I couldn't find him.
Sombat is a common-ass name.

384
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:27,250
No last name either.

385
00:36:27,916 --> 00:36:29,208
Next time,

386
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,750
can you give me more to work with?

387
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:34,708
You think I like meeting you here?

388
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:37,791
I don't. It's a waste of time and gas.

389
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:48,916
Okay.

390
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:50,958
You're here.

391
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,083
What are you doing?

392
00:36:57,708 --> 00:36:59,625
I give freedom, and you do this?

393
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:03,916
What did you tell the cop?

394
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,916
He asked why I was there.

395
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,416
What did you tell him?

396
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,083
-About the hospital.
-Why would you talk to the cop?

397
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:23,666
-Why put us all at risk?
-What else could I do? He's a cop.

398
00:37:26,666 --> 00:37:28,666
I brought you guys here to work,

399
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,791
not to waste time on nonsense.

400
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:36,333
Donations are still low.
The tree project is frozen.

401
00:37:37,416 --> 00:37:40,916
Do you think I was joking
when I asked you to do something?

402
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,875
Hey! Wait!

403
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:46,375
Hey! What are you doing?

404
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:48,708
Hey!

405
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:52,625
Hey! Calm down!

406
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:53,708
Hey!

407
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:56,166
Wait! Please calm down!

408
00:37:56,666 --> 00:37:58,416
Let me try the lottery again.

409
00:37:58,916 --> 00:38:00,750
Do you really think you can rig it?

410
00:38:06,958 --> 00:38:09,791
I know a way, all right? Just calm down.

411
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:31,083
Don't make me get violent, all right?

412
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:33,750
It's a waste of time.

413
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:38,291
As for this,

414
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:40,125
I'll handle it.

415
00:38:42,083 --> 00:38:44,333
Focus on what you should be doing.

416
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:10,791
Why are you putting us at risk?
You'll get us all killed!

417
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:12,458
My job's to find a way out.

418
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:17,125
What's yours, asshat?
The lotto draw's coming up. Got a plan?

419
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:18,791
I know a way.

420
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:21,083
Don't screw up.

421
00:39:21,166 --> 00:39:23,625
Still talking shit
after putting us in danger?

422
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:37,666
IMNOTDEAR:
GAME, HOW ARE THINGS WITH YOU AND WIN?

423
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:13,250
Thank you so much.

424
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:18,666
-You're kidding.
-Let's grab a bite.

425
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,541
-Shall we?
-Ask him.

426
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:21,666
Hey, Dol!

427
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:24,208
What?

428
00:40:24,916 --> 00:40:26,166
Come down.

429
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:29,041
He's been working so long.
He's so fucking calm.

430
00:40:29,125 --> 00:40:32,291
-Doesn't he look familiar?
-Who does he look like?

431
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:34,708
-Like a bottle of soy sauce.
-So stiff.

432
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:36,458
-What?
-Hands together.

433
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:39,833
Dol, did you get your paycheck?
Let's go grab a bite.

434
00:40:39,916 --> 00:40:41,208
You can eat dinner now.

435
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,333
-He can.
-Let's go.

436
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,458
-Go easy on him.
-Why?

437
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:46,666
Let's eat offal.

441
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:04,083
We should be singers.

442
00:41:04,166 --> 00:41:05,708
Aren't you singing?

443
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:08,708
I'd rather not. I can't sing.

444
00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:10,916
-Dol, one song.
-Let's hear it.

445
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,208
-You're too stiff.
-Or you can chant.

Looking for trouble?

449
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:25,333
-You laughed at our friend.
-You started it.

-Come on!

-Wanna try?
-Just a little.

Party pooper.

Put the beer away and order kids' cereal.

455
00:41:47,291 --> 00:41:49,583
I'm done. I gotta pee. Can't hold it.

456
00:41:49,666 --> 00:41:51,750
-Let's go.
-Wanna come? Let's go.

-Careful.
-Carry my junk for me.

Hey, are you a human or a giraffe?

460
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:03,000
So tall. I'm gonna shoot you down.

461
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:14,708
So? No money,
yet you still came to a place like this.

462
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:18,041
<i>Sorry. The number you've dialed</i>

464
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:23,416
Pay up.

465
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,375
Or we go to the police.

466
00:42:29,666 --> 00:42:31,500
Please let me call them again.

467
00:42:33,416 --> 00:42:34,500

<i>Dear?</i>

474
00:43:30,416 --> 00:43:32,958
Sorry to call you so late at night.

475
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:39,208
Is everything okay, Venerable Brother?

476
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:47,583
I've left the monkhood.

477
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,916
Something urgent came up.

478
00:43:51,666 --> 00:43:54,958
I need 30,000 baht right now.

479
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:57,000
Thirty thousand baht, you say?

480
00:43:58,291 --> 00:44:01,458
<i>If it wasn't really urgent,</i>
<i>I wouldn't bother you.</i>

It's not a small amount of product.

486
00:44:40,666 --> 00:44:44,291
Yai, you know I'm working
on a big project right now.

487
00:44:44,375 --> 00:44:46,875
I have to be careful with everything I do.

488
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:48,958
For how long?

489
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:52,583
I have to give Mr. Roj an answer.

490
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,500
Until the hospital's finished.

491
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:57,791
That's a year.

492
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:04,375
Does your dad know? Is he okay with it?

493
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:09,708
I want to finish it sooner.

494
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:13,166
But someone keeps getting in my way.

495
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:16,250
-Who?
-Your beloved junior.

496
00:45:20,125 --> 00:45:21,125
I'll talk to him.

497
00:45:22,541 --> 00:45:23,958
Don't talk. Just fix it.

498
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:28,125
I can handle my own people.

499
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:31,666
I want to get it done.

500
00:45:32,416 --> 00:45:37,041
So I can import medical equipment,
medicines, and other supplies.

501
00:45:37,791 --> 00:45:41,125
Actually, I need your help
facilitating this part.

502
00:45:41,958 --> 00:45:43,458
I can't do it alone.

503
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,708
Back up! Okay, that's enough!

504
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:53,958
Stop!

505
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Okay, you can come down.
Please go upstairs.

506
00:45:59,583 --> 00:46:01,375
Careful, mind the step.

507
00:46:13,541 --> 00:46:15,416
Why not just buy lotto tickets online?

508
00:46:17,166 --> 00:46:18,416
That's the next step.

509
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:23,000
Hey! Get in the front!

510
00:46:40,166 --> 00:46:41,208
