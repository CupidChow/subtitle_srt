00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,333
THE BELIEVERS 2

2
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,000
Only relatives can go in.

3
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,500
Hello.

4
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:52,833
-Hi there.
-Hello.

5
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:55,458
Stomach pain?

6
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:57,458
-Right.
-Okay, then…

7
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:00,416
-Let me do a quick physical exam.
-Okay.

8
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:04,791
-Please wait outside.
-Okay.

9
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:06,583
Please lie on the bed.

10
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:27,958
-I'm pressing gently.
-Okay.

11
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,250
-Does it hurt?
-No.

12
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,083
WIN'S AWAKE. WHERE ARE YOU?

13
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,000
Does it hurt here?

14
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,083
No, it doesn't.

15
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:42,833
Any pain here?

16
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:44,375
No.

17
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:47,458
-And here?
-No.

18
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,333
I'll press a little harder.

19
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:51,000
-Okay.
-Does this hurt?

20
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,291
-No.
-What about here?

21
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:54,833
No.

22
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:56,750
DTH HOSPITAL. BRING A PHONE

23
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:02,375
Okay, from what I can see,

24
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:04,458
there's nothing to worry about.

25
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,958
I'll prescribe some medicine
for you to take home.

26
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:08,958
Okay.

27
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:16,416
Well, based on your symptoms
and the physical exam,

28
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,791
my diagnosis is acid reflux.

29
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:23,250
I'll prescribe some antacids.

30
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,833
I couldn't get into the wallet,
but I texted Dear.

31
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,416
Have you dealt with the video clip?

32
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:45,708
We're finding out who has it
and lobbying them.

33
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:52,541
How will we know
if we've got rid of all the evidence?

34
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,666
To be honest, it's going to be tough.

35
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:02,166
But there might be a way
to sort everything out.

36
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,416
Which is?

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,291
Whatever it takes,

38
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:11,333
we need to strengthen your public support.

39
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,458
You said it yourself.

40
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:17,666
The people's faith is the best shield.

41
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,458
Which means the position of abbot

42
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,125
and the Wat Nong Khan Hospital project

43
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:28,750
must continue in your name alone.

44
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,541
Is this all the abbot had?

45
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,125
It would seem so.

46
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,125
Dol.

47
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,416
Win woke up.

48
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,333
Game called for help.

49
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,166
You want to help them, don't you?

50
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:34,125
I can't abandon them this time.

51
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,666
AUSPICIOUS GROUNDBREAKING
OF WAT NONG KHAN HOSPITAL

52
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:57,250
Have you found someone
to assume the abbot position?

53
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,916
Deputy Vatin seems the most suitable.

54
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:08,708
He hasn't been ordained long,
but he's quite agreeable.

55
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,458
And the foundation funds,

56
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,583
have they recovered them all?

57
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,458
Patience, Father.

58
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,500
With that much money,
it'll take some time.

59
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,500
Where are you going?

60
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:06,916
I'm going for a smoke.

61
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,708
Didn't you learn in school?

62
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,958
I said no smoking in the hospital.

63
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,250
Idiot!

64
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,791
Then I'll go to the vending machine.

65
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,541
I'm allowed to get drinks, aren't I?

66
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,416
Smart-ass. Go ahead.

67
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,125
I'm Game, by the way. What's your name?

68
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,708
You don't need to know. Just go.

69
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,666
Bro, can I borrow some money?

70
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,166
You shithead.

71
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,416
Well, I don't have my wallet.

72
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,750
I'll pay you back.

73
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:46,500
Here.

74
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,000
That's all I've got. There you go.

75
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,125
Want a sweet one?

76
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,666
Yeah, anything sweet.

77
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,666
Okay.

78
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,041
Here.

79
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,041
Shit. What the hell?

80
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:24,916
Wow.

81
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,083
Man, this vending machine is shit.

82
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:30,875
Go on.

83
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,333
The machine isn't shit.

84
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:34,875
You are.

85
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,125
GOT IT, WHITE GIRL

86
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,291
WHAT NOW?

87
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,041
Excuse me.

88
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,791
Could you call your boss for me?

89
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,458
I just want to go to temples
and pray for my son.

90
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,958
Please? Could you call him?

91
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:12,458
Hello, boss.

92
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:18,083
Well, the auntie here
wants to go and pray for her son.

93
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,541
He said you should wait here

94
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,000
until Win gets better.

95
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,291
Let me talk to him.

96
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,333
Sir.

97
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,583
I'm begging you.

98
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,875
My son's condition is serious.

99
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,000
I just want to go to temples
and pray for his recovery.

100
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,916
You're a father.

101
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,541
I'm sure you understand.

102
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,166
Almost there, Aun.

103
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,333
If it was me who died,

104
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,083
would you be sad?

105
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,250
What more do you want, Ae?

106
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,041
I haven't done anything to you,

107
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:43,416
but you show no remorse
for all the damn trouble you caused.

108
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,750
If the tree hadn't fallen

109
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:50,708
and the hospital had been built,
you would be begging for my help.

110
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,041
You're scared, aren't you?

111
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,791
Scared that I'm more capable than you.

112
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,208
That's why you never support me
in anything I do.

113
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,166
When I come up with something nice,

114
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,083
you just swoop in and take it all.

115
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,708
Do you actually think you're more capable?

116
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,666
You're still here
because you're my daughter.

117
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:35,333
If you weren't,
you'd be some piece of crap somewhere.

118
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,458
Hey, pull over.

119
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,041
Boss said you can go tomorrow morning.

120
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:34,375
HEAD EAST
49 MINUTES, 52 KM

121
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:37,041
But you have to be back by evening.

122
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,583
Can my nephew drive me there?

123
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,208
What nephew?

124
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,041
Win.

125
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,041
I'm going to pray for you tomorrow.

126
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,916
<i>-Take care of Win.</i>
<i>-I will.</i>

127
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,958
We have to stop Deputy Vatin
from becoming abbot,

128
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,875
or we won't get a single baht.

129
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,750
We just need to make
an offer better than Dad's.

130
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,583
People like him

131
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,500
are absurdly selfish.

132
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,708
He won't let other people get a share.

133
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,458
So you'll go against your father?

134
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,375
But he kept you out of jail.

135
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,000
So what?

136
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,416
<i>And the tree collapse?</i>

137
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,166
<i>How will you fix it?</i>

138
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:40,833
<i>Can it be resolved?</i>

139
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,166
Sir, someone's here to see you.

140
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,958
I'll be right there.

141
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,750
I'll be going now.

142
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,708
Venerable Brother.

143
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,041
Is there a man around here aged about 60

144
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,458
with scars on his face
and the back of his neck?

145
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,083
He may have moved here
around 18 years ago.

146
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,208
Have you ever seen him?

147
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:44,875
Father, have you seen a man
with scars on his face and neck,

148
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,083
about 60 years old?

149
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,416
He moved here 18 years ago.

150
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,375
Scars here and the back of his neck.

151
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,166
Have you ever seen him?

152
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,750
No, I haven't.

153
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,458
Thank you.

154
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,708
How many temples already? Almost done?

155
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,125
Almost.

156
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,583
Come on, let's keep going.

157
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,583
TURN RIGHT ONTO ROAD SK.3085

158
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,666
Excuse me, Uncle?

159
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:33,958
Are there temples near here?

160
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,833
None. Only a monastery up on the mountain.

161
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,916
TURN RIGHT ONTO SK.3085

162
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,541
SEARCHING GPS…

163
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:47,875
MONASTERY

164
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,791
Excuse me? Venerable Brother.

165
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,125
Brother.

166
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:00,875
Brother.

167
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:07,166
Have you seen a man with a scar here
and one on the back of his neck?

168
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:11,458
He may have moved here 18 years ago.
Have you ever seen him?

169
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:17,500
Are you the only monk here?

170
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,375
It's just me and the Venerable Father.

171
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,291
Let's go a bit further.

172
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:40,875
Oh, Monk Dol.

173
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,500
When did you disrobe?

174
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,500
A while ago.

175
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,083
What brings you here?

176
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:58,166
I'm in town for some errands.

177
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,875
I heard you were staying here.

178
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:05,208
So I was hoping
to stay overnight at the temple.

179
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:06,875
Is that all right?

180
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,291
Of course.

181
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,625
You can stay in my old quarters.

182
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,541
How have you been?
What have you been up to?

183
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:20,958
I'm…

184
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,125
preparing for equivalency exams.

185
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:27,166
That's good. Jobs are scarce these days.

186
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,958
Even more so
for a monk who recently disrobed.

187
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,458
Did you see
the wreckage of the gold and silver tree?

188
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,000
Yes.

189
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,333
It was the work of Win and Game.

190
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,208
They're talented people.

191
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:51,375
They were able to make a small temple
such as Phummaram famous.

192
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:56,291
Here, they started a project
to raise funds to build a hospital.

193
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:00,541
After the tree incident,
I don't know what happened to them.

194
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,708
Have you talked to them?

195
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,125
Not at all.

196
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,125
Make yourself at home.

197
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,125
I'll excuse myself.

198
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,500
Can you pick somewhere more accessible?

199
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:14,750
You go ahead.

200
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,208
Excuse me.

201
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,875
Is anyone here?

202
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:02,291
Oops.

203
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,750
Sorry, Venerable Father.

204
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,666
Who is it?

205
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:10,500
Honey.

206
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:13,833
It's me.

207
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:40,041
That's the last temple. Let's go back.

208
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:02,125
Hello, Jeng?

209
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:08,083
Oh, it's you, Auntie? Okay.

210
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:09,166
Just a sec.

211
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:12,958
Go ahead.

212
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,125
I visited all nine temples for you.

213
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:27,875
I found the Venerable Father.

214
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,125
<i>He told me</i>

215
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:36,083
<i>that when you wake up,</i>

216
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,375
<i>I should take you to see him.</i>

217
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:43,125
<i>So you have to wake up.</i>

218
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:50,250
Win…

219
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:20,208
NONG KHAN TEMPLE

220
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,000
Which way?

221
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:48,708
I'M INSIDE THE TEMPLE

222
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:31,625
Did Win say where it's kept?

223
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:34,875
He only said
it's in the scripture library.

224
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:51,375
Dear.

225
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:12,375
I think this is it.

226
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,291
What are you doing?

227
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,125
I said, what are you doing here?

228
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:30,833
What are you stealing?

229
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:36,875
We think there might be evidence here

230
00:26:36,958 --> 00:26:38,833
that may implicate the embezzler.

231
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:45,375
Who do you mean?

232
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:48,208
Councillor Ae.

233
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:51,083
And maybe MP Wut as well.

234
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:56,416
How did you know to look in here?

235
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:00,958
Win…

236
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:04,791
Win told me.

237
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:09,250
Is the proof in the safe?

238
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:12,208
Not sure. We have to open it to find out.

239
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,833
We don't have the code.

240
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:23,666
Wait here, then.

241
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,000
Don't go anywhere.

242
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,416
Wait.

243
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:02,583
Make another copy for me.

244
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:07,458
When Win wakes up,
tell him his cat is with me.

245
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,583
I will.

246
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:39,750
GOT THE EVIDENCE
PROCEED TO NEXT STEP

247
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:42,208
What's taking so long?

248
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:51,125
Meet at the market parking lot.
Altis, plate number 2328.

249
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,791
What the hell are you doing?
You're taking too long.

250
00:29:57,458 --> 00:29:58,666
Don't rush me, bro.

251
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:00,333
What were you doing?

252
00:30:00,958 --> 00:30:02,000
Jerking off.

253
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:05,041
Fuck. That was long.

254
00:30:05,541 --> 00:30:08,541
Well, I had to use my imagination.

255
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,875
-Jeez.
-I take a while to finish.

256
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:13,125
Hey.

257
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:17,708
Not funny, jackass.

258
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:42,375
Once it's over, what will you do?

259
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:47,958
Are you still going to do business
with your friends?

260
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:51,250
Yeah, I guess I will.

261
00:30:54,416 --> 00:30:57,250
But I have no idea where to get the funds.

262
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,208
Are you coming with me?

263
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:21,166
They didn't invite me.

264
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:25,541
I'm inviting you.

265
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:41,250
It's…

266
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:45,250
It's much further than I imagined.

267
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:50,291
But it…

268
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:56,083
sounds interesting.

269
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,000
Playing hard to get?

270
00:32:17,708 --> 00:32:18,875
Morning's breaking.

271
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:22,208
Want to give alms?

272
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:26,833
Sure.

273
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,125
I'll go buy the things.

274
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:46,708
ASKING PRICE: 6,450,000 BAHT (NEGOTIABLE)

275
00:32:46,791 --> 00:32:49,458
VIEWINGS AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST

276
00:33:02,666 --> 00:33:04,000
How much for a rose?

277
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:05,083
Twenty baht.

278
00:33:08,416 --> 00:33:09,625
I'll take one.

279
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:22,750
<i>Rose.</i>

280
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:24,708
<i>World.</i>

281
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,333
Robot.

282
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:29,333
Key.

283
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:31,500
Mushroom.

284
00:33:35,166 --> 00:33:36,166
Rainbow.

285
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:39,416
Moon.

286
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:44,666
Tennis.

287
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:54,166
Calendar.

288
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:17,250
Well, the money's all yours now.
Let's go our separate ways.

289
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:21,875
That money
will never make up for my son's life.

290
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,291
Shit, are you playing tricks on us?

291
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:25,958
Fuck you!

292
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:28,125
-Hey, sit!
-Bastard!

293
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:30,083
-Freeze! Police!
-Hands up!

294
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:31,291
Show me your hands!

295
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:33,458
Freeze! Stay still. Don't move!

296
00:34:33,541 --> 00:34:35,083
Hands up! Search the place!

297
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:36,500
Hands up!

298
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:38,416
What are you looking at? Sit there!

299
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,458
Now! Do it!

300
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:41,375
Move!

301
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:43,041
Stay calm!

302
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:44,958
-To the center!
-Move to the center!

303
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:48,458
Sit down! Hands behind your neck!

304
00:34:48,541 --> 00:34:50,500
Kneel down. Hurry up!

305
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:51,875
-Go on.
-Search them.

306
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:52,958
First one, cleared!

307
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:54,250
Second one, cleared!

308
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:55,583
Third one, cleared!

309
00:34:55,666 --> 00:34:57,041
-Take them away!
-Up!

310
00:34:57,125 --> 00:34:59,041
-Get up!
-Don't resist. Walk!

311
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:00,041
Move it!

312
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,291
Just walk.

313
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:09,250
Allow me to take you in for questioning.

314
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:13,583
About what?

315
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:16,250
Please cooperate with the authorities.

316
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:22,833
This way.

317
00:35:32,916 --> 00:35:35,708
The contractor that built the tree is

318
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:39,416
one of my daughter's affiliated companies.

319
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:45,000
The engineer and the person
who signed off on it

320
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:47,500
shut the company down and ran off.

321
00:35:49,541 --> 00:35:51,000
What's she got to do with this?

322
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:53,208
One billion baht appeared in your account.

323
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:55,291
Where'd it come from?

324
00:35:56,875 --> 00:36:00,000
Those damn kids
embezzled the foundation's money.

325
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:02,875
I helped to get it back.

326
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:05,500
What an incredible act of generosity.

327
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:11,833
So the donated money
can finally go to building the hospital.

328
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:14,083
May your family be blessed for this.

329
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:16,125
May you prosper.

330
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:21,958
When you're ready,

331
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:26,041
please transfer it back to the foundation.

332
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:34,750
If there's nothing else, then… I'll leave.

333
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:38,583
Besides that, sir,

334
00:36:38,666 --> 00:36:42,333
the abbot of Nong Khan Temple
was quite meticulous.

335
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:44,416
Everything he did,

336
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:46,958
he kept records of it.

337
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:51,250
<i>Who did what,</i>

338
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:52,166
<i>how,</i>

339
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:54,666
<i>with whom.</i>

340
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:57,458
Everything was documented.

341
00:36:58,125 --> 00:36:59,958
Not backing down, are you?

342
00:37:02,708 --> 00:37:04,833
Getting transferred wasn't enough.

343
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:07,625
You want to disappear for good?

344
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:13,083
He's here, sir.

345
00:37:19,958 --> 00:37:21,291
<i>I get the impression</i>

346
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:25,000
that you like wasting bullets.

347
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:31,166
But this one,

348
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,625
I'm sure you remember.

349
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:45,375
This bullet

350
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:49,333
was pulled from this man's head
18 years ago.

351
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:52,708
Your old buddy,

352
00:37:53,416 --> 00:37:55,666
Mr. Anuwat Luckngam.

353
00:37:56,666 --> 00:38:00,041
You were board members
of the Trai Burin Temple Foundation.

354
00:38:01,416 --> 00:38:03,291
I thought he was dead.

355
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,000
But guess what? He's still alive.

356
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,000
And his memory's sharp.

357
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:12,250
He remembers exactly

358
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,333
<i>which of his friends</i>

359
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:16,750
<i>did him wrong.</i>

360
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:20,041
The fuck are you yapping about?

361
00:38:20,541 --> 00:38:21,583
I don't know him.

362
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,958
I knew you'd say that.

363
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:28,291
So I found an eyewitness.

364
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:32,875
Long time no see, bro.

365
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,208
Take care of it.

366
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,083
I brought you something.

367
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:52,375
<i>You had the father shot.</i>

368
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:56,875
The son was shot by your daughter.

369
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,250
<i>Your families' fates</i>

370
00:39:01,666 --> 00:39:03,083
<i>are perfectly aligned.</i>

371
00:39:23,666 --> 00:39:25,291
Thank you so much.

372
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:33,333
You idiots are so naive.

373
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:40,916
What about Dear?

374
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:53,083
What?

375
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:54,750
What is it?

376
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,208
What?

377
00:40:11,916 --> 00:40:12,916
What is it?

378
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:19,708
-How much for a rose?
-Twenty baht.

379
00:40:19,791 --> 00:40:21,083
I'll take one.

380
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Sixty baht.

381
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,750
There's a shooting!

382
00:41:04,791 --> 00:41:07,208
Could you… make the call for me?

383
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:22,583
Are… are you calling?

384
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:29,416
Dear.

385
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:31,833
Dear.

386
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:36,833
Dear.

387
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:12,666
Shit.

388
00:42:14,958 --> 00:42:15,875
Win.

389
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:19,958
You gotta tell me
this is part of your plan.

390
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:26,666
Tell me this is part of your plan!

391
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:44,625
Stay with me.

392
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:46,208
Just for a moment.

393
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:38,375
The person who shot Ms. Darisa

394
00:44:39,291 --> 00:44:40,291
said that she

395
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:43,833
worked for your daughter.

396
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:48,416
Do you really think
the law can do anything to me?

397
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:58,458
<i>You've been a cop for this long.</i>
<i>You should know by now.</i>

398
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:19,833
Win.

399
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:22,708
Won't you eat something?

400
00:46:27,666 --> 00:46:30,791
ABBOT NARES'S RESIDENCE

401
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:32,375
ABBOT EKACHAI'S RESIDENCE

402
00:46:32,458 --> 00:46:34,416
<i>Luck is definitely on your side.</i>

403
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,666
<i>Trai Burin's deputy abbot</i>
<i>passed on suddenly.</i>

404
00:46:38,416 --> 00:46:42,000
Don't you think it's because
of my abilities or spiritual merit?

405
00:46:43,541 --> 00:46:45,416
Yes, of course.

406
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:49,541
By the way,
please DM me a copy of your ID.

407
00:46:49,625 --> 00:46:52,958
The Alphard van donated by Mrs. Jongjit
isn't insured yet.

408
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:54,291
I'll take care of it.

409
00:46:54,958 --> 00:46:56,583
Don't you have my ID already?

410
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,458
Also,

411
00:46:59,958 --> 00:47:02,875
do you want a lucky number
for the license plate?

412
00:47:02,958 --> 00:47:04,208
I can reserve one.

413
00:47:05,875 --> 00:47:09,083
Any number will do.
You needn't believe in such things.

414
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:14,791
Also, please deposit the cash offerings

415
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:17,833
into our foundation's account as usual.

416
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:22,083
Of course. But the foundation's account
is frozen at the moment.

417
00:47:22,166 --> 00:47:24,416
It could be a while
before the case is closed.

418
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,125
Hey.

419
00:48:01,208 --> 00:48:02,458
So Dear

420
00:48:03,708 --> 00:48:05,791
donated her body to science.

421
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:09,000
<i>And I've</i>

422
00:48:10,291 --> 00:48:11,416
<i>informed the hospital.</i>

423
00:48:12,375 --> 00:48:13,833
<i>Her dad is</i>

424
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:16,291
<i>on his way here.</i>

425
00:48:41,166 --> 00:48:42,375
What about you?

426
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:48,000
Don't you wanna see your dad?

427
00:49:14,208 --> 00:49:17,958
<i>Do you think Dear will go to a place</i>
<i>where she can be at peace?</i>

428
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:23,625
When her mom died, she asked me about it.

429
00:49:34,625 --> 00:49:36,125
-Game.
-Yeah?

430
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,875
I was the one who killed Dear.

431
00:49:47,333 --> 00:49:48,375
It was me.

432
00:50:05,958 --> 00:50:07,125
<i>It wasn't just you.</i>

433
00:50:16,875 --> 00:50:18,250
<i>It was me too, buddy.</i>

434
00:50:49,166 --> 00:50:50,541
Shit, I miss her, man.

435
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:53,083
Yeah.

436
00:51:13,416 --> 00:51:14,333
Excuse me.

437
00:51:15,541 --> 00:51:16,500
Win's friend…

438
00:51:17,458 --> 00:51:19,166
-Dear?
-Yeah.

439
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:20,625
Game?

440
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:45,625
So late, isn't he?

441
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:47,250
Yeah.

442
00:51:53,166 --> 00:51:54,291
How about this?

443
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:58,041
Let's just get started.

444
00:52:02,791 --> 00:52:03,708
Okay.

445
00:52:10,166 --> 00:52:12,708
It's a project that's…

446
00:52:14,208 --> 00:52:15,208
totally amazing.

447
00:52:17,291 --> 00:52:19,416
It's an NFT game, which I think

448
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,875
will go viral in the next few years.

449
00:52:21,958 --> 00:52:24,458
The game's called <i>Pirate's Hell.</i>

450
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:27,666
I'm sorry, but…

451
00:52:28,166 --> 00:52:30,041
Thank you for thinking of me.

452
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:33,083
But I have a full-time job.

453
00:52:33,666 --> 00:52:36,333
I came today to turn you down in person.

454
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:37,833
Come on.

455
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:40,333
You're here already.

456
00:52:41,375 --> 00:52:42,583
Just hear me out.

457
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:48,791
Look, when Win heard the pitch,

458
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:50,458
he dropped everything to do it.

459
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:54,875
That fucker Win, he's so…

460
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:57,750
Sorry.

461
00:52:58,833 --> 00:53:00,541
Here's the quick version.

462
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:06,583
So <i>Pirate's Hell </i>is a game
on the blockchain platform.

463
00:53:06,666 --> 00:53:08,833
And it's P2E,

464
00:53:08,916 --> 00:53:13,250
which means players can earn
a sustainable income from the game.

465
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,791
I should get going.

466
00:53:16,875 --> 00:53:18,166
I have other plans.

467
00:53:21,291 --> 00:53:23,041
Is the bathroom downstairs?

468
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,500
Yeah.

469
00:53:45,375 --> 00:53:46,583
How did that happen?

470
00:53:48,791 --> 00:53:52,333
It's a red-and-white curb.
Of course you'd get busted.

471
00:53:52,958 --> 00:53:54,000
Fuck.

472
00:53:54,083 --> 00:53:55,083
But it's okay.

473
00:53:56,416 --> 00:53:57,333
I handled it.

474
00:53:58,041 --> 00:53:58,958
Here.

475
00:54:00,666 --> 00:54:01,750
Hey.

476
00:54:02,958 --> 00:54:04,083
Why are you here?

477
00:54:04,666 --> 00:54:05,583
Did you talk?

478
00:54:06,166 --> 00:54:08,291
We did, but your friend won't do it.

479
00:54:10,583 --> 00:54:11,708
I'll get going.

480
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:22,458
Give me one.

481
00:54:24,375 --> 00:54:25,208
Here.

482
00:54:28,958 --> 00:54:32,250
By the way, I found an investor for us.

483
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:34,166
We don't have to get a loan.

484
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:36,666
How much?

485
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:38,750
The first payment's two million.

486
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:41,333
After that, it'll come in installments.

487
00:54:41,833 --> 00:54:44,666
Two million a month for two years.

488
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:48,625
Anyway, point is,

489
00:54:48,708 --> 00:54:51,083
they said this project has potential.

490
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:52,583
It's a damn moneymaker.

491
00:54:57,458 --> 00:54:58,458
Count me in.

492
00:55:01,333 --> 00:55:02,416
What the hell?

493
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,000
Changed your mind?

494
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:07,791
I don't wanna miss out.

495
00:55:12,791 --> 00:55:15,166
Okay. Let's go inside, then.

496
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:16,333
Come on.

497
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:20,375
Is there any liquor? Or just wine?

498
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:22,500
Of course there is, asshole.

499
00:55:22,583 --> 00:55:25,666
Give me your account number.
I'll pay you back for the ticket.

500
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,375
Just buy me drinks.

501
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:28,791
That's more expensive.

502
00:55:28,875 --> 00:55:30,458
Yeah. That's the point.

503
00:55:30,541 --> 00:55:31,416
What the hell?

504
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:34,125
-Which floor?
-Let's go to the fifth floor.

505
00:55:37,833 --> 00:55:44,833
PLEASE STAY FOR THE POST-CREDITS SCENE

506
00:56:07,208 --> 00:56:09,708
FOUR MONTHS LATER

507
00:56:09,791 --> 00:56:12,583
The Thai stock market's P/E
has already peaked.

508
00:56:12,666 --> 00:56:15,333
It's better to invest
in undervalued stocks

509
00:56:15,416 --> 00:56:17,291
and wait for the returns.

510
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,416
I'll send you the list of stocks I picked.

511
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,541
We'll choose the president
on Makha Bucha Day.

512
00:56:24,125 --> 00:56:25,500
Blessings.

513
00:56:33,333 --> 00:56:36,875
I heard the money was transferred
back to the foundation.

514
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:38,625
That's right.

515
00:56:40,166 --> 00:56:41,291
In that case,

516
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,875
continue with the hospital project.

517
00:56:44,958 --> 00:56:46,416
The sooner, the better.

518
00:56:46,916 --> 00:56:49,500
Many people will benefit from this.

519
00:56:58,791 --> 00:56:59,666
Excuse me.

520
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,500
Namaskar.

521
00:57:03,083 --> 00:57:05,583
Please step outside.
The ceremony will begin now.

522
00:57:13,958 --> 00:57:15,041
Wait a moment.

523
00:57:15,583 --> 00:57:16,958
Monk Ekachai,

524
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:22,083
you are now the abbot of Nong Khan Temple.

525
00:57:22,791 --> 00:57:26,791
Make sure to do your duties well.

526
00:57:28,166 --> 00:57:29,791
As for that video clip,

527
00:57:30,708 --> 00:57:32,833
we are keeping it safe.

528
00:57:36,333 --> 00:57:37,791
Don't worry about it.

529
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:45,041
A pity about that poor old lady, isn't it?

530
00:57:47,166 --> 00:57:49,250
No one knows who killed her.

531
00:57:51,708 --> 00:57:53,875
Such was her karma.

532
00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:23,500
An assistant to a minister
is presiding over the event.

533
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:25,208
Master Songchai recommended him.

534
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:09,000
Sadhu.

535
00:59:15,625 --> 00:59:18,875
