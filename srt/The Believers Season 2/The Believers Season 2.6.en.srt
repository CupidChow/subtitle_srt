Shit.

I've made up my mind.

00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,541
I really can't keep doing this.

22
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,125
Thank you for everything.

23
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,041
It's been a good experience.

24
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,250
But I don't think this is for me.

Anyway,

26
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,375
I hope

27
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,625
you will succeed, Dear,

28
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,208
and achieve what you set out to do.

29
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,250
Dear,

30
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,291
are you gonna answer it?

31
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,375
Give me a moment.

32
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,583
Hello?

33
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,291
The plan's changed.

00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,291
<i>What is it now?</i>

35
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,875
For fuck's sake, listen.

36
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,208
The tree collapsed and crushed people.

37
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,750
<i>Get on a flight to Bangkok now.</i>

38
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,541
Dear. I'm begging you.

39
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,083
You don't have to help me.

40
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,708
But can you help my mom?
You're the only one who can.

41
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,375
How?

42
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,875
The seed phrase ends in "calendar."

43
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,833
Check the wallet. There's a billion.

44
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,208
But please help my mom. Please.

45
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,833
Why don't you help her?

46
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,458
I have to help Game.

47
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,083
<i>Listen carefully, Dear.</i>

48
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,875
<i>Whatever happens,</i>
<i>you can't make any mistakes.</i>

49
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,333
Get a flight to Bangkok ASAP.

50
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,416
When you land,

51
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,833
go to the third-floor parking lot,
pillar L4.

52
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,375
Third floor, pillar L4.

53
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,125
I parked a rental car there.

54
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,541
Pick my mom up in front of our old school.

55
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:31,958
<i>Then drive to the location I sent you</i>
<i>to get the watches.</i>

56
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,583
That's our ticket out of this.

57
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,250
<i>Do it now, Dear. There's no time.</i>

58
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,625
I'll come with you.

59
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:46,833
No. It's dangerous.

60
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,333
More reason for me to go.

61
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,583
Where's your friend?

62
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,041
-Where is he?
-I don't know.

63
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:05,833
I wish I knew too.

64
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,375
What did Ae say?

65
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,375
Did you call her?

66
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:14,708
I called her.

67
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,541
She's not picking up.

68
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,000
So call her again. It's urgent, asshat.

69
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,041
I've done some research.

70
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:25,625
In our province, we have
many elderly people with kidney disease.

71
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:29,125
We've received funding
for five dialysis machines.

72
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,958
But just two would be enough.

73
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,541
What if we get caught?

74
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:33,958
What then?

75
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:35,416
Doctor.

76
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,291
There are thousands of hospitals
in our country.

77
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,375
No one's going to check.

78
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,291
Same goes for the meds.

79
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:47,000
Nobody's going to ask the patients
which meds they received.

80
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,125
This is a sensitive matter.

81
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,125
I need time to think.

83
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,458
What's your concern, Doctor?

84
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,375
It violates the code of medical ethics.

85
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,416
Perhaps I didn't tell you.

86
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:04,291
I'll give you free rein to handle
all the expensive meds we won't be using.

87
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:33,750
<i>Ms. Ae.</i>

88
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,208
That's too much.

89
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,791
100 to 200 cases a day.

90
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:40,208
If we do this for four or five days,
that's 1,000 cases.

91
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,875
At that rate, doctors would probably
end up as patients.

92
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,958
Try some. It's from a famous place here.

93
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,166
Ms. Ae.

94
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,458
Have you seen this?

95
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,125
Hi, son.

96
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,458
<i>Hello? Mom, where are you?</i>

97
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:12,583
I'm at home.

99
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,583
<i>She's upstairs. Should I get her?</i>

100
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,000
No, don't.

101
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,458
Mom, listen carefully.

102
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,291
Get away from Ple now.

103
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,125
Why? What's going on?

104
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,875
<i>It's nothing. Don't ask.</i>

105
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,000

Where are you going?

120
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,833
I'm taking some curry to Pen.

121
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,166
Where's the curry?

122
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:58,416
That's right.
I knew I'd forgotten something.

123
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,458
Oh well. I blame old age.

124

Hey, go and look!

00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,208

189
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:51,583
<i>I have to go now.</i>

190
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,791
I WANT 500,000 BAHT NOW
BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER: T BANK…

191
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:20,416
YOTTHON OSOT PHARMACY

192
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,083
Here, there's soup too.

193
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:45,916
Do you want some?

194
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,416
Or this one?

195
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,041
Oh, there's a toy.

196
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:58,958
Hey, here it is.

197
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,166
What did you get me?

198
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:01,625
Here you go.

199
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,375
Are you really friends?

200
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,416
Doesn't he give a shit?

201
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,833
You're about to die here.

202
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,333
Win.

203
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,291
You did me dirty, Win.

204
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,791
Embezzling temple money isn't very nice.

205
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,333
Hurry and give it back.

206
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,583
<i>Where's Game?</i>

207
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,125
You're asking me? How should I know?

208
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,000
<i>Is he trapped under the fallen tree?</i>

209
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,291
And your mom? Where is she?

210
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,125
I'm worried about her.

211
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,833
<i>Did you find her?</i>
<i>If not, tell me. I'll help you look.</i>

212
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,125
We can always earn back the temple money.

213
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,291
But if you come to see me,

214
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,958
maybe I can help you find your friend.

215
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,791
You have one hour.

216
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:48,083
Come meet me.
We might have a little misunderstanding.

217
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,000
Auntie.

218
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,125
Open the door.

219
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,083
I'll drive you.

220
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,375
Where are you going?

221
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,958
Auntie. Open!

222
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,625
I said, open.

223
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:16,958
Auntie.

224
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,833
Open it!

225
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,416
Open it right now.

226
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,416
Open! I said, open it!

227
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,333
Open it now!

228
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,333
Open it, bitch!

229
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,041
-No! Please, Ple!
-Open it!

230
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,041
-Ple! No!
-Open!

231
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:34,541
Please, Ple!

232
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,083
I'm scared! Ple!

233
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,583
Stop it, Ple!

234
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,166
I'm scared!

235
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,833
Auntie!

236
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,916
-Please! I'm scared!
-Auntie!

237
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,333
It's me, Dear.

238
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:18,791
Over there.

239
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:40,583
Dear.

240
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,416
She's hurt.

241
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:45,250
-Fuck!
-Dear, where's Win, honey?

242
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,000
Dear, where's Win?

243
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,083
Dear, where's Win, honey?

244
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,208
I'm taking you to Win right now.

245
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,416
Dear. Stop the car.

246
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,625
Stop the car!

247
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:23,541
Hey! Where are you going?

248
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:30,333
I can't do this.

249
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,333
I should stop here.

250
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:14,208
<i>I'm standing in front</i>
<i>of the Wat Nong Khan Foundation,</i>

251
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:18,958
<i>reporting live from the scene</i>
<i>of the gold-and-silver tree collapse.</i>

252
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:22,250
<i>Initial reports indicate</i>
<i>six people have died in this incident.</i>

253
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,750
<i>Among them is the abbot,</i>

254
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:29,458

256
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:34,125
Motherfucker.

257
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:38,250
<i>As for the cause of the collapse,</i>
<i>initial reports suggest</i>

258
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,958
<i>the structure couldn't support…</i>

259
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,916
Oh, good grief.

260
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,750
That's fucking scary.

261
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:45,708
What?

262
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:47,708
She took my money again.

263
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:50,541
Now I'm really fucked.

264
00:25:15,416 --> 00:25:16,375
Mom!

265
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:19,291
Mom!

266
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:22,083
Nong.

267
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:24,708
Why is Nong lying there?

268
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:25,708
Where's Milin?

269
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,083
Isn't she with you?

270
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:29,458
Nong! Where's Milin?

271
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:30,708
Nong!

272
00:25:30,791 --> 00:25:31,666
Nong! Wake up!

273
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,125
-Honey!
-Wake up! Where's Milin, Nong?

274
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,041
Milin's gone!

275
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:36,916
Nong!

276
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:09,041
Dear.

277
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:13,291
Can you tell me something?

278
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:19,125
Win's waiting for us at the pier.

279
00:26:20,416 --> 00:26:23,166
When we get there,
I'll let Win tell you everything.

280
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:28,875
Vichit!

281
00:26:28,958 --> 00:26:30,250
Milin's missing.

282
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:31,875
Get the workers to look for her.

283
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,416
How did she go missing?

284
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,958
If I knew, why would I come to you? Go!

285
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:37,333
-Let's go.
-Go look for her!

286
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:39,208
-Come on.
-I'll go left!

287
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:41,666
-Milin!
-Where are you?

288
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,166
Milin!

289
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,000
-Where are you?
-Milin, honey?

290
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:48,291
Have you seen Milin around here?

291
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:50,416
No, ma'am. Not at all.

292
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,583
Milin!

293
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:53,000
-Where are you?
-Milin!

294
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:54,125
No sign of her.

295
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:55,708
Milin!

296
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:56,958
Shut the back gate.

297
00:26:58,208 --> 00:26:59,750
Nong, wake up! Nong!

298
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,375
Nong, wake up!

299
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,250
Nong, listen to me.

300
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,083
Who took Milin?

301
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:11,208
Who took Milin?

302
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:12,750
It was Chat.

303
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:14,375
What's his department?

304
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:15,541
Delivery.

305
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:18,000
Check the CCTV.

306
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,708
-Track the GPS to see where the car is.
-Ms. Grace.

307
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:25,250
Ms. Grace, I'm sorry.

309
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:27,625

310
00:27:27,708 --> 00:27:29,041
I'm sorry.

311

BOON TO CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR

312
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,166
Please see to the wounded over there.

313
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:52,458
Hey, take care of this one.

314
00:27:52,541 --> 00:27:53,791
Let's go over there.

315
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:56,375
The responders are here. Don't worry…

316
00:27:56,916 --> 00:27:59,041
Tell the cooks to prepare more food.

317
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:03,458
Pond, get electrolyte drinks
for the rescue workers.

318
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:04,666
Sure.

319
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,833
Uncle.

320
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:33,208
-Can I have a cig?
-What's wrong with you?

321
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:35,041
You ask every damn day.

322
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:37,375
-Just a cig. Stingy much?
-Here.

323
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:46,833
Don't you want a cig? It's burning.

324
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:48,375
It stinks.

325
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:56,375
GRACE: MILIN'S MISSING
WHERE ARE YOU?

326
00:28:57,666 --> 00:28:59,791
Why are you messing with my family?

327
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:05,916
You're fucking pathetic.

328
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:12,583
If your friend doesn't show, Milin's head
will be all that's left of her.

329
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:18,708
If you're gonna kill someone,

330
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:20,291
just shoot me.

331
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:22,333
Shoot me, bitch. Right here. Do it!

332
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:25,208
You know what?

333
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:28,208
I never wanted to do this,
but you just had to challenge me.

334
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:34,166
You want this so badly, huh?

335
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:37,000
You really wanna die, do you?

336
00:29:37,958 --> 00:29:38,791
Well?

337
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:44,583
You think I want to do this?

338
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:48,583
You can't go in. Please stop!

339
00:29:48,666 --> 00:29:50,208
You can't go in there yet!

340
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:53,333
Hold on. Wait, boss!

341
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,041
Sir, you can't go in there. Please stop.

342
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:15,625
Ae.

343
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:17,458
What are you doing?

344
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:22,625
What the fuck are you doing here?

345
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:25,333
Getting ten million for the party.

346
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,541
Here.

347
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,041
He transferred ten million.

348
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,500
He told me to come here for another ten.

349
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:43,250
He's probably some… Chinese investor.
The name's difficult.

350
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,083
Mr. Wat-Nong-Khan?

351
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:51,250
Or maybe he's Vietnamese?

352
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:02,541
Shit.

353
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:07,708
<i>Hello?</i>

354
00:31:07,791 --> 00:31:08,791
Hello, Dad?

355
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:14,166
<i>What are you doing at the warehouse?</i>

356
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:17,208
Collecting ten million for the party.
Ae's here too.

357
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:18,916
She's pointing a gun at some guy…

358
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,958
Shit, Ae!

359
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:22,333
-Why'd you say that?
-Don't point it at me! Dad!

360
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:24,208
What's going on with you two?

361
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:25,250
Dad!

362
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,291
Ae's pointing a gun at me.

363
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:29,250
What? Put her on the phone.

364
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:30,416
Let me talk to Ae.

365
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:32,833
Shit.

366
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:37,333
-Ae.
<i>-Hello? Ae?</i>

367
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:38,500
Dad wants you.

368
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:40,041
<i>What's going on with you?</i>

369
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,625
<i>Hello?</i>

370
00:31:41,708 --> 00:31:43,291
<i>Ae, can you hear me?</i>

371
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:44,250
Ae.

372
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:47,125
-Why'd you come?
-I told you! For the money!

373
00:31:47,208 --> 00:31:49,750
Why are you pointing it at me?
Dad, Ae's gone mad.

374
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:54,291
Ae.

375
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:55,916
Calm down, dear.

376
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,750
<i>Let's just talk.</i>
<i>That's your little brother.</i>

377
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:06,458
Oh, right!

378
00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:10,083
He's Mr. Wat-Nong-Khan?

379
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,083
Are you trying to steal my money?

380
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:15,583
Fuck you!

381
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:22,416
What the hell?

382
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:29,958
There's a fire outside!

383
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:31,666
<i>It's spreading to the warehouse!</i>

384
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:34,666
Shit. Fire!

385
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,583
Ms. Ae, let's get out of here.

386
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:39,583
What the fuck are the guards doing?

387
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,916
Tell them to put it out.

388
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,750
Wait, I'll be right there.

389
00:32:45,916 --> 00:32:47,166
Where's the fire?

390
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:24,708
Go.

391
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:25,666
Nobody move!

392
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,583
No one leaves till Win gets here.

393
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,041
Fuck, Ae, it's a fire!

394
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:35,458
I said stop.

395
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:47,083
Someone called the fire department.
Two fire trucks heading to the warehouse.

396
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:48,500
Fucking Aun.

397
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:50,208
You called the cops? You prick!

398
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:52,375
Are you crazy? Why would I do that?

399
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:53,291
I'm here too!

400
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:57,958
The fire trucks are here, boss.

401
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,958
NONG KHAN MUNICIPALITY

402
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,416
Back truck, put out the south side first!

403
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:12,750
Put out the north side!

404
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:16,291
Who called it in?

405
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:18,083
Is anyone inside?

406
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:19,958
No.

407
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:23,666
Put out the fire outside.
Too much stuff inside. Don't go in yet.

408
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:39,416
What's going on?

409
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,125
Fire behind the warehouse.

410
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:44,875
Don't go in yet. It might explode.

411
00:34:47,666 --> 00:34:49,541
Ae, stop it now.

412
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:50,958
There's a fire.

413
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:52,958
Let's go. I can't take this.

414
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:55,291
Aun! If you go out there, I'll shoot!

415
00:34:58,666 --> 00:35:00,333
If you go, I'll shoot.

416
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:03,791
Then you'll have to talk to Dad!

417
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:06,208
Aun!

418
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:09,000
If you go, I'll shoot!

419
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:50,958
What's going on in there?
I heard gunshots.

420
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,916
Game?

421
00:36:19,541 --> 00:36:20,541
Shit!

422
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:25,416
Fuck.

423
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:44,750
Win!

424
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:49,208
Breathe! Hey.

425
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:50,666
Win!

426
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,583
Hey! Win!

427
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,000
Win…

428
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,708
Win, wake up!

429
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:03,416
Win! Fucker! Wake up, Win!

430
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,416
Shit!

431
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:09,333
Hey!

432
00:37:10,916 --> 00:37:12,041
Hey, Win!
