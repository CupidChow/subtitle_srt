00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:49,250
Sue.

00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:09,541
THE BELIEVERS 2

4
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,333
Inhale through the nose.

5
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:22,541
<i>If you're saying</i>
<i>this brings you to true focus,</i>

6
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,416
I think

7
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:27,958
meditation can do the same.

8
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:37,916
But people find peace in different ways.

9
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,333
I think what we're doing now

10
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:44,291
is like when you taught people
at the temple.

11
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:49,208
Back then, I didn't charge them.

12
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,791
Is it so wrong to do this as a job?

13
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:56,125
Monks get money from people making merit.

14
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:00,708
I don't think
monks and therapists are that different.

15
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:04,833
People turn to Dharma because they suffer.

16
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,833
People who go to retreats have problems.

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,958
<i>We just use different tools</i>
<i>to help them find peace easier.</i>

18
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:19,791
As a river full of water fills the ocean,

19
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:25,875
so the merit you dedicate here
shall benefit the departed.

20
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,958
May whatever…

21
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,583
Blessings to you.

22
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,750
May you all return home safely.

23
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,375
May all your wishes be fulfilled
in every way.

24
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:42,375
Aun.

25
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,833
I heard that Ae

26
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:55,500
is building a hospital
at the Wat Nong Khan Foundation.

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,916
Why not ask her to do it here?

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,500
Well, you know
how damn complicated things are here.

29
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,166
Too much to handle.

30
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,958
Let Ae try this on her own.

31
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,250
Let's see how far she can go.

32
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,625
Venerable Father,

33
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,708
please take a look at these names.

34
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,083
A request from upstairs.

AUGUST 26, 1966 - NOVEMBER 11, 2005

36
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,125
Excuse me.

37
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,291
Can I borrow a lighter?

38
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:57,666
Here.

39
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,666
Thank you.

40
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,583
Are you making merit for a relative?

41
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:06,916
For my mother.

42
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,708
Sorry for your loss.

43
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,208
It's okay.

44
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,708
It's been almost 20 years.

45
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,750
What about you?

46
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,416
For a relative?

47
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:22,875
For my father.

48
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:26,500
Thank you.

49
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,166
-Hey.
-Oh, Win.

50
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,291
Are you here for an amulet?

51
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm in the area, so I stopped by.

52
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,625
I see.

53
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,416
-Hey.
-What?

54
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,625
He's making merit for his mom.
Shouldn't Ae be here too?

55
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,625
His mom's the mistress.

56
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,750
I just finished work.

57
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,500
-Wanna drink?
-I have work.

58
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,916
Fuck it. Just a small one.

59
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:18,041
The doctor said it's viral enteritis.

60
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:20,875
What did she eat?

61
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:24,375
The other day we went out
for sukiyaki with Grandpa.

62
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:28,125
I fed her one spoon of soup.
When we got home, things went bad.

63
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,125
I see.

64
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,541
Aren't you busy? How'd you manage to come?

65
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,250
Yeah, a little busy. But…

66
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,500
My niece is sick, so I had to come.

67
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,583
What a good guy.

68
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,708
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

69
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,750
It's probably not serious.

70
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,416
She'll be on an IV,
and they'll observe her.

71
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,791
If she's okay tomorrow, she can go home.

72
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,208
-By the way…
-What?

73
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,083
Nong is quitting.

74
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm so bummed out.

75
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,958
It's hard to find a good nanny.

76
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,916
Oh well.

77
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,250
How about this?
I… can help you find someone.

78
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,625
And here she is, Auntie Amara.

79
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:17,250
The lucky winner who just won
on Mahachok Online, the online lotto.

80
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,708
The prize is 32 million baht.

81
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,500
She believes it was from the blessings

82
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,250
of the gold and silver tree before us.

83
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:30,541
Today, she's making merit by donating
two million baht to the locals.

92
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,208
Still in the mood to do shit like this?

93
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,083
-Where are you going?
-Fuck off.

94
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,375
You little shit.

95
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,458
A package for you.

96
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:41,625
What did you order?

97
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,666
My mom's New Year gift.

98
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,416
I see.

99
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:47,375
Hey.

100
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,375
Your senior just gave you something.

101
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:52,458
Thank you.

102
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,375
There you go. Good boy.

103
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,500
In another shot,
focus on the people near the monk.

104
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,291
-Got it.
-Thank you.

105
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,458
All right. Smile.

106
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:18,041
One, two, three.

107
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,166
Lower the sign a bit.

108
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,916
Okay, good.

109
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,750
One, two…

110
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,666
Bronze leaves, please.

111
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,375
Sure. How many?

112
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:32,875
Cigarette boy.

113
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,125
Oh.

114
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,458
It's you. Hi.

115
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,833
Are you a temple boy?

116
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,916
Yeah, I guess so.

117
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,125
I want ten gold leaves.

118
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,291
Ten leaves, please.

119
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:49,916
Where did you get that T-shirt?

120
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,708
From a shop I know.

121
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,166
You like it? It's a collectible.

122
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,625
That's something else.

123
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:57,375
Hey…

124
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,208
With your kind of money, why stop at ten?

125
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,833
You should get 100 leaves.

126
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,291
So…

127
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,708
What are you wishing for?
Since you bought ten.

128
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,083
Don't know. Haven't thought of it.

129
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:25,958
The lip balm you gave me…

130
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:28,875
is really good.

131
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:33,000
And the other day,
I watched your brand's live selling event.

132
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,416
Your sales are great.

133
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,791
So I wanted to invite you

134
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,291
to do co-marketing with us here.

135
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,541
Let's say you sell something
for 99 baht, all right?

136
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,666
I ask for nine baht
to donate to the hospital.

137
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,833
And you can do CSR
while also making merit.

138
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:56,083
A good image plus good karma.

139
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,416
Well?

140
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:01,208
It's a noble deed
to help people who are unwell.

141
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,000
You're surely

142
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,791
good at marketing.

143
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,125
Leave the temple and do marketing for me.

144
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,791
You see, my fee's quite high.

145
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,666
I think your idea's not bad, but…

146
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,708
nine baht is a lot.

147
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,833
You won't just be making merit.

148
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,833
You'll be a bridge
that helps others make merit too.

149
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:28,625
So in your next life,
you'll be pretty and… rich like this.

150
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,666
All right.

151
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,750
Here's the deal.

152
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,875
Don't give me an answer now.
Sleep on it first.

153
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:41,916
Take my contact info,

154
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,958
and if you're interested, just message me.

155
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:48,041
Here. My name's Game.

156
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,708
What does L stand for?

157
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,208
Just an L.

158
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,250
HELP US BUILD
WAT NONG KHAN HOSPITAL

159
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:07,166
Now I know what I want to write.

160
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,791
You guys can make the clip
in your usual style.

161
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,291
I want the atmosphere and the mood.

162
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,791
<i>Some close-ups.</i>

163
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,708
<i>-How about this mode?</i>
<i>-Yes, that's good.</i>

164
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,500
<i>Actually, I want more like this.</i>

165
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,958
Go with this one instead.

166
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:35,583
HAPPY NEW YEAR 2024

-Inspector!
-Congratulations, Inspector!

169
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,166
Thank you. Welcome.

170
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,333
Happy New Year. Hi there.

171
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,083
Happy New Year, Dad.

172
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,625
The Venerable Parn
from a temple in Phetchabun.

173
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,000
Only 99 of this edition were made.

174
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,875
You know Aun's using drugs again?

175
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,666
You're his sister. Watch him.

176
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,875
How's that my business?

177
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,250
Just send him to rehab.

178
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,750
Hey.

179
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:32,791
Mr. Roj told me you haven't
moved anything for him in a while.

180
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:34,833
What are you doing?

181
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,541
The hospital, of course.

182
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:41,041
The feedback is great,
and the donations keep growing.

183
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,958
No need to go through him.

184
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,583
We don't need to split it.

185
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,375
And who gave you

186
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,083
the right

187
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,875
to decide
whether you want to do something?

188
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:53,791
Huh?

189
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,166
You listen to me.

190
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:57,958
In this business,

191
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,250
you work for me.

192
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,791
Being my child doesn't give you privileges
to do what you want.

193
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,416
Before you tell me off,

194
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,666
you know how much the hospital's worth?

195
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,583
I don't give a damn.

196
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,666
If I tell you to do something, do it.

197
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,500
Then let that shithead Aun handle Roj.

198
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,750
He's into that stuff anyway.

199
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:41,583
<i>Next, I'd like to respectfully invite</i>
<i>the esteemed MP Wut</i>

200
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,041
<i>to give New Year's blessings onstage.</i>

201
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,250
<i>Please come on up.</i>

202
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,708
HAPPY NEW YEAR 2024
ESTEEMED SETTAWUT KLAIDUANG

203
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,333
Hello.

204
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,791
No need for introductions, I guess.

205
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,541
We see each other every year.

206
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:13,625
Just now, the MC called me "MP."

207
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,833
But that's in the past.

208
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,750
These days, I just plant trees

209
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,125
and raise chickens here and there.

210
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,541
But in my heart,

211
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,083
I still want to serve the people.

212
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,000
So this year, I've decided

213
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,791
to pass the baton to Aun.

214
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,333
My youngest son

215
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:37,958
will take the baton.

216
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,333
He'll take over from me

217
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,958
as the party's candidate
for constituency MP

218
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,208
in the upcoming election.

219
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:56,333
With that,
I entrust Aun to all of you here.

220
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,291
Please support my son.

221
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:04,458
Hello.

222
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:10,041
Hello.

223
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,333
Finally,

224
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:17,166
I'd like to thank everyone
who joined us today.

225
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,666
May this year bring you
happiness and prosperity.

226
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,625
SETTAWUT FIGHTING COCKS

227
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:25,541
Get out.

228
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,166
You too.

229
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,916
Auntie Kim
from Huad Seng Agricultural Supplies

230
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,583
will be here for the holy water.

231
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,291
At 11:30 p.m.,
you'll lead the New Year's Eve chanting.

232
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:08,958
During that time, the media will be here
to report and take photos.

233
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,625
I'd like you to practice blinking slowly.

234
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:12,541
Look down.

235
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,791
Maybe a faint smile. Wait…

236
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,333
No smile? Don't smile.

237
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,708
Keep a serious, reverent expression.

238
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,166
Greetings, everyone.

239
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,500
Devotees who have come to make merit.

240
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:33,625
On New Year's Day
at the Wat Nong Khan Foundation,

241
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,666
<i>we are holding a grand merit-making event</i>

242
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,833
<i>to bring blessings for the new year.</i>

243
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,916
<i>There's a mass ordination ceremony</i>

244
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,166
<i>for a group of celebrities</i>
<i>who are beloved by all of you.</i>

245
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,750
<i>A grand temple fair in the evening</i>

246
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,916
<i>continuing through</i>
<i>to New Year's Eve chanting.</i>

247
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,291
<i>On this auspicious occasion,</i>

248
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:55,333
I invite everyone to come and see

249
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,541
the gold and silver tree.

250
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,666
Sacred and filled with merit.

251
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,125
<i>Buddham</i>, put money in the box.

252
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,791
<i>Dharmam</i>, put money in the box.

253
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,708
Sangham<i>, put money in the box.</i>

254
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,666
In my hand

255
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,541
are merit leaves you may choose
to purchase as a donation.

256
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:17,458
<i>Great or small,</i>

257
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,083
<i>it is up to your faith.</i>

258
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:23,208
<i>There are six levels</i>
<i>representing levels of heaven.</i>

259
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,750
<i>The greater your offering,</i>
<i>the greater your merit.</i>

260
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,000
<i>All donations</i>

261
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,416
<i>will be used to build</i>
<i>Wat Nong Khan Hospital.</i>

262
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,500
<i>Your merit</i>

263
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,625
<i>will make you healthy</i>

264
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,291
<i>and free from illnesses.</i>

265
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:41,166
<i>And it will bring you endless wealth.</i>

266
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,416
More importantly…

267
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,375
Today is a blessed day.

268
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,625
Put aside negative emotions.

269
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,416
On this New Year's Day

<i>most people associate them with monks…</i>

277

I LISTEN TO THIS EVERY DAY

278
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:34,416
…<i>so they often make merit with monks</i>
<i>through alms and offerings.</i>

00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,458
-Every leaf.
-Right.

293
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:01,000

294
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,916
match the drawn numbers,

295
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,791
you win one million baht.

296
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:06,416
It's that simple.

297
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,416
<i>So simple. Pay 1,000 baht</i>

00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,708
-How's it going?
-Good.

308

00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,541
<i>called the Golden Top Tiered Chatra.</i>

311
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,083

<i>For this top Phoken leaf.</i>

319
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:08,000

400,000!

323
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:13,333
400,000 already!

324
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:17,083
Now, we're not going home
until we hit one million.

325
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:18,333
We'll hit a million.

326
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:21,375
DONATIONS FOR HOSPITAL CONSTRUCTION: 80%

327
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:24,416
<i>500,000 baht!</i>

328
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,083
Game.

329
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,333
Yes?

330
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:58,208
Your project is almost complete, isn't it?

331
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:02,666
Young people do have great ideas.

332
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,583
I wanted to accomplish this.

333
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:12,125
But

334
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:16,000
now that we're close, I'm just

335
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,208
not so sure anymore.

336
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,250
Why is that?

337
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,250
The path to success

338
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:33,833
may not always be smooth.

339
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:39,000
But if it's for the greater good…

340
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:42,916
sometimes

341
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:46,291
we have to look past certain things.

342
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:49,958
And if our options are limited…

343
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:56,166
we can only do the best we can.

344
00:24:57,791 --> 00:24:58,791
That's all.

345
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:08,333
Venerable Father,
would you come take a photo?

346
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:25,208
Arrange them properly. Go that way.

347
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:26,541
Line them up.

348
00:25:27,541 --> 00:25:30,583
Don't block the entrance.
Just go that way. Go.

349
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:32,541
-Hello.
-Hello.

350
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:34,166
Point it that way.

351
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,375
Hello.

352
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:40,083
Why are you here, Dad?

353
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:42,666
You said it was a big event.

354
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,916
I wanted to see for myself.

355
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:49,708
Aun.

356
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:53,083
Ae, I'll help.

357
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:58,125
What the hell do you want? What else?

358
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:00,916
What's the budget?

359
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,666
Who did you appoint as director?

360
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:14,458
-Hi, Major General. Hi, Yai.
-Hello.

361
00:26:14,958 --> 00:26:16,500
-Hello, Mr. MP.
-Hello.

362
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:17,416
Wow.

363
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:22,500
This is a huge event.

364
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:24,625
With you presiding over an event,

365
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,500
it's always huge.

366
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:28,750
-Yes, so the people can enjoy.
-Right.

367
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:31,375
-How about a group photo?
-Sure.

368
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:33,166
Please, join us.

369
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,708
Aun, come take a photo.

370
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:36,333
Please. Come on.

371
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:38,750
Please, come over here.

372
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:42,000
Excuse me, I have to excuse myself.

373
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:44,041
I need to check on something.

374
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:45,500
Look after the VIP guests.

375
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:46,750
Stand close together.

376
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:48,666
One, two…

377
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,791
All right. One more.

378
00:26:53,541 --> 00:26:57,625
<i>In the year 2024,</i>

379
00:26:57,708 --> 00:27:00,250
<i>we will ring the bell</i>

380
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:02,083
<i>to welcome the new year.</i>

381
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:04,916
<i>We'll light the candle of victory</i>

382
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,708
<i>and chant the Jaya Paritta</i>

383
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:11,791
<i>to attain the greatest propitiousness</i>
<i>of our lives.</i>

384
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:14,208
<i>Moreover, Monk Ekachai</i>

385
00:27:14,291 --> 00:27:17,166
<i>will mercifully sprinkle the holy water</i>

386
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,833
<i>for all of you.</i>

387
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,875
<i>The New Year's Eve chanting</i>

388
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:26,416
<i>is a practice of cleansing the heart…</i>

389
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,375
What's up?

390
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,500
I want to give my mom a gift.

391
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:34,208
What gift? Let me see.

392
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:54,291
You're a softie, aren't you?

393
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,250
I think your mom

394
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:02,041
would be happy with just a card.

395
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:05,208
As for this, I'll keep it

396
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:07,916
as my caretaking fee.

397
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:12,583
What is it?

398
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,583
Happy New Year.

399
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:22,958
Thank you, son.
Best of luck for the New Year.

400
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:27,791
Hey, will you stay
for New Year's chanting?

401
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:29,250
No, I'm sleepy.

402
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,958
-Are you leaving?
-Yeah. Bye.

403
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:52,125
Look. Isn't it beautiful?

404
00:28:56,541 --> 00:28:59,333
MOM: DON'T STAY UP TOO LATE
HAPPY NEW YEAR

405
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:04,333
Wow.

406
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:08,541
A different look again.
I almost didn't recognize you.

407
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:13,000
So did you make it here
because the temple's not busy tonight?

408
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:14,666
New Year holiday.

409
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:18,875
What about you? Shouldn't you be
having dinner with family?

410
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:20,000
Why?

411
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,958
Do I look like I already have a husband?

412
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:26,875
Just asking.

413
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:31,041
You ordered a lot tonight.
How about some wine?

414
00:29:34,916 --> 00:29:36,625
Can I…

415
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,875
-Can I get the drinks menu?
-Sure.

416
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:45,000
The CSR project I told you about,
here's a rough campaign idea.

417
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,125
Something like…

418
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:48,750
"Beautiful inside and out."

419
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:52,291
It could link to your Beauty Beauty brand.

420
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:54,708
We could do a limited-edition item,

421
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:56,583
like "Lucky Lip Balm."

422
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:58,916
I'll design the packaging.

423
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,291
Put the Pho tree

424
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:02,125
or something on the packaging.

425
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:03,125
Any thoughts?

426
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:12,291
Why are you working at the temple?

427
00:30:13,916 --> 00:30:15,625
I'm not, exactly.

428
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,583
I'm just helping
with the hospital project.

429
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:26,583
Well…

430
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:32,500
The thing is…

431
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:38,541
My grandpa…

432
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:41,625
He passed away.

433
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:47,208
And before he passed,

434
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:48,791
he was ill.

435
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:53,625
In public hospitals, you have to wait
for beds to become available.

436
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:57,958
And… when Grandpa was waiting,
he suffered a lot.

437
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,791
Eventually, he got a bed.

438
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:07,083
But the condition in the hospital,
it was… unacceptable.

439
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:10,500
This hospital project, well,

440
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:13,666
it's meant to help poor patients,
you know?

441
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:18,458
So when a friend asked me,
I said yes and volunteered to help them.

442
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,166
With this project, do you believe we'll…

443
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:27,458
go to heaven if we donate to it?

444
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:33,625
Well…

445
00:31:35,416 --> 00:31:36,500
I don't know.

446
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,666
But it's making merit through a hospital.

447
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:41,708
Shouldn't it get you to heaven?

448
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:46,791
I believe you.

449
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:48,875
Because what I've been thinking

450
00:31:49,416 --> 00:31:50,875
is about to come true.

451
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:55,958
So what did you wish for this time, huh?

452
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:57,750
How many millions?

453
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:02,791
Want a drink?

454
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:05,250
Again?

455
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:06,958
It's New Year.

456
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,041
<i>If I move, what will I even do there?</i>

457
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:13,333
<i>Jobs aren't easy to find, you know.</i>

458
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:15,291
All right. Okay.

459
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:19,208
Is our kid awake? Can I talk to him?

460
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:21,958
<i>He's already asleep.</i>

461
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:23,916
<i>I don't want to wake him up.</i>

462
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:26,416
Wish him Happy New Year for me.

463
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,708
Happy New Year.

464
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:26,333
Happy New Year.

465
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:45,000
Happy New Year.

466
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:53,458
Drink up.

467
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:01,625
So, as an undertaker,

468
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:03,000
what exactly do you do?

469
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:06,666
When someone dies,

470
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:12,041
their family brings the death certificate
from the hospital and contacts the abbot.

471
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:14,583
Then the abbot calls me.

472
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:17,750
The body arrives at the crematorium.

473
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:21,125
Then I prepare the body and…

474
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,791
give them the final farewell.

475
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:30,708
How many have you cremated?

476
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:31,791
Do you remember?

477
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:34,541
I can't recall.

478
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:35,791
But I made notes.

479
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:40,708
Can I see?

480
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:49,708
<i>I take refuge in the Sangha</i>

481
00:34:49,791 --> 00:34:51,583
<i>For the second time</i>

482
00:34:51,666 --> 00:34:56,583
<i>I take refuge in the Buddha</i>

483
00:34:56,666 --> 00:34:58,083
<i>For the second time</i>

484
00:34:58,166 --> 00:35:01,333
<i>I take refuge in the Dharma…</i>

485
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:03,625
I got an A-lister on board.

486
00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:06,500
The tycoon Puvanai will come
for your New Year's blessings.

487
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:15,500
Venerable Brother,

488
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:16,875

489
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:18,750

You collect them?

494
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,375
They belonged to the dead.

495
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:58,583
Rescue workers took the good stuff.

496
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:00,833
By the time they get to me,

497
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:03,625
all that's left is junk.

498
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:11,541
We're out of ice. Got more?

499
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,000

I don't remember.
I've had it since I was a kid.

504
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:48,250
Take it. All yours.

505
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:49,916
Who gave it to you?

506
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,625
I said I don't remember.

507

What the fuck?

508
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:56,291
I'm asking, who gave it to you?

509
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:57,791
How did you get it?

510
00:36:58,541 --> 00:36:59,708
What got into you?

511
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:01,041
That's my fucking name!

512
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:07,208
A teacher gave me that.

513
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,500
What's the teacher's name?

514
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:12,208
Anuwat.

515
00:37:12,291 --> 00:37:13,833
Where is he now?

516
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:16,666
He died.

517
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:19,125
When?

518
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:22,750
When I was a kid,
someone had me cremate him.

519
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:23,666
Who?

520
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,000
Who brought him?

521
00:37:25,541 --> 00:37:26,750
How did he die?

522
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:30,375
-I don't know.
-You bastard!

523
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:32,875
Someone brought you a body,
and you don't know shit?

524
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:34,416
Why didn't you call the cops?

525
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:36,500
You don't know?

526
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:37,708
Why not call the cops?

527
00:37:37,791 --> 00:37:39,083
A cop brought him!

528
00:37:41,666 --> 00:37:43,541
Who? What's the cop's name?

529
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,041
One of Wut's people?

530

The fuck are you talking about?

544
00:41:17,791 --> 00:41:19,000
<i>I used to think</i>

545
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:22,000
<i>money could buy anything.</i>

546
00:41:30,583 --> 00:41:33,250
When I was a kid,
my dad said he'd take me to Hong Kong.

547
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:38,250
My mom and I were so happy.

548
00:41:45,083 --> 00:41:46,875
But two days before the trip…

549
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:54,291
he fucking disappeared.

550
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:57,166
What is it?

551
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:02,541
A cop killed my dad.

552
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:06,416
Why are you telling me?

553
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,416
<i>That cop</i>

554
00:42:10,458 --> 00:42:12,000
might work for MP Wut.

555
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,500
Remember the paper I gave you?

556
00:42:20,041 --> 00:42:22,333
<i>The missing name was Sombat.</i>

557
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,083
<i>It was MP Settawut's old name.</i>

558
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,500
Any idea who that cop might be?

559
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,125
<i>Fuck you!</i>

560
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:43,625
My mom changed completely.

561
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,833
She was never happy again.

562
00:42:50,416 --> 00:42:52,666
So I decided I'd do whatever it took

563
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,625
to make my mom happy again.

564
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:02,625
<i>I thought, if I could earn money as fast</i>

565
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:04,291
and as much as I could,

566
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,791
my life would be better.

567
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:12,666
But look around.

568
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:34,708
Thank you.

569
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:38,500
This is where it got me.

570
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:45,875
Win.

571
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:53,041
You just need to find a way out.

572
00:43:54,958 --> 00:43:56,166
Then we'll be okay.

573
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:10,791
Have you found the way out?

574
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:25,833
Happy New Year, guys.

575
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:30,833
I'm here to give bonuses to top employees
who hit their target early.

576
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:35,500
So you'll let us go now?

577
00:44:35,583 --> 00:44:36,916
We're still short.

578
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,916
How impatient, Game.
Put that aside for now.

579
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:43,666
I'm here to talk to you about two things.

580
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:44,750
First,

581
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:48,000
since the donations
are almost at the target,

582
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:50,750
I want to move up
the groundbreaking ceremony

583
00:44:50,833 --> 00:44:52,291
to two weeks from now.

584
00:44:52,958 --> 00:44:53,916
Wait.

585
00:44:54,916 --> 00:44:57,375
The original date was already damn tight.

586
00:44:58,083 --> 00:44:59,958
It happens to be an auspicious day.

587
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:01,791
Second,

588
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:04,250
I want to invite you two

589
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:06,541
to be my business partners.

590
00:45:17,458 --> 00:45:18,458
No.

591
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:26,875
What's our cut?

592
00:45:33,291 --> 00:45:34,166
Twenty.

593
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:36,708
Fifty-fifty.

594
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:38,583
You want 50?

595
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:43,208
You're just an employee,
but you want as much as the investor?

596
00:45:43,291 --> 00:45:46,041
Twenty percent is already
a generous offer.

597
00:45:46,583 --> 00:45:47,916
Yes or no?

598
00:45:56,041 --> 00:45:56,958
Piece of shit!

599
00:45:57,041 --> 00:45:58,166
Who are you cussing at?

600
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:00,875
It's fine if you want out.

601
00:46:02,541 --> 00:46:04,083
Then you do it alone.

602
00:46:04,166 --> 00:46:06,458
Let's part ways once we hit a billion.

603
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,375
Game.

604
00:46:09,291 --> 00:46:10,875
No need for an answer now.

605
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:12,208
Sleep on it.

606
00:46:13,125 --> 00:46:14,208
Wait.

607
00:46:14,291 --> 00:46:16,500
I have a gift for Milin.

608
00:46:16,583 --> 00:46:18,291
Didn't she get discharged?

609
00:46:32,625 --> 00:46:34,500
Pleasure doing business with you.

610
00:48:13,833 --> 00:48:16,750
