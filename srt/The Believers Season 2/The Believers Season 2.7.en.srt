1
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:00,083
Please help him, Father.

2
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,041
Don't worry.

3
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,625
I have prepared the shelter.

4
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,250
Will he be all right, Grandpa?

5
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:15,458
It's up to his will.

6
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:25,250
Please excuse me. I have to go now.

7
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:28,708
Good luck.

8
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:43,625
Remember, Sue.

9
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:46,333
You must never tell anyone about this.

10
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,333
Because if your teacher isn't dead,

11
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,041
we will be.

12
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:15,291
THE BELIEVERS 2

13
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,666
Hey, bro. Can you recover my hard disk?

14
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:41,541
Can you do it?

15
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:44,708
I'm about to go home.

16
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,041
Where'd everybody go?

17
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,916
Department party.

18
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,416
I'm begging you.

19
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,041
It's… really urgent.

20
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:57,375
Tomorrow.

21
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:58,458
That won't work.

22
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,166
My presentation's tomorrow.

23
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:01,708
Please?

24
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,333
I'll give you 5,000.

25
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,000
Wait.

26
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,750
Ten thousand.

27
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,125
Do you always go home this late?

28
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,375
What do you do so late?

29
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,916
Work, obviously.

30
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,666
The view at night

31
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,875
is pretty nice, isn't it?

32
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,166
Is it tricky?

33
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:53,708
Yeah.

34
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,583
In that case, how about a drink?

35
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,500
To get your brain going.

36
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,333
The cameras.

37
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,958
Not a problem.

38
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,166
Easy-peasy. Be right back.

39
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,083
The cameras won't know.

40
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,208
Whose is this?

41
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,000
Mine.

42
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,583
But I haven't used it.

43
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,750
Hear this, everyone did
the lucky draw, okay?

44
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,458
Some got AirPods.

45
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,125
Or iPads.

46
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,666
That's what I got.

47
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,333
And…

48
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,625
Motherfuckers.

49
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,333
Cheers, my friend.

50
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:51,791
Yeah.

51
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:57,125
But don't worry.
If there's liquor, oh man.

52
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,291
I can stay up till dawn.

53
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,291
Don't let me catch you sleeping.

54
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,000
<i>I'll drink you under the table.</i>

55
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,666
I'm Game.

56
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:09,750
What's your name?

57
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:12,625
<i>Win!</i>

58
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,250
Hey, Win! Wake up!

59
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,208
Shit.

60
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,541
Win.

61
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,833
Wake up, Win!

62
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:24,750
Win!

63
00:05:56,916 --> 00:06:00,166
<i>Sorry, the number you've dialed</i>
<i>is not available…</i>

64
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,416
Still can't reach Win?

65
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:26,166
Wait here. The boat's on its way.
I'll come get you.

66
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:27,791
Okay.

67
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,250
Are you Mr. Wut? Please try to calm down.

68
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,333
Mr. Wut?

69
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,125
What the hell are you doing? Help my son.

70
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,041
Sir.

71
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:52,666
Please calm down.

72
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,166
-Let officers do their jobs.
-Who hurt my son?

73
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,916
Calm down and step outside.

74
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,375
Let go of me!

75
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:02,208
Go catch the fucker who hurt my son!
What the fuck did you grab me for?

76
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,333
Hey. Get over here.

77
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,333
Why the hell are you fussing? Go!

78
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,583
You're Game, aren't you?

79
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,666
Yes.

80
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,375
How did my son die?

81
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,708
Tell me. How are you involved in this?

82
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,541
I was abducted.

83
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,916
And my friend got shot.

84
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,708
Who took you?

85
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,291
Councillor Ae.

86
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,083
She shot my friend.

87
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,291
And she took my niece.

88
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,333
You're Ae's father, aren't you?

89
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:15,708
Please.

90
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,041
Let my niece go.

91
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,166
She's not a part of this.

92
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,583
Hey, get him.

93
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,125
Don't let him go.

94
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:32,833
Wait.

95
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,875
You know all the fucked-up shit
your kids did?

96
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,583
If you let my niece go,

97
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,416
I'll tell you.

98
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,833
You're in no position
to negotiate with me.

99
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,916
<i>Did you bring the card Win gave you?</i>

100
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,958
Oh, it's in my wallet.

101
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,416
I left it in the car.

102
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,291
Fuck.

103
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,041
Hey, wait a minute.

104
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:09,750
Here.

105
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,291
Will this work?

106
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,250
Yes.

107
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:24,833
Hello?

108
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,333
Yes.

109
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,041
What?

110
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,541
Is something wrong?

111
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,166
<i>First the monk's assistant died,</i>

112
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,416
<i>then a businesswoman killed her husband,</i>

113
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,125
<i>and now the giant tree's collapsed,</i>
<i>killing more than ten people.</i>

114
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,958
This gold and silver tree,

115
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,916
do you think it's cursed?

116
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,083
A man-made structure cannot move itself.

117
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:38,541
The cause of these events
is nothing but human action.

118
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,833
<i>I'd like to take this opportunity</i>
<i>to remind everyone</i>

119
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,000
<i>that the purpose of making merit</i>

120
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,291
<i>is to reduce and abandon your desires.</i>

121
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,000
NARUETHIP WATER

122
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,375
Milin!

123
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,458
Milin, my baby!

124
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:15,875
Building a hospital to treat
and care for the sick is a good thing.

125
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,416
But in my opinion,

126
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,500
there's no need for an exaggerated statue.

127
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,125
Hey.

128
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,333
Boss let your niece go.

129
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,416
Milin, you're safe now.

130
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,541
<i>One duty of a Buddhist</i>

131
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,958
is to bring benefit to others.

132
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,875
Doing more than what's necessary

133
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,958
isn't real merit.

134
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:01,208
Sadhu.

135
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,291
Who are you here to see?

136
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:03,708
I'm Win's mom.

137
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:05,583
Who was that girl?

138
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:11,875
I came alone.

139
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,333
Leave your phone with me for now.

140
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,166
Why are you taking it?

141
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:18,750
Why?

142
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,333
Please follow the rules.

143
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:28,958
Hello.

144
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,416
I'm Win's friend.

145
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,333
Hi, son.

146
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,625
It's Game, isn't it?

147
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:37,625
Yes.

148
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,000
You don't have to worry.

149
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,375
I'm sure Win will be fine.

150
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,541
Family of Mr. Peerapat Luckngam?

151
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:49,666
That's me.

152
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,041
How is my son?

153
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:55,125
The patient was shot
in a critical area near the spine.

154
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:59,458
We don't have the specialist
or equipment to perform the surgery.

155
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,625
But we will arrange a transfer.

156
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,041
Once we find a hospital to take his case,

157
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,166
we'll let you know.

158
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,541
-Hey, miss.
-Yes?

159
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,291
-You can't park here.
-Sorry.

160
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,916
-Please move your car.
-Yes.

161
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,166
Man, I'm fucking pooped.

162
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,708
I can't believe today's cases.

163
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:57,541
Here, guys.

164
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,291
That's all, isn't it?

165
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,458
That's it.

166
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,750
I haven't slept yet.

167
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,625
A tree collapse.

168
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,500
A warehouse shooting too.

169
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,708
You mean the MP's son?

170
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,083
You know what happened?

171
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,833
A sister shot her brother dead.

172
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,083
So who's the guy in the ICU, then?

173
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,041
I thought he was the brother.

174
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,708
Shit, I don't know.

175
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,375
Peace out.

176
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,666
<i>So</i>

177
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:37,000
I'll ask my family to help find
a good doctor in Bangkok.

178
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,041
Then we can move Win there for treatment.

179
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,500
Thank you so much.

180
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,875
Win is all I have.

181
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:06,625
Game.

182
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,083
Yes?

183
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,583
You were there, weren't you?

184
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:14,166
So… how did Win get shot?

185
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,291
Just tell me.

186
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,000
Dear told me everything.

187
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,166
Dear?

188
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,541
Did you shoot Aun?

189
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,333
No, I didn't.

190
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,333
Don't lie to my face, Ae.

191
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,000
People in the warehouse saw you shoot him.

192
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,916
If you're so sure, why bother asking?

193
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,166
You never believe what I say anyway.

194
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,250
You're a real piece of shit.

195
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:35,041
I raised you
not knowing you'd be this fucked up.

196
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,083
I was raised by a piece of shit.

197
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,583
Didn't you do the same shit to Aun's mom?

198
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,041
Don't think I won't do anything to you.

199
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,000
You've run out of options.

200
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,958
Your favorite child is fucking dead.

201
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,375
Just the two of us now, Dad.

202
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,958
And that kid Win's wallet.

203
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,000
How much is in it?

204
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,000
Why do you ask?

205
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,125
If you want to stay out of jail,

206
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,833
hand me the hospital project.

207
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,000
Is that what you want?

208
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:24,875
Fine.

209
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:27,666
Take it.

210
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,500
If you can handle it.

211
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,125
Think you're a hotshot?

212
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:41,833
I know someone like you doesn't have
the brains to come up with it.

213
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,750
<i>What you did really humiliated me.</i>

214
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,125
Do you even know
how much I've donated to this temple?

215
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:17,000
Have I done something to upset you?

216
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,833
You told the cops to arrest my people.

217
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,791
I can just kill you right now.

218
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,250
Killing me won't do you any good,

219
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,750
don't you think?

220
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:40,333
Is there anything I can do
to make it right with you?

221
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,916
You mean you'd work for me?

222
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,041
I don't think
that's appropriate for a monk.

223
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:51,125
It's easier to make you disappear.

224
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:56,041
When a person commits evil
and hides it with more evil,

225
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,083
the stench only grows stronger.

226
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:02,666
To hide the stench completely,
you must cover it with fragrance.

227
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,250
Isn't that true?

228
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,708
You have done many things.

229
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:16,250
Why don't you do
a nice project to give back to society?

230
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,958
People don't want
to make merit with temples these days.

231
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,416
Too many bad monks.

232
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,625
But if it was a hospital project,

233
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:36,041
I think raising funds
would be much easier.

234
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,250
<i>Hello?</i>

235
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,333
Hello, Grandpa.

236
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,208
<i>What is it, Game?</i>

237
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:19,791
Well…

238
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,833
I need your help with something important.

239
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,083
Don't beat around the bush. Say it.

240
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,166
Well,

241
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,041
I want to borrow some money.

242
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:35,875
It's…

243
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,458
for a friend's treatment.

244
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:42,833
My friend, he needs major surgery,

245
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,958
and it costs a lot.

246
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:48,708
<i>I can give you money,</i>
<i>but on one condition.</i>

247
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:52,958
<i>You have to stop causing trouble</i>
<i>and go study in China.</i>

248
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,250
<i>If you can do it, I'll give you the money.</i>

249
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:02,833
Okay, Grandpa.

250
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,750
Bye.

251
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:36,375
Auntie.

252
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:41,750
Don't be afraid, Auntie.

253
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,000
I'm Sue.

254
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:49,750
You're Win's mother, aren't you?

255
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:52,875
Yes.

256
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:55,166
I'm Win's friend.

257
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:03,416
Mr. Anuwat gave me a scholarship
when I was young.

258
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:06,833
Eighteen years ago,

259
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:09,083
he was shot.

260
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:12,875
He was brought to my grandpa
to be cremated.

261
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:17,791
My grandpa was the undertaker
at Trai Burin Temple.

262
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:21,791
But at that time,

263
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,458
Mr. Anuwat, your husband,

264
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:27,625
was still alive.

265
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,958
Why are you telling me this now?

266
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,083
My grandpa told me never to tell anyone.

267
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,333
But my grandpa passed away.

268
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:47,166
Where is he now?

269
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:48,958
My grandpa and I

270
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,583
took him to hide

271
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,250
at a temple in Sa Kaeo.

272
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:57,666
Can you take me to him?

273
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:00,250
Please.

274
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:06,083
But I was very young, Auntie.

275
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:09,708
I don't remember exactly where it was.

276
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:12,041
Besides,

277
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:16,041
I don't even know if he's still alive.

278
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,666
I should have told Win the truth

279
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,833
before he ended up like this.

280
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:32,750
Who's in there? Why did you lock the door?

281
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:34,666
Just a moment.

282
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:42,958
Why did you lock the door?

283
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:23,500
<i>Dear?</i>

284
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:25,500
<i>How are you?</i>

285
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:32,208
<i>Dear?</i>

286
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,208
IMNOTDEAR: I SAW THE NEWS
WHAT'S GOING ON?

287
00:25:53,291 --> 00:25:55,208
WHERE ARE YOU?
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

288
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:48,791
I'm such a shitty friend, aren't I?

289
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:51,000
For abandoning those two.

290
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:57,750
They have to clear a billion-baht debt
because of me.

291
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:01,000
Win got shot 'cause of me.

292
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:06,750
Stop blaming yourself.

293
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:11,791
I think you did the right thing,

294
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,166
trying to remove yourself
from what was wrong.

295
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:19,291
Because what those two are doing

296
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:21,875
isn't right.

297
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:24,625
But we started it together.

298
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:30,333
That doesn't mean
you have to finish it together.

299
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:33,625
Every happening has a cause.

300
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:37,375
Even if you run away,

301
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:40,708
the cause is already in motion.

302
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:48,000
What would you do?

303
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,416
We are born alone.

304
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,750
We die alone.

305
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:03,541
We are responsible
only for our own actions.

306
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:07,833
Every decision you make belongs to you.

307
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:14,791
And you…

308
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:20,458
have the right to break this cycle.

309
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:48,791
Can it really be over that easily?

310
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:12,458
Dear, only you can free yourself.

311
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:35,625
<i>I'm sure you're all aware</i>

312
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:38,333
<i>of the loss our family has suffered.</i>

313
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:44,625
And yet, there are still rumors spreading

314
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:48,666
that Ae, Aun's older sister,

315
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,958
shot her own brother.

316
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:57,583
We're here today as father and daughter
to share the truth.

317
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:02,250
<i>This all started</i>

318
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:06,666
<i>when I asked my son</i>
<i>to take over as this district's candidate.</i>

319
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,500
<i>Soon after the news broke,</i>

320
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:12,041
<i>my son became a target.</i>

321
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:16,500
<i>I knew politics around here</i>
<i>could be dangerous.</i>

322
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:20,416
<i>But I never imagined it would go this far.</i>

323
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,250
<i>Although we've suffered a huge loss</i>
<i>and just gone through a horrible tragedy…</i>

324
00:30:27,541 --> 00:30:29,208
Do you like this set?

325
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:31,791
It's not too much, is it?

326
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:35,750
Not for an abbot. It's not too much.

327
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:40,041
<i>What about the giant tree collapse</i>
<i>at Nong Khan?</i>

328
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:43,500
<i>I understand your company</i>
<i>was the contractor.</i>

329
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:47,041
That must be a misunderstanding.

330
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:50,416
I'm only listed as a consultant
for the company.

331
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,083
I'm not involved in running the business.

332
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:56,125
What about the hospital's opening?

333
00:30:56,208 --> 00:30:58,916
Is it still on schedule? Or postponed?

334
00:30:59,416 --> 00:31:00,583
As for--

335
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:04,958
Going through this experience
has made it clear to me

336
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:09,625
that caring for patients
and for our public health system

337
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:11,375
is important.

338
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:15,500
<i>Because this project</i>
<i>benefits the community,</i>

339
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,291
I volunteer to help carry it forward.

340
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:21,500
I don't want the project to stall

341
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:23,750
<i>because of this incident.</i>

342
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,541
I'd like to apologize for the fact
that your son was caught in the crossfire.

343
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:38,166
But I understand.

344
00:31:38,666 --> 00:31:39,750
In a case like this,

345
00:31:40,958 --> 00:31:43,375
an apology alone won't help.

346
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:47,833
So I want to take responsibility

347
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,833
by covering all his medical expenses.

348
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:57,708
Thank you so much, sir.

349
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,625
If you can,

350
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:01,666
please help Win.

351
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:03,708
Don't worry.

352
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:05,708
Your son

353
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:08,041
will recover and be his old self again.

354
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:10,625
Do you know

355
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:13,166
how Win got shot?

356
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:19,041
The police are still investigating
at the moment.

357
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:22,083
That's out of my hands.

358
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:25,750
What I can do right now

359
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,625
is use my connections
with the best doctors in Bangkok.

360
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,541
He should be moved there for treatment.

361
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:52,541
If it's all right with you,

362
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:55,458
I'll have my people

363
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,875
take care of it right away.

Oh, bye.

00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:37,208
Mr. Wut.

370
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:41,041
Once you get the money,

371
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:43,000
you'll let us go, won't you?

372
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:55,666
Who the hell does he think he is?

373
00:33:56,416 --> 00:33:58,458
Once this is done, sort them all out.

374
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:50,000
MP SETTAWUT KLAIDUANG

375
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:56,791
PRACHARAK HOSPITAL, CHACHOENGSAO

376
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:25,000
Forceps, please.

377
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,416
Cautery, please.

378
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:30,916
Cut.

379
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,166
Do you have a cigarette?

380
00:36:53,541 --> 00:36:56,166
Are you crazy? We're in a hospital.

381
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:32,625
Greetings.

382
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:37,083
I'm in charge of
the Wat Nong Khan Hospital project now.

383
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:43,541
There's a monk serving as the acting abbot
after the late abbot's passing.

384
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:45,875
But he's not one of us.

385
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,791
Could you recommend someone
to take his place, Father?

386
00:37:51,666 --> 00:37:53,708
And what about the trouble there?

387
00:37:54,958 --> 00:37:56,791
Has it been sorted out?

388
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:59,625
I have my people taking care of it.

389
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:04,041
When is the groundbreaking ceremony?

390
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,083
This Thursday, Father.

391
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:21,416
<i>Does anyone have any objections?</i>

392
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:24,625
If not,

393
00:38:24,708 --> 00:38:29,500
we'll appoint Monk Ekachai
as the abbot of Wat Nong Khan Foundation.

394
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:32,166
Bring that.

395
00:38:32,666 --> 00:38:33,541
Thank you.

396
00:38:36,875 --> 00:38:40,083
In that case,
Monk Ekachai, please sign here.

397
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:41,416
All right?

398
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:47,541
What is it?

399
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:55,708
I'd like to object

400
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:59,541
because Monk Ekachai did something
that calls for defrocking.

401
00:39:01,166 --> 00:39:02,416
How come?

402
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:04,875
Novice.

403
00:39:56,541 --> 00:39:58,916
I don't get it. How could you do that?

404
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:02,125
Wat Nong Khan Foundation
was about to be yours.

405
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:03,625
Don't ask me now.

406
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:05,500
Take care of the clip.

407
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,375
That's gonna be tough.

408
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:08,833
How many people saw it?

409
00:40:08,916 --> 00:40:11,041
How much will it cost to lobby them?

410
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:13,333
Well, just deal with it.

411
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:15,166
What are you here for?

412
00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:11,791
Win.

413
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:13,833
How do you feel, son?

414
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:16,833
Mom.

415
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:21,708
Hold on.

416
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:32,166
Game and Dear.

417
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:34,208
Game's in the next room.

418
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,541
Dear dropped me off and left.

419
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:38,125
I can't reach her.

420
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,958
Don't tell anyone

421
00:41:45,083 --> 00:41:46,791
that I woke up.

422
00:41:51,916 --> 00:41:53,500
-Mom.
-Yes?

423
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:58,416
Dad is dead.

424
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:09,583
Win.

425
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:12,708
Sue told me

426
00:42:13,666 --> 00:42:15,458
your dad might still be alive.

427
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:25,791
He said he took your dad to Sa Kaeo.

428
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,625
But he doesn't remember exactly where.

429
00:42:32,291 --> 00:42:33,791
Excuse me.

430
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:40,291
We're taking his vitals.

431
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:41,416
Sure.

432
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:36,458
How is he, Doctor?

433
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:47,583
His condition has improved. Normal pulse.

434
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:49,833
I see.

435
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:11,250
Yes?

436
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:21,000
Yes?

437
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:25,000
Which room is the patient named
Peerapat Luckngam in?

438
00:44:25,583 --> 00:44:26,958
Just a moment.

439
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:35,250
<i>The nurse said</i>

440
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:39,250
they've moved Win
to a hospital in Bangkok.

441
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:44,833
<i>Do you know</i>

442
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:46,625
which hospital he moved to?

443
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:51,375
I don't know. The system doesn't say.

444
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:09,250
I want my phone.

445
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:13,958
I wanna check my wallet balance
and find Salt.

446
00:45:15,083 --> 00:45:17,166
They took our phones and computers.

447
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:24,333
Win, let's just stop.

448
00:45:24,416 --> 00:45:26,333
Why hold on to the money?

449
00:45:26,416 --> 00:45:28,791
Let's give them the billion
and end this shit.

450
00:45:28,875 --> 00:45:30,750
You and I are still alive

451
00:45:30,833 --> 00:45:32,875
because I have the seed phrase.

452
00:45:33,625 --> 00:45:35,500
If I didn't have the billion,

453
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:37,625
you wouldn't be here.

454
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:45,625
The tree collapsing was your plan?

455
00:45:48,958 --> 00:45:50,500
What's your plan, then?

456
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,791
Track the money trail for the cops.

457
00:45:54,875 --> 00:45:56,208
Put Ae in jail.

458
00:45:59,125 --> 00:46:01,125
How the hell do we know

459
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:03,333
which cops aren't theirs?

460
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,791
The one who got transferred.

461
00:46:08,416 --> 00:46:10,833
Let me tell you, people like them…

462
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,375
They're in jail a few years if at all.

463
00:46:15,458 --> 00:46:17,833
When they're out, they'll come after us.

464
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:20,500
That's why we need enough money to run.

465
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:23,916
When I get back, I'll come to see you.

466
00:46:24,875 --> 00:46:26,791
Don't you get that I'm working?

467
00:46:27,916 --> 00:46:29,791
I can't come back now.

468
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:32,250
My mom said my dad might still be alive.

469
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:35,458
If we're lucky, and my dad is alive,

470
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:38,875
we can take Wut down too.

471
00:46:41,958 --> 00:46:43,083
How's that relevant?

472
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:49,875
Wut ordered my dad to be killed.

473
00:46:53,916 --> 00:46:55,625
So what do we do now?

474
00:47:00,041 --> 00:47:02,000
The most important thing now

475
00:47:03,041 --> 00:47:05,333
is getting evidence to put Ae in jail.

476
00:47:07,208 --> 00:47:09,166
And the only person I trust

477
00:47:10,541 --> 00:47:11,708
is Dear.

478
00:49:01,666 --> 00:49:04,583
