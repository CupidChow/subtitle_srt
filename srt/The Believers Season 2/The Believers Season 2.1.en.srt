THE BELIEVERS 2

2
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:15,250
<i>Win.</i>

3
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:23,416
Win!

4
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:28,958
Win.

5
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:43,541
What did you do?

6
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:47,416
What did I do?

7
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,333
What?

8
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,625
You got arrested.

9
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,166
I did nothing wrong.

10
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,500
I got released.

11
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,666
Stop lying to me.

12
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:00,958
And you dropped out.

13
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:02,708
I know that too.

14
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,750
Shit, suspended?
What's it got to do with you?

15
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:35,750
Don't worry. Someone's helping me.

16
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:46,041
<i>Chiang Dao National Forest</i>
<i>and Pha Daeng National Park</i>

17
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:49,125
<i>have reportedly become</i>
<i>targets of illegal logging.</i>

18
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:54,625
<i>You know, it makes you think,</i>
<i>whenever we hear stories like this…</i>

19
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,625
Say hello to the Council Member.

20
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:01,208
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
Win just woke up.

21
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,916
It's okay. Young people are like that.

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,083
Why are you here?

23
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,583
Oh, Win.

24
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,583
Do you know who she is?

25
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,875
The PCM will help
clear you of the offense.

26
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,625
She thinks you're a victim of a scam.

27
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,000
There are many cases like this.

28
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,333
Win is young
and probably didn't know any better.

29
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:24,458
But don't you worry.
I will personally clear him of it.

30
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:26,708
Thank you so much.

31
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,958
Thank her, son.

32
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,083
You don't have to pressure Win.

33
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,208
He's been through a lot.

34
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,833
He's probably still working
through his feelings.

35
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,916
After this, you and I will be busy
cleaning things up for a while.

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,083
I'm worried your mom will be alone,

37
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,625
so I'll have Ple stay with her.

38
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,416
I'm okay, ma'am.

39
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,416
I'm used to living alone.

40
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,416
You shouldn't let
an old person live alone.

41
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,708
It'd be dangerous if something happened.

42
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,583
All right.

43
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,916
Think of it as me
leaving a helper with you.

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,250
Ple is very handy.

45
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,708
She can help with housework
or drive you wherever you need to go.

46
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,583
Just let her know where you want to go.

47
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:24,833
Are you sure?

48
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,000
It's no trouble at all.

49
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,500
Think of it as my duty.

50
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,083
I have another appointment,
so I have to go.

51
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,166
I'll wait in the car with the cat.

52
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,791
-Pack up and meet us there.
-No, I'll carry him.

53
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,083
Where are you staying?

54
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,250
Where are you going?

55
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,708
What more do you want?
I told you it was a misunderstanding.

56
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:05,500
Before you do anything,
make sure you look out for yourself.

57
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,875
Can you not leave for once?

58
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:26,000
Go pack your clothes.
I'll give you ten minutes.

59
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:29,416
Tell Dear and Game to meet us
at the Wat Nong Khan Foundation.

60
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,875
<i>How about this?</i>

61
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,291
If anything happens,

62
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:51,666
I'll…

63
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,083
I'll call you.

64
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,000
Okay?

65
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:09,750
Thank you.

66
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,833
Hey! Everyone, out!

67
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,083
Where's Dear?

68
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,541
No idea. I can't reach her.

69
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,750
Then I'm not waiting. Let's get into it.

70
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,125
I'm planning to build
Wat Nong Khan Hospital here.

71
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:05,541
A megaproject
filled with the power of great merit,

72
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,416
to care for the poor.

73
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:12,750
I need 500 million baht
to fund this project within six months

74
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,750
to meet the groundbreaking date.

75
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,291
I trust you'll make it happen.

76
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,333
Make it happen?

77
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,583
Make what happen?

78
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,000
Where are you going?

79
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,125
Let's go.

80
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,416
Move it!

81
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,833
<i>She's on the run, Boss.</i>

82
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,916
Ask her which country she's running to.

83
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,625
Where are you running off to? Huh?

84
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,833
She won't talk, Boss.

85
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:07,916
Not many people around.

86
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,000
Dear won't say where she's going.
What should we do?

87
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,291
Let her run.

88
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,958
She's no use to us.

89
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,125
No use?

90
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,541
I'll kill her, then.

91
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:41,375
Let her go.

92
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,000
<i>Let her go for now.</i>

93
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:32,958
Exciting, isn't it?

94
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:37,125
I'm kind, but not that kind.

95
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,500
With Dear absent,
her share falls on you two.

96
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,333
The original target was 500 million.

97
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,833
Now it's 750 million.

98
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,333
Scratch that.

99
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:50,833
Let's make it 999 million baht.

100
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,208
Lucky number.

101
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,000
But the deadline stays the same,
six months.

102
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,208
Are you crazy? Where are we
supposed to find a billion baht?

103
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,750
If it were easy,
why would I get you two to do it?

104
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,041
I know you have the skills.

105
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:13,041
And if we fail,
you'll just kill us, right?

106
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:16,541
Why would I kill you, Game?
You're still of use to me.

107
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:20,500
But your family, I don't know any of them.

108
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,208
So I've sent someone to get to know them.

109
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:27,375
This one is… Milin, right?

110
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,875
How old is she?

111
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,416
And here's Grace.

112
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,000
Her mommy, right?

113
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,875
-Fuck! Leave them out of this!
-That's not very polite.

114
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:42,083
I was going to tell you who I sent,
but I've changed my mind.

115
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:46,916
I'll let you guess.
Your family's helpers always come and go.

116
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,458
Come on, let's get to work.

117
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,791
All done, Father. Does it sound okay?

118
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,458
Can it be louder?

119
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,041
-Sure.
-Wait, do it one more time.

120
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:21,958
Of course.

121
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,375
ABBOT NARES'S RESIDENCE

122
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,291
Hello, Father.

123
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,375
Here are Win and Game.
I've brought them to help us.

124
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:35,083
A project this big, but only two of them?

125
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,958
They're very good.

126
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,666
They look so young.

127
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,500
Today's marketing should be handled
by the young ones.

128
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,291
We can't keep up anymore.

129
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,791
What about the other group
that made a proposal?

130
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,291
Korn was negotiating with them.

131
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,625
We can try something new for once.

132
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,416
If Ae recommends them,

133
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,916
they must be good.

134
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,333
All right, let's do it.

135
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,958
But I need all documents in order.

136
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:09,416
Of course.

137
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,416
Let's try it one more time.

138
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,583
Salt.

139
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,916
How do you like your new workplace?

140
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,958
Better than Phummaram?

141
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,208
Let's check our results in six months.

142
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:05,416
Now, let's make merit to mark
an auspicious start for the project.

143
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,416
It's a huge merit, you know?

144
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,541
Are we done here?

145
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:17,791
It's fine.

146
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:22,166
Let Game go.
He's probably worried about his family.

147
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,166
I'm counting on you, Win.
I hope you won't disappoint me.

148
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,458
Let's make merit.

149
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,166
Sadhu.

150
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,833
DONATE TO HELP BUILD NONG KHAN HOSPITAL

151
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,250
Let's nom-nom.

152
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,458
-Just a moment.
-Nong!

153
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,708
What are you doing?

154
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,458
What did you put in it?

155
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,500
Vitamins.

156
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,958
What vitamins?

157
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,250
What's going on?

158
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,041
Leave us.

159
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:01,416
Yes, sir.

160
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,458
Let's change the nanny.

161
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,083
Why?

162
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,916
She doesn't seem trustworthy.

163
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,791
Nong's been looking after Milin
for a long time.

164
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,541
What's with you?
Why should we get rid of her?

165
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:33,833
NARUETHIP WATER FACTORY

166
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:47,333
Here we go again.
You said there was nothing going on.

167
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,208
INCOMING CALL: YOD

168
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,375
Why here?

169
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,250
Are you scared of ghosts?
It's too damn crowded out front.

170
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:13,125
Have you found out
who Ae's been sending drugs to?

171
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,875
She stopped doing that.

172
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,375
Wait, what?

173
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,000
She has a new project.

174
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,750
What project?

175
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,333
A hospital.

176
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,375
Shit. How fucking smart.

177
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,666
Making merit to wash away her sins?
A hospital? Shit.

178
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:36,958
Easy money laundering.

179
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,041
What did you bring me?

180
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:48,583
What do you want from me?
You gave me so little.

181
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,791
Then help me with this.

182
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,583
MISS KANNIKAR PARANSAKUL

183
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:13,583
TO MR. WATTHANA IAMRATTANAPONG

184
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,375
MR. SOMBAT

185
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,500
Find out who they are.

186
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,041
I'll send you documents.

187
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:27,583
Next time,

188
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:34,083
bring me the financial records
and all the evidence on this damn project.

189
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,166
Got it?

190
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:39,333
<i>Through the power</i>
<i>Of all the monks chanting in unison</i>

191
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:45,375
<i>May you always be safe</i>

192
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:50,000
<i>And be well</i>

193
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,666
-It's so hot.
-Right?

194
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:10,625
Now, Father Kiw has passed away,

195
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:12,833
so you should

196
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,625
succeed him as abbot here.

197
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:20,750
I'm afraid there are others
who are more senior and suitable.

198
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:24,791
Oh, you've been a monk for ten years
and hold a Level Nine Parian.

199
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:26,791
Not suitable? Then who is?

200
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,083
Master.

201
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:30,041
All right.

202
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:33,083
I have to go now. Here's what we'll do.

203
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:37,250
Think about it.
When you're ready, let me know.

204
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,875
I'll request your appointment.

205
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,916
Let's go.

206
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:48,708
May you be blessed.

207
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:50,708
Uh-huh.

208
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:57,875
Brother, please sign your name
where I've marked,

209
00:24:57,958 --> 00:25:00,833
as the abbot's beneficiary.

210
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:02,500
Here you go.

211
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:04,541
Right here.

212
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,500
You're back?

213
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:42,125
Lend your friend a hand.

214
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:45,208
It's a group project.

215
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:12,625
Still want to work for her after all?

216
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,041
Got a better idea?

217
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,041
If we don't do it, we'll die.
So will our families.

218
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:25,708
What do we do, then?
That's a lot of money.

219
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:43,250
<i>This time's different.</i>

220
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:46,833
Last time, we needed money
to pay off our debt ASAP.

221
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:55,333
<i>Just spit it out already.</i>

222
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:57,208
<i>Once we get a billion…</i>

223
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:00,791
<i>what will happen to us?</i>

224
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,333
SCRIPTURE LIBRARY

225
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,583
<i>She won't applaud or hand you a trophy.</i>

226
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:19,125
Thanks, bro.

227
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:22,375
Hey, come on.

228
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:25,625
<i>We know too much</i>
<i>about her plans and transactions.</i>

229
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,750
<i>Once we hit a billion,</i>
<i>next place we'll end up</i>

230
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,500
<i>is inside a temple wall,</i>
<i>in one of those urns.</i>

231
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:08,916
<i>Here's the list of bidders on our temple's</i>
<i>Loy Krathong event this year.</i>

232
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,166
Someone offered
two million less than last time.

233
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:17,916
Ae has been our sponsor for all this time.

234
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:22,083
If we make a switch now,
it'll make her lose face.

235
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:26,458
But you know how much money
Ae's been skimming off the top.

236
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:29,458
Why do we need to walk on eggshells?

237
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:32,666
<i>But if we don't do it,</i>

238
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,125
everyone dies.

239
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:47,416
Why'd you bring that?

240
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,791
I have to be more careful.
The stakes are way too high.

241
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:54,791
If we do too many projects at once,

242
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:57,291
we can't control the cash flow.

243
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:59,291
It could hit a billion too soon.

244
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:06,916
The temple and the community
rely on each other.

245
00:29:07,958 --> 00:29:11,541
We should compromise when we can.

246
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,708
Do we have to compromise
with those two new kids?

247
00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:19,500
Don't you feel that they seem…
untrustworthy?

248
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:23,166
<i>You know, when they were</i>
<i>at Phummaram Temple,</i>

249
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,041
<i>there was news of meth busts.</i>

250
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:27,833
<i>And Father Kiw passed away soon after.</i>

251
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:32,125
We need to find a project.
Just one project.

252
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:36,208
One that looks like it'll raise a billion.
Only one project.

253
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:40,583
So we can control the money better.

254
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:42,833
I'll have time to focus

255
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:44,875
on finding us a way out.

256
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:51,666
You've thought of it, huh?

257
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:00,333
Shit.

258
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:12,666
<i>Don't you wonder why two kids</i>
<i>who should be looking for good jobs</i>

259
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,708
are hanging around temples?

260
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:17,500
-I don't think it's right.
-Oh?

261
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:22,541
Are you saying people who work
at the temple aren't good or normal?

262
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:28,000
That's not what I meant.

263
00:30:28,708 --> 00:30:32,625
But I can sense
that something's definitely fishy.

264
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:38,166
Maybe that's just prejudice.

265
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:44,625
The hospital they want to build
could really help the locals.

266
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:50,333
Those guys might genuinely
want to do something for society.

267
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:54,125
<i>Why don't we give them a chance?</i>

268
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:56,833
Don't be too quick to judge.

269
00:31:07,958 --> 00:31:11,000
All right. See you soon.

270
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,333
IMNOTDEAR: HEY, I NEED MONEY

271
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:53,416
CAN YOU SEND ME MY SHARE?

272
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,708
SAY SOMETHING SO I KNOW YOU'RE OKAY

273
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:49,583
<i>I'd been a monk since childhood.</i>

274
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:53,958
<i>I thought I knew things.</i>

275
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,666
But after going out into the real world,

276
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:01,833
I now realize…

277
00:36:04,583 --> 00:36:06,083
I don't know anything.

278
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:14,500
Dharma isn't only practiced
within the temple grounds.

279
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:16,916
MRS. KONG CHAROENTIN

280
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,625
<i>It is the outside world</i>
<i>where the true test lies.</i>

281
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:41,000
For this year's Kathin ceremony
at the Wat Nong Khan Foundation.

282
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:44,583
let's come together to make merit

283
00:36:44,666 --> 00:36:47,208
by offering donations.

284

289
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:05,833
How about
"Pra Peung Luang, Secret Edition"?

290
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:08,416
What <i>Peung</i>? Wrong temple.

291
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:13,250
Then let's make one for this temple
and create a new brand.

292
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,333
<i>I invite all of you…</i>

293
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:17,916
To make a billion,
you have to sell a million of those.

294
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:20,208
-Can you do it?
-You fuck.

295
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:22,833
So? Have you come up with anything?

296
00:37:22,916 --> 00:37:24,500
All you do is criticize.

297
00:37:24,583 --> 00:37:26,958
<i>…flowers, incense, candles.</i>
<i>What day were you born?</i>

298
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:29,208
<i>Friday? Good luck to you.</i>

299
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:33,583
You do know I'm in this mess
because of you, right?

300
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,750
It's my fucking fault?
Didn't you drag Ae into this?

301
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:42,583
-To keep you out of jail!
-I didn't need your help.

302
00:37:42,666 --> 00:37:47,083
I told you the police couldn't touch us.
But you signed that damn document.

303
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:49,500
Now my mom's in danger because of you.

304
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:56,041
What about my family?
They're in deep shit because of you!

305
00:37:56,125 --> 00:37:59,666
You think you're so smart?
Our lives are ruined, you bastard!

306
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,541
You wanted to keep going.

307
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:04,041
Now I'm fucked too. You fucking know why?

308
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:06,041
<i>…together, all right?</i>

309
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:08,833
Because you're dumb.

310
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:12,375
<i>-I invite you to present the offerings…</i>
-Huh?

311
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,833
Dumb, am I?

312
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:16,583
Hey!

313
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:19,666
You bastard! Motherfucker!

314
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:20,625
Asshole.

315

<i>Nothing is greater</i>

00:38:23,541 --> 00:38:24,541
Come on, fucker!

317
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:27,250
<i>It's definitely great…</i>

318
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:28,208
You bastard!

319
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:29,250
Bastard!

320
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:30,791

00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:34,166
<i>To all who came to make merit</i>

You bastard!

323
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,375
Please be mindful and stay calm…

324
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:38,916
You asshole! Let go!

325
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,333
<i>Be mindful of your actions…</i>

326
00:38:41,416 --> 00:38:43,583
-Shit, my hair!
<i>-We're all adults.</i>

327
00:38:43,666 --> 00:38:46,958
<i>Kids behave like kids.</i>
<i>Adults behave like adults.</i>

00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:50,708
Speak calmly. Never use violence.

329
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:51,625
Bastard!

00:38:51,708 --> 00:38:57,500
<i>…think about where you are</i>

"Let's do a mega project," my ass.

337
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:47,041
What the fuck do you plan to do?
A giant incense stick?

338
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:51,416
World's largest Pho tree?
A hundred-headed naga?

339

Or a thousand-penis amulet?

340
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:58,125
Make a towering penis shaft,
with hundreds of penises sprouting out.

341
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,708
Hey, I like that idea.

342

A thousand-penis amulet?

The tree, asshole.

344
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,458
The world's largest Pho tree.

The tree of Dharma that brings together
the merit of all faithful Buddhists.

346

Shit's gonna be a huge hit.
Fucking genius!
