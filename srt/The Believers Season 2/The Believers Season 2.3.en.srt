00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:49,500
Take care of it.

00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,333
LOCAL NEWS REPORT

4
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:28,833
<i>This is the bustling atmosphere</i>
<i>at Wat Nong Khan Foundation,</i>

5
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:32,458
<i>where 91 villagers</i>
<i>from Si Racha have gathered.</i>

6
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:35,875
<i>They've all won</i>
<i>the two-digit prize with the number 91</i>

7
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:38,875
<i>by purchasing silver and gold</i>
<i>Pho leaves for merit-making.</i>

8
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:43,083
<i>Over there is a Likay troupe</i>
<i>that the villagers have paid for</i>

9
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,083
<i>to perform for three nights</i>

10
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:48,125
<i>as an offering of gratitude</i>
<i>after their lotto win.</i>

11
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,500
<i>We chartered a bus from Chonburi.</i>

12
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:53,666
<i>-There were 93 of us.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

13
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,958
<i>But two people went to the restroom,</i>
<i>so they weren't counted.</i>

14
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:59,291
<i>-We ended up with 91 people.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

15
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,458
<i>So we bought that number and won.</i>

16
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:02,958
<i>Wow!</i>

17
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,208
<i>But unbelievably, amid the joy,</i>

18
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,958
<i>tragedy also struck</i>
<i>at the Wat Nong Khan Foundation.</i>

19
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:12,500
<i>At around 3:00 p.m. today,</i>

20
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,583
<i>Mr. Korn Silpsomwang,</i>
<i>a monk's assistant at the temple,</i>

21
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:19,208
<i>was killed in a collision involving</i>
<i>his motorcycle and a pickup truck.</i>

22
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:23,541
<i>The police are now looking</i>
<i>for the truck driver who fled the scene.</i>

23
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,375
<i>And most importantly,</i>
<i>here's the shocking part,</i>

24
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:35,250
<i>Mr. Korn's motorcycle license plate</i>
<i>also ends with 91.</i>

25
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:39,958
<i>Our condolences go</i>
<i>to the family of the deceased.</i>

26
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,708
Namaskar.

27
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,583
Have they found the driver?

28
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,125
Not yet.

29
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,625
The truck used fake license plates.

30
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:25,583
MR. KORN SILPSOMWANG

31
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,541
For your school fees.

32
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,166
Thank you.

33
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,666
-I'm sorry for your loss.
-Thank you.

34
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,916
The police caught the suspect

35
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,458
but concluded it was joint negligence.

36
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,333
So the driver was released
on a suspended sentence.

37
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,375
That's impossible.

38
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:26,875
A witness saw the truck
driving in the wrong lane.

39
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:31,541
We have to let the police
handle the investigation.

40
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,416
So,

41
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,625
what about Korn's daughter, Toey?

42
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,750
Who will look after her?

43
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,125
My mother will probably
take her back to Nong Khai.

44
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:50,250
An elderly woman and a little girl.

45
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,958
Can they manage alone?

46
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,750
I have no idea what to do.

47
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,708
Everything happened so suddenly.

48
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:08,166
I think you should leave
to look after your mother and niece.

49
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,333
Being a good layperson

50
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,833
and supporting your parents and family

51
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,625
is also considered a good deed.

52
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,250
What do you think?

53
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,416
Life is so uncertain, isn't it?

54
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,833
But what can we do?

55
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,375
Life must go on.

56
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,958
I believe in karma.

57
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,958
Good deeds will be rewarded.

58
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,750
Just like how evil deeds will be punished.

59
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,041
We lost a monk's assistant.

60
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:20,333
Win should take over for the time being,

61
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,000
since Game has a record.

62
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,750
Move all your things tomorrow, guys.

63
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,500
THE 91 COINCIDENCE

64
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,958
MONK'S ASSISTANT DIES IN HIT-AND-RUN,
LICENSE PLATE MATCHES WINNING LOTTO

65
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,208
Here's some water.

66
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You read it.

67
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,625
-My eyesight is bad. How much?
-37,000.

68
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:07,625
-Well? Was it worth all those rounds?
-You did it too.

69
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:08,916
Pay up.

70
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,333
Here, Dol.

71
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:21,166
I can only give you this much now.

72
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,583
My mom's in the hospital, so…

73
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,041
When can you pay me back?

74
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:28,916
The thing is,

75
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:33,041
I have to pay back
the person I borrowed from.

76
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,208
Okay, next time we'll…

77
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,458
Yes, ma'am? Oh, okay!

78
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,166
-Let's go! She's calling us.
-See you!

79
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:12,916
What?

80
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:17,458
-You gotta do it under a big tree outside.
-I know!

81
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,583
Enough with the lecturing.

82
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:31,041
Fuck.

83
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,541
Nice view. How many people
can this pavilion hold?

84
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:47,333
About 20 to 30 people,
depending on how you plan to use it.

85
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,791
It's for a retreat.

86
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:52,625
That should work. People use it
for retreats from time to time.

87
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,583
What kind of retreat is it?

88
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:59,125
Well… a mix of a few things.

89
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,166
I see.

90
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,916
Our rules are no illegal drugs,

91
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,083
no gathering for malicious purposes,
no noise after 10:00 p.m.

92
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,375
We'll provide housekeepers.

93
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:12,083
If you need anything else, let us know.

94
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,291
<i>I'd like to disrobe.</i>

95
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,166
Everyone,

96
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,041
please consider me a layperson.

97
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,375
Are you sure, Father?

98
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,875
Is this how you want things to be?

99
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,458
Things that are too black or too white

100
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,541
don't mix well.

101
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,208
As long as someone still benefits,

102
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,375
I believe I must remain here.

103
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,625
PHRA KHRU NARES WORAKAWINTO
ABBOT OF WAT NONG KHAN FOUNDATION

104
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,250
That's it for today.

105
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,958
MUEANG PHANOM POLICE STATION
JURISDICTION MAP

106
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:21,958
Yod.

107
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,000
Stay.

108
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,875
Should I stay too?

109
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,083
What is it?

110
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,333
They're transferring you to Mae Hong Son.

111
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:52,875
I knew it.

112
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:57,083
What do you want me to do? It's an order.

113
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,208
Yai.

114
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,000
When will you stop serving those dicks?

115
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,208
Watch your damn mouth.

116
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,500
I'm trying to save your life.

117
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:12,541
Yeah?

118
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,583
You think you'll get away?

119
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,875
You'll end up like me one day.

120
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,833
Or even more fucked than I am.

121
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:24,833
Fuck.

122
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:28,750
Cool it, bro.

123
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,125
You got me transferred?

124
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,458
They found out.

125
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,125
<i>You bastard. I gave you a chance.</i>

126
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:58,250
You're fucking done.
You better pray I don't come back.

127
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:14,166
<i>Our temple is still</i>
<i>in great need of financial support.</i>

128
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:20,208
<i>We humbly ask for your generosity.</i>

129
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:23,833
<i>Please help us in our time of need.</i>

130
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:28,666
<i>Our temple is still under construction…</i>

131
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,166
-Hey, Game.
-What?

132
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:37,250
I know why
Ae wants to build a hospital here.

133
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:45,166
She donated drug money, then used
her company to build stuff for the temple.

134
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,875
Huge profit in just the first step.

135
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,875
<i>Chamaiporn Klaiduang</i>
<i>from the Dharma Pattana Party.</i>

136
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,541
<i>Remember to vote for her</i>
<i>in the upcoming by-election.</i>

137
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,833
Hello, Grandpa.

138
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,041
I'm building Wat Nong Khan Hospital.

139
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:08,666
<i>She set up the foundation, and now</i>
<i>all the temple donations go through it.</i>

140
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,625
<i>The money's then sent to schools</i>
<i>and other organizations.</i>

141
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,583
<i>They can fake the donation numbers,</i>
<i>and nobody would know.</i>

142
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,583
That's a shitload of money.

143
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,375
Enough to make her filthy rich.

144
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:23,125
-A new hospital. Please take a look.
-Sure.

145
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,583
May you be prosperous. Where's your dad?

146
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,166
Busy with work.

147
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,416
I'm building a new hospital,
Wat Nong Khan Hospital.

148
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,916
Next time you're sick,
you'll have a hospital nearby.

149
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,708
No need to go downtown. Nice, right?

150
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,625
Yes.

151
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,333
Goodbye.

152
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,583
-Delete the part about my dad.
-Got it.

153
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,625
People used to pay so little
to rent land around here.

154
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,500
OCCUPIED PLOTS OF LAND

155
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,666
Ae is chairperson of the foundation.

156
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:54,875
So she can rent the land out to businesses

157
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,833
and collect more rent.

158
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,291
That's probably billions yearly.

159
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:03,958
So the abbot must be in on it.

160
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,708
TENANT PAID AN ADDITIONAL 50,000 BAHT…

161
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,708
WATTHANA, NATTASIT, CHAMAIPORN, KORN

162
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:12,958
Even we know.

163
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,916
VERIFIED BY:
ABBOT PHRA KHRU NARES WORAKAWINTO

164
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,750
How could he not?

165
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:25,250
Get the abbot to sign the disbursement
papers for the new Pho leaves.

166
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,458
Why me?

167
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,500
It's my day off.

168
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:33,541
What?

169
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:40,666
DHARMA PATTANA PARTY

170
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,166
Can you hold your hand up?

171
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,000
One, two, three.

172
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,833
-This one's nice.
-Got any of me smiling more?

173
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,250
Should we make small-sized prints
of this one to hand out?

174
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,791
Do as you see fit.

175
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,708
Anything else on my schedule?

176
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,416
Today, you have to go to…
a boxing stadium.

177
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,250
-What time?
-At 8:00 p.m.

178
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,583
Okay. There's still time.

179
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,250
-This one too.
-Okay.

180
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,416
Ms. Ae, someone's calling.

181
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:17,791
Excuse me.

182
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:25,583
Hello?

183
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,375
What do we do?

184
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,625
All of you were here.
Did none of you try to stop him?

185
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,000
Should I call an ambulance?

186
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,583
Are you fucking stupid?

187
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,041
I'm sorry, boss.

188
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,791
Call Dr. Chamrat.

189
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,250
Yes.

190
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,166
Hi, Ae.

191
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,250
Hello.

192
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,333
Venerable Brother, this is Pond.

193
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:47,333
He'll help oversee your brand image
as your manager.

194
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,041
Namaskar.

195
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,375
Blessings to you.

196
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,958
Ae gave me homework.

197
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,500
To start, I drafted a strategy.

198
00:17:56,583 --> 00:18:00,500
I think for a monk to become
nationally famous overnight,

199
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:04,500
we need to create a brand that's clear,
strong, and focused on one point.

200
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:09,166
<i>The wait is over</i>
<i>for the Lightweight World Championship!</i>

201
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,583
<i>In the blue corner,</i>
<i>Emerald Bullet C. Wattana Gym.</i>

202
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,041
The fastest way to become a phenomenon

203
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:19,791
<i>is to use an idol</i>
<i>that everyone in the country knows.</i>

204
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,291
Sadhu.

205
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,208
To leave a lasting impression,

206
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,625
<i>you need to create your signature.</i>

207
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:37,750
Fight!

208
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,375
<i>And let everyone see</i>

209
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,833
what your remarkable virtues
are capable of.

210
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,958
<i>And then,</i>

211
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,666
<i>you just wait</i>

212
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,791
<i>and see.</i>

213
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,500
<i>The idol everyone has faith in</i>
<i>will do the job.</i>

214
00:18:55,583 --> 00:19:00,541
<i>Then comes the "wow" moment</i>
<i>when your spiritual powers are proven.</i>

215
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,333
<i>And finally,</i>

216
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,541
<i>the idol's victory</i>

217
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,166
will also be your victory.

218
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,750
<i>The winner is Emerald Bullet!</i>

219
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,958
May I interview you, Venerable Brother?

220
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,083
Venerable Brother, may I interview you?

221
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,916
May I interview you, Venerable Brother?

222
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:44,791
Venerable Brother!

223
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:49,125
Do you think the win by knockout was
because of your virtues or his skills?

224
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:59,958
I'd like you to think of a sailboat
in the middle of the sea.

225
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:05,916
For a boat to sail in any direction,
it partly depends on the wind.

226
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,041
But the other part,

227
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,500
we can control
by setting the sail ourselves.

228
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,958
<i>Luck is like the wind.</i>

229
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:19,333
<i>But a person's life</i>
<i>cannot rely on luck alone.</i>

230
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,250
<i>We must also put in effort.</i>

231
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,708
<i>We have the power to steer the boat,</i>

232
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,416
<i>to turn it left or right.</i>

233
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:30,750
<i>You could say</i>
<i>life is a combination of both.</i>

234
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,458
<i>Some might think</i>
<i>it's all about encouragement and morale.</i>

235
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,583
<i>Others may believe</i>
<i>it's the monk's sacred power.</i>

236
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,583
WAT NONG KHAN TEMPLE FOUNDATION

237
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,708
You know, don't you?

238
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,875
Father Kiw died because of Ekachai.

239
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:04,708
Well…

240
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,208
When I went to see Father Kiw
to talk about Tang,

241
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:14,000
Father Kiw pointed
to a picture of a child.

242
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:18,375
And I think
that child is probably Ekachai.

243
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,750
What about Tang? Was that Ekachai too?

244
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,041
DHARMA GUIDES LIFE, FREES THE MIND

-Use this photo.
-Okay.

248
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,625
Blur out the background.

249
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:30,375
<i>Sorry, the number you have dialed</i>
<i>is not available at this time.</i>

250
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:37,041
<i>Sorry, the number you have dialed</i>
<i>is not available at this time.</i>

251
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,541
Is this your daughter?

252
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:15,000
Yes, it's her.

253
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,416
She studied business in the US.

254
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,416
She's working there now.

255
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:26,458
Come by my quarters tomorrow
to pick it up.

256
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,625
Father, can't you just sign it now?

257
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,791
I need to go through it first.

258
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:40,125
Sure.

259
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:57,791
-Excuse me.
-Yeah?

260
00:23:58,333 --> 00:23:59,750
Can I have a cigarette?

261
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:03,416
How do you know I have one?

262
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,958
That's my last one.

263
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,875
And the lighter too?

264
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,833
Sure. Here you go.

265
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:41,291
I've been fucking dying for one.
Haven't smoked in three days.

266
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:45,875
So are you dressed like that

267
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:47,916
to practice Dharma?

268
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,833
Yeah.

269
00:24:57,416 --> 00:25:01,291
I dreamed of a huge tree
three nights in a row.

270
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:05,041
When I saw the tree on the news,

271
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:06,666
it was just like my dream.

272
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:10,625
I drove from Chonburi right away.

273
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:14,375
And got here.

274
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,708
Can you believe it?

275
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:19,666
I hadn't even made it home

276
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,791
when someone paid me back
ten million right away.

277
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:25,750
My business was in a slump,

278
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,416
and it fucking got back on track.

279
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:32,000
What business do you do?

280
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:37,208
Here.

281
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:40,416
For the cigarette.

282
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,583
I already used some.
I don't know if you mind.

283
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,541
Actually,

284
00:25:50,666 --> 00:25:53,500
I came here to fulfill a vow.

285
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,375
I didn't know practicing Dharma
would be this hard.

286
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:01,791
I should've vowed to run naked instead.

287
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:20,750
Hello.

288
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,458
Yes.

289
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,333
<i>I got them. Beauty Beauty Cosmetics.</i>

290
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:38,000
<i>This new lip balm's a total hit</i>
<i>and super hot right now.</i>

291
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:41,000
<i>I got three</i>
<i>because I was afraid they'd sell out.</i>

292
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:45,708
<i>I missed out on it last time.</i>
<i>But this new peach scent, it's like…</i>

293
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:48,666
<i>Let's see just how soft</i>
<i>and fragrant it is.</i>

294
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:53,375
<i>The packaging is nice,</i>
<i>easy to open, and cute.</i>

295
00:26:56,208 --> 00:27:00,708
<i>This new peach scent is perfect.</i>
<i>It's super cute.</i>

296
00:27:00,791 --> 00:27:05,583
<i>Everyone, look at this, the juiciness,</i>
<i>the glow, the shine. It's just…</i>

297
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:11,041
<i>Isn't it great?</i>
<i>Here, I'll swatch it on my lips.</i>

298
00:27:11,541 --> 00:27:14,958
<i>It's easy to use</i>
<i>and doesn't smudge on your hand.</i>

299
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:17,958
Hi.

300
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:19,291
This way, please.

301
00:28:25,916 --> 00:28:27,666
Thank you for coming.

302
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:30,916
We're just meditating, right?

303
00:28:31,416 --> 00:28:35,375
Yes. You can get changed first,
and we'll go over the details.

304
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,708
Meditation

305
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:51,958
is not peace.

306
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:56,791
But meditation is stability.

307
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:01,250
We practice the mind

308
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:05,083
by noticing where it wanders.

309
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:08,791
When the mind wanders, notice it.

310
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:12,875
When the mind wanders to the bottle,
notice it.

311
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:15,708
When you notice it,

312
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:17,666
the movement stops.

313
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:20,625
The mind will become stable again.

314
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:26,708
Use your breath as an anchor.

315
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:29,125
Breathe in.

316
00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:31,208
Be aware.

317
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:36,750
Breathe out.

318
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:39,000
Be aware.

319
00:29:40,666 --> 00:29:42,541
<i>When the mind wanders,</i>

320
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:45,791
<i>and we notice it immediately,</i>

321
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:50,083
<i>awareness will arise.</i>

322
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:20,333
Thank you.

323
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:24,708
And tomorrow,

324
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,875
what do you want me to do?

325
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,791
Another sitting session?

326
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:36,625
Is there anything else?

327
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:39,750
Like, a different style of meditation?

328
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:42,750
I'm not sure.

329
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:46,000
But

330
00:30:47,416 --> 00:30:50,166
maybe we could try walking meditation.

331
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:53,500
Okay, let's do that.

332
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:55,791
I'll prepare the area and…

333
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:58,458
Outdoors is probably better, isn't it?

334
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:05,875
Dol.

335
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,208
When did you disrobe?

336
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,000
A while ago.

337
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:20,458
What about you, Dear?

338
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:24,041
Did you move here?

339
00:31:26,958 --> 00:31:28,916
Well, something like that.

340
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:32,125
I want to try running my own business.

341
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:42,750
What time am I leaving on Wednesday?
I have work in the morning.

342
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:46,333
Oh, I booked you the earliest flight.

343
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:50,833
Here's your key.

344
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:05,208
See you in the morning.

345
00:32:53,291 --> 00:32:57,291
You have a scheduled service
this Friday at 10:00 a.m.

346
00:32:57,791 --> 00:32:58,708
Look,

347
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:03,083
we only need the top-tier people
in the country, the VVIPs.

348
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:05,083
This is a waste of time.

349
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:07,458
All right.

350
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:11,166
Well, I'll look more into it.

351
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:13,750
But it'll take a while.

352
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:18,458
Getting access to A-listers
is not that easy.

353
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:21,750
Remember this.

354
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,791
We don't need a million people
donating 100 baht each.

355
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,916
We only need ten people
to donate ten million.

356
00:33:32,916 --> 00:33:39,250
ABBOT NARES'S RESIDENCE

357
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:03,916
-Hello.
-Hello.

358
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:10,833
I really appreciate you coming to help.

359
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:12,833
Thanks.

360
00:34:15,708 --> 00:34:19,750
Thank you. Thank you so much.

361
00:34:22,916 --> 00:34:24,125
There you are.

362
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:27,375
Come on, give me an update.
How are things going?

363
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:42,583
You can talk. They're all our people.

364
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,541
Here, see for yourself.

365
00:34:53,416 --> 00:34:54,708
Looks okay.

366
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:57,750
But the growth is still a bit slow.

367
00:34:58,541 --> 00:35:00,458
-Right.
-I'm not blaming you.

368
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:02,166
I'm here to help.

369
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,541
I have a plan to get us
to one billion baht faster.

370
00:35:07,666 --> 00:35:10,291
I asked Pond to contact
ten boys' love series actors

371
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:12,250
to ordain here during the New Year break.

372
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:15,291
Monk Ekachai will be the ordaining monk.

373
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:17,000
It'll make good content.

374
00:35:22,666 --> 00:35:26,208
Game, you don't look well.
Is something on your mind?

375
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:31,083
If you're stressed or unhappy,
you can ordain with those kids.

376
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:32,833
It can remove bad luck.

377
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:38,791
Advertise this on his page.

378
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:42,625
His followers might be interested
in joining the New Year event.

379
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:45,166
It can help boost donations.

380
00:35:45,666 --> 00:35:46,500
Sure, Ae.

381
00:35:47,458 --> 00:35:48,958
I have to thank you guys.

382
00:35:49,541 --> 00:35:51,750
I got this idea from you two

383
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,166
when you put it all together
with Monk Dol.

384
00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:35,541
Oh, Ple.

385
00:36:36,041 --> 00:36:37,541
What should we eat for lunch?

386
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:42,583
You've had <i>nam prik </i>and boiled vegetables
for the past few days.

387
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:44,666
Anything you want?

388
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:48,041
-Want to go to the market?
-Yeah.

389
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:51,250
Good idea.
We can buy something to cook for dinner.

390
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,583
I'll drive.

391
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,750
Oh, Win?

392
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:04,041
How did you get here?

393
00:37:10,666 --> 00:37:12,291
I'm hungry. Got any food?

394
00:37:12,791 --> 00:37:15,333
You just got here,
and you're hungry already?

395
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:17,250
I didn't cook.

396
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:19,916
Let's go out, then.

397
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:22,500
I'll drive you guys.

398
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,416
Let me pack up.

399
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:29,375
It's fine. Let's just eat at home.

400
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:31,166
-Yeah.
-Oh.

401
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,500
I'll see what's in the fridge.

402
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,000
Ple, can you hang the rest of the laundry?

403
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:38,291
Sure, Auntie.

404
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:41,250
Hey, what about minced pork omelette?

405
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:47,458
Mom.

406
00:37:47,541 --> 00:37:48,375
What?

407
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:56,083
Is she with you all the time?

408
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:58,041
Yeah.

409
00:37:58,125 --> 00:37:59,791
Never out of sight.

410
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:04,041
I usually go to the market alone,
but she insists on driving me.

411
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:07,208
Like I'm an old lady
who can't take care of herself.

412
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:10,250
Where does she sleep?

413
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:12,625
I let her sleep in your room.

414
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:15,291
But if you're staying tonight,
sleep in my room.

415
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:17,291
I'm not staying.

416
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:20,833
What meal is this?

417
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:23,333
Breakfast.

418
00:38:23,833 --> 00:38:24,666
See?

419
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,625
You're going to get a stomach ulcer.

420
00:38:28,125 --> 00:38:29,416
Oh, are you done?

421
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:32,291
I'm out of clothespins.

422
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:35,083
-Could you find some more for me?
-Oh, sure.

423
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,583
Let me show you something.

424
00:39:06,916 --> 00:39:07,875
In here,

425
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:10,333
I have everything.

426
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:13,375
I can take care of her.

427
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,291
Or kill her.

428
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:18,750
It's your choice,

429
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,125
Win.

430
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:26,666
Ple.

431
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:30,000
-Here you go.
-Yes, Auntie.

432
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,500
TRAI BURIN TEMPLE ORDINATION HALL

433
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:21,750
ORDINATION HALL DONORS
1. MP SETTAWUT KLAIDUANG: 50,000,000 BAHT

434
00:40:29,916 --> 00:40:34,750
KANNIKAR PARANSAKUL
AUGUST 26, 1966 - NOVEMBER 11, 2005

435
00:40:48,916 --> 00:40:50,166
What are you doing?

436
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,500
DHARMA PATTANA PARTY

437
00:40:57,333 --> 00:41:00,208
This area's full.
If you want a spot, go over there.

438
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:04,000
Where's the undertaker?

439
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:05,958
I'm the undertaker.

440
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:10,333
I thought undertakers were old.

441
00:41:10,416 --> 00:41:13,250
Oh, my grandfather died last year,

442
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:14,833
so I had to take over.

443
00:41:21,791 --> 00:41:22,875
You keep staring.

444
00:41:24,291 --> 00:41:25,291
Want some?

445
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,250
You're here on your own?

446
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:30,666
Yeah.

447
00:41:36,583 --> 00:41:40,583
It's lonely being an undertaker.
Not many people want to talk to me.

448
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:43,291
Yeah. Try this.

449
00:41:44,833 --> 00:41:49,291
This temple is fucking strange.
It's huge, but not many people come.

450
00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:54,916
The abbot doesn't care
about these petty things.

451
00:41:55,416 --> 00:41:58,208
He has powerful, high-ranking sponsors.

452
00:41:58,291 --> 00:42:00,791
Some of their Kathin
and Pha Pa donations are huge.

453
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:05,166
Are you a vote-broker?

454
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:09,791
What vote-broker?

455
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:13,666
People like me are only in it
for free T-shirts.

456
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:16,333
So he owns the whole district?

457
00:42:17,291 --> 00:42:18,375
Yeah.

458
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:22,458
But his son's a complete screwup.

459
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,541
He's done so many drugs,
his brain's fried.

460
00:42:28,708 --> 00:42:30,291
Karma for rich people.

461
00:42:31,291 --> 00:42:32,458
Their kids are fuckups.

462
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:38,916
But he's a good man.

463
00:42:39,916 --> 00:42:41,416
A devoted Buddhist.

464
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:46,666
He's done a lot to develop this place.

465
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:49,666
Pulled strings
to get the temple road built.

466
00:42:50,541 --> 00:42:52,041
That crematorium's his.

467
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:54,583
That wall too.

468
00:42:58,291 --> 00:43:01,125
The people inside the wall,
are they his too?

469
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:21,500
I wouldn't know.

470
00:43:32,708 --> 00:43:33,791
Bathroom's inside.

471
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:35,083
Outside is fine.

472
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:35,375
DONATED TO TRAI BURIN TEMPLE
BY MR. SOMBAT KLAIDUANG AND FAMILY

473
00:44:35,458 --> 00:44:38,625
DEDICATED TO THEIR KARMIC CREDITORS

474
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:49,375
Thank you.

475
00:45:27,666 --> 00:45:29,708
This is for your time.

476
00:45:32,416 --> 00:45:35,708
You take some of it
as payment for my debt.

477
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:37,583
I already did.

478
00:45:37,666 --> 00:45:39,291
There's 50,000 left over.

479
00:45:40,208 --> 00:45:42,125
That much?

480
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:45,541
Please take it.
If it weren't for you, Monk…

481
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:51,833
If it weren't for you, I'd be in trouble.

482
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,166
It's okay.

483
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:57,500
I don't usually charge
for teachings anyway.

484
00:47:30,083 --> 00:47:31,125
Hello?

485
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:32,833
Oh.

486
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:34,708
Yes. Sure.
