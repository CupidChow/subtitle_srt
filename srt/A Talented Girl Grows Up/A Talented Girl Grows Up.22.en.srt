00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,990
It means I should go.

4
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,990
If I stay,

5
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,910
I'm afraid I'll die here.

6
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,140
Honey.

7
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,810
This prophecy has an ominous meaning.

8
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,760
You've been looking for the ancient painting.

9
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,560
Tell me.

10
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,810
Are you hiding something from me?

11
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,150
Does the ancient painting

12
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,150
has something to do

13
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,840
with the Star Chart?

14
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,009
Will it affect you?

15
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,150
I'm not hiding only one thing from you.

16
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,910
To be honest,

17
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,670
I am

18
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,630
actually a fairy in heaven.

19
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,830
When time comes,

20
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,509
I'll go back to heaven.

21
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,960
And you

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,640
will become a statue waiting for your beloved...

23
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,420
Honey, what time is it now?

24
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,130
Are you still joking with me?

25
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,420
You know it's a joke?

26
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,440
Don't worry.

27
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,540
The celestial phenomena

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,930
is superstitious in my hometown.

29
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,190
It's untrustworthy.

30
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,470
But

31
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,470
I do have a secret

32
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,730
that I want to tell you.

33
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,430
It's the secret about my hometown

34
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,360
that you've always wanted to know.

35
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,070
But before that,

36
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,329
I have one condition.

37
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,350
What is it?

38
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,770
There's still a month before the Star Day.

39

In other words,

40
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,540
I must find the ancient painting

and return to the original world.

43
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,300
Otherwise, I'll die here.

44

Either I part him alive

45
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,550

00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,130
I owe you an apology.

193
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,560
I'm sorry.

194
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,910
Thank you for once liking me.

195
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,750
You're wonderful

196
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,900
and deserve a unique love.

197
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,880
In the future, you will meet your true love.

198
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,600
You don't owe me anything.

199
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,060
It was all my one-sided feelings.

200
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,570
Being friends with you is truly lucky.

201
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,640
Today,

202
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,190
I came to say goodbye to you.

203
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,890
This is the shareholding document for Yuber.

204
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,920
I'm returning it to you as well.

205
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,780
Why?

206
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:37,700
Manyi.

207
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,030
I've imagined countless times

208
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,070
in my mind

209
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,430
the scene of meeting you again.

210
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,110
I never expected

211
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,600
you would come to me today

212
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,110
just to give me this.

213
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,540
This is my last

214
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,500
connection with you.

215
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,350
If this is cut off too,

216
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,910
then I'll have no relationship with you at all.

217
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,250
Manyi, why...

218
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,440
Why have you become so heartless?

219
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,870
Is Wen Chenyi pressuring you?

220
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,280
No,

221
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,940
it's not like you think.

222
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,980
There are some things

223
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,300
I can't explain clearly to you.

224
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,970
And Yuber

225
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,660
was originally yours.

226
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:40,490
♫It's like deep and true love losing to time♫

227
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,740
I'm just returning what belongs to you.

228
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,400
Returning what belongs to me?

229
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,960
It's mine?

230

♫Only sadness and wounds can be commemorated♫

231
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,420
But we worked on it together.

232

It's ours.

233
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,960

I've given you so much.

237
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,570
can't I get even a little of your affection?

238

Am I really not worth your glance?

247

is there even a sliver of feeling for me

251

Why?

What is all this for?

347
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,760

the Fifth Prince

351
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,710
What?

352
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,640
You're saying

353
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,240
the Wen family is a descendant of the former emperor?

354
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,020
I am of the same clan and ancestry as Wen Chenyi,

355
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,150
and we're both descendants of the former emperor?

356
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,470
Not just that,

357
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,880
there are many things you don't know.

358
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,830
The Wen family is the true royal lineage.

359
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,350
The former emperor

360
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,790
was determined to pass the throne to Wen Chenyi's grandfather

361
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,690
and even wrote an edict.

362
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,270
Is that so?

363
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,840
She's right.

364
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,800
The former emperor loved Wen Xian deeply

365
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,920
and wanted to pass the throne to him.

366
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,720
However, the Wen family refused,

367
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,280
claiming they would stay away from politics.

368
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:01,310
And the former emperor promised to treat the Wen family well.

369
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,310
That's how the current emperor came to the throne.

370
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,710
But how can the emperor

371
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,670
allow danger to lurk nearby?

372
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,690
The Wen family's identity ultimately poses a threat.

373
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,080
I've devoted my life to the Feng State,

374
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,710
so I've repeatedly taken action

375
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,310
to obtain the academy and the seal.

376
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,860
Then tell me,

377
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,430
when it comes to the academy seal

378
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,000
and the so-called treasure you asked Mayor He

379
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,400
to go excavate in Fuzhou,

380
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,100
what secrets

381
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,820
lie within?

382
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,230
The legends of the Feng State are known to everyone,

383
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,320
that the one who obtains the treasure will gain the world.

384
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,070
Within the seal and the Fuzhou treasure,

385
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,300
there lies the address of the treasure.

386
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,150
Inside that treasure,

387
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,170
there's an ancient painting,

388
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,310
and within the layers of that painting,

389
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,590
there remains the former emperor's will.

390
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,190
That can prove the Wen family

391
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,630
is the true lineage of the Feng State.

392
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,890
Don't you want to know about the ancient painting?

393
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:57,690
The ancient painting?

394
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:58,350
Where is it?

395
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,420
The ancient painting?

396
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:04,330
Could it be the one Manyi has been looking for?

397
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,760
Think carefully about who the ultimate beneficiary is,

398
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,290
and you should understand.

399
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,570
Cheng Manyi claims to be searching for the ancient painting,

400
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,970
but in reality, she is looking for the will.

401
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:15,570
Everything she does is for Wen Chenyi.

402
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,800
She is merely using you.

403
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,400
Now even the warriors are under her command,

404
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,540
and you

405
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,090
are still here hesitating,

406
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,880
limited to personal feelings.

407
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,230
Once the will appears,

408
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,920
the Feng State will face a change in imperial power,

409
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,720
and its foundations will shake.

410
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,820
Feng Qiwu,

411
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,190
as a prince of the Feng State,

412
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,660
if you allow things to reach that point,

413
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,340
even in death,

414
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,090
I won't rest easy.

415
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,000
Enough.

416
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,240
This is the fate of royal descendants, I suppose.

417
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,450
Don't worry.

418
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,020
I will prevent the will from appearing,

419
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,830
at any cost.

420
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,070
[A Talented Girl Grows Up]

421
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,170
Honey, you have accompanied me through so much,

422
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:05,410
and it's time for me to fulfill my promise,

423
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,730
to tell you the secret about my hometown.

424
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,050
You may find it hard to accept at first.

425
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,770
Actually...

426
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,130
Actually, you do not belong to this world.

427
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,150
The hometown you speak of

428
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,170
is the world where you originally belonged.

429
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,890
You accidentally entered the Feng State

430
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,220
and became Cheng Manyi,

431
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,330
right?

432
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,450
You...

433
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,180
How do you know all of this?

434
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,440
I should have realized it long ago.

435
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,020
You are so different

436
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,980
from all the women

437
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,440
I have met.

438
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,080
That must be the reason.

439
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,430
So, Honey, can you tell me

440
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,240
what kind of world you lived in

441
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,510
and how you came here?

442
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,160
I come from a very distant 21st century.

443
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,460
Due to an accident,

444
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,000
I entered a comic book

445
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,230
called "The World's Greatest Talented Woman."

446
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,760
And the Feng State is merely

447
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,030
a setting in the comic.

448
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,490
This is hard to understand, isn't it?

449
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,630
It means

450
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,370
we are just

451
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,540
characters in a comic book.

452
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,770
Why aren't you surprised at all?

453
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,030
It's because the words you spoke earlier

454
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,310
made me sense it.

455
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,350
Today, you just confirmed it.

456
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,350
Actually,

457
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,870
I don't care about anything else.

458
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,920
I just want to know what our story's ending

459
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,910
is like.

460
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,350
Do you really have to return

461
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,750
to your own world?

462
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,490
Actually, I don't know

463
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,550
what the ending of the story will be,

464
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,590
because from the moment I entered the comic,

465
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,700
all the story's direction

466
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:01,120
is written by the two of us.

467
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,800
I fell in love

468
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,880
not with a setting,

469
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,570
not with a virtual character,

470
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,260
but with the real,

471
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,530
unreserved you.

472
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,630
I believe you feel the same.

473
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:17,890
Of course.

474
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,940
Falling in love with you

475
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,160
is the most perfect,

476
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,500
the happiest thing

477
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,250
I've ever done.

478
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:32,060
As for whether to return to my original world...

479
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,950
I won't go back.

480
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,060
I want to stay

481
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,030
and grow old with you,

482
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,980
to be together forever. Is it okay?

483
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,070
Honey.

484
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:46,950
I...

485
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,620
The meteor shower.

486
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,310
Hurry.

487
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,260
Close your eyes and make a wish.

488
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,730
But all I want is for you to live safely.

489
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,910
In the first lunar month,

490
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,470
with ominous stars at hand,

491
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,900
destiny's farewell,

492
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,330
never to linger long.

493
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:21,050
My lady, why are you coughing up blood?

494
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,310
I'm going to find the Young Master.

495
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,590
Don't go.

496
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,690
I know my illness.

497
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,500
There's no cure for it

498
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,650
Unless I find the ancient painting

499
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,060
and return to my original world.

500
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,120
I've long since stopped having fantasies.

501
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,350
You know, in this world,

502
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,700
he means the most to me,

503
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,040
and I fear his sadness the most.

504
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,520
Boss, let's look for a painting.

505
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:48,250
Not this one.

506
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,710
Please take a look at this.

507
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,290
No, no.

508
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,550
It's a Star Chart.

509
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,130
Young Master,

510
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:53,800
look,

511
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,700
is this the one?

512
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,000
No, no.

513
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:56,760
Not this one.

514
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:58,770
Bosslady,

515
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,050
may I ask if you have an ancient painting

516
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,030
with a star chart?

517
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,590
We don't have such a painting here.

518
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,760
Take a look at these.

519
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,650
Is there anything to your liking?

520
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,410
Young Master,

521
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,560
since you know the truth,

522
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,180
why not reveal it to the Young Madam?

523
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,560
She wholeheartedly cares for me.

524
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,000
How can I let her down?

525
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,110
Jiaobai, we don't have much time left.

526
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,290
Let's split up and search for the painting.

527
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,010
Let's go.

528
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,680
Grand Master Ning.

529
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,640
I have a request.

530
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,110
I know you are knowledgeable

531
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,060
and have collected many calligraphies and paintings.

532
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,930
I have no other way,

533
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,890
so I can only ask for your guidance.

534
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:52,610
Do you know

535
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,630
where to find an ancient painting with unusual star patterns?

536
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,360
Where is the ancient painting?

537
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,560
Wen Chenyi,

538
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,630
why do you ask questions you already know the answers to?

539
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,310
Your Wen family's disloyalty

540
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,910
is already evident.

541
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,370
You dream of obtaining the treasure and the will

542
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,840
it's wishful thinking.

543
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,170
The treasure and the will...

544
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:18,870
Wait,

545
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:23,310
You really know where the ancient painting is?

546
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,230
I, Wen Chenyi,

547
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,290
only knelt to heaven, earth, the emperor,

548
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,820
and my parents.

549
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,820
I wouldn't kneel to others.

550
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,660
But now,

551
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,890
my wife's life hangs by a thread.

552
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,110
Only the ancient painting can save her.

553
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,650
Grand Master Ning.

554
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,270
I beg you to tell me

555
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,540
where the painting is.

556
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,350
You're not seeking the painting

557
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,020
for the will?

558
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:56,890
What does

559
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,100
the will matter?

560
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:02,000
If you can tell me where the painting is,

561
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,790
I'd rather die here

562
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,110
to ease the emperor.

563
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,860
You know

564
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,000
that I never speak lightly.

565
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,080
I just hope my wife

566
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:17,630
can live safely.

567
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,350
So, Grand Master Ning,

568
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,480
I beg you,

569
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,440
I beg you.

570
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,670
I beg you. Grand Master Ning.

571
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,870
I beg you.

572
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,700
I beg you.

573
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,540
I beg you.

574
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,690
Have I been wrong about your Wen family

575
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,750
all these years?

576
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,590
I beg you, Grand Master Ning.

577
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,150
I beg you.

578
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,020
No.

579
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,050
Feng Qiwu.

580
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,150
Wen Chenyi,

581
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,720
listen to my words.

582
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,760
Do not seek the ancient painting any further.

583
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,830
Otherwise,

584
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,890
when the secret is revealed to the world,

585
00:27:58,890 --> 00:27:59,650
your Wen family

586
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,510
will bring about your own doom.

587
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,130
Remember, remember.

588
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,350
In my life,

589
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,460
I have never believed in gods or spirits.

590
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,320
And I never asked heaven for help.

591
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,770
But at this moment,

592
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,030
I sincerely pray

593
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:20,670
for the gods and ghosts to know

594
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,430
and heaven to see,

595
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,270
to save my beloved wife's life

596
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,390
and help her return safely

597
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,640
to her own world.

598
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,420
But if that's the case,

599
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,350
you will be eternally separated

600
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,550
from the Young Madam,

601
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,050
never to meet again.

602
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,190
At that time, how painful

603
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,280
will it be for you?

604
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,820
Compared to leaving,

605
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,270
the worst is watching her

606
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,790
fade away from my side.

607
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,700
If it weren't for death's separation,

608
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,040
how could I bear

609
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,100
to part from her?

610
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,160
I wish

611
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,590
that after I'm gone,

612
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:33,260
my husband won't be too sorrowful.

613
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,760
Please plant me as a tree

614
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,870
by the road he must take.

615
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,620
I hope my beloved wife returns to her world,

616
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,420
living out her life peacefully.

617
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:47,000
I'm willing to endure the heart-wrenching pain of spiritual separation.

618
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,870
Life is like a summer flower, brilliant in bloom.

619
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,240
Even if it withers,

620
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,510
there are no regrets.

621
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:54,700
This life's love

622
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,430
will never fade.

623
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,330
No matter where you are,

624
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,500
I only wish for your well-being.

625
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,550
Honey.

626
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,700
Honey?

627
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,420
Honey, where are you?

628
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:49,610
Honey?

629
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,480
Honey.

630
00:30:58,810 --> 00:30:59,890
Honey?

631
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,060
Manyi.

632
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,640
Where are you?

633
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,800
You wouldn't be...

634
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:10,270
Manyi!

635
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,230
Manyi!

636
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:14,980
Manyi!

637
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,270
Manyi!

638
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,370
Honey!

639
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:23,790
Manyi.
