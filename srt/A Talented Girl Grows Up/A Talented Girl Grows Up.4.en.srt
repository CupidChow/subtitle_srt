Cheng Manyi.

5
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,610
You skipped class too, right?

6
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,470
How about we go on a trip together?

7
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,500
I'm in a hurry. I have something urgent to do.

8
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,310
I'm busy.

9
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,190
Why are you so flustered?

10
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,110
Maybe we can help you.

11
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,400
Wen Chenyi is missing.

12
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,190
I can't explain what happened in a short time.

13
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,850
Arrest the human trafficker!

14
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,070
That seems to be Wen Chenyi's clothes.

15
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:37,900
Go after him!

16
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,580
Go!

17
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:40,580
Stop!

18

You human trafficker! Stop!

19
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,130
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,380
What are you doing?

21
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,229
Make way.

22
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:49,250
Excuse me.

23
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,400
You knocked over my things. Pay me for the damage.

24
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,140
Sorry.

25
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,289
Pick up the money.

26
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,610
Pick up the money!

27
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,140
Stop!

28
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,800
Tell me, where did you get the clothes?

29
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,780
Who are you? Let go of me!

30

The human trafficker is running away.

31
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,500
The human trafficker? Aren't you the human trafficker?

32

Who are you?

34
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,300
I'm Cui Jun.

I got you!

38
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,290
Let go of me! I'm not a human trafficker!

39

Young Master, the carriage is ready.

40
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,370
Recently, people have been missing in the city.

41
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,670
After my investigation,

42
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,440
I found out that a group of people

43
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,450
who abducted and sold them.

44
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,250
Maybe they caught Mr. Wen by mistake.

45
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,520
Since they want to sell him,

46
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,079
he wouldn't have been killed.

47
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,760
Mr. Wen is indeed weak.

48
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,520
He was abducted just like that?

49
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:48,880
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,040
Tell me what happened to the robe.

51
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,660
Here's the thing. I saw a strong man on the street today.

52
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,250
He bought a lot of wine and food.

53
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,130
It's nothing.

54
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,600
But it's weird that his bag

55
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,220
is made of a gorgeous outer robe.

56
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,900
I could tell from the material of this outer robe

57
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,660
that it was clearly something he couldn't afford.

58
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,720
So I came to ask him.

59
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,660
But he didn't even want his robe

60
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,460
and ran away.

61
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,810
It was very suspicious.

Were the people chasing him from the government?

He said it was a man and a woman.

Fine, it'll be okay.

These pine trees only grow in the mountains,

111
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,640
so this place must be a desolate mountain.

The sun moves from east to west,

113
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,570
So the dungeon

114
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,310
must be located on the southeast side of the mountain.

115

The soil is white and fine.

116
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,350
Could it be clay?

Near the capital,

00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:39,110

This is Mr. Wen's handwriting indeed.

The Lovesick Birds are really amazing.

129
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,460
The kiln site has been deserted for many years.

130
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,110
It seems to be

131
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,180
on the southeast slope of the mountain.

132
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:30,780
Yes.

00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,659
Wen Chenyi is very likely imprisoned there.

We're outnumbered. We can't force our way in.

It's easy.

We'll just buy off everyone.

That would be helping them fence stolen goods!

00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:09,630
It wasn't me.

377
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,620
Wait for me! Don't go!

378
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,320
[Wen's Mansion]

379
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,160
Come back!

380
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,430
Why are you leaving?

381
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,120
Wait for me.

382
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,220
Vice Censor-in-Chief Du is targeting the Wen family.

383
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,200
I suspect your poisoning is likely related to him.

384
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,370
The Wen family has always been targeted by schemers

385
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,630
and has been restless.

386
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,180
It’s just that we’ve never made it public.

387
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,080
Could it all be Vice Censor-in-Chief Du’s doing?

388
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,130
It is him, but not only him.

389
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,320
It would be easier if he was alone.

390
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,170
But I believe there must be

391
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,770
someone behind him pulling the strings.

392
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,920
A hidden mastermind?

393
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,400
There are suspects, but none are confirmed.

394
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,040
The Wen family has been enduring in silence

395
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,150
to catch a bigger fish.

396
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,890
You're just a sickly person who can't hold an official post.

397
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,030
The Wen family never joins factions,

398
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,890
forms cliques, or stirs trouble.

399
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,359
Why would we be targeted?

400
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:23,119
Yi.

401
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,510
For so many years,

402
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,040
I've had you pretend to be weak.

403
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,320
Do you know why?

404
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:34,150
To stay away from court politics and disputes.

405
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,170
Yes. The Wen family's status is unique.

406
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:41,000
Once exposed, it would cause turmoil in the court

407
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,280
and disrupt the peace.

408
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,580
I could only make you endure

409
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,530
the pretense of frailty to ensure

410
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,880
the Wen family's safety for a hundred years.

411
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,730
Remember, never tell outsiders.

412
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,990
Otherwise, not only our Wen family will be in danger,

413
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,740
but those close to you will also

414
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,650
suffer unwarranted calamities.

415
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,070
Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

416
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,080
The Wen family oversees the World's Greatest Academy.

417
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,740
Naturally, it attracts envy.

418
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,610
How can we remain aloof?

419
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,250
That makes sense.

420
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,040
Don't worry.

421
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,270
I will protect you...

422
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,770
And the Wen family.

423
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:30,310
Honey. You've protected your husband very well.

424
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,960
Almost got your husband sold.

425
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,650
Didn't you smile happily just now?

426
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,600
Why are you bringing that up again?

427
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,100
I was wrong.

428
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,520
I shouldn't have made light of your situation,

429
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,310
nearly causing you to be abducted.

430
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,750
Thankfully, you taught me that word of wisdom.

431
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,310
But now I realize how important learning is.

432
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,100
I promise

433
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,650
I will study hard and make progress every day.

434
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,410
All right.

435
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,330
Get up now.

436
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:13,160
My previous approach to your studies was too aggressive.

437
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,300
It’s like pulling up seedlings to help them grow faster, which only has the opposite effect.

438
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,260
But if it weren't for that,

439
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,590
how could I have had the fortune

440
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,190
to witness Heroin Cheng's heroic appearance?

441
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,820
Since we are both at fault,

442
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:25,870
we're even now.

443
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,910
Look.

444
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,170
I hung this up.

445

[Eliminate Treason and Support the Weak]

446
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,100

♫Pretty girl and handsome guy♫

448
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,490
My Lord, according to my investigation,

449
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,240
it turns out Cheng Manyi does possess martial art skills

450
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,640
and is quite remarkable.

451
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,070
Father.

452
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,270
Come to think of it,

453
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,860
Cheng Manyi spends all day at the academy without studying.

454
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,430
Moreover, she has never shown her calligraphy

455
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,380
to others.

456
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,660
She might actually

457
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,190
be an illiterate

458
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,250
who doesn't know a single character.

459
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,990
If that’s the case, the so-called World's Greatest Talented Woman

460
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,180
would become the greatest joke in the world.

461
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,500
If this can be confirmed,

462
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,100
the Wen family could be accused of deceiving the Emperor.

463
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,090
The World's Greatest Academy

464
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,730
would be within reach.

465
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,540
[World's Greatest Academy]

466
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,310
He's here.

467
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,330
Hurry up.

468
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,530
What are they doing?

469
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,050
They must have known about your esteemed arrival,

470
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,380
which has brought them great honor, hence the warm welcome.

471
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,520
Ladies and gentlemen, Lord Du has arrived…

472
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,310
Don’t shout.

473
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,610
I have always been low-key in how I conduct myself and handle affairs.

474
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,430
Yes.

475
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,350
Everyone!

Cheng Manyi.

477
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,990
Is this all for me?

478
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,150
Cheng Manyi.

479
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,070
Thank you.

480
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:57,950
Cheng Manyi!

481

Cheng Manyi!

483
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:00,790
Cheng Manyi!

484
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,000
Thank you.

485
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,310
Cheng Manyi.

486
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,230
Thank you.

487
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,070
What brings you here today, Vice Censor-in-Chief Du?

488
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:23,920
Mr. Wen!

489
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:25,990
Mr. Wen.

490
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,910
Your wife slept through class yesterday.

491
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:32,030
Today she started telling stories.

492
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,940
Yesterday, the bright world saw some scoundrels

493
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:43,490
imprisoning several commoners.

494
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,340
At a critical moment,

495
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,610
I made a brilliant appearance.

496
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,630
I rushed in barehanded

497
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,830
and fought with the scoundrels.

498
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,490
How inappropriate!

499
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,230
Your wife used my jade chess pieces

500
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,790
as dice during class yesterday.

501
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,900
She disregarded the academy's rules.

502
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,340
Mr. Wen, this is your wife's work.

503
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,540
It’s truly awful and a complete mess.

504
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,150
How can this be?

505
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,410
Are you talking about Miss Cheng?

506
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,510
Director Du.

507
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,490
That's her.

508
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,330
Strange.

509
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,270
Miss Cheng seems unskilled

510
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,470
and with many faults,

511
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,200
not at all like someone renowned for her talents.

512
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,840
Actually,

513
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,660
I instructed her to act this way.

514
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,180
My wife is quite talented.

515
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,790
I feared that if the students saw her talents,

516
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,520
they might become complacent.

517
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,410
So I had her pretend to be foolish in front of others,

518
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:44,170
to encourage the students' eagerness to learn.

519
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,890
Hiding one's abilities is not a good strategy.

520
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,730
Revealing them at the right time

521
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:53,260
can inspire others to study harder.

522
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,480
In my opinion,

523
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,840
tomorrow's qin playing meeting

524
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,280
is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

525
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,830
Today, I have come to sincerely invite

526
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,780
Miss Cheng to perform on stage and play the qin.

527
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,080
Tomorrow's qin playing meeting?

528
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,340
Isn't it a bit rushed?

529
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,050
My wife may not be up to the task.

530
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,320
Perhaps we should discuss it another day.

531
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,360
Don't worry. I've invited high officials and nobles.

532
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,940
Talented scholars and beautiful ladies will gather

533
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,740
to exchange and discuss. This matter is settled.

534
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,940
May I ask where the qin playing meeting will be held?

535
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,610
Someone will come to inform you tomorrow.

536
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,100
Everyone.

537
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,630
Please come and watch the performance tomorrow.

538
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:57,260
The combat was unprecedentedly intense.

539
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,890
Unexpectedly, just as things were happening in a flash,

540
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:03,490
a group of burly men with knives rushed in from the other side.

541
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,310
Luckily, I’ve mastered unparalleled martial arts.

542
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:09,570
I rushed in and pinned them

543
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,170
to the ground,

544
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:17,570
leaving them no choice but to beg for mercy.

545
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,320
They had to plead with me to spare them.

546
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,590
I've never heard that you knew martial arts.

547
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:30,250
Right, aren't you a talented scholar?

548
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,360
Could it be that you were faking it?

549
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,830
I just didn't publicize it before.

550
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,920
I grew up in a martial arts school.

551
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:46,270
I guess I'm just an ordinary

552
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,860
but well-rounded talent, both in literature and in martial arts.

553
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,180
We can't limit our thinking.

554
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,840
We must broaden our horizons.

555
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,540
Very true.

556
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,710
When one person is far superior to another person,

557
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,720
the latter can only look up in admiration.

558
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,280
You...

559
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,550
Who are you referring to?

560
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,520
After hearing your story,

561
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,440
I am in deep admiration.

562
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,310
May I have your handwriting?

563
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,410
I'll place it in my ancestral home

564
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,510
and burn incense before it every day.

565
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,770
That's not very appropriate.

566
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,220
We should keep a low profile, keep it low-key.

567
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,660
Miss Cheng won't even

568
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,060
do such a small favor?

569
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,400
Manyi, didn’t you say this morning

570
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,800
that you'd gift me the calligraphy

571
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,030
"Serenity Sustains a Thousand Years,

572
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,150
and the Hidden Spring Dwells in Solitude"?

573
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,840
Since our classmate requests it,

574
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,610
why not give it to her first?

575
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,910
Sure, why not?

576
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,160
Sure.

577
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,320
Not at all!

578
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,590
I don't know how to write.

579
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,800
Manyi.

580
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,630
Your hand was injured during the fight yesterday.

581
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,550
I forgot.

582
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,440
Injured?

583
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,700
My hand is injured.

584
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,160
What unfortunate timing.

585
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,390
Then I'll write it on behalf of you today.

586
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,650
Would that be alright?

587
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,520
Could Wei possibly know

588
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,090
that I'm pretending to be a talented scholar?

589
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,410
Well, you...

590
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,030
That outfit looks nice on you.

591
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,820
This is the academy's standard student uniform.

592
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,940
The same as mine.

593
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:48,010
By the way, your brother...

594
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,630
Has he not finished his studies yet?

595
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:55,250
My brother doesn't have class today.

596
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,030
No class? Well, I'll be off then.

597
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:58,750
Manyi.

598
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,170
Are you wondering

599
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,360
if I know

600
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:08,600
that you're not actually a talented scholar?

601
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,970
What? Manyi is illiterate?

602
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,640
She just doesn't know the Feng State script, that’s all.

603
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,190
This is unbelievable.

604
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:19,960
Wei.

605
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,830
If you can't accept it...

606
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,630
Manyi is even more extraordinary than I imagined.

607
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,960
Brother, you've truly found a gem.

608
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,210
I'm glad you don't mind.

609
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,990
I have a favor to ask you.

610
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,080
You must protect Manyi,

611
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,230
but also ensure that no one realizes anything is amiss

612
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,760
and takes advantage of her.

613
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,950
You want to play the qin for me?

614
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:57,110
No, it’s you. You're the one who must play the qin

615
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:59,130
at tomorrow's qin playing meeting.

616
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,370
What?

617
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,630
I have to play the qin?

618
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,350
Yes.

619
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,020
To ensure that nothing goes wrong, Vice Censor-in-Chief Du

620
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,880
didn't even reveal the location.

621
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,500
This time next year,

622
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:16,010
you can burn more paper offerings for me.

623
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,230
But not all hope is lost.

624
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:23,850
Right.

625
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,710
I can't play the qin.

626
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,510
But I can run away.

627
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:33,410
This is Cheng Manyi, the World's Greatest Talented Woman.

628
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,080
She’s Cheng Manyi?

629
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,770
You are now a walking, living signboard.

630
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,460
Where can you run to?

631
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,780
Could I fake being sick to get out of this?

632
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,320
Delaying won’t work.

633
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,840
Vice Censor-in-Chief Du will simply choose another time.

634
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,530
Young Master, Vice Censor-in-Chief Du has sent word that the qin playing meeting

635
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,660
will be postponed until after the Young Madam recovers.

636
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:04,330
[Invitation to the Qin Playing Meeting]

637
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,100
The "fake illness" plan

638
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,290
is dead.

639
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,670
You can cover the windows,

640
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:31,160
but how do you hide from

641
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,320
all the Du's Mansion's many servants?

642
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,390
The "blinding" plan

643
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,880
is dead too.

644
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,320
This won’t work.

645
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:45,830
That won’t work.

646
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,140
What should I do?

647
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:47,950
This qin playing meeting

648
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:50,030
is clearly aimed at me.

649
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,970
I already have a plan.

650
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,500
But for now,

651
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,810
you'll need to learn

652
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,290
to put on a show

653
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,740
and mimic the motions of playing the qin.

654
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,350
What do you mean?

655
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,460
Come, sit.

656
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,830
The qin has

657
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,320
seven strings named Gong, Shang, Jue, Zhi, Yu, Wen, and Wu.

658
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,970
The right hand plucks the strings with techniques

659
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:28,340
like plucking, sweeping, hooking, flicking, supporting, breaking, striking, and picking.

660
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,860
Your left hand will press the strings to produce tones.

661
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,150
And the right hand

662
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:35,830
will play the sliding tone.
