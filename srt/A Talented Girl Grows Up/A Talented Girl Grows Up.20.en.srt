[Episode 20]

3
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,190
Feng Qiwu,

4
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,870
kill me.

5
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,720
Kill me.

6
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:22,580
Okay.

7
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,610
I'll help you.

8
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:27,950
Come with me.

9
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,610
Feng Qiwu, how dare you!

10
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,240
Manyi, let go!

11
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,520
He's dying.

12
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,740
I want to reduce his suffering.

13
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,229
Let me be the sinner.

14
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,789
Feng Qiwu, let me tell you.

15
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,300
It has nothing to do with you.

16
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,220
Whether I live or die

17
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,370
is none of your business.

18
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:51,110
Let go!

19
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:59,910
Let go!

20
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,670
Let go!

21
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,800
You did so much

22
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,340
for him.

23
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,520
Yes.

24
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,600
As long as I can save him,

25
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,590
I'm willing

26
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,400
to do anything for him,

27
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,790
let alone drug trials.

28
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,079
I won't let you die before me.

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,150
Fine.

30
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,430
Okay.

31
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,770
Don't delay the drug trial.

32
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,190
Cheng Manyi,

33
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,050
I'll let my five babies bite you one by one.

34
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,710
Tell me

35
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,840
your feelings.

36
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,710
You enjoy testing drugs. You're crazy!

37
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,150
You agreed to do a drug trial for your beloved. You're crazy, too.

38
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,490
How do you feel?

39
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,940
Nothing.

40
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,360
It just hurts a little.

41
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,470
It hurts.

42
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,140
It hurts.

43
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,850
It tickles.

44
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,510
It's hot.

45
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,310
I see.

46
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,230
Snake venom

47
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,450
causes pain.

48
00:04:57,909 --> 00:05:00,110
Scorpion venom makes people feel cold.

49
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,230
Centipede poison makes people feel itchy.

50
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,460
Toad poison makes people feel hot.

51
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,680
Great.

52
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,780
The toxic effects of all the five poisons are clear.

53
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,190
But you only tested four kinds of venom.

54
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,250
What about the spider venom?

55
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,190
You gave it to me?

56
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,250
Take it.

57
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,150
Wen Chenyi.

58
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,159
Wen Chenyi!

59
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,190
See?

60
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,140
I told you

61
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:53,560
even the Phoenix Grass couldn't save him.

62
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,210
Wen Chenyi!

63
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,320
He didn't get away with it.

64
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,160
Wen Chenyi!

65
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:04,960
Wen Chenyi!

66
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,240
Wen Chenyi!

67
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,830

they lose the hope

77
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,690

Am I dreaming?

95
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,310
You were poisoned by five venom

96
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,410
and hallucinated.

97
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,260
Why were you so stupid?

98
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:10,950
Do you know

99
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,820
if you die for me,

100
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,070
I won't live alone?

I'm fine now.

Are you okay?

103
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,460
Yes.

104
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,790
You are lucky this time.

105
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,300
Luckily, Doctor Tang just wanted to scare you.

106
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,690
He has the antidote for five poisons.

107
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:37,870
Otherwise,

108
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,560
I will never forgive myself.

109
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,830
We're the same.

110
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,180
When the arrow came,

111
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,820
you stood in front of me.

112
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,130
We are a couple.

113
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,520
For you,

114
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,410
I'm willing to do anything.

No.

Okay.

120
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,940
She's not yours.

121
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,010
It's no use looking at her.

122
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,450
Stop dreaming.

123
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,280
Are you ignoring me?

124
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,290
Oh, I forgot.

Nonsense!

128
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,070
Your Majesty,

129
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,580
the burglary in Fuzhou

130
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,140
has nothing to do with me.

131
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,910
Your Majesty, we will see who is talking nonsense

132
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,590
after summoning witnesses and evidence.

133
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,750
Summon the witnesses.

134
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,470
Summon the witnesses and evidence.

135
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,380
Long live the Emperor!

136
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,120
Get up.

137
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,670
Yes, Your Majesty.

138
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,770
Grand Minister Ning, you didn't expect that we're alive, huh?

139
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,050
If we had died,

140
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,830
we could never prove you are the culprit?

141
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,190
Can we go back to the capital now

142
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,760
to clear Brother Yu's name?

143
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,600
No hurry.

144
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,870
Grand Master Ning is sinister and vicious.

145
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,070
He must have a backup plan.

146
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,070
To avoid any accidents on our way,

147
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,840
we need to change the evidence in advance

148
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,960
and find someone to pretend to be Mayor He.

149
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,120
Then, we have to leave Fuzhou

150
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,850
in two carriages separately.

151
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,990
Father, I assisted Cheng Manyi

152
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,920
in investigating the burglary.

153
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,370
I found out that it was Grand Master Ning who manipulated all this.

154
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,930
Mayor He was also instigated by him

155
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,550
to destroy the levee,

156
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,050
causing people

157
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,300
to be displaced.

158
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,300
I beg you, Father,

159
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,450
to punish Grand Master Ning severely.

160
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,610
Your Majesty, the Fifth Prince is right.

161
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,030
Grand Master Ning sent Mayor He to dig the levee to find treasures in Fuzhou

162
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,870
and framed the laborers.

163
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,920
Luckily, Yu Yidao was righteous

164
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,300
and saved the laborers.

165
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,610
That's why he was framed as a bandit.

166
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,480
Now we have witnesses and evidence.

167
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,350
Please make the right judgment, Your Majesty.

168
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,410
Your Majesty,

169
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,190
with the laborers' testimony as evidence,

170
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,150
my name can be cleared.

171
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,380
Your Majesty!

172
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,400
Your Majesty,

173
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,470
it was Grand Master Ning's fault.

174
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,680
Grand Master Ning threatened me

175
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,670
with the lives of my family.

176
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,000
I dared not disobey him.

177
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,520
These letters are the evidence.

178
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,090
Grand Master Ning even

179
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,080
tried to kill me on my way back to the capital

180
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,220
to destroy the witness and evidence.

181
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,990
It's Grand Master Ning who is behind all this.

182
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,510
Your Majesty, please make the right judgment

183
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,110
and give me justice.

184
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,460
Nonsense!

185
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,510
Your Majesty,

186
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,210
they colluded

187
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,030
to frame me.

188
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:53,780
Shut up!

189
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,070
They have witnesses and evidence.

190
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,670
How dare you deny it?

191
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:06,650
Your Majesty,

192
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:08,710
don't you

193
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,910
understand why I did so?

194
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,390
I've been looking for treasures, and I targeted the Wen Family,

195
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:15,990
for,

196
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,080
for the good of Feng State.

197
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:19,810
For Feng State's sake,

198
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,590
you killed those innocent people

199
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,120
and committed crimes, huh?

200
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,220
Your Majesty.

201
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,350
I am

202
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,370
the Grand Master of Feng State.

203
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,330
I'd rather be a villain

204
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,670
than be a sinner of Feng State.

205
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,370
Guards!

206
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,660
Put Grand Master Ning in jail and execute him in autumn.

207
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,170
As for Mayor He,

208
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,890
he helped the evil

209
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,350
and committed heinous crimes.

210
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,070
He should be executed according to the law.

211
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:55,550
But considering his repentance, he will be given a lighter sentence.

212
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,170
He will be sentenced to ten years in prison.

213
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,680
His assets will be confiscated.

214
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,590
Take him away.

215
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,080
Go.

216
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,720
You worked together to solve the case,

217
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,630
saving the people of Feng State

218
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:20,160
and finding out the rotten apple for the court.

219
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,270
It's a great contribution.

220
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,950
I will give you

221
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,180
everything you want.

222
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,420
Your Majesty,

223
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,530
may I ask Your Majesty

224
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,190
to restart the imperial examinations of martial arts

225
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,450
and allow women to take part in the exams?

226
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,160
No way.

227
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:40,960
Honey.

228
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,740
Allowing women to attend the exams?

229
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,110
What's the use of restarting the imperial examinations of martial arts?

230
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,370
Now, the work of the City Guard Department is inefficient.

231
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,430
The case of Grand Master Ning

232
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,550
has proved that we cannot let civilian officials wield power alone.

233
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,590
In the literary fight before,

234
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,390
Your Majesty agreed that we should govern the country with civilian and military officials.

235
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,140
I think it's time to restart the imperial examinations of martial arts.

236
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,920
We can't allow women to take the imperial examinations of martial arts.

237
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,840
That's right. It's inappropriate.

238
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,950
I think there are many women,

239
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,760
who can tell right from wrong,

240
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,310
distinguish good from evil,

241
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,280
and are good at martial arts in Feng State,

242
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,680
like Cheng Manyi.

243
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,420
They also want to serve the people

244
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,820
and don't want to be trapped in the boudoir.

245
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,170
They are as capable

246
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,290
and talented

247
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,960
as men.

248
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,780
They have great aspirations.

249
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:34,840
Besides,

250
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,590
women

251
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,600
have never lost to men.

252
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,000
If Your Majesty cares about women's rights,

253
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:42,990
I think

254
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,710
it's a great idea to start selecting women officers.

255
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,710
That makes sense.

256
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,530
Come on. Pass my order.

257
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,050
We're going to restart the imperial examinations of martial arts.

258
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,700
Make everyone knows

259
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,020
that all the people of Feng State,

260
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,670
no matter men or women, can take part in the exams.

261
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,869
The martial champion

262
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,410
will be the next City Guard Censor.

263
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

264
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,060
[On the 10th day of the first month of the third year of Feng State]

265
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,790
This is Wen Xian, my grandfather.

266
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,730
Grandfather?

267
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,000
The trick of a woman disguising as a man

268
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,880
can only fool you ancient people.

269
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,000
You can tell this is a woman?

270
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,220
Isn't that obvious?

271
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,620
Your grandfather is a woman.

272
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,630
Fine.

273
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,930
I will tell you the truth.

274
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,160
What do you mean?

275
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,400
I will tell you

276
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,210
the secret that the Wen Family has been hiding.

277
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,130
What's that?

278
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,840
Are you actually a member of the royal family?

279
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,910
How did you know that?

280
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,180
Honey, you are so smart.

281
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,600
I was right.

282
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,560
Gosh!

283
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,060
It's dramatic.

284
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,170
That's a plot used frequently by TV dramas.

285
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:36,900
Tell me then.

286
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,100
Wen Xian, my grandfather,

287
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:45,000
was loved by Feng Yi,

288
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,910
the first Emperor of Feng State.

289
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,840
They promised

290
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,170
to create a world

291
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,830
where people can live freely

292
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,630
and choose who they love out of their willingness.

293
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,060
But nobody knew

294
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,350
she was a woman.

295
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,930
She fell in love with Feng Yi.

296
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,570
After giving birth to their baby,

297
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,230
they separated.

298
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,640
That's why Wen Xian stayed away from the court

299
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,400
and established the World's Greatest Academy.

300
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,300
[World's Greatest Academy]

301
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,990
So,

302
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,430
the descendants of the Wen Family are of the royal bloodline.

303
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,290
This has always been a hidden danger for Feng State.

304
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:30,170
That's why Grand Master Ning wanted to destroy the Wen Family all the time.

305
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,360
But he didn't know

306
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,790
the Wen Family has never intended to usurp.

307
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,340
We just want to stay away from the court

308
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,010
and keep our family members safe and safeguard Feng State.

309
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,500
No wonder Grand Master Ning

310
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,730
said he did so for the good of Feng State.

311
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,650
Feng Yi was such a scumbag.

312
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,340
Top scumbag!

313
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,320
What does that mean?

314
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,980
Your grandmother gave up everything for him

315
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,130
but he was fickle.

316
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,700
He was a scumbag!

317
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,880
Well.

318
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,580
But don't worry.

319
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,070
Grand Master Ning has been imprisoned.

320
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,030
Your wish to safeguard the Wen Family and Feng State

321
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,070
was achieved.

322
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,440
No one can make trouble for the Wen Family.

323
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,700
Since you have fulfilled my wish,

324
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,510
I should grant your wish.

325
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,030
What do you mean?

326
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,180
Don't peek.

327
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,500

571
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,320
Sister, I have something to tell you.

572
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,330
I'm going to marry her.

573
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,680
She is my wife.

574
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,380
Everyone, I'm getting married.

575
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,920
Jun!

576
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,330
Just keep the joy in your heart.

577
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:01,750
Don't make it so public.

578
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,270
I kept everything

579
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,290
in my heart.

580
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:08,200
This caused our misunderstanding.

581
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,880
From now on,

582
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:12,270
I will express my feelings bravely.

583
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,740
Who wants your flowers?

584
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,720
Sir, I have something to tell you.

585
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,380
I'm engaged.

586
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,550
I must have done good deeds

587
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,740
to get such a good wife.

588
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,050
Do you mean

589
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,960
I lost my love

590
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,240
because I'm immoral?

591
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,570
Do you want to be beaten?

592
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,620
I'll forgive you.

593
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,190
Jun,

594
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,970
he just experienced the pain of separating from his lover.

595
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:39,220
But you showed off our engagement.

596
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,020
You were adding fuel to the fire.

597
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,070
I was telling the truth.

598
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:46,420
I want to show off to everyone

599
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,790
that I got engaged with you.

600
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,600
Stop!

601
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,380
Stop!

602
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,030
Jun, run!

603
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,090
It's him! Beat him!

604
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,470
Run!

605
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,350
-Chase him!
-Go!

606
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,030
Stop! Stop!

607
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,560
-Don't let him escape.
-Go!

608
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:02,900
Stop!

609
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,290
Stop!

610
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,110
Stop!

611
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:06,840
Stop!

612
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,210
Go ahead and take a look!

613
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,680
Jun,

614
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,910
you mentioned our engagement many times.

615
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,600
But do you know

616
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,190
what it means?

617
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,430
It means

618
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,970
I dare do what I didn't dare do before.
