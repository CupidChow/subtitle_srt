00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,560
Okay.

195
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:53,320
Time to work.

196
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,300
Time to work.

197
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,430
Let's begin.

198
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,000
My farming cow

199
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,680
has been pregnant for 12 months.

200
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,700
But it hasn't given birth to a calf yet.

201
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,180
I lost my cat.

202
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,630
It's been raining for days,

203
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,460
causing the collapse of one of my rooms.

204
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,960
My hen is missing.

205
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,850
My husband hasn't been home for three days.

206
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:09,830
I've written it down.

207
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,150
Thank you.

208
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,110
You lost your wife?

209
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,630
You lost your bracelet?

210
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,270
-Okay.
-Okay.

211
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,140
Wait for our news.

212
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:13,810
You lost your pig?

213
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,270
I'll find it for you, okay?

214
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,030
Chick.

215
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,940
You can't beat your child.

216
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,070
What did you lose?

217
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,870
Wang Lao'er, my neighbor,

218
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,350
borrowed 20 taels of silver from me

219
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,250
but hasn't returned it yet.

220
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,170
Come on, look what this is.

221
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,280
Young Master.

222
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,710
What's the matter?

223
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,260
Grand Master Ning invited the Crown Prince to dinner.

224
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,380
He invited you to visit his mansion.

225
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,530
Hello.

226
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:34,310
I'll help you.

227
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,520
I will.

228
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,740
Okay.

229
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,220
I'll go.

230
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,400
But don't tell Young Madam about this.

231
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,220
OK.

232
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,380
Take care.

233
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,159
Let's go.

234
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,570
It's not a punishment from heaven for a rooster to lay eggs.

235
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,880
It's because all you have are roosters.

236
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:50,770
As time passes,

237
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,570
it became a androgyny.

238
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,510
Just put some hens in.

239
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,280
Your wife became a vampire

240
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,900
and even sucked blood from wood?

241
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,660
I think she has bleeding gums.

242
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,950
Bring her to see a doctor.

243
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,910
A man has been pregnant for two years but couldn't give birth?

244
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,070
It's not a baby

245
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,060
but fat.

246
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,020
Lose some weight.

247
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,540
What did you lose?

248
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,860
In our mountain,

249
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,680
there is a Grieving Spirit in a haunted house

250
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,140
called Granny Ghost-face.

251
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,610
At midnight,

252
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,200
there are always creepy cries.

253
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,170
A brave young man

254
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,810
went to the haunted house

255
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,039
and saw Granny Ghost-face.

256
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:35,780
He said she looked like a demon

257
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,270
and could take souls.

258
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:39,690
He got seriously ill when he came back.

259
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,090
It's true.

260
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:41,429
[Case Record]

261
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,650
So, everything happened can be explained by science.

262
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,880
You learned for nothing.

263
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,830
You can't trust feudal superstition.

264
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,160
Let's go and have a look.

265
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,360
Mr. Wen,

266
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,720
the fire a few days ago

267
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,160
was dangerous.

268
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,790
If you hadn't

269
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,950
risked your life to save Miss Cheng,

270
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,410
she would have died.

271
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,020
How is your wife?

272
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,330
Thank you for your concern.

273
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,860
Even if my wife is in danger,

274
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,700
I would do my best to protect her

275
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,520
not only on that day

276
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,320
but also in the following days.

277
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,430
It's easy to avoid natural disasters.

278
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,890
But the manmade disasters

279
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,940
are unpredictable.

280
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,660
I heard that Mr. Wen is dissatisfied with

281
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,670
the inspection result given by the City Guard Department.

282
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,340
If you have any evidence,

283
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,820
you can give it to me.

284
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,470
I will enforce the law impartially

285
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,850
and do my best to catch the murderer.

286
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,250
I will do my best

287
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,670
to help you.

288
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,850
When will His Highness arrive?

289
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,130
His Highness will arrive tomorrow.

290
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,000
How about this?

291
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,080
Mr. Wen, stay in my residence today,

292
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:08,790
okay?

293
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,160
Don’t bother, Grand Master Ning.

294
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,670
I’ll visit you tomorrow.

295
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,990
Send him to the ice cellar.

296
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,260
He can't escape this time.

297
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,470
Cheng Manyi has won praise from the people many times.

298
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,540
The Wen family

299
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,610
is troublesome.

300
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,940
No need to care about them.

301
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,480
Fortunately, Miss Chenwei didn't come.

302
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,410
Come, let's boost our morale.

303
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,160
The Three Heroes of Feng State

304
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,880
are unparalleled

305
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,120
and dominant!

306
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,750
Let's go.

307
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,620
Are you looking for me?

308
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,670
Wen.

309
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,510
Wen.

310
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,140
Wen, are you okay?

311
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,800
I overheard the conversation between my father and Grand Master Ning

312
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,000
and found this place.

313
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,440
I know you don't like me.

314
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,760
But

315
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,120
I will never harm you.

316
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,060
Thank you.

317
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,670
Let's go, Wen.

318
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,940
I'll take you out now.

319
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,710
Du Yaqin!

320
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,680
Dad.

321
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,630
You silly girl.

322
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,170
Do you think he will fall in love with you

323
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,860
after you save him?

324
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:36,520
Dad,

325
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,630
please.

326
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,070
Please let him go.

327
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,590
If he stays here,

328
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,830
he'll be in trouble.

329
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,470
You are so stupid.

330
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,710
If you

331
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,380
are caught by Grand Master Ning,

332
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,040
do you know the consequences?

333
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,370
Go with me. Hurry!

334
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,470
Go with me!

335
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,130
Dad!

336
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,880
Go!

337
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,190
Damn it.

338
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,490
If I have a fever,

339
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,420
and become a nine-year-old boy,

340
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,070
I won't be able to control myself.

341
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:19,250
I'm afraid the consequences will be unimaginable.

342
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,150
It's delicious.

343
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,170
It smells so good.

344
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,230
It tastes better than the roast chicken in the capital.

345
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,190
All these years,

346
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,040
besides my husband,

347
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,960
you are the only people who are kind to me.

348
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,840
But Miss,

349
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,450
I think you're pretty.

350
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,850
Those people are blind.

351
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,190
What are you doing?

352
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,450
Stay away from my wife!

353
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,940
Stay away from my wife!

354
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:49,920
Honey.

355
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,060
Don't scare them.

356
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,690
They are all good men.

357
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,260
Mr. Wen.

358
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,580
Mr. Wen.

359
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,270
Who are you?

360
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,800
Where am I?

361
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,710
It's so cold.

362
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,130
Yi, don't be afraid.

363
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,560
Do you know me?

364
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,360
No.

365
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:32,900
Don't be afraid.

366
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,950
I'm your father's best friend.

367
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,260
He told me

368
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,640
to get you out of here!

369
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,300
Come.

370
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,510
Get up.

371
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,830
Why

372
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,810
didn't he come to pick me up?

373
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,110
Father told me

374
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,130
not to get close to strangers.

375
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,630
You're nine years old.

376
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:53,820
Your father is the principal of the World's Greatest Academy.

377
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,550
You befriended a girl named Cheng Manyi.

378
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,010
Am I right?

379
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,720
If that's the case,

380
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,450
you are indeed my dad's best friend.

381
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,030
Come on.

382
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,730
She used to be so beautiful.

383
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,470
If it were not the accident

384
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,010
that ruined my wife's face,

385
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,940
we would have enjoyed a happy life.

386
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,350
My family has been practicing medicine for generations.

387
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,750
I can cure all illnesses in the mortal world

388
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,400
but I can't cure my wife.

389
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,080
I'm useless.

390
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,590
Then why

391
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,290
did you choose to

392
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,120
live in the mountains?

393
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,550
I know

394
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,310
you came here because of the rumors.

395
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,980
Sorry for pretending to be a ghost and scaring you.

396
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,170
You're trying to avoid disturbance, right?

397
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,130
Due to

398
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,310
my ugly face,

399
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,970
I was discriminated in the village.

400
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,430
Some villagers thought I was unlucky.

401
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,000
Thank you.

402
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,840
They often came to make trouble.

403
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,780
My husband had no choice

404
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,210
but

405
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,120
to take me into the mountains

406
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,700
and make up a rumor about Granny Ghost-face

407
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,060
to keep strangers away.

408
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,770
If he had abandoned me,

409
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,250
I wouldn't have the courage to live in the world.

410
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,120
For my sake,

411
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,410
he gave up many things.

412
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,290
I'm afraid

413
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,920
I won't be able to pay him back forever.

414
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,780
Then we'll stay together forever

415
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,330
as long as you don't hate me.

416
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,770
It's touching.

417
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:33,510
Miss,

418
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,550
can I have a try?

419
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,700
Maybe I can help you recover a bit.

420
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,170
I'm old.

421
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,240
Yi,

422
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,830
I almost forgot something important.

423
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,840
Do you know where the seal is?

424
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,150
Your father will meet His Majesty soon.

425
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,410
If he can't take it out,

426
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,040
his life will be in danger.

427
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,640
The seal?

428
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,050
There are countless seals in our family.

429
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,200
If you don't make it clear,

430
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,740
I don't know which one you want.

431
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,700
The one left by your grandfather.

432
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,069
In that case,

433
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:12,490
I remember it.

434
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,920
OK. OK.

435
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,790
Yi,

436
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,550
this matter concerns the future of the Wen family.

437
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,720

You

441
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,560
didn't make it clear.

442
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,230
Why do you want the seal?

443
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,670
Why will my father be killed

444
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,200
if I do not give you the seal?

445
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,040
If you don't make everything clear,

446
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,000
I won't tell you where it is.

447
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,920
You...

448
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,690
This seal concerns the secret of Feng State.

449
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,020
Think about where is it!

450
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,870
You were

a kind elder just now

452

but you suddenly turned against me.

453

I don't know where it is.

I...

455
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,980
I said I don't know.

456
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,690
I don't know.

457
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,420
How dare you!

Head-changing technique,

463

I mean, makeup technique.

464
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,280
Makeup?

465
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,280
I've taught her how to make up.

466
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:48,910

you don't have to

468
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,560

There are methods to cure over 2000 poisons.

A herb called Phoenix Grass can detoxify all poisons.

475
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,680
However, it's rare.

476
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,110
It's difficult to get it.

477
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,990
It can detoxify all poisons?

There is also sugar cream on the body of the bow.

In that case,

573
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:48,110
this arrow should also be covered with sugar cream.

574
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,620
Your Highness,

575
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,660
there is no sugar cream in the arrow.

576
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,230
Maybe you…

577
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,360
You mean, I painted it afterward, huh?

578
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,470
When Grand Master Ning shouted,

579
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,540
everyone saw

580
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,380
what I did.

581
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,080
I stood there all the time.

582
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,450
As you said,

583
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:26,530
everyone present can testify for Chenyi.

584
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,880
He couldn't shoot an arrow

585
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:32,100
from where he stood.

586
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,230
It's more like...

587
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,590
An assassin!

[A Talented Girl Grows Up]

589
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,370
Your Highness,

590
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,470
this arrow was shot by him.

591
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,840
We'll know

592
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,590
who is behind this.

593
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,270
Who are you?

594
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,810
How dare you assassinate the Crown Prince?

595
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,430
Tell me the truth.

596
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,770
Or

597
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,530

598
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:09,180
No.

599
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:24,660
Grand Master Ning knew the Crown Prince would come here.

600
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,460
But you didn’t send more guards,

601
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,950
causing the assassin to sneak into the mansion

602
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,620
almost leading to the death of the Crown Prince of Feng State.

603
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,640
Grand Master Ning,

604
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,970
do you admit your guilt?

605
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,890
Your Highness,

606
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:40,010
I know my crime is unforgivable.

607
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,590
But please, for the sake of

608
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,570
my contributions to Feng State in all these years,

609

allow me to go to fight at the frontier

610

Grand Master Ning has served two emperors.

613

You've made great contributions.

614
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,000
You have a lot on your plate.

615
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,770
Your mistake is forgivable.

616
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,100
I'll give you a pay penalty

Listen to me.

655
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,040

No, Manyi.

You'll suffer a loss.

669
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,320

on planning the selling process

700
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,690
is novel.

701
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,290
This is called hunger marketing.

702
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:15,170
We need to lower the price to arouse enthusiasm

703
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,900
and make them willing to pay.

704
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,710
Marketing?

705
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:19,740
What does it mean?

706
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,090
It's to make them pay more

707
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,720
but believe they earn a lot.

708
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,710

Thank you. Please continue to support Chenwei.

724
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,400
Not bad.

725
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:54,830
Take it.

726
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,150
Yes, count it.

00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:10,960
Sorry, madam.

I know.

731
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,560
But Miss Manyi,

732
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,990
all the books and comics

733
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,060
are sold out.

734
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,160

My boy.

738
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,670
He admires you very much.

739
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,750
He always said he wanted

740
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,830
to be a talented man adept in both pen and sword like you.

741
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,140
But

742
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,980
he was hit by a carriage

743
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,310
a month ago

744
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,950
and got a leg disease.

745
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:49,490
My son, a good boy,

746
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:52,750
can never stand up again.

747
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,860
Luckily,

748
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,290
every day when he was in pain,

749
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,900
he listened to your story

750
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,340
and got the courage to live.

751
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:07,870
You know,

752
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,750
his birthday is coming.

753
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,950
As his mother,

754
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,580
I want your autograph

757
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,260
I won't break the rules of the bookstore.

758
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:24,410
This is all I have.

00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,830
I can book your next comic.

760
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,730

761
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,520
Please sign it for me.

Madam.

763
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,360
Madam!

764
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,660
