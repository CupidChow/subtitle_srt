[Episode 16]

3
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,710
Tea instead of wine.

4
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:23,700
Manyi,

5
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,650
you're amazing.

6
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,930
Everything is sold out on your opening day.

7
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,260
Even the pre-sale situation is very good.

8
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,289
If this continues,

9
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,430
we'll become Feng State's richest bookstore

10
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,420
in no time.

11
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:37,970
What are you talking about?

12
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,410
The greatest bookstore in Feng State.

13
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,390
You're right, Honey.

14
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:44,729
No matter what we did in the early stages,

15
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,780
what we're after

16
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,770
is to establish a good bookstore.

17
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,479
Brother, don't worry.

18
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,880
I've already planned out Season Two.

19
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,630
Let's have a look.

20
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,550
The first season's star-crossed lovers storyline was heartbreaking enough.

21
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,470
For Season Two,

22
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,150
I want a happy ending

23
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,880
so that lovers can be together.

24
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,760
Is it possible

25
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,000
to let other lovers join in the story?

26
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,180
For example?

27
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,910
For example,

28
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,750
a highly skilled hero

29
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,990
fell in love

30
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,730
with a lovely young lady.

31
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,230
Honey.

32
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,720
I have something to discuss with you.

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,860
Highly skilled?

34
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,910
A young lady?

35
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,550
Honey, what are you drawing?

36
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,990
I'm thinking about the ending of the comic.

37
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,990
Let's defeat the villains together

38
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,650
and have two children.

39
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,400
♫The candle is burning out, the dawn is breaking♫

40
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,030
You are knowledgeable,

41
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,450
so you'll teach them to read and write.

42
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,480
♫The moon knows my thoughts♫

43
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:22,010
I'm good at martial arts,

44
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,200
so let me teach them martial arts.

45
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,750
♫Life is so long, I hope to spend♫

46
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,940
And then?

47
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,000
♫The rest of my life with you♫

48
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,900
Then,

49
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,480
the four of us

50
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,190
will expand the academy

51
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,220
♫It's a long way to go♫

52
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,150
and grow old together.

53
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:42,790
♫May I have a lifelong partner♫

54
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,510
This story

55
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,810
is too perfect.

56
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,550
However,

57
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:42,220
I like it very much.

58
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,660
♫In halcyon days♫

59
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,000

♫The ending is you♫

65
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,240
On the basis

66
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,850
of the Large Seal Script…

67
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:20,680
What's going on?

68
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,070
Who gave you the order?

69
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,830
How dare you come to the academy to make a scene?

70
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,800
It's me.

71
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,680
Why is he here?

72
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,680
What does he want?

73
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,060
Vice Censor-in-Chief Du,

74
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,440
what brings you here today?

75
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,480
Guards!

76
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,710
Arrest Cheng Manyi!

77
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,260
Yes.

78
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:44,870
Wait.

79
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,930
How dare you!

80
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,650
With me here,

81
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,840
let's see which one of you dares.

82
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,310
Do you dare?

83
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,909
What crime did my wife commit?

84
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,190
Rebellion.

85
00:04:59,260 --> 00:04:59,980
What?

86
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,220
How is that possible?

87
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,590
My sister-in-law won't.

88
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,630
The crime of rebellion is too severe an accusation.

89
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,110
You have no evidence.

90
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,620
How can you make such a conclusion?

91
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,110
Whether she rebels or not,

92
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,610
we can see the evidence.

93
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,550
Guards!

94
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,510
Search!

95
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,350
Yes.

96
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,130
Search carefully.

97
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,250
Don't miss any corner.

98
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,230
Found it!

99

Cheng Manyi.

100
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,620
How dare you write a treasonous document?

101
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,510
This is outrageous!

102
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,040
A treasonous document? How is that possible?

103
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,470
The Emperor of Feng State values scholars over warriors

104
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,630
and persecuted warriors,

105
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,830
resulting in an excess of inept officials

106
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,990
and a military lacking in courage and spirit.

107
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,070
If it goes on,

108
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,350
the country will be weak

109
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,430
and will be no match for other countries.

110
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,820
Why don't all warriors join forces to overthrow the emperor

111
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,620
restore the status of warriors?

112
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,250
Now, we have solid evidence.

113
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:02,930

114

Wait.

116

Master,

120
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,830
the truth is right in front of us.

121
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,630
Now, it's more important to sacrifice a pawn to save the chariot.

122
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,190
Cheng Manyi is my wife.

123
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,120
No matter what happens,

124
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,550
I'll face it together with her.

125
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,430

How dare you still deny it?

129
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,100
Someone is framing me.

130
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,900

Your Majesty,

139
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,150
the mark on the document is fake.

140
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,630
My personal seal has already made anti-counterfeit marks.

141
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,850
But you must keep this personal seal.

142
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,740
What if someone copies it?

143
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,090
Don't worry.

144
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,010
Not to mention, my writng of simplified characters

145
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,950
is one of a kind in all of the Feng State.

146

Besides,

147
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,640
I've coated it with alum.

148
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,210

Nice!

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,710
Are you okay?

192
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,030
I'm fine.

193
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,230
Manyi, don't worry.

194
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,240
I will prove your innocence.

195
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,000
I dragged you down.

196
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,360
No.

197
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,650
We are husband and wife.

198
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,070
We

199
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,100
should share weal and woe together.

200
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,710
Go.

201
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,520
Hurry up!

202
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,350
Don't push me.

203
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,850
Do you know who I am?

204
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,480
Father!

205
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:03,950
Father!

206
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:04,510
Mother.

207
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,110
Mother!

208
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,910
Father, Mother.

209
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,510
Yi.

210
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:06,980
Wei.

211
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,350
Father.

212
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,710
Brother.

213
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,630
Are you hurt?

214
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,690
It's all my fault.

215
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,060
My negligence

216
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,030
caused Man Yi to fall victim to treacherous villains

217
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,230
and got you involved.

218
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,860
Where is Manyi?

219
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,130
Where is Manyi?

220
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,440
Where is she?

221
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,590
Wei, I'm here.

222
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,230
Manyi.

223
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,350
Are you okay, Manyi?

224
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,070
I'm fine.

225
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,790
Don't worry. I'm fine.

226
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,010
It won't be easy to harm the Wen family.

227
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,050
His Majesty will definitely tell right from wrong.

228
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,030
Yi,

229
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,340
show the dignity of a scholar.

230
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,830
We can't let them succeed.

231
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,490
Father!

232
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,490
Father! Father!

233
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,050
Father, are you alright?

234
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:41,690
I'm fine.

235
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,800
Manyi. Take care of yourself.

236
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,590
Okay.

237
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,500
Miss Cheng,

238
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,880
Grand Master Ning wants to interrogate you.

239
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,680
Please.

240
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,030
Manyi.

241
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,470
Manyi!

242
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,070
Grand Master,

243
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,320
Cheng Manyi is here.

244
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,780
Cheng Manyi.

245
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,600
I was ordered by His Majesty

246
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,600
to investigate the rebellion case.

247
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,100
Although this case has solid evidence,

248
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,350
I know you well.

249
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,740
You're honest, kind,

250
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,140
and virtuous.

251
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,780
You'd never do such a thing.

252
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,970
Really?

253
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,750
Then, why didn't you

254
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,630
tell His Majesty about my grievances?

255
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,590
I'm ordered to investigate the case.

256
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,430
If I can't find out the truth,

257
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,350
what can I report to His Majesty?

258
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,230
So,

259
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,560
as long as you confess the mastermind,

260
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,250
I can guarantee your safety.

261
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,640
What do you mean?

262
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,900
You and your husband love each other.

263
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,470
I really envy that.

264
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,960
But you're facing the death sentence now.

265
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,430
I advise you to think more for yourself.

266
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,990
Yes.

267
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,930
When disaster strikes,

268
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,670
of course a couple would go their separate ways.

269
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,630
Good.

270
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,590
I admire people like you the most

271
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,590
who know how to judge a situation.

272
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,140
Guards!

273
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,470
Sign this statement of identification.

274
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
How dare you!

275
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,960
Does it look like you?

276
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,230
You're all old foxes.

277
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,940
Don't play dumb with me!

278
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,590
You just want me

279
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,200
to accuse Wen Chenyi of being the mastermind, don't you?

280
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,730
Bah!

281
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,990
No way!

282
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,790
You really won't shed tears

283
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,770
until you see a coffin.

284
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:14,750
Guards!

285
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,160
Start the torture!

286
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,210
Manyi!

287
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:27,690
Manyi!

288
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,160
Manyi!

289
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,310
Manyi. What's wrong?

290
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,470
It's Manyi's voice.

291
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,870
Is Manyi being tortured?

292
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,750
These beasts.

293
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,410
There seems to be no sound.

294
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:37,870
What's going on?

295
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,580
Manyi.

296
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,550
Manyi.

297
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,310
Manyi!

298
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:41,870
Manyi.

299
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:43,410
Manyi!

300
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,600
How are you?

301
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,880
Manyi. Are you okay?

302
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:46,480
Manyi.

303
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,960
Are you okay, Manyi?

304
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,010
Manyi.

305
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,100
Honey.

306
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,430
I'm here.

307
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,450
Did they...

308
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,800
Did they torture you?

309
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:01,830
No.

310
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,710
Just a little

311
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:05,820
cucking stool

312
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,070
and pepper spray.

313
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,740
In my opinion,

314
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,810
the punishment here

315
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,680
is too amateurish.

316
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,930
It's not worth my screaming.

317
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,310
Honey. Honey.

318
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,710
Are you hurt?

319
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:20,920
Is it serious?

320
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,290
I'm fine.

321
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,150
I'm fine.

322
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,160
It's like an ant bit me.

323
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,360
Well,

324
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:36,330
I'm a little sleepy.

325
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,540
I want to take a nap.

326
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,760
Manyi.

327
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,310
Don't fall asleep.

328
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,080
Manyi.

329
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,260
Manyi.

330
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,070
Manyi!

331
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,610
Mr. Wen.

332
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,810
Please.

333
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,350
What did you do?

334
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,070
What on earth did you do?

335
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:21,860
Wen Chenyi,

336
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,300
your wife loves you so much.

337
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,800
She suffered the pain of being apart.

338
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,030
She would rather die than betray you.

339
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,460
Unfortunately, she loves

340
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,590
the wrong person.

341
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,000
How can you bear the pain

342
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,070
and not to scream?

343
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,180
It seems that

344
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,390
you're afraid that Mr. Wen will worry about you.

345
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,110
Cheng Manyi.

346
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,840
You and the Wen family are in the same boat.

347
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,490
I advise you to confess.

348
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,360
Escalate.

349
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:20,570
My Lord,

350
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,760
His Majesty wants to personally interrogate her tomorrow.

351
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,280
Well...

352
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,860
Take her away.

353
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,490
Grand Master Ning.

354
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,530
I know…

355
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,000
everything you do

356
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,230
is to get the seal of the academy.

357
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,270
I can give you the seal,

358
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,090
but I beg you…

359
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,390
I beg you

360
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,910
to let go of Manyi and the Wen family.

361
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,630
It's too late.

362
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,860
Now, the evidence is solid.

363
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,750
When His Majesty convicts you tomorrow,

364
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,440
the Wen family and the seal

365
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,390
will all be mine for the taking.

366
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,770
Wen Chenyi,

367
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,900
you came to your senses too late.

368
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,960
Weren't you

369
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,980
bragging just a few days ago

370
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,380
that you were going to be the first one to defeat me?

371
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,260
But now,

372
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,260
the world is really ever-changing

373
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,770
like a game of chess.

374
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,500
Take him away.

375
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:41,940
Yes.

376
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,750
No need!

377
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,400
I can walk by myself.

378
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,390
Go.

379
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:51,270
Go in.

380
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,220
Yi.

381
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,800
Yi.

382
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:54,620
Brother.

383
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,780
Yi, are you alright?

384
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,240
Brother.

385
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:02,670
Father!

386
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:06,980
Yi.

387
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,930
I know what you want to say.

388
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,609
It's not Manyi's fault

389
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,950
that the Wen family ended up like this.

390
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,599
On the contrary,

391
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,250
we

392
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:23,260
should apologize to her.

393
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,530
We've implicated her.

394
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,310
A man

395
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,530
doesn't fear death.

396
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,280
If the Wen family can't get through this,

397
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,190
it's fate.

398
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,180
It's just that

399
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,150
I've let your mother down.

400
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,300
She

401
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,050
is afraid of pain the most.

402
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,470
And your sister.

403
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,070
She's not married yet.

404
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,090
What are you talking about?

405
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,860
It's the most important that we're together.

406
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,860
Yes.

407
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,110
Father.

408
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,200
I'm not afraid, either.

409
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,750
Besides,

410
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,250
my brother must have a way.

411
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,660
[A Talented Girl Grows Up]

412
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,180
Mr. Wen.

413
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:31,270
Cui Jun.

414
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,990
How did you get in?

415
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,060
Have you forgotten?

416
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,620
I have brothers everywhere.

417
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,440
I drank with the prison guards here several times.

418
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,130
Take a look at

419
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,280
how Manyi is.

420
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,550
Is she okay?

421
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,500
Don't worry. I've checked.

422
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,280
She's fine.

423
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,630
Mr. Wen.

424
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,310
I only have about 15 minutes.

425
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,940
You're going to see His Majesty tomorrow.

426
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,430
Do you have any idea?

427
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,250
We can't just sit and do nothing.

428
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,780
I do have a risky move,

429
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,850
but I need your help.

430
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,840
Okay, go ahead.

431
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,600
Sorry.

432
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,320
I'll be gentler.

433
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:17,870
Manyi.

434
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,830
This ointment is very effective for external injuries.

435
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,170
I'll ask someone

436
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,910
to apply it on your back.

437
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,180
Thank you.

438
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,840
Grand Master Ning

439
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,070
is such a cunning and evil person.

440
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,980
I must report him to Father.

441
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,070
I hope I can see it alive.

442
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,040
Manyi.

443
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,820
As long as you're willing to marry me,

444
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,920
you can live well.

445
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,240
What do you mean?

446
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,280
Actually, I've thought it through.

447
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,070
As long as you divorce Wen Chenyi

448
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,490
and have a fake marriage with me,

449
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,190
then you can get away

450
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,410
as a princess.

451
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,630
As long as you become a member of Feng's royal family,

452
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,340
you won't be disloyal to the imperial power.

453
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,160
The crime of rebellion can be cleared.

454
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,470
Think about it. Manyi.

455
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,820
What are you thinking, Wu?

456
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,320
Brothers become husband and wife.

457
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,640
Don't you feel odd?

458
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,260
But…

459
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,090
this is the only way to save you now.

460
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,010
I know you're doing this for my own good.

461
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,800
Thanks.

462
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:34,000
I believe Wen Chenyi will find a way.

463
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,140
What if he has no other way?

464
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,870
Then, we'll die together.

465
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,040
What's the big deal?

466
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,550
You'd rather die with him

467
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,830
than live with me?

468
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,950
What are you talking about?

469
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,820
We are husband and wife.

470
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,570
We must share weal and woe together.

471
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,300
Wu,

472
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,630
if you really care about me,

473
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,510
do me a favor.

474
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,140
Go ahead.

475
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,110
Honey.

476
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:21,830
Slowly.

477
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:22,850
Sit down.

478
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,130
How are you?

479
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,200
I'm fine.

480
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,430
Let me see.

481
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,170
I'm really okay.

482
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,050
Let me see.

483
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,650
Luckily, I was the one who was tortured.

484
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,450
Otherwise, with your weak body,

485
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,510
how would you be able to bear it?

486
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,230
I'm incompetent.

487
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,880
I failed to protect you.

488
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,290
Honey, I'm sorry.

489
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,330
I'm not afraid of getting hurt.

490
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,080
I'm just afraid

491
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,260
you would be like other couples I saw.

492
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:40,610
When they're in danger,

493
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:45,930
one of them is always doing things harming the other

494
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,940
with the excuse of doing it for the other person's good.

495
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,610
Don't you think

496
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,340
it is ridiculous?

497
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:57,550
Yes.

498
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,850
But I believe you won't.

499
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,220
No matter what happens,

500
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,970
we will bear it together.

501
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,130
You will never let go of my hand.

502
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,720
No.

503
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,460
Right?

504
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,210
I will never let go of your hand.

505
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,890
Honey,

506
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,250
I have an idea.

507
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,520
What a coincidence.

508
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:26,940
Me too.

509
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,230
Illiterate.

510
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,840
The World's Greatest Talented Woman

511
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,840
is illiterate?

512
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,830
How is that possible?

513
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,520
That's ridiculous.

514
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,070
My lady got seriously ill after she won the title

515
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,510
of the World's Greatest Talented Woman.

516
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:43,480
After she woke up, she lost all her talents,

517
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:44,840
including writing.

518
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,210
Even the handwriting on the scrap paper used

519
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,950
for occasional practice was rough, illegible,

520
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,350
and even barely logical.

521
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:58,930
Your Majesty,

522
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,810
you can see the writing on the treasonous document for comparison.

523
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:04,070
It's a symmetrical Feng-style writing.

524
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:07,130
But Manyi's handwriting is simple and rough.

525
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,800
It can prove that she didn't write it.

526
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,020
Yes, Your Majesty.

527
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,240
As for the personal seal,

528
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,320
the day before yesterday, when the bookstore opened,

529
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,000
a customer deliberately

530
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,930
coaxed me to stamp the seal on a piece of blank paper.

531
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,100
Please investigate it, Your Majesty.

532
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,930
I have no intention to rebel.

533
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:30,780
Regarding the treasonous document case,

534
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,630
now, it seems

535
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,460
Cheng Manyi didn't do it.

536
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,200
But we still need to investigate

537
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,380
who the mastermind is.

538
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,140
Your Majesty,

539
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,640
even if the case of the treasonous document has nothing to do

540
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,640
with Cheng Manyi,

541
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:49,670
she just admitted

542
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,070
she pretended to be a talented girl while actually being illiterate.

543
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,590
This act has committed

544
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,070
the crime of deceiving Your Majesty.

545
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,230
According to the law of the Feng State,

546
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,560
she should be executed.

547
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,870
Your Majesty,

548
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,630
according to the laws established by the founding emperor,

549
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,790
martial artists who are illiterate

550
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,140
but pretend to be talented

551
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,890
should be executed.

552
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,510
Anyone who impersonates a talented person

553
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,300
should be executed.

554
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,530
Those deceiving the emperor

555
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:11,150
should be executed.

556
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:13,490
If Cheng Manyi is not executed,

557
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,520
it will violate our ancestral rules

558
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:18,330
and disappointed our people.

559
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,660
That's right.

560
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,330
Here's His Majesty's order.

561
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,880
Cheng Manyi is to be punished for the three crimes combined.

562
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,240
She should be…

563
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,150
Wait!

564
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,940
Father, wait.

565
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,540
We'll know if it's really

566
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,070
disappointing the people.

567
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,190
Son,

568
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,110
what do you mean by that?

569
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,450
Father, look.

570
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,350
This is a petition

571
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:49,350
signed spontaneously by thousands of common people.

572
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,980
His Majesty might

573
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,640
be lenient

574
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,420
for the sake of people's outcry.

575
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,230
Okay, leave it to me.

576
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:57,550
Father.

577
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,220
The people are grateful to her.

578
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,470
She is willing to uphold justice

579
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,620
and solve problems.

580
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:03,950
Manyils been doing her best

581
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,060
and devoting herself to the people,

582
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,370
so the people don't care whether she's illiterate.

583
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,320
Father,

584
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,880
how can you be restrained

585
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,400
by this ruthless system?

586
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,790
Yes, Your Majesty.

587
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,780
You are a wise emperor.

588
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,750
'You are skilled at recognizing and making the best use of talent.

589
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:17,060
I'm sure you'll see that Manyi is warm-hearted.

590
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,920
Please show mercy, Your Majesty.

591
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,910
Your Majesty,

592
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,450
Cheng Manyi lied to you,

593
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:22,840
which is disrespectful.

594
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,210
The Wen family is harboring her,

595
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,320
which is disloyal.

596
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,590
They're so disrespectful and disloyal.

597
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,090
Your Majesty, I beg you

598
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,950
to punish Cheng Manyi and the Wen family severely.

599
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,380
Your Majesty,

600
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,860
the Wen family didn't know

601
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,290
that I was illiterate.

602
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:39,580
Your Majesty,

603
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,130
this has nothing to do with the Wen family

604
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,500
or Cheng Manyi.

605
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,970
It was all done by me.

606
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,460
Wen Chenyi.

607
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,550
What do you mean?

608
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,520
Your Majesty,

609
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,030
I'm guilty.

610
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,950
Since Cheng Manyi got ill

611
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,080
and lost her memory,

612
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,370
I didn't dare to report to you.

613
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,790
Moreover, I was afraid that if she failed in the literary fight,

614
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,480
it would bring shame to Feng.

615
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,030
So, I took the liberty

616
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,850
to hide it from the Wen family and the court

617
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,140
that Cheng Manyi had become illiterate.

618
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,800
I even forced Cheng Manyi to

619
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,050
to sign a Letter of Commitment

620
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,230
to cover up the truth

621
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,500
and deceive the world.

622
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,230
Dongqing.

623
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,540
Give it to me.

624
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,670
[Letter of Commitment]

625
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:27,860
Your Majesty.

626
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,530
Wen Chenyi.

627
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,420
This is the Letter of Commitment.

628
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,970
The Fifth Prince can testify.

629
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:32,820
Give it to me.

630
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,460
Yes.

631
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:34,910
Father,

632
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,580
I can prove the Letter of Commitment is true.

633
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,070
Wen Chenyi and Cheng Manyi

634
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,570
are actually contractual spouses.

635
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,790
Your Majesty, please investigate it.

636
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,400
Although I was in a marriage contract with Wen Chenyi,

637
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:43,980
[Letter of Commitment]

638
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,350
the contract has been terminated.

639
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,870
-We've already…
-We've already divorced.

640
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:54,940
Divorced?

641
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:58,350
[Wen Chenyi and Cheng's Divorce Agreement]

642
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,540
This is the Divorce Agreement.

643
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,910
Yes.

644
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,730
We've won the literary fight.

645
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,350
You are useless to me.

646
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,580
From now on,

647
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,580
we no longer have any relationship.

648
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,400
The Wen family

649
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,920
has nothing to do with you anymore.

650
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,790
Wen Chenyi has taken on the crime of deceiving the emperor.

651
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,880
But Cheng Manyi was always against me.

652
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,300
How can I let her go so easily?

653
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,630
None of them can escape.

654
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,490
Wen Chenyi.

655
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:27,850
All the officials

656
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:30,260
know that you and Cheng Manyi are deeply in love.

657
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,590
What you did

658
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,480
is just to clear her name.

659
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,270
You were

660
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,690
trying to clear her name of treason.

661
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:38,610
Defending her

662
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,960
is the last thing I could do as her husband.

663
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:44,710
Now, the Wen family

664
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,310
is guilty because of her.

665
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:49,230
How can I ignore the safety of my family?

666
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,070
But not long ago,

667
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,860
you were helping her fulfill her dream as a warrior.

668
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,810
Dream?

669
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,260
Catching cats, walking dogs,

670
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,630
or stopping a fight

671
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,630
such trivial matters

672
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,490
are not dreams,

673
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,690
but children's play instead.

674
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,420
I was devoted to teaching and educating,

675
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,670
but she was idle

676
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,470
and caused trouble every day.

677
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,670
We have different ambitions and paths.

678
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:19,660
[Wen Chenyi and Cheng's Divorce Agreement]

679
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,450
How can we continue to be together?

680
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,530
Wen Chenyi,

681
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,910
do you really think I'm a three-year-old child?

682
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:24,050
Dare you say you have no feelings for Cheng Manyi?

683
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,370
Humans are not plants.

684
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,870
I do

685
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,750
have feelings for her.

686
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,800
But those feelings

687
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,160
are not worth mentioning

688
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,290
in front of the Wen family's safety.

689
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,510
Let me ask you one last time.

690
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:56,430
Are you sure you're going to do this?

691
00:29:59,230 --> 00:29:59,930
Yes.

692
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,120
If I had known it would be so hurtful,

693
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,460
I'd rather we had never

694
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,570
known each other.

695
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:15,710
Okay.

696
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,470
Your Majesty, you're wise.

697
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,030
Wen Chenyi is right.

698
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,960
We divorced long ago.

699
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,210
From now on,

700
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,690
I'll cut ties with him.

701
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,360
And I'll have nothing to do

702
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,870
with the Wen family.

703
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:43,790
Report!

704
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:45,840
Your Majesty,

705
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,230
there are many major cases in Jiangnan.

706
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:49,030
There was a robbery in Jiangzhou.

707
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,640
A headless female body was found in Lianzhou.

708
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,990
There are bandits in Fuzhou.

709
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:52,870
Those cases are all very difficult to solve.

710
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:53,740
They're asking for a backup.

711
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,870
Please give your instructions, Your Majesty.

712
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:55,570
Father,

713
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:57,100
Cheng Manyi is very experienced

714
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,270
in solving cases.

715
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,450
How about

716
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,390
pardon her for deceiving you

717
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,690
and allow her to redeem herself?
