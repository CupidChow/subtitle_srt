00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,789
[Episode 2]

3
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,830
I want to go back.

4
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,780
His Majesty appointed you to join the verbal struggle.

5
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,630
All the land belongs to His Majesty.

6
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,230
You won't be able to escape.

7
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,550
You will save me, right?

8
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,100
It's okay

9
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,830
to save you.

10
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:41,840
Really?

11
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,830
As long as I can go back alive,

12
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:47,430
I'll ask the author to add more scenes for you,

13
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,350
like giving many beauties and much wealth to you.

14
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,580
You'll be the treasure of the world.

15
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,640
What nonsense are you talking about?

16
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,520
That's not important.

17
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,170
How are you going to save me?

18
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,229
It will pay

19
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,580
my reputation.

20
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,790
Then, it's not appropriate. Forget it.

21
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,900
Mr. Wen,

22
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,280
you have profound learning

23
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,970
and are kind.

24
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,690
I'm weak, pitiful, lonely, and helpless.

25
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,700
You won't

26
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,030
stand by, right?

27
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,410
You take the initiative to

28
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,570
ask for my help.

29
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,290
I heard you're looking for an ancient painting, right?

30
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,040
Yes. Will you help me look for it?

31
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,590
Yes.

32
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,829
I can kill two birds with one stone.

33
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,740
As long as you come with me to study in the academy,

34
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,170
and do whatever I want you to do,

35
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,130
I'll sacrifice my reputation to play a loving couple with you.

36
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,110
Then, we can keep your illiteracy a secret

37
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,350
and keep you safe.

38
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,300
At the same time,

39
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,000
I'll try to help you look for the painting.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,470
Good.

41
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,770
As long as I can ride your coattails,

42
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,420
others won't suspect that I'm illiterate.

43
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,260
Then, I'll be safe.

44
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,110
Okay.

45
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,350
I

46
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,030
have written down our words on the agreement.

47
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,480
If there is no objection,

48
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,480
we will take it as the written pledge

49
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,710
and never betray it.

50
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,790
Wait, you prepared

51
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,270
it beforehand, huh?

52
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,980
He needs my help

53
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,350
but it seemed like I was begging him.

54
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,530
What a cunning man!

55
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,170
He set a trap for me.

56
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,090
Find the painting for me.

57
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,940
[A Talented Girl Grows Up]

58
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,630
I have never seen this painting.

59
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,380
So strange.

60
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,420
It's

61
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,350
totally different.

62
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,280
But its outline is about like this.

63
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,080
Remember the aspect astrology.

64
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,790
It's a busy road.

65
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,840
It's lovely.

66
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:31,940
My lady.

67
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,290
Young Madam is curious about everything.

68
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,110
Would you like a sugar painting?

69
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,270
I...

70
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,659
Mr. Wen is here.

71
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,230
Is this Mrs. Wen,

72
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,700
the World's Greatest Talented Woman?

73
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,060
Sorry. I didn't recognize you, Mrs. Wen.

74
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,060
What do you want? I'll give it to you for free.

75
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,400
I want this one.

76
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,610
Okay, I'll make it for you right away.

77
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,000
Does everyone know him?

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,820
Feng State has always been thinking highly of scholars rather than warriors.

79
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,800
Young Master is the World's Greatest Scholar.

80
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,460
Everyone respects him.

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,640
Mrs. Wen, your sugar painting is ready.

82
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:13,990
Catch the thief!

83
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,470
Stop! Stop!

84
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,030
Freeze!

85
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:18,900
Go!

86
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,670
Did you see that man?

87
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,680
Yes.

88
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,070
He was caught

89
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,320
and will be punished severely

90
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,490
because he was found

91
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,710
to be illiterate.

92
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,390
Don't be afraid.

93
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,220
I will protect you.

94
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:47,250
Go away. Warriors are not welcome.

95
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,970
Go away!

96
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,390
What are you doing?

97
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,790
Go away.

98
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,430
Please come in, gentlemen.

99
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,230
What did they drive them away?

100
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,690
Do they think warriors are not respectable?

101
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,180
That's because

102
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,830
some scholars have booked the whole place.

103
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,780
Why are people divided into different classes?

104
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,960
Why a talented person is superior?

105
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,870
Isn't his life

106
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,600
supported by ordinary people?

107
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,720
Besides, we need warriors to protect our country.

108
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,950
If there is an attack from outside,

109
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,210
can we defeat enemies by reciting poems?

110
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,240
Everyone is born equal, and there must be a use for their talent.

111
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,350
That makes sense.

112
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,500
It's going to rain.

113
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,710
Jiaobai.

114
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,060
Yes.

115
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,990
Come with me to buy umbrellas.

116
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:39,560
Okay.

117
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,710
My lady, let's go.

118
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,690
Miss, take a look.

119
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,630
Sir, do you have

120
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,670
rare

121
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,190
and precious ancient paintings?

122
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,070
Are you one of those who are looking for the treasure of Feng State?

123
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,070
Give up as soon as possible.

124
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,530
The saying that whoever gets the treasure will rule the world

125
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,010
is just a rumor.

126
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,440
What treasure?

127
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,420
I just want to buy ancient paintings.

128
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,510
Paintings?

129
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,310
I have all kinds of paintings.

130
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,870
Pick whatever you want.

131
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,310
Du Yaqin is elegant

132
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,830
and attractive.

133
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,150
Du Yaqin is elegant

134
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,590
and attractive.

135
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,950
Du Yaqin is elegant

136
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,300
and attractive.

137
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,710
Du Yaqin is elegant

138
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,990
and attractive.

139
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,360
Du Yaqin is elegant

140
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,659
and attractive.

141
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,490
It turns out that there's an ancient fan culture.

142
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,690
She is a celebrity of the ancient times.

143
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,630
Who is Du Yaqin?

144
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:46,760
She is the daughter of Vice Censor-in-Chief Du.

145
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,590
She is

146
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,840
from a noble family.

147
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,110
She is charming

148
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,290
and talented.

149
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,750
She's named as the World's Second Talented Woman.

150
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,550
The second.

151
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,590
The World's Second Talented Woman?

152
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,810
I read it in the comic prologue.

153
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,930
She was defeated by Cheng Manyi.

154
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,460
Du Yaqin is elegant

155
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,980
and attractive.

156
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,350
Du Yaqin is elegant

157
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,750
and attractive.

158
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,070
Du Yaqin is elegant

159
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,450
and attractive.

160
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,770
Du Yaqin is elegant

161
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,190
and attractive.

162

Du Yaqin is elegant

163
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,510
Miss Manyi.

164
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,669
and attractive.

165
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:34,270
Didn't Wen go with you?

166
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:35,830
He...

167
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,090
He has something to do.

168
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,960
I used to call him Wen.

169
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,130
I blurted it out just now.

170
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,530
Do you mind it?

171
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,750
No.

172
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,620
Great.

173
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,950
After, we had a relationship

174
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,630
but we were fated to be apart.

175
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,840
Sorry, I said something wrong again.

176
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,240
Don't get me wrong.

177
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,540
Never mind.

178
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,310
Manyi, what is this painting?

179
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,700
Please lend it to me.

180
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,770
Give it back.

181
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,710
Let me see it.

182
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,240
How dare you treat Fairy Yaqin so rude?

183
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:18,600
You...

184
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,620
You must have had the evil intention out of jealousy.

185
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,710
We'll seek justice for Fairy Yaqin.

186
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,570
What does this have to do with My Lady?

187
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,580
It was Du Yaqin who provoked

188
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,890
us.

189
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,650
Wen,

190
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,150
please don't blame Miss Manyi.

191
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,080
I believe

192

She is so insidious

195

Master and Madam picked the right girl.

381
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,250
Have you read all the ancient books I gave you?

382
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,130
Have you memorized

383
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,920
all the poems?

384
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,470
I think

385
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,470
it's time to check your studies.

386
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,430
Jiaobai, huh?

387
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,480
Young Mater,

388
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,010
I said nothing. I...

389
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,490
[Wen's Mansion]

390
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,130
Why is there a chicken?

391
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,990
My lady, you're awake.

392
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,980
Who did this?

393
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:09,570
Young Master.

394
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,210
Where is he? I will beat him.

395
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,190
You have to wait for Young Master

396
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,640
to come back from the academy.

397
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,310
By the way, My lady,

398
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,370
today is the first day of the academy.

399
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:19,660
Oh no.

400
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,290
I forgot about this.

401
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,290
Oh no.

402
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,000
Wen Chenyi will kill me.

403
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:27,630
My lady,

404
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:31,540
wait for me. I'll go with you.

405
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:32,400
No need.

406
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,500
Luckily, I'm prepared.

407
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,810
Hurry up, Dongqing, tell me

408
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,040
where is the academy?

409
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,000
Go out and turn right.

410
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,030
[Wen's Mansion]

411
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,700
It's time to show my real skills.

412
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,440
Sorry. Excuse me.

413
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,740
Sorry.

414
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,900
Excuse me.

415
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,520
There's no taxi.

416
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,620
It's really a hard time.

417
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,390
Assassin!

418
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,180
Stop!

419
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:26,170
How dare you! Surrender now!

420
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,300
Miss,

421
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,090
the way you attract me is so unique.

422
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,770
I like it very much.

423
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,550
It's a misunderstanding.

424
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,210
I'm just a passerby.

425
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,260
Bye.

426
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,700
Miss, where do you want to go?

427
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,670
His clothes

428
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,220
looks exactly like mine.

429
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,470
Is

430
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:59,710
he also a student of the World's Greatest Academy?

431
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,670
I know who you are.

432
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,520
I'm a student of the World's Best Academy.

433
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,050
A student from the World's Greatest Academy.

434
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,420
Why are you laughing?

435
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,840
Am I wrong?

436
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,500
Yes.

437
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,350
Do you know who I am?

438
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,330
Who are you?

439
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,790
I'm your teacher's wife.

440
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,190
You're so funny.

441
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,040
I'm serious.

442
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,680
I'm Wen Chenyi's wife.

443
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:27,990
Mr. Wen's wife?

444
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,710
But I heard that

445
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,530
Mr. Wen married

446
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,250
an intelligent, virtuous, and talented woman.

447
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,510
What you did just now

448
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,860
is totally different from a talented woman.

449
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,470
I was

450
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:44,460
testing a new means of transportation.

451
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,320
And then?

452
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,790
If Mr. Wen finds out that

453
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,130
you reject to let me off, and I'm late because of you,

454
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,400
I'll let you fail the exam at the end of the year.

455
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,930
What are you talking about?

456
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:57,040
I'm saying you'll be in big trouble.

457
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,800
Ask your men to move their swords away.

458
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,420
I'm going to the academy.

459
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,160
You're so funny.

460
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:08,020
Initially, I wanted to give you a ride.

461
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,270
But if you insist on going alone,

462
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,150
then go ahead.

463
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,060
Leave now.

464
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:13,670
Yes.

465
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:14,550
Yes.

466
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,910
In that case,

467
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,630
I'll give you a chance.

468
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,060
Let's go now.

469
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,550
[World's Greatest Academy]

470
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,500
He is coming.

471
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,960
Who?

472
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,570
So handsome.

473
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,350
He's Helen of Troy.

474
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,540
Mr. Wen.

475
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,560
You changed your uniforms without permission.

476
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,960
Copy the rules ten times.

477
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,150
I wrote a poem.

478
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,610
Mr. Wen, please read it.

479
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,680
The autumn rain goes on and on.

480
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,000
Cicadas are constantly singing.

481
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,540
I want to express my love.

482
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,320
No good.

483
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,280
You didn't even learn the rhyme

484
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,510
let alone the artistic conception.

485
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,580
Mr. Wen.

486
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,750
Mr. Wen is married.

487
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,380
Why didn't you

488
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,730
come to the academy with Cheng Manyi?

489
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,400
My wife

490
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,560
is not feeling well.

491
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,080
So...

492
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,160
She is coming.

493
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,420
Is that Cheng Manyi's carriage?

494
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,700
Another Helen of Troy.

495
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,810
Welcome.

496
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,830
Okay.

497
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:53,500
I know I'm extraordinary today,

498
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,030
but please

499
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,040
do not stare at me.

500
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,430
Goddess.

501
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:59,380
Goddess.

502
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,470
Goddess.

503
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,300
Goddess.

504
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,200
You are incredibly talented.

505
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,120
You are Cheng Manyi, an outstanding woman.

506
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,600
Why did Mrs. Wen and the Fifth Prince

507
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,450
come in the same carriage?

508
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,060
They just got married.

509
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,760
But now Cheng Manyi is flirting with another man.

510
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,960
Mr. Wen

511
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,970
is really unlucky.

512
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,130
Manyi is carefree

513
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,150
and doesn't care about trifles.

514
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,810
How can you make wild guesses?

515
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,220
That's right, guys.

516
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,320
Don't misunderstand that

517
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,720
the Fifth Prince and Cheng Manyi

518
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,230
are too intimate.

519
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,380
Cheng Manyi is married to Mr. Wen.

520
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,730
If you keep spreading gossip, it will damage their reputation.

521
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:44,220
You...

522
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,360
What a tragedy!

523
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,620
This couple is not harmonious.

524
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,420
What a sin!

525
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,350
Forget it. I'll help you

526
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,690
in case you want to break the contract.

527
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,820
I'm going all out.

528
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,110
Honey,

529
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,230
did you forget that

530
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,360
last night,

531
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:10,790
we talked about the philosophy of life, poetry, and so on.

532
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,050
You promised that

533
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:16,530
you would never go apart from me

534
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,510
till the doomsday.

535
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,600
Why didn't you wake me up in the morning?

536
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,770
I almost got late.

537
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,720
You were tired last night.

538
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,650
I wanted you to sleep more.

539
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,080
But why were you in the same carriage with the Fifth Prince?

540
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,070
Fifth Prince? Who?

541
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,540
He is the Fifth Prince, Feng Qiwu.

542
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:46,240
What's wrong with having a ride with a classmate?

543
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,040
Du Yaqin,

544
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,090
why did you have such a

545
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:50,900
dirty thought?

546
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,280
What?

547
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,380
What are you talking about?

548
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,940
You just got off the carriage

549
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,870
but you pretended not to know Feng Qiwu.

550
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,720
Is your love for Mr. Wen

551
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,310
true?

552
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,410
None of your business.

553
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,630
Mr. Wen,

554
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,760
you've only known each other for a few days.

555
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,190
I'm just worried that you were cheated.

556
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,740
A few days?

557
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,000
Actually, we've been in love for a long time.

558
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,370
I still remember that years ago,

559
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,290
when we met by the Dafeng Lake,

560
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,900
he fell in love with me at first sight.

561
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:33,760
Then, he pursued me for months

562
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,790
before I agreed to be with him.

563
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,650
But there was a "green tea",

564
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:43,060
who

565
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,020
showed up to ruin our relationship.

566
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,130
How could "green tea" harm people?

567
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,230
It

568
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,640
describes someone

569
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:55,940
that looks fresh, like green tea

570
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,280
but actually,

571
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,620
she's a bitch.

572
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,170
Anyway,

573
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,660
I was so smart

574
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,400
that I revealed her evil mind

575
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,630
hidden under her innocent appearance.

576
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,360
Then,

577
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,680
we got married.

578
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,230
The end.

579
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,940
You're indeed extraordinary.

580
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,430
Your sentences are novel.

581
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:25,090
What a romantic story.

582
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,930
I think

583
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,910
you just made

584
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,440
this ridiculous story up.

585
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,660
My brother and Manyi are deeply in love.

586
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,510
They are a good match.

587
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,510
Stop slandering them.

588
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:35,790
Chenwei,

589
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,850
I'm just worried about the Wen family.

590
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,080
Why are you so aggressive?

591
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,150
Thank you for

592
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,620
alienating my brother and sister-in-law.

593
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,160
I...

594
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,500
I didn't.

595
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,140
Yaqin is kind-hearted.

596
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,930
After all, we are classmates.

597
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,780
Enough.

598
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,130
I guess I have to use my ultimate skill.

599
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,810
Or I can't end it.

600
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,570
I can make up stories.

601
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,160
But can I make this up?
