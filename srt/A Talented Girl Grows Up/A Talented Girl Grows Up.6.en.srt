[Episode 6]

3
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,150
Guys, move!

4
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,270
Yes.

5
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:19,320
Cheng Manyi!

6
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,120
Like this.

7
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,430
Arms outstretched.

8
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,320
No good.

9
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,130
Put your hands on your hip.

10
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,850
To the left.

11
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,470
To the right.

12
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:42,920
No good.

13
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,940
The other side.

14
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,250
Turn around.

15
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,520
Turn. Faster.

16
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,240
I really...

17
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,470
Today, Young Madam

18
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,670
suddenly asked me about your birthday.

19
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,080
I wonder what she wants.

20
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,550
She went through so much trouble

21
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,829
and played tricks.

22
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,780
Turns out she's preparing a birthday gift for me.

23
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,030
I'll pretend that I don't know

24
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,980
so that her effort won't be in vain.

25
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,080
The best color is dark green,

26
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,910
which is elegant and luxurious.

27
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,630
The bamboo pattern

28
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,370
shows the dignity

29
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,960
and character of a scholar.

30
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,730
And the blue shirt style works well.

31
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:25,940
Honey,

32
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,150
what do you think?

33
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,030
Very good.

34
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,790
Boss, make it his size.

35
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,270
Make the design as he mentioned as soon as possible.

36
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,180
Okay.

37
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,850
[A Talented Girl Grows Up]

38
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,950
Manyi. Look.

39
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,430
This robe should only be in heaven.

40
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,370
You can't see it many times in the mortal world.

41
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,840
It turns out that it was only my wishful thinking.

42
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,040
It looks better than the ones made in the palace.

43
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,020
I did it for others' benefit.

44
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,420
Manyi.

45
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,170
You have extraordinary taste.

46
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,630
Look. Isn't it beautiful?

47
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,660
Is it beautiful?

48
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Today, we're going to learn "Discourse on Politics."

49
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,470
Why do you have this robe?

50
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,310
What?

51
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,630
Why do you have this robe?

52
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,570
This robe?

53
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,060
I saw you and Mr. Wen

54
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,780
went to the garment-making shop.

55
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,810
I found the fabric you chose was very good.

56
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,550
So, I bought the same one at a high price.

57
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,520
Look.

58
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,040
I hope that you can…

59
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,230
Do I look good?

60
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,580
You're so annoying.

61
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,280
you can…

62
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,420
Doesn't it look good with this piece?

63
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,950
Does it look good?

64
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,010
You're so annoying.

65
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,030
Put it down.

66
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,870
Manyi. You have good taste.

67
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,550
Help me with my shopping in the future.

68
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,870
The academy is the place to learn knowledge

69
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,670
and get enlightened.

70
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,310
Our clothes shouldn't be too luxurious.

71
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,100
For one thing, you won't fit in;

72
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,800
for another, it will encourage a sense of competition.

73
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,390
I hope the student to my left

74
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,790
can change his robe.

75
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,080
Mr. Wen is talking to you.

76
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,390
To me?

77
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,550
Mr. Wen is right.

78
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,750
I'll change it now.

79
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,490
Focus on your class.

80
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,480
[Sorry]

81
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,390
Since you don't want to study

82
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,900
or make progress,

83
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,890
our contract will be canceled.

84
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:54,190
I'm sorry, okay?

85
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:57,710
You look handsome.

86
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,620
You're upright and kind.

87
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,900
I can't even praise you for your kindness.

88
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,390
It's said that no one is perfect.

89
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,590
Nonsense!

90
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,000
You're an exception!

91
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:10,110
You won't make things difficult for me,

92
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,230
a poor and helpless girl, will you?

93
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,840
That contract...

94
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,740
It is still valid.

95
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,960
I was just being angry.

96
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,270
A gentleman never goes back on his word.

97
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,640
Manyi.

98
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,150
Why are you here?

99
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,570
What a coincidence. You also want to climb over the wall?

100
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,740
We don't have to attend the elective course this afternoon.

101
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,620
Right?

102
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,140
I agree with you.

103
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,660
I always wanted to skip the elective course.

104
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,530
Manyi.

105
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,440
More.

106
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,650
Stand still.

107
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,870
Stand still.

108
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,250
Up, up, up.

109
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,270
Okay?

110
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,500
Yes.

111
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,960
Manyi. You've left?

112
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,420
What about me?

113
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,370
Manyi!

114
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,060
Young Master, bad news!

115
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,440
Why are you so nervous?

116
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:36,640
I saw Young Madam

117
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,080
going shopping with the Fifth Prince.

118
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,990
They were even chatting and laughing.

119
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,590
Whether she'll cheat on you

120
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,590
depends on this.

121
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:44,820
This is a serious matter.

122
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,020
I dare not neglect it.

123
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,910
Young Master, you must be strong.

124
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:02,890
Hang in there.

125
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,630
Let's go. I'll get changed and take me there.

126
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,300
Let's go.

127
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,030
Take a look.

128
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:12,990
This is not bad.

129
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:13,790
It looks good.

130
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,350
Young Master.

131
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:14,870
Take a look.

132
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,200
Didn't Young Madam make that robe for you?

133
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,380
Why is the Fifth Prince wearing it?

134
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,760
That's because

135
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,590
I really don't like that robe.

136
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,270
Young Madam insisted on giving it to me,

137
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,810
but I still refused her.

138
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,620
But she thought it'd be a waste,

139
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,150
so she sold it to the Fifth Prince.

140
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,710
I knew it.

141
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,110
Young Madam can't spend your money

142
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,429
and bring you to buy clothes for others.

143
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,110
Young Master, are you going to change?

144
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,820
It's raining heavily.

145
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,630
Let's go back first.

146
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,550
No.

147
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,650
Keep following them.

148
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,810
I want to see

149
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,940
what outrageous things they're going to do.

150
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,010
Let's go.

151
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,510
Young Master.

152
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,160
They went into an out-of-the-way alley.

153
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,670
Young Master, hang in there.

154
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,700
Don't lose your manners.

155
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,480
That's right. Let's go.

156
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,300
Let's go.

157
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,570
It's intolerable.

158
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,150
Young Master, at this point,

159
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,960
seeing is believing.

160
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,600
They are doing nothing.

161
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,700
How is the carriage?

162
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,800
Not bad.

163
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,390
It's quite solid.

164
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,190
It's not a problem to carry five or six people.

165
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,330
Ordinary people can't

166
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,480
afford this kind of carriage.

167
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,620
But in the capital,

168
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,070
the noble lords

169
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,380
and wealthy landlords

170
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,510
all have carriages.

171
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,990
We can get them all.

172
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,020
Okay.

173
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,170
Okay?

174
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,810
As long as there are enough carriages,

175
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,460
we won't worry about having no business.

176
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,400
Look.

177
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,390
The Feng State is peaceful and prosperous.

178
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,760
Clothing, food, and shelter are all provided for the common people.

179
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,530
The only thing they lack is convenient transportation.

180
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,580
People can't afford a carriage,

181
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,370
but they can afford the fare of riding one.

182
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,000
As long as we can seize the market share,

183
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:16,310
we can solve most students' commuting problems

184
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,590
and can also make use of idle carriages.

185
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,070
It's a very profitable business.

186
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,190
Great, Manyi.

187
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,720
Thank you.

188
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,660
We played a trick on Vice Censor-in-Chief Du,

189
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,550
and he really went to tell my father.

190
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,510
My father docked my salary for three months.

191
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,150

00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,190
Okay, I'll keep it.

377
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,540
I'll listen to you.

378
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,800
It's gonna rain. I'm leaving.

379
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,510
Manyi.

380
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,950
I have something to do later.

381
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,520
I can't see you off.

382
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,420
Liu, see Manyi off.

383
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,200
This way, please.

384
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,400
Okay.

385
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:51,740
Let's go.

386
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,290
Come with me.

387
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,590
Miss Cheng, if you want to play,

388
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,490
go by yourself.

389
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,080
I won't accompany you.

390
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,470
Are you going or not?

391
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:32,870
No.

392
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,100
I know you've had a lot of grievances with me recently,

393
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,970
but I have my reason.

394
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,450
Reason?

395
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,210
Is it because I'm too strict with you

396
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,060
or because I couldn't play around with you?

397
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,670
So…

398
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,070
My reason is you.

399
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,590
Me?

400
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,540
Do you want to know why?

401
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:10,170
♫Happy birthday to you♫

402
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:15,040
♫Happy birthday to you♫

403
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,210
♫I wish you the same happiness♫

404
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,790
♫Every year and every day♫

405
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,020
♫Congratulations♫

406
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,820
♫Congratulations♫

407
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,630
Wen Chenyi, happy birthday.

408
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,020
You prepared this for me?

409
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:38,760
Do you like it?

410
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,870
I made you kneel in the ancestral hall

411
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,830
and got a cough.

412
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,890
I feel bad about it.

413
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,670
Mother told me

414
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,720
you had never celebrated your birthday.

415
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,510
So, I thought I could

416
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,950
celebrate your birthday for the first time as compensation.

417
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,670
I wanted to make you a robe,

418
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,810
but...

419
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,780
Isn't the robe

420
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,080
for the Fifth Prince?

421
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,130
The fabric you chose was very good.

422
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:11,920
So, I bought the same one at a high price.

423
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,260
I couldn't give it to you because he has the same one.

424
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,760
It is still in my room.

425
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,800
So I used Yuber to raise money

426
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,590
to prepare these for you.

427
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,050
Look at this.

428
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,650
Wei said

429
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:37,270
Vice Censor-in-Chief Du is the worst to the Wen family.

430
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,220
So, I specially made this.

431
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,240
If he makes you angry,

432
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,160
you can hit him.

433
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,370
Vice Censor-in-Chief Du.

434
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,120
-Hit him!
-Hit him!

435
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,750
Beat him to vent your anger.

436
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,550
Indeed. It's all him!

437
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,530
What about these?

438
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,670
These? Aren't you weak?

439
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,670
These are for you to exercise.

440
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,350
When I'm gone one day,

441
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,620
if you are in danger,

442
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,360
you can at least run away.

443
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,870
I'll teach you how to use them.

444
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,750
Wait.

445
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,920
Why would you be gone?

446
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,370
I...

447
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:17,780
I have to go to the toilet and go shopping.

448
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,260
Don't think too much.

449
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,940
Come here.

450
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,590
Let me teach you how to make a wish first.

451
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,340
Later,

452
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,950
put your hands together like me.

453
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:31,390
Close your eyes and make a wish.

454
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,350
And then, blow out the candles.

455
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,670
This way, your wish will come true.

456
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,920
This custom is unique.

457
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,260
Try it.

458
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,680
Happy birthday!

459
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,990
Thank you, Manyi.

460
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,080
You're welcome.

461
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:14,030
Now, start enjoying your birthday party.

462
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,990
These are all raw.

463
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,140
How can we eat those?

464
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,880
Here.

465
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,690
Thank you.

466
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,020
That's called a skewer.

467
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,570
You don't need chopsticks.

468
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:45,970
Skewer?

469
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,690
You have to

470
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,070
take one

471
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,130
and eat like this.

472
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,470
That's what makes you feel good.

473
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,270
Delicious.

474
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,990
I misunderstood you before.

475
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,030
I thought you just wanted to have fun,

476
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,560
and I punished you on purpose.

477
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,130
Actually, I...

478
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,640
Then, apologize with wine.

479
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,310
Fine.

480
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,050
It was all my fault.

481
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,010
Please forgive me, Heroin Cheng.

482
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,110
Hurry.

483
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:27,910
Okay.

484
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:28,590
Eat more.

485
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,040
Cheers.

486
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,130
Delicious.

487
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:46,590
Who is it?

488
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,590
Thief! Don't run!

489
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,990
Tell me who you are. What are you doing here?

490
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:58,250
Manyi!

491
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:58,790
Stop!

492
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,460
Don't chase a desperate enemy!

493
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,920
In case there's an ambush.

494
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:08,670
What is that thief doing here in the middle of the night?

495
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,520
Stealing?

496
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,280
Poisoning?

497
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,350
Murder?

498
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,480
You still have the mood to drink tea?

499
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,340
Are you really not worried at all?

500
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,840
I'm used to it.

501
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:25,890
What do you mean?

502
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:29,010
The Wen family was often visited by intruders at night.

503
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,140
Their purpose is

504
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,230
to steal the seal of the academy.

505
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,530
So, the mastermind

506
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,550
has been targeting the Wen family and the academy

507
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,910
in order to

508
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,190
get the seal?

509
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:47,060
Normally, according to the dramas,

510
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,670
this seal must be a treasure

511
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,430
with a big secret hidden in it.

512
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,970
It's my fault.

513
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,040
I failed to find the seal.

514
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,700
Please spare my life, My Lord!

515
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,490
Father, please calm down.

516
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:01,940
In my opinion,

517
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,130
we should start with Cheng Manyi.

518
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,170
What do you mean?

519
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,730
Tomorrow is Double Seventh Day.

520
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,860
According to the tradition of the Feng State,

521
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,910
Mr. Wen

522
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:15,810
will write the dedication on the Double Seventh Lantern Festival

523
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,690
and stamp it.

524
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,150
In that case,

525
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:24,620
tomorrow is a good chance to take action.

526
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,320
We can use Cheng Manyi

527
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,040
to distract them

528
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,950
and take the chance to get the seal

529
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,410
so that we can report to the noble one.

530
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:38,500
Then, the World's Greatest Academy...

531
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,710
And Mr. Wen…

532
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,090
Will all belong to

533
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,820
the Du family.

534
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,370
[Wen's Mansion]

535
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,890
What are you doing?

536
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:02,640
I specially prepared these for you.

537
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,110
Do you like delicacies

538
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,100
antiques,

539
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,890
or my…

540
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,090
recent homework.

541
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,690
Just say what you want.

542
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,540
You're scaring me.

543
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,920
Let's go.

544
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,180
I haven't been late or going home early recently.

545
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:27,040
I wrote so much that I even have calluses on my hands.

546
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,430
Aren't your calluses on your hand

547
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,500
from practicing martial arts??

548
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:35,980
That's not important.

549
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,400
What matters is

550
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:43,300
Dongqing said it's a kind of festival today.

551
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,580
Can you give me a day off?

552
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,570
Balancing work and rest is the key to success, right?

553
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,840
Wen Iceberg!

554
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:00,540
It's useless to beg you.

555
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,310
Why don't you get changed?

556
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:06,120
Today is Double Seventh Day, the most fun festival in the Feng State。

557
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,780
I've already prepared a plan for you to have fun.

558
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,060
You'll miss it if you're late.

559
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,260
Dongqing, bring me the uniform!

560
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,950
Magpies gather in the sky,

561
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,760
and people meet each other in the mortal world.

562
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,510
Every year at the Double Seventh Festival,

563
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,660
the male students will air their scriptures

564
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,000
to pray to be uncorrupted.

565
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,970
As for female students, they will make Qiao cake

566
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,360
and pray to Lady Qiao

567
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,240
for their wishes to be granted.

568
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,690
On the night of the festival,

569
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,270
people who are in love

570
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,560
will date at the Double Seventh Festival

571
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,710
for good luck.

572
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:42,450
That is the custom of the Double Seventh Day.

573
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,110
What is this?

574
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,790
This is Qiao cake I mentioned.

575
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,400
Qiao cake?

576
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,640
Smells good.

577
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:56,040
It's fun to experience the traditional customs,

578
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,200
but I didn't prepare anything.

579
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,270
Jiaobai.

580
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:01,710
Coming.

581
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,370
Be careful.

582
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,660
This… Is it for me?

583
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,360
Young Madam, be careful.

584
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,820
No ordinary person can carry this Qiao cake.

585
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,140
Mr. Wen knows you so well.

586
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,720
He especially had this made for you

587
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,150
the night before yesterday.

588
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,210
Not bad.

589
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,790
You're always reliable at critical moments.

590
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:31,180
But is Lady Qiao really so effective?

591
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,900
If you pray sincerely,

592
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,520
your wishes will be granted.

593
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,990
Does Young Madam want to pray

594
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,850
for a happy marriage with you, Young Master?

595
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,730
Lady Qiao,

596
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,260
I don't ask a happy marriage from you,

597
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:46,830
but please make me rich overnight!

598
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,960
Coming true!

599
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,940
It's coming true!

600
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,630
What was I hoping for?

601
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:08,350
Pay attention to stitches, cutting, and color coordination.

602
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:12,500
The Qiao Dress decides whether you can

603
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,390
amaze everyone present

604
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,900
at the Double Seventh Lantern Festival

605
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,500
and find your Mr. Right.

606
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,830
Forget it. Nothing is difficult in the world

607
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,060
as long as you give up.

608
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:35,750
Manyi, don't be discouraged.

609
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,280
A person with both talent and beauty

610
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,240
needs no adornment from clothing.

611
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,170
That makes sense.

612
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,420
The graceful beauty stands tall, herself being a match to a group.

613
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:49,120
Unparalleled in elegance — Du Yaqin.

614
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,820
She wears a robe of radiant clouds,

615
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,540
with an emerald adornment between her brows.

616
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:01,670
That's what you'd expect from Du Yaqin, the Feng State's No. 1 Beauty.

617
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:10,620
Is this the Qiao Dress you made

618
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:13,050
for the Double Seventh Lantern Festival?

619
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,100
It suits you well.

620
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,870
Don't jump to conclusions yet.

621
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,810
This is just the beginning.

622
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,820
Just wait, and you'll be amazed.

623
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,420
I'll wait and see.

624
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,290
Manyi.

625
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:27,860
Do you have any idea?

626
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,280
No.

627
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:30,810
I was just bluffing.

628
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,590
But I can't lose in terms of momentum.

629
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,610
But what should we do?

630
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:40,010
Why don't I give my Qiao Dress

631
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:40,710
to you?

632
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,370
You look better in this dress.

633
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:58,970
It's time to improve Feng State's aesthetics.
