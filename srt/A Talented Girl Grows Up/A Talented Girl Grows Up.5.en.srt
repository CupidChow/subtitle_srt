I can't play the song I love anymore.

188
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,390
I'm useless.

189
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,320
Honey.

190
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,460
Does it still hurt?

191
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:30,900
No.

192
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,480
It doesn't hurt anymore.

193
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,240
Is she having a sweet dream again?

194
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,550
Your Highness.

195
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,080
I got a jade pendant yesterday

196
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,980
which looks exactly the same

197
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,710
as yours.

198
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,350
So I brought it to show you.

199
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,870
Yes, it's mine.

200
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,930
I lost it a few days ago.

201
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,820
Fortunately, it was found by you.

202
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,370
It was lost?

203
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,520
Did you lose it on the saddle?

204
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,630
You're so heavy. Come on!

205
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,120
What saddle?

206
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,150
I have never seen any saddle.

207
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,440
Don't make assumptions

208
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,450
if you have no evidence.

209
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:15,250
I will report what happened yesterday to His Majesty

210
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,400
and ask His Majesty to make a decision.

211
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,050
Your Highness.

212
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,150
The qin playing meeting is about to begin.

213
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,030
Please.

214
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,790
[Enjoying Qin Pavilion]

215
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,520
It is about to begin.

216
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,030
We're waiting.

217
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,100
Come here.

218
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,210
Take a good seat.

219
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,170
Are you nervous?

220
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,190
I am excited.

221
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,450
I am too excited to wait any longer.

222
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,710
Mr. Zhang, come here.

223
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,280
Everyone, it's an honor

224
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,550
have you, talented scholars and intellectuals, here today.

225
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,310
This meeting is honored by your presence.

226
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:12,840
The qin playing meeting starts now.

227
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:17,500
Let's welcome Cheng Manyi, the World's Greatest Talented Woman.

228
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,940
She'll play the qin now.

229
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,360
Bravo! Bravo!

230
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,590
Young Madam, come on!

231
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,670
Please bring the qin here.

232
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,260
What are they doing?

233
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,110
I'm afraid an ordinary qin is not good enough for you to play.

234
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,670
It might affect your performance.

235
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,940
That's why I asked people to look for these qin with high quality.

236
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,170
They all have beautiful sounds. Feel free to choose.

237
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,430
Vice Censor-in-Chief Du, you're really considerate.

238
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,490
There's more.

239
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:58,870
Guards!

240
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,570
Who is he?

241
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,170
I'm afraid someone might get hurt or feel uncomfortable while playing the qin.

242
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,050
So I asked a famous doctor

243
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,400
to prepare the medicine and provide first aid here.

244
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,200
Please play the qin.

245
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,470
Miss Cheng, please.

246
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:27,230
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

247
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,090
Guards, put down the curtains around.

248
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,890
Mr. Wen, why?

249
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,070
Vice Censor-in-Chief Du, let me explain it to you. My wife is introverted.

250
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,860
She is surrounded by many talented people here.

251
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,920
I'm afraid she might feel uncomfortable.

252
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,680
If the gauze can be put down,

253
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,110
she will have no worry to play the qin here.

254
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,580
We will wait for her outside.

255
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,240
It's like seeing the moon in the water and enjoying the flowers amid the mist.

256
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,510
Isn't it wonderful?

257
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,950
What Miss Cheng is playing is a traditional yet beautiful song.

258
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:45,370
It sounds as beautiful as shattering jade and dew-weeping lotuses.

259
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,170
That's right.

260
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:52,430
Impossible. She can't play the qin.

261
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,600
There must be something wrong inside.

262
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,210
Why can't it be possible?

263
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,700
I'll take a look.

264
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,430
Will there be anything wrong?

265
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,520
Let's see who's playing the qin.

266
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,270
Gosh, you scared me.

267
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,760
Sorry.

268
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,540
Brother, look.

269
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,819
This is the map of the Enjoying Qin Pavilion that Cui Jun and I drew

270
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:30,110
according to the proportion.

271
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:35,700
That's great. It is like a fortress.

272
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:37,300
[Shaped like a fortress]

273
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:39,310
Someone can hide in the center

274
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,720
to play a two-man act.

275
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,850
I see. You know that it is impossible for Manyi

276
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,210
to be an excellent qin player

277
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,250
in a short period of time.

278
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,230
Now, she only needs to practice the basic posture and techniques

279
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,890
and pretend to be a qin player.

280
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,580
Who will be the one to play the two-man act?

281
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,720
-Bravo!
-So pleasant to the ear.

282
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,990
Cheng Manyi, no wonder you're the World's Greatest Talented Woman.

283
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,430
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

284
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,080
I will report to Father

285
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,770
about Vice Censor-in-Chief Du's misbehavior today.

286
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,150
I'd like to see if you can still

287
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,540
be in your position.

288
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,430
Let's go.

289
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,390
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

290
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,950
[A Talented Girl Grows Up]

291
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,330
Here.

292
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,830
Did you see Old Crow's face today?

293
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,560
He was really furious.

294
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,910
I didn't expect you to come up with such a trick.

295
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,660
Good for you.

296
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:26,200
That's called being smart and resourceful.

297
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,260
It's almost the same.

298
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:32,230
Stop lecturing at a time like this.

299
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,070
I'll help you next time when you're in trouble.

300
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,170
Cheers.

301
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,610
I am not like you.

302
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,650
That won't happen to me.

303
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,270
Yes.

304
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:56,440
You never lose your temper

305
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,020
and always look serious.

306
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:02,460
You never make mistakes and always look aloof.

307
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:06,920
In terms of living a boring life,

308
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,480
you are surely my teacher.

309
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,700
I am flattered.

310
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,460
In other words,

311
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,690
think twice before you make a decision.

312
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,190
Don't be impulsive.

313
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,350
If you can be more intelligent,

314
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,030
you won't

315
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:27,830
cause countless troubles,

316
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,250
be it minor or serious.

317
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,410
You look handsome when you smile.

318
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,350
Remember to smile more.

319
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,350
It's tiring to be serious all the time.

320
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,470
I've been asked

321
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,670
to be disciplined and behave myself since I was young.

322
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:10,140
My father stopped me from practicing martial arts.

323
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,220
I couldn't engage with this world.

324
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:16,980
Although I might be considered as a scholar now,

325
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,180
I haven't found out

326
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,670
who framed the Wen family.

327
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:26,500
What's worse, I've been suffering from strange illness,

328
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,220
which made my parents worry.

329
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,730
That's why I am here.

330
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,850
I will teach you martial arts

331
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,690
and help you catch the mastermind behind.

332
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,910
Your illness is not a big deal.

333
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,730
You are still cute even with illness.

334
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,190
Don't worry. I'm here.

00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:03,590
♫It's okay to be a little late♫

371
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,110
Why…

372
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,920
Why did I sleep here?

373
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,850
Why did you sleep here?

374
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,390
Let me think

375
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:38,850
where to start.

376
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,960
Yi, are you awake?

377
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,760
I made chicken soup for you.

378
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,430
Be careful.

379
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,670
It's inappropriate to display your affection

380
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,720
in public.

381
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,540
You two should kneel in the ancestral hall as punishment.

382
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,580
I'm sorry

383
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,390
for involving you.

384
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,130
Don't be angry.

385
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,430
Think from another perspective.

386
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,500
It's not necessarily a bad thing to kneel in the ancestral hall,

387
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,700
especially for writers like you.

388
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,210
You are experiencing life

389
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,170
and accumulating materials for your writing.

390
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,710
In that case,

391
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,070
I should thank you.

392
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,090
No worries.

393
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:51,680
Just don't be angry.

394
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,980
This is the first time you kneel in the ancestral hall, right?

395
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,840
I've done many things for the first time

396
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,280
because of you.

397
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,080
Yes.

398
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,670
But there are many beautiful memories.

399
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,100
Like what?

400
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,490
Like...

401
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,570
Like…

402
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,060
I saw nothing.

403
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,220
And like…

404
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,950
No, I cannot think about any beautiful memory.

405
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,620
There have been some.

406
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,780
What's wrong?

407
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,820
I'm fine.

408
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,090
Just some coldness inside my body.

409
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:05,040
That's serious. Why are you still pretending tough?

410
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:14,380
Wait here. I'll get someone.

411
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,140
If you didn't punish Yi to kneel in the ancestral hall,

412
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,760
he wouldn't have had a cough.

413
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,590
My son suffered a lot.

414
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:31,430
I'm afraid he'll have to spend his birthday in illness.

415
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,830
Honey, calm down.

416
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:34,890
Don't be sad.

417
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,150
Yi

418
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,450
is not greedy.

419
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,120
He never celebrates his birthday.

420
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,920
He won't be unhappy because of this.

421
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,620
How could you say that?

422
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,060
As his mom, I wish that

423
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,300
he could spend his birthday

424
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,860
in peace.

425
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:49,260
Yes, you're right.

426
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:52,070
I'll find the best doctor in the city to treat Yi.

427
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:52,930
Hurry up.

428
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,830
You're awake.

429
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,900
Luckily, you're fine.

430
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,100
Have you been taking care of me all the time?

431
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,230
Who else can take care of you except me?

432
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,430
I am exhausted

433
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,160
for taking care of you.

434
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,690
Thank you, Miss Cheng.

435
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:30,530
How are you going to return me the favor?

436
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,770
Is she

437
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,340
coveting my body, isn't she?

438
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,060
You're fully recovered, aren't you?

439
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,660
I knew it.

440
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,930
Yes.

441
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,030
That's good.

442
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,850
Get up. Get dressed and come with me.

443
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,670
Why did you bring me here?

444
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,520
Without doubt, to buy fabrics.

445
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,910
Your task today is to be a model

446
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,600
and help me pick out the most suitable style.

447
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:06,950
Model?

448
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:08,960
What is this?

449
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,880
You need to

450
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:17,300
put on the clothes and walk like this.

451
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,110
Don't look. What are you doing?

452
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,590
Go over there.

453
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,650
Stop in front of me.

454
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:27,390
Turn around clockwise and then counter-clockwise.

455
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,520
Where are you going?

456
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,250
I am in no mood

457
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,440
to have fun with you.

458
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,540
Goodbye.

459
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,750
Stop there!

460
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,080
You don't want to return the favor to me?

461
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,600
I'm the Greatest Scholar of the Feng State.

462
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,500
How could I do such a strange thing?

463
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,700
It's inappropriate!

464
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,930
As long as you're not afraid of being embarrassed,

465
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,730
just walk out with your head high.

466
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,790
I won't return the belt to you anyway.

467
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,400
Give it to me.

468
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,790
You won't win if we fight.

469
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,590
Stop it.

470
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,590
Sir, please show me all your fine fabrics.

471
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,670
I can afford it.

472
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,920
Guys, move!

473
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:01,910
Yes.

474
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:03,910
Cheng Manyi!
