[Cheng's Boxing Gym]

4
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,430
Based on my extensive experience binge-watching dramas,

5
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,710
although this scarecrow may seem unharmed on the surface,

6
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,550
it has likely suffered severe internal injuries.

7
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,210
In the end, it will burst open.

8
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,910
This is the secret technique of our Cheng family:

9
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,110
the 72 Forms of Swordsmanship.

10
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,420
72 Forms...

11
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,039
What about the remaining 71 forms?

12
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,539
That... that's it.

13
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:58,770
That slash didn't do anything.

14
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:01,550
This glaive may seem harmless,

15
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,080
and in fact, it really can't inflict any harm?

16
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,670
Manyi,

17
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,270
the reason we martial arts practitioners

18
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,930
perform the fist-palm salute

19
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,430
is to show the other person

20
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,870
that we value peace.

21
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,310
The purpose of martial arts is to deter,

22
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,950
not to harm.

23
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,280
You must always remember this.

24
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,870
How long does it take to master this swordsmanship?

25
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,790
Ten years.

26
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,650
Sorry to disturb you, Dad.

27
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,250
Goodbye.

32
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,910

It's said that he's never lost a fight.

89
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,840
In a fight, fists and feet don't discriminate.

99
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,360
He's bound to be slow,

100
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,150

00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,670
Are you all out of your minds?

386
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,010
How dare you insult a girl in public?

387
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,500
This is Feng!

388
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,760
I don't care if you're a scholar or a martial artist.

389
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,740
If you dare to commit such acts,

390
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,030
the laws of Feng

391
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,420
will punish you.

392
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,210
F-F-Fifth Prince.

393
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,370
Please spare us, Fifth Prince.

394
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,290
Get lost now.

395
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,460
Go. Let's go.

396
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,320
Thank you for saving me, Fifth Prince.

397
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,170
Since you have nowhere else to go,

398
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,840
stay here.

399
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,520
With Wen Chenyi and Cheng Manyi's support,

400
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,160
the martial artists are now in high spirits

401
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,150
and arrogant.

402
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:04,530
Today,

403
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,030
you stood up for me like this.

404
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,200
Will it cause trouble for you?

405
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:10,980
Trouble?

406
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,350
I'd like to see what kind of storm

407
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,030
these martial artists can stir up.

408
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,520
Just do as I say later.

409
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:36,760
Come on.

410
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,210
Help!

411
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,900
Cheng Manyi.

412
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,350
You and Wen Chenyi

413
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,450
have destroyed my family.

414
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,750
I'll make you both pay with your lives.

415
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,050
As for Feng Qiwu,

416
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,560
who loves you but cannot have you,

417
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,220
he will make the perfect partner for me.

418
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,870
My efforts have not been in vain,

419
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,400
nor have I let down everyone's expectations.

420
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,430
It's truly

421
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,480
a double triumph

422
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,710
in both career

423
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,710
and relationship.

424
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,580
♫A stroke of romance fell from the heavens♫

425
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:30,980
♫Pretty girl and handsome guy♫

426
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:34,460
♫A stroke of romance fell from the heavens♫

427
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:39,120
♫Pretty girl and handsome guy♫

428
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:42,710
Honey, why are you...

429
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,310
♫My good luck is here♫

430
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,200
♫Is this the grand prize or the first prize?♫

431
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:52,680
♫Like the wildflowers which I can pick at will♫

432
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:56,240
♫Don't be shy, it's all for you♫

433
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:59,090
♫Your good luck is also my good luck♫

434
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,760
You are awake?

435
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,140
Now I know

436
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,870
that the most beautiful sight

437
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,270
isn't the morning light,

438
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,620
but you awakening from a dream.

439
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,500
I'm sure

440
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,370
with both the sunshine and you by my side,

441
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,160
this is the happy future

442
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,310
I want.

443
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,140
Morning, honey.

444
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:11,710
Morning.

445
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,670
Honey.

446
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,640
Wei,

447
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:30,390
why are you doing all these small chores yourself?

448
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,690
I'm brainstorming ideas for my next comic storyline.

449
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,490
I need to fully experience life.

450
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,250
You can help me think.

451
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,990
There are plots about a concubine's daughter reborn for revenge,

452
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,530
a tragic love story between a human and a demon,

453
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:43,440
and a sweet romance between an immortal master and a cute disciple.

454
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,570
Which one is better?

455
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:48,530
These all sound so complicated.

456
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,760
Is there

457
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,260
a simple and sweet type?

458
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,210
For example,

459
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,280
the journey of a young, pampered wife becoming the matriarch of her family.

460
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,550
Drama and farming stories

461
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,080
could be a direction too.

462
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:16,810
Wei,

463
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,540
may I...

464
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,430
Wei, you're so nice.

465
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,730
Manyi taught me that.

466
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,580
She says life

467
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,230
is unpredictable,

468
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,750
so we must live in the moment

469
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,060
and seize joy when we can.

470
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,520
Whatever you say is right.

471
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:50,260
But there's one more thing

472
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,190
I'd like to try.

473
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,800
I wonder...

474
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,520
if we can...

475
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,160
Of course!

476
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,370
Wei,

477
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:06,080
we're already engaged,

478
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,770
and I will soon marry you,

479
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,320
but...

480
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,100
won't that...

481
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,490
be...

482
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,660
too improper?

483
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,060
Don't worry.

484
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:23,860
My parents, as well as my brother and sister-in-law, are very open-minded.

485
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,590
Even if it's improper,

486
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,330
they won't blame me.

487
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,250
But I'm not ready yet.

488
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,560
This is too embarrassing...

489
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,190
in broad daylight.

490
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:38,130
Don't worry.

491
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,230
I've already dismissed everyone.

492
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,140
No one will disturb us.

493
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:45,940
Alright.

494
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,520
Then...

495
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,940
I'm coming.

496
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,700
Hurry up.

497
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,490
I can't wait any longer.

498
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:01,850
Manyi said

499
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,240
that using a real-life model for reference

500
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,440
can quickly improve my drawing skills.

501
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,820
Jun,

502
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,380
raise your arm a bit higher.

503
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,860
Come on. Hold there.

504
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,750
Wei,

505
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,480
I'm willing to be your model forever.

506
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,820
With my black hair, I've bound your heart;

507
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,580
hand in hand, we'll spend our remaining days together.

508
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,090
My only wish is to stay together forever;

509
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,410
until our hair turns white,

510
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,590
never to part.

511
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,740
Honey,

512
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,660
you must be really good at playing the guqin, right?

513
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,810
Why do you say so?

514
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,140
Because...

515
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,960
you always manage to strum the strings of my heart.

516
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,420
What's wrong?

517
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:16,710
I...

518
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,420
What's wrong?

519
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,350
Lift your head.

520
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,850
Why are you getting a nosebleed?

521
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,500
Doctor,

522
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,180
what's wrong with my wife?

523
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,960
Could it be that this time...

524
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,360
she's really expecting?

525
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,480
Don't say such nonsense!

526
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,160
Don't pressure the kids.

527
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,140
We're not in a hurry to have grandchildren to dote on.

528
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,660
Father, Mother,

529
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,440
Yi and Manyi

530
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,190
have just consummated their marriage.

531
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,230
How could they already be expecting?

532
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:41,870
Wei,

533
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,440
watch your words.

534
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,490
Other than the nosebleed,

535
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:47,660
are there

536
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:48,820
any other symptoms?

537
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,340
No.

538
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,610
This is exactly the strange part.

539
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,090
The nose is the opening of the lungs,

540
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,360
a gateway between the outside world and the body.

541
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,660
Nosebleeds usually occur

542
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,170
due to errant blood flow,

543
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,150
though sometimes they're caused by kidney deficiency

544
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,940
or a case of qi deficiency.

545
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,040
But judging by your pulse,

546
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:09,070
there is nothing unusual.

547
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,390
Could it be...

548
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,870
that I'm not actually ill at all?

549
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,280
If it occurs infrequently,

550
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,880
indeed, there's no need to worry.

551
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,280
But if it recurs,

552
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,280
it could be a more serious problem.

553
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,610
I'm sure it's just a one-time thing.

554
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,750
There's nothing wrong with me.

555
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,040
Look at you,

556
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,410
troubling the doctor

557
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:32,630
over something so minor!

558
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,370
Come on.

559
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,610
Everything is a big deal

560
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:36,800
if it concerns you.

561
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,100
Yi is right.

562
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,020
Your matters

563
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,720
are our family's matters.

564
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,410
Thank you, Dr. Song.

565
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,380
I'll see you off.

566
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,660
You will be fine.

567
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,530
I'll see the doctor off too.

568
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,540
Why is this happening?

569
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,500
My lady, wait a minute.

570
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,880
Perhaps we should just go back.

571
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,920
I want to walk a bit longer.

572
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,310
Why?

573
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:15,020
Could it be that the magnetic field between me and this world

574
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,490
is repelling each other?

575
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,530
Honey.

576
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,380
It's been so long.

577
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,890
But you've finally learned to read.

578
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,500
Of course.

579
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,780
After studying with Scholar Wen for so long,

580
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,080
it wasn't for nothing.

581
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,270
You...

582
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,390
What's wrong?

583
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,350
What do you want?

584
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,510
I just received a piece of news

585
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:45,950
from the Verification Office of the Directorate of Astronomy

586
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,010
that I know you'll find interesting.

587
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,310
Look.

588
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:54,960
[By the middle of the first month of spring, the Roof aligns;
Fate decrees an untimely parting; One cannot linger long]

589
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,650
The Directorate of Astronomy has observed

590
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,210
an unusual celestial phenomenon in the heavens.

591
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,480
This star alignment

592
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,570
will appear on the 15th of next month.

593
00:30:58,730 --> 00:30:59,750
By then,

594
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,830
the gate of heaven will open,

595
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,150
and it will shine across the sky.

596
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:07,220
[By the middle of the first month of spring, the Roof aligns;
Fate decrees an untimely parting; One cannot linger long]

597
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,160
I remember.

598
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,190
This is the exact symbol from the ancient painting

599
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,860
you've been looking for.

600
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:08,670
Yes.

601
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,580
Yes, it is.

602
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,110
This is the star alignment.

603
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,210
Heaven...

604
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,300
Middle...

605
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,500
Come on. Let me see.

606
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,770
This is the Directorate of Astronomy's augury.

607
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:25,750
By the middle of the first month of spring,

608
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,480
the Roof aligns.

609
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,120
Fate decrees an untimely parting.

610
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,240
One cannot linger long.

611
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,310
Fate decrees an untimely parting.

612
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,710
One cannot linger long.

613
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,070
It means that I should go.

614
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,210
If I force myself to stay,

615
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,090
I may meet my end here.
