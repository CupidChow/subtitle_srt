00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,740
-Young Master.
-My lady.

4
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,240
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,190
What are you doing?

6
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,070
Madam's orders.

7
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,190
Young Master needs to focus on healing.

8
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,850
My lady, please bear with it and go back quickly.

9
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,570
Honey.

10
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,610
Honey.

11
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,270
Hurry up, haven't you had enough during the day?

12
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,050
Being too lovey-dovey to the point that it affects the plants wouldn't be good. My lady.

13
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,650
Honey, then let's meet again tomorrow.

14
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,680
Honey.

15
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,700
I'll wait for you tomorrow morning.

Wen Chenyi.

18
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,360
With a face like a lotus and brows like a painting;

19
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,180
Surpassing countless immortals in heaven.

20
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,530
Today, he is so handsome that it's infuriating.

21
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,190
I shouldn't let my saliva drip

22
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,740
and ruin the mood.

23
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,890
Today, you...

24
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,280
I woke up late today.

25
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,520
I didn't have time to groom and dress up.

26
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:33,490
This is

27
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,010
my first date since leaving single life.

28
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,070
His first impression of me depends on you, Wei.

29
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,510
Don't worry, Manyi. I've noted it all down.

30
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,250
It needs to be bright, yet clear.

31
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,710
It must be careful, but not deliberate.

32
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,390
It should give a feeling of

33
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,329
being natural even without makeup.

34
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,150
In short,

35
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,070
the “Straight Guy Killer” look.

36
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,670
Does it look sloppy?

37
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,300
Even without dressing up,

38
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,360
you are beautiful.

39
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,430
Your outfit...

40
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,500
I think the same as you.

41
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,920
Great minds think alike.

42
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,060
It's just a casual outfit.

43
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,060
Young Master.

44
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,520
How about this dark-colored long robe?

45
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,120
It makes you look noble and steady.

46
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,990
Old-fashioned.

47
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,170
How about this lake-blue brocade robe with cloud trim?

48
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:15,900
Too clichéd.

49
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,780
The blue cloud-patterned long robe.

50
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,190
So today

51
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,420

52
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,660
Let's start our sweet love.

53
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,950
Master, please.

54
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,620
Honey, you are so considerate.

55
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,110
It was just a casual preparation.

56
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,190
Attention, everyone.

57
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,690
Attention, everyone.

58
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,880
Especially focus on the details, details.

59

Dongqing, Jiaobai.

60
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,970
You need to put your emotions into the performance.

61
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,630
The emotions need to be sincere.

62
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,060
Understand?

63
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:02,490
Okay.

64
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,920
Brothers and sisters, the fruit needs to be arranged.

65
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,370

67
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Follow the sheet music I gave you.

68
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,860
Listen to my direction. Pay attention to the atmosphere.

69

Boss.

70
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,880
The audience tomorrow must be even numbers.

71
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,310
They should be in pairs, so there will be...

72
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,750
A feeling of love.

73
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,420
No problem.

74
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:23,940
Okay.

75
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,800
Everyone, get moving.

80
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,380
Preparing "The Legend of the White Snake" is definitely correct.

81

It's a perfect date plan.

82

Great!

85

The play is over?

87
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,550
The play was full of twists and turns, deeply moving.

88
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,480
I'm savoring it.

89
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,370
I've known “The Legend of the White Snake” since I was little.

90
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,120
I fell asleep because of that.

91
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:53,950
It's alright.

92
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,850
Sometimes,

93
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,670
What you do is not important.

94
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,520
What matters is the thought behind it.

95
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,870
The most important thing

96
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,670
Is having you.

97
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,430
Has anyone ever said you're good at sweet talk?

98
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,110
Yes.

Alright.

Are you taking me to the mountain to enjoy the scenery?

105
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,680
Don't be impatient.

106
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,040
Look over there, Honey.

107
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,670
Slow down, Honey.

108
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,940
What's this?

109
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:34,750
Why...

110
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,050
Don't you take a guess?

111
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,940
You didn't

112
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,060
prepare 999 roses, did you?

113
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,310
You like that?

114
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,010
Well.

115
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,020
That means I had a wrong guess.

116
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,409
Try guessing again.

117
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,010
Will you tell me or not?

118
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,310
If you don't, I'll just leave.

119
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,290
Honey, look.

120
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,960
Did you make this yourself?

121
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,000
How are you so talented?

122
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,150
Do you have any other surprise skills

123
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,410
I don't know about?

124
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,770
It's just a wooden kite.

this date plan.

130
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,060
Hurry up,

Yes.

134
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,550
Get ready.

135
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,940
One, two, three.

136
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,790
It's my fault for planning this date.

137
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,760
I fell asleep during the play, and it started off badly.

138
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,560
I completely ruined the mood.

139
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,090
He wouldn't regret agreeing to this, would he?

140
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,840
If only my plan had been more thorough,

141
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,740
I wouldn't have ruined our first date.

142
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,170
It's all my fault. She must be angry with me.

143
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,340
Look at him. His eyes were so angry they seemed ready to devour me.

144
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,400
She indeed complains through her eyes.

145
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,060
Jiaobai, stop the carriage.

146
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,240
Are you okay?

147
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,430
I'm fine.

148
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,590
Not really.

I need to get out and clear my mind.

150
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,780
I also have a few things to take care of.

151

Let's meet at the teahouse in four hours.

152
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,460
Alright.

153
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,560
It's raining outside. Take an umbrella.

154
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,370
No, I have to make it up.

155
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,429
No, I have to make it up.

156
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,950
Finally, there's a date,

157
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,980

159
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,460
What should I give him?

160

This one looks really nice.

I will give him...

162
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,940
Right?

163
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,430

Boss,

168
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,760
I'd like to choose a gift for my husband.

169
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,030
Do you have anything suitable?

170
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,330
Look at these mandarin ducks.

171
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,320
A pair of matching ones,

172
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,320
flying together.

173
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,270
How nice.

174
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,150
I think it's a bit old-fashioned.

175
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,670
Then how about this one?

176
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,730
Golden boy and jade girl.

177
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,980
It symbolizes a talented man and a beautiful woman.

This golden boy and jade girl is quite good.

179

This gift box looks very exquisite.

180
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,850
What good things are inside?

181
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,950
This, Miss, is specially customized by another customer

182
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,390
for his loved one. It's not for sale.

183
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,740
You can customize here?

184
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,740
Of course.

Miss, your craftsmanship is truly exceptional.

495
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,100
What do you understand?

496
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,990
This is clearly a reward for us.

497

My lady said

498
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,210
this is called "shipping someone."

At our age,

508
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,080
how inappropriate.

509
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,260
Let's talk about it back at the house.

510
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,380

512
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,620
Young Master.

513
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,490
The City Guard Department sent someone to inform us

514
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,590
that the investigation results

515
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,190
for the academy fire are out.

516
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,330
This operation really made me laugh.

517
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,430
The black-clad man started the fire right in front of me.

518
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,110
And you're telling me it was an accident?

519
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,510
Can it be any more absurd?

520
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,240
This is the final verdict.

521
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,780
If you have objections, you may go to the government office

522
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,270
and appeal to the Imperial Censor.

523
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,940
You have failed to act for so many times.

00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:12,250

525
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,420
Where is the public servant's sense of duty?

526
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,150
Farewell, no need to see us off.

527
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,340
Stop right there!

528
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:17,740
Honey.

529
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,970
I'm going to the Imperial Censor

530
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,790
to appeal.

531
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,890
Who is it?

532
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:32,300
It's almost time to close the court, and you're still here beating the drum?

533
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,100
Sirs,

534
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,360
I need to appeal to the Imperial Censor.

535
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,910
The Imperial Censor stayed overnight at the brothel last night.

536
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,290
Go look there.

537
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:43,420
Isn't this Mr. Wen and Miss Cheng?

538
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,760
It might have been a matter of life and death earlier.

539
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,310
Is this how you treat the common people?

540
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,730
Miss Cheng, you're overthinking.

541
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,330
Our Feng State is peaceful and prosperous.

542
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,270
There's no life-and-death matter.

543
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:51,990
Right.

544
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:54,960
If there's nothing else, we'll be leaving.

545
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,590
I haven't said anything yet.

546
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,700
I haven't told you my matters yet.

547
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:02,270
Alright, Honey.

548
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,610
Honey, alright, alright.

549
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:04,540
Do not get angry.

550
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,570
Do not get angry.

551
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,870
This is all because

552
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,890
the Feng State highly values education.

553
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,750
Everyone is eager to take the civil service exams,

554
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,980
but no one applies for the martial arts exams.

555
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,800
The city guards and the officials

556
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,130
are selected randomly.

557
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:17,920
So,

558
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,880
this leads to sloppy work.

559
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,480
In that case,

560
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,510
the Imperial Censor is also selected randomly?

561
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,170
Not at all.

562
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,790
Only those who pass the martial arts exams and become martial champion

563

can be appointed as Imperial Censor.

564
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,670
I've decided.

I will become the Feng State's first female Imperial Censor.

568
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,630
The Feng State's first female Imperial Censor?

569
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,310
Yes.

570
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:49,050
I want to uphold justice for the people.

571
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,970
While I am still in this world,

I'll protect everyone I care about

573
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,230

The Wen family has a special status.

578
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:07,510
To avoid concerns from the court and potential disturbances,

579
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,750
I established a family rule

580
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,660
that prohibits participating in the Imperial exams

581

and to continue the learning of past sages, I will be content.

this matter of wielding a sword.

604

It’s not him who's going to take the exam.

605

Did you hear that clearly?

614
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,730
You should stay at home, and support your family.

615
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,350
Isn't that a nice thing to do?

616
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:40,100
Why bother participating in such a crude thing as the martial arts exams?

621
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,530
you should hurry back home.
