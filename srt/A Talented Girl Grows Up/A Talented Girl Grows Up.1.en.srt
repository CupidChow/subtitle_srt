Honey, what instructions do you have for me?

189
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,980
I'm not your "honey."

190
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,510
And I don't have any instructions for you.

191
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,150
Don't talk nonsense.

192
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,750
It seems that you have had too much to drink.

193
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,870
Then

194
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,390
I shall rest in the study.

195
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,150
I need to tell you...

196
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,850
a big secret!

197
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,120
I'm all ears.

198
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:06,590
I'm not the

199
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:10,630
"World's Greatest Talented Woman" at all.

200
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:12,980
How could that be?

201
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,780
I personally... tested

202
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,040
and selected you.

203
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,440
There can't be a mistake.

204
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,430
I don't understand.

205
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,150
Speak in human language!

206
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,710
Could it be...

207
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,700
that you're not Cheng Manyi?

208
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,910
I am Cheng Manyi.

209
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,750
I'm not the one in the book.

210
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,650
Utter nonsense.

211
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,780
Honey, you are drunk.

212
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,270
Have a good rest.

213
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,240
Don't you go.

214
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,510
You're just a fictional character.

215
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,820
You don't understand anything.

216
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,860
I can't make you understand.

217
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,300
You're forcing me to strike.

218
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,150
Young Master, are you all...

219
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,410
My lady, are you all...

220
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,360
I'm fine.

221
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,080
Let's have some tea.

222
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,340
Let's go.

223
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,740
Father, Mother.

224
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:12,990
Jiaobai.

225
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,560
Young Master, you can do it!

226
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,750
[Wen's Mansion]

227
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,260
Why am I still here?

228
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,380
What happened last night?

229
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,320
Why can't I remember a thing?

230
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,080
Did Wen Chenyi...

231
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,480
Let's analyze it calmly.

232
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,780
This is how things should have happened.

233
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,950
Last night, Wen Chenyi tried to take advantage of me.

234
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,270
Thankfully, I've had some training!

235
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,060
At the critical moment,

236
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,030
I fought to break free,

237
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,030
seizing the opportunity to leap

238
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,760
and escape through the window.

239
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,750
But just then,

240
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,830
a pair of claws

241
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,390
pulled me

242
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,860
back into the abyss.

243
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,500
Then he...

244
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,530
tormented me in every possible way.

245
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,450
Gosh.

246
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,910
What have I been through?

247
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,440
Right.

248
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,150
I have to go to the police

249
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,680
and preserve the crime scene.

250
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,280
But this is ancient times; there are no police!

251
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:29,790
What should I do?

252
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,960
What should I do?

253
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,280
Honey.

254
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,710
I think...

255
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,430
You are the cook from yesterday.

256
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,390
You actually dare to take advantage of me?

257
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,580
I took advantage of you?

258
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,980
Who is taking advantage of my weakness now?

259
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,560
You're so good-looking.

260
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,590
Couldn't you do something better with your life?

261
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,120
Why must you be such a twisted, two-faced man?

262
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,900
What does the phrase "twisted, two-faced man" mean?

263
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,380
It's a man like you!

264
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,670
In order to stop me from running away,

265
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,030
you disguised yourself as a cook,

266
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,470
drugged the food,

267
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,890
and tried to...

268
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,290
take advantage of me.

269
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,570
All the traces in this room are evidence.

270
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,110
First,

271
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,550
you mistakenly thought I was just a cook

272
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,310
and didn't allow me to say a word.

273
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,110
Second,

274
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,830
you loved that drunken crab dish

275
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,790
and downed the entire bowl of wine in it.

276
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,700
That's what

277
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,310
caused you to pass out.

278
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,520
Third,

279
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,280
all the traces in the room were of your doing.

280
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,200
Then, let me ask you,

281
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,120
why did you try to run away?

282
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,670
I just don't want to marry you.

283
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,230
Seriously?

284
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,520
You're that weak?

285
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,350
Don't tell me you're going to blackmail me over this.

286
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,610
And if you accuse me of domestic abuse...

287
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,760
I've never imposed anything on anyone.

288
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,210
If you didn't want to marry me, why didn't you say so earlier?

289
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,350
We are already husband and wife.

290
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,480
How can a royal decree of marriage be overturned at will?

291
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,310
We need to discuss divorce further later.

292
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,110
For now,

293
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,900
you must fulfill your duties as a wife.

294
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,020
What do you want?

295
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:13,790
[A Talented Girl Grows Up]

296
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:15,820
I wronged him?

297
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,300
My lady, yesterday you caused such chaos

298
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,490
in here.

299
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,920
Ever since you fell ill,

300
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,760
your personality has completely changed,

301
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,560
like you're a different person.

302
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,230
Then tell me what the old Cheng Manyi...

303
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,270
What was I like before?

304
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,250
The old you

305
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,910
excelled in

306
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,190
all arts, such as music, chess, calligraphy, painting,

307
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,150
and composing verses, ditties, odes, and songs.

308
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,990
You could make people forget about other mundane girls just by seeing you.

309
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,060
Isn't that obvious?

310
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,570
To be the World's Greatest Talented Woman,

311
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,430
you have to have some real skills.

312
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,900
Are there any specific characteristics?

313
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,370
According to the poems you taught me,

314
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,630
you were like,

315
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,440
"Willow-like eyebrows seem to frown though they don't;

316
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,330
almond-shaped eyes appear to be joyful though they aren't;

317
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,090
cherry lips are ever so slightly pursed;

318
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,750
head lowers and smiles as if shyly wanting to speak when meeting others.

319
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,040
Your speech was like birdsong,

320
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,970
and you walked with delicate steps,

321
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,590
as graceful as a willow swaying in the breeze.

322
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,110
Even the way you held a book or waved a fan

323
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,540
was calm and elegant,

324
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,090
like a delicate flower blooming by the water.

325
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,710
Beautiful.

326
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,870
So beautiful.

327
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,420
My lady, you taught me

328
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,110
that one should never display joy or anger on the face

329
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:22,150
and that likes or dislikes should not be expressed outwardly.

330
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,310
The real Cheng Manyi

331
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,470
was a perfect match for Wen Chenyi.

332
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,010
But it doesn't sound like I was in good health.

333
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,990
My lady, you've stayed up late studying from a young age,

334
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,650
which has weakened your body.

335
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,770
Case solved.

336
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,780
She was another Lin Daiyu.

337
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,570
Full of knowledge and illness.

338
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,750
Died on the day of her wedding,

339
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,280
and now I've taken her body.

340
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,670
I don't know if I should feel pity for her

341
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,110
or for myself.

342
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,610
My lady, you're speaking nonsense again.

343
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,190
Are you okay?

344
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,110
I'm fine.

345
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,960
Thank you for saving me, sister-in-law.

346
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,050
It was nothing.

347
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,310
You addressed me as "sister-in-law"?

348
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,020
My name is Wen Chenwei.

349
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,800
Wen Chenyi is my older brother.

350
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,190
Hello, Wei.

351
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,589
Do you need me to pick up your painting?

352
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,930
No need, Manyi.

353
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,900
It's just a piece of waste paper.

354
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,920
That Wen Chenyi

355
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,950
literally has such a cute sister.

356
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,080
Unbelievable.

357
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,500
My brother is fortunate enough

358
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,070
to have such

359
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,730
a kind and warm-hearted wife.

360
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,310
Young Madam! Young Lady!

361
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,670
It's time.

362
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,390
The new bride should go meet her parents-in-law.

363
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,430
What?

364
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,890
Meet the parents-in-law!

365
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,070
Yi,

366
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,090
being able to marry someone

367
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,790
as talented and beautiful as Manyi

368
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,790
is also a blessing to our Wen family.

369
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,060
From now on, we're family.

370
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,820
I hope you and Yi can treat each other with respect

371
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,100
and live in harmony.

372
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,590
Also,

00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,200
I'm afraid I'll have to trouble you

to take care of Yi's health in the future.

375
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,090
New bride, serve tea to your in-laws.

376
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,890
Fortunately, everything is alright.

377
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,070
Manyi, you're good.

378
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:45,420
I'm not

379
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,200
the World's Greatest Talented Woman at all.

380
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,380
Dealing with Wen Chenyi alone is already difficult enough,

381
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,380
and now I've offended the whole family.

382
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,220
The opponents are too strong.

383
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,220

384
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,030
My lady, you can't go.

385
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,470
You can only stay alive if you remain in Wen's Mansion.

386
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,470
Dongqing,

387
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,390
you're way too naive.

388
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,280
Stay alive?

389
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,970
Staying here may actually get me killed faster.

390
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,470
Young Madam.

391
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,650
I'm Jiaobai.

I am the Young Master's personal attendant.

393
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,080
Now that you've married into the Wen family,

394
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,540
then...

395
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,150
then...

396
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,450
there's a huge secret

397
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,970
that I must share with you.

398
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,560
In the future, you might...

399

maybe...

401

notice that the Young Master occasionally displays peculiar behavior,

402
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,220
almost as if he...

403
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,520
transforms.

405
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,980
But please don't be frightened.

406
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,970
Because our Young Master...

407
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,640
He...

408
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,550
He what?

409
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,810
Could it be...

410
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,590
that he has a hidden illness?

411
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,630
I've known it for a long time.

412
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,160
You've known it for a long time?

413
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,320
Of course, I did.

414
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,940
Okay, I got it. You may leave.

415
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,290
Then, I'll take my leave.

416
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,080
My lady, what exactly do you know?

417
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,110
Dongqing,

418
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,210
you're so naive.

419
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,770
Isn't it obvious?

420
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,390
Wen Chenyi

421
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,640
is a completely twisted, sick, and two-faced man.

422
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,790
Based on all my experiences with dramas,

423
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,510
with such a husband,

424
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,860
I might end up like this.

425
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,230
Hero, I still have heroic deeds to accomplish.

426
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,230
Please let me go.

427
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,030
Honey, you keep talking about doing heroic deeds,

428
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,960
yet you won't even do this small favor of marrying me?

429
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,720
That makes so much sense,

430
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,970
and I can't even argue with it.

[Plea for Mercy Plan; Failed]

placed right before me.

434
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,110
I didn't cherish it.

435
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,200
Only when I lost it

436
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,490
did I regret it deeply.

437
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,760
There's nothing more painful in this world than that.

Don't hesitate any longer.

If God could give me another chance

442
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,110
to do it all again,

443
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,540
I would say three words to that girl:

444
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,240
I love you.

445
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,930

or "sick and two-faced"?

450
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:39,610
My lady, are you possessed or going crazy again?

451
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,060
No.

452
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,990
I have to find a way to go back.

453
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:47,020
But how can I go back?

454
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,470
The coffin.

455
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,190
As late autumn passes, all flowers wither and fade.

456
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,180
Only the Three Friends of Winter—pine, plum, and bamboo—

457
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,730
stand tall and proud.

458
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,420
But I wonder:

459
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,270
if heavy snow suddenly falls,

460
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:07,950
will the pine

461

remain evergreen and ageless?

462
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,250
Will the plum

463

maintain its exceptional grace?

464
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,770
And will the bamboo

465
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,900
bend yet remain unyielding?

466
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,820
Vice Censor-in-Chief Du, I'm sorry for not welcoming you sooner.

467
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,880
Please forgive me.

468
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,000
Wen,

469
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,270
you are the principal of the World's Greatest Academy.

470
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,550
Though I serve as a court official,

471
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,820
within the academy, I am merely a superintendent.

472
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,550
There's no need for such formalities between us.

473
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,670
I have yet to congratulate Scholar Wen...

474
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,540
on your recent marriage to the talented Lady Cheng.

475
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,030
Thank you, Vice Censor-in-Chief Du.

476
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,670
May I ask the purpose of your visit today?

477
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,810
To deliver His Majesty's oral edict.

478
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,630
In three months, a delegation of scholar-officials

479
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,780
from Sangyi will visit our country.

480
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:00,570
At that time, Scholar Wen and his wife, Cheng Manyi,
will meet with His Majesty

481
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,770
and lead the top scholars of the academy

482
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,300
in a literary debate against them.

483
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,380
This concerns the honor of our country.

484
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,950
His Majesty has strictly ordered:

485
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,230
we must win; failure is not an option.

486
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,500
I accept the decree.

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,880

Hya!

503
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,130
Could it be that I didn't do it right?

504
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,040
Could it be

505
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,200
that the Master was right about Manyi?

506
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,660
Although she can ward off the evil through a wedding,

507
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,900
the malevolent spirits have already invaded her body.

508
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,210
Half of her soul

509
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,070
has already been destroyed.

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,800

The Wen family is a source of spiritual energy and vitality.

00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,270
Only by staying there

520
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,050
can your daughter

521
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,880
stay alive

522
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,440
and have her soul restored.

523
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,000
Please follow my instructions.

00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,560
Devour.

00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,120
[I was here]

537

Why are they so different?

539
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,490
Are you certain about the news

540
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,850
that she's gone mad due to demonic possession?

541
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:22,060
It's insider information. Absolutely reliable.

542
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,110
Right now, only we and the Cheng family know about it.

00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,250
If she really has been possessed and gone mad,

547
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,600
what should we do when we meet His Majesty

548
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,860
and compete in the talent competition against Sangyi in three months?

549
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,410
Young Master, our Wen family will be in big trouble.

w-w-we are doomed.

553
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:52,180
Though her personality has changed and she speaks oddly,

554
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,020
I don't believe she's gone mad.

555
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,320
She's very smart.

556
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,560
Let me test her out,

557
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,570
and then we can plan accordingly.

558
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,410
Old Cheng is really ruthless.

559
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,760
Superstitions can be really harmful.

560
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,560
Why is it that when others time travel to the past,

561
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,880
they gain all sorts of cheating powers

562
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,810
and enjoy their new life,

563
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:11,800
but when it comes to me,

564
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,060
I'm this unlucky?

565
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,860
No.

566
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,600
I have to find a way to go back.

567
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,340
Falling from a high place?

568
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,120
Honey,

569
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,160
do you recognize this piece of calligraphy?

570
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,760
What kind of scribble is this?

571
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,470
What does it even say?

572
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,130
How could she be illiterate?

573
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,460
Is there anything else?

574
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,700
If not, I'm leaving.

575
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,830
Then don't blame me for...

576
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,980
clearing the obstacles.

577
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,240
My apologies; I was reckless

578
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,580
and collided with you, Young Madam.

579
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,030
It's okay.

580
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,550
Earlier, I was rushing over,

581
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,070
and I spotted a big goose in the sky.

582
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,220
It was so beautiful.

583
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,100
So I paused to admire it for a moment,

584
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,860
and in that moment of distraction, I...

585
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,580
Is it all right?

586
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,460
Yes.

587
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:06,700
[The World's Greatest Talented Woman]

588
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:09,830
Watch out!

589
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,180
So, it's that ancient painting.

590
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,410
Let me ask you, Jiaobai.

591
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,190
Where can I buy ancient paintings?

592
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:24,190
Young Madam, why would you need to buy them?

593
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:27,070
In all of Feng State, no one has a larger collection of ancient paintings

594
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,390
than our Young Master.

595
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,290
They're all just ordinary paintings.

596
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,700
They're not what I'm looking for at all.

597
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,700
Young Master.

598
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,950
Sunlight streaming onto the incense burner kindles violet smoke...

599
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:23,390
[The Book of Songs]

600
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:25,340
Li Bai came to the roasted duck restaurant.

601
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,690
Could it be that she...

602
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,180
is really illiterate?

603
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,380
I'm tired.

604
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,790
I'm going to take a break.

605
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,820
Not so fast.

606
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,700
Why don't you and I discuss the literature further?

607
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,010
This Wen Chenyi

608
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,740
is testing me like crazy.

609
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,980
What should I do? What should I do?

610
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,110
Right, I should roll with the punches.

611
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,700
All right.

612
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,790
I can't keep up the act anymore.

613
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,390
I confess.

614
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,300
I was seriously ill,

615
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,120
and afterward, I tragically lost my memory.

616
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,830
So, now, I am

617
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,870
not the "Cheng Manyi" you used to know.

618
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,930
The one standing in front of you is...

619
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,070
a new me.

620
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,910
Didn't you say that you wanted a divorce?

621
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:13,590
Let's get on with it.

622
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,990
I won't hold you back from finding new love.

623
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,430
Just what I wanted.

624
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,930
This accursed Small Seal Script...

625
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:33,920
[Letter of Commitment]

626
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:32,340
I think I know this character.

627
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,000
It's... "Letter."

628
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,870
Isn't this a divorce letter? I'll sign it.

629
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,970
I must keep her here for now

630
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:43,420
to address the impending crisis of Sangyi's delegation.

631
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,520
There is nothing between us anymore.

632
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,320
This is a...

633
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:12,020
letter... of... commitment.

634
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,750
You illiterate.

635
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:16,620
Commitment letter? What commitment letter?

636
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,840
Did you just call me illiterate?

637
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,890
I just can't read your script here.

638
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,540
Is that illegal?

639
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,220
Deceiving the Emperor is against the law.

640
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,170
Your title as the World's Greatest Talented Woman

641
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:27,230
was bestowed upon you by His Majesty.

642
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,840
If you're found unworthy of the title...

643
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,680
What?

644
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,370
According to the laws of Feng,

645
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,630
martial artists pretending to be scholars

646
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,870
face execution.

647
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:40,670
Those impersonating talented scholars

648
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:41,700
face execution.

649
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,090
Those deceiving the emperor

650
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,690
face execution.

651
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,750
To be a scholar is to be at the pinnacle of society.

652
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,380
If you don't study hard, you'll end up like her.

653
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,340
You can't even write your own name.

654
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,050
Die, illiterate!

655
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,910
No, no!

656
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,390
No, I can't die!

657
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,080
If I die,

658
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,840
my heroism award ceremony

659
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,640
will become a memorial service.

660
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:11,740
I have to go back.

661
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,730
His Majesty has appointed you for the literary competition.

662
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,470
All under heaven belongs to the emperor.

663
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,250
Even if you had wings, you couldn't escape now.
