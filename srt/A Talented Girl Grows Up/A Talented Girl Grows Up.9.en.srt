00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,860
It's not in the script.

190
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,520
Are you improvising?

191
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,830
It's just acting.

192
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,670
You playboy!

193
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,900
You have no heart!

194
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,980
I've dedicated myself entirely to you and the Wen family.

195
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,230
What are you doing?

196
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,120
If it weren't for me,

197
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,990
that seal in Wenshu Library

198
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,010
would have been lost 100 times over!

199
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,550
The fish has taken the bait.

200
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:20,940
Next,

201
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,570
watch my performance.

202
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,730
We'll pretend to have a big argument,

203
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:29,460
leaving me heartbroken and disinterested in continuing the game.

204
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,540
[Five] [Four]

205
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,970
It's fine.

206
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,810
Once Du Yaqin learns the location of the seal,

207
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,150
it will quickly reach the ears of the people behind the scenes.

208
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,690
When the Crown Prince starts to take action,

209
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,320
I'll fake an injury and leave,

210
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,850
then go with Feng Qiwu to catch him on the spot.

211
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,830
-Manyi!
-Manyi!

212
00:11:58,830 --> 00:11:59,490
Manyi!

213
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,110
Let's go.

214
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,660
Wait.

215
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,690
Why Feng Qiwu?

216
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,190
To put on a show, you have to go all the way.

217
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,240
Sorry, bro,

218
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,290
I even got you involved this time.

219
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,180
If the Crown Prince really intends to do this,

220
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,300
then I'll have no choice but to act for the greater good.

221
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,440
There's no one else, Manyi.

222
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,860
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

223
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,310
Where is it?

224
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:33,250
They hid it so well.

225
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,510
Don't move!

226
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,510
We've caught you.

227
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,750
You have the right to remain silent,

228
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,630
but anything you do say

229
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,740
may be used against you in a court of law.

230
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,200
Yes!

231
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,370
It's too late!

232
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:48,890
Darn it.

233
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,920
This huge academy doesn't even have any toilet paper!

234
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,430
It looks like the Crown Prince is heading to...

235
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,590
That's right.

236
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,620
The toilet.

237
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,120
Where is the nearest toilet?

238
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,650
Your Highness,

239
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,130
it's in the library.

240
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,260
[Toilet]

241
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,600
Your Highness,

242
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,240
your stomach is not feeling well lately, right?

243
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,910
I was quite disrespectful earlier.

244
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,930
Is there any chance this matter could be kept from Father?

245
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,550
How about I go to the field to support Cui Jun

246
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,590
while you continue to apologize to the Crown Prince?

247
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,670
Okay.

248
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,800
Your Highness...

249
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,910
What went wrong?

250
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,570
Is anyone there?

251
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,360
Hello?

252
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,790
Help me!

253
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,770
Anybody?

254
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,940
Chenwei!

255
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,010
Are you okay?

256
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:49,890
I'm fine.

257
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,820
[Five] [Five]

258
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,920
Whether we can turn the game around

259
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,430
depends on you, Cui Jun.

260
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,350
We won!

261
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,670
We won!

262
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,590
We won!

263
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,370
Good job, Cui Jun!

264
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,540
Here.

265
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,720
We won!

266
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,750
[Congratulations on the grand opening of the Academy Cup Soccer Tournament]

267
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:13,910
Feng Qiwu.

268
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,320
Your Highness.

269
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,320
Where's Manyi?

270
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,610
She's already back.

271
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,310
Isn't she here?

272
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:30,450
Manyi.

273
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,510
Manyi!

274
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:34,860
Manyi!

275
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,670
Miss Cheng.

276
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,470
Manyi!

277
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,310
Miss Cheng!

278
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:38,660
Manyi!

279
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,790
Miss Cheng!

280
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,910
Manyi!

281
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,430
Is anyone there?

282
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,300
Help me.

283
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,070
What is it?

284
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,350
I'm not afraid of it!

285
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,310
Help!

286
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,300
Help!

287
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,450
Manyi!

288
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,460
Manyi!

289
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,050
Help!

290
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,400
Manyi!

291
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,050
Man...

292
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,710
What took you so long?

293
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,280
Alright, don't be afraid, Manyi.

294
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,680
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

295
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,150
I'm sorry.

296
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,990
I failed to protect you,

297
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,620
leaving you in danger alone.

298
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,390
It was all my fault.

299
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:37,980
But now...

300
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,080
neither of us can get out.

301
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,760
We're stuck here!

302
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,630
We're doomed.

303
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,790
When I heard you screaming,

304
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,200
a lot of

305
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,450
terrifying images flashed through my mind in that instant.

306
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,200
I didn't have time to think

307
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,880
and jumped down immediately.

308
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,710
They say you're usually calm and composed.

309
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,180
It turns out I'm the exception.

310
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,990
Manyi, tell me

311
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,510
what exactly happened.

312
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:25,320
Today, seeing that we almost fell into a trap,

313
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,900
I was so anxious

314
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,590
that I pushed Cheng Manyi

315
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,270
into the dry well.

316
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,370
My Lord, please don't be angry.

317
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,730
I'm sorry.

318
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,690
The fact that we used the Crown Prince as a scapegoat

319
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,150
has already been exposed.

320
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,450
From now on,

321
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,390
I will be more careful

322
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,480
to avoid implicating you.

323
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,220
My Lord, please don't be angry.

324
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,950
My Lord, please don't be angry.

325
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,200
The hidden hand behind the Feng State

326
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,580
is incredibly bold,

327
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:55,290
actually using the Crown Prince as a smokescreen.

328
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,930
He shifted the blame onto someone influential,

329
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,790
thinking it would make us give up.

330
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,630
But he didn't expect that after setting several traps,

331
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:03,910
we would uncover the truth.

332
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,640
Then, he even tried to harm you.

333
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:06,770
However,

334
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,830
he should never have harmed you.

335
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,360
But right now, neither of us can get out.

336
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,440
Manyi, this spot seems to be hollow.

337
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,500
Take a look.

338
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,140
Is your hand okay?

339
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,990
It's fine.

340
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,260
Slowly.

341
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,140
Be careful.

342
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,260
Okay. It's okay.

343
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,280
Let me help you.

344
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,140
How is there such a large secret passage

345
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,670
under your family's academy?

346
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,530
I don't know.

347
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,910
This well has been abandoned

348
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,630
since I can remember.

349
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,400
Why haven't we found an exit yet?

350
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,860
It's getting late.

351
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,750
How about we make do here for the night?

352
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,210
Okay.

353
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,880
Come on. Be careful.

354
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,540
Are you okay?

355
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:05,770
I'm fine.

356
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,870
You sleep over there.

357
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,790
Don't try to take advantage of me.

358
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,390
Okay.

359
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,510
Morning sun,

360
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,570
morning dew,

361
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,000
fresh breeze,

362
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,590
the fragrance of flowers,

363
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,180
rainbow—

364
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,630
all the beautiful things in the world

365
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,230
are metaphors for you.

366
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,590
So,

367
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,790
this is what it feels like to like someone.

368
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,820
Manyi,

369
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,120
are you okay?

370
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,280
I'm fine.

371
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,220
This

372
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,360
is a secret remedy passed down

373
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,930
through the generations in our Cheng family.

374
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,790
It can reduce bruises and remove scars.

375
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,760
Here, take it.

376
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,320
Thank you, Father.

377
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,000
Yi, have you forgotten the Wen family rules?

378
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,370
You must always protect Manyi.

379
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,900
That's right. You made your mother

380
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,600
worry so much that she couldn't sleep all night,

381
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,800
and that made me unable to sleep as well.

382
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,190
It was all my fault.

383
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,570
I'm so hungry.

384
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,070
Mother,

385
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,840
I'd like some chicken soup.

386
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,180
I had Dongqing stew it a long time ago.

387
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,390
Thank you, Mother.

388
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,120
Then you should go have some chicken soup

389
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,030
and get some rest.

390
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:14,790
Okay.

391
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,880
Let's have some chicken soup.

392
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,150
Have a good rest.

393
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:18,400
Let's go.

394
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,660
Close the door.

395
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,490
Making such a big deal out of it

396
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,110
made it seem like I was paralyzed.

397
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,240
They're just

398
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,840
worrying too much about you.

399
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,140
Well...

400
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,310
We didn't find out

401
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,270
who's behind the scenes in the soccer tournament.

402
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,470
What should we do now?

403
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,640
I'll think of another way.

404
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,580
For now, you should focus on recovering.

405
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,590
Who's outside?

406
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,090
Slow down!

407
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,400
Stop, you thief!

408
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,710
Wei?

409
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:55,880
Wei...

410
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,180
Why...

411
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,420
Why did she run away?

412
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:05,290
I guess it was probably because she felt embarrassed.

413
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,070
Wei loves drawing comic strips.

414
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:09,550
[Eliminate Treason and Support the Weak]

415
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,370
Her dream since childhood

416
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:11,180
has been to become a comic strip artist.

417
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,890
She's quite good at it.

418
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,280
Why would she feel shy?

419
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,310
It's not about her drawing skills.

420
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,450
It's because

421
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,570
drawing comic strips

422
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,550
is considered very lowbrow in Feng State.

423
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,850
I wonder how Manyi's recovering.

424
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,050
Should I go check on her?

425
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,890
After all, she is a married woman now.

426
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:47,020
My going over there rashly could damage her reputation.

427
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,380
But...

428
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,270
But she should be okay now, right?

429
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,340
Ma'am.

430
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,920
I asked you to draw a landscape.

431
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,390
Why are you drawing a woman instead?

432
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:04,220
It seems your thoughts

433
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,550
are focused on the woman in the painting.

434
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,210
Ma'am,

435
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,090
please forgive me.

436
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,250
I did draw it wrong.

437
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,670
I'm afraid I'm not the only one

438
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,930
who drew the wrong subject.

439
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,430
My admiration and respect

440
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:27,060
for Mr. Wen are open and honest.

441
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,810
Unlike your feelings for Cheng Manyi,

442
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,940
which are more than just friendship between classmates.

443
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,600
What does it have to do with you?

444
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,000
I care about and look out for

445
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,040
my classmates.

446
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,110
What's wrong?

447
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,630
Is that not allowed?

448
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,220
Shoo!

449
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,040
How is that possible?

450
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,760
Shoo!

451
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,700
Wei.

452
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,350
I got your drawings back.

453
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:49,870
Those...

454
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:52,710
those are just things I doodled casually.

455
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:54,070
It's no big deal.

456
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,030
That would be a shame.

457
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,770
Manyi,

458
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,540
you don't mind me drawing comic strips?

459
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,140
I don't.

460
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,280
But in others' eyes,

461
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,460
it's considered a lowbrow

462
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,270
and contemptible pursuit.

463
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,240
In terms of being looked down upon,

464
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,910
you have me, an illiterate, as an even lower benchmark.

465
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:15,870
Moreover,

466
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,920
dreams don't come with rankings.

467
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,800
After all, we only have one life,

468
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,260
so we should bravely pursue our dreams

469
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,720
and live it to the fullest.

470
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:24,950
Manyi,

471
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,070
this is the first time

472
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,950
someone ever encouraged me

473
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,010
to pursue my dream.

474
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,750
From now on,

475
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,590
you're the person

476
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,560
I admire the most

477
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,610
in my heart.

478
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,590
Since you admire me so much,

479
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,000
I'll teach you something that I'm really good at.

480
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,610
What's that?

481
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:45,890
Wei,

482
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,510
the love stories you drew

483
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,260
lack soul.

484
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,940
I understand.

485
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,740
But I really

486
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,330
know nothing about love.

487
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,800
Actually, the essence of love is quite simple.

488
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,200
It's like these pastries on the table.

489
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:08,830
Only when you combine sour, sweet, bitter, and spicy

490
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,930
can it be considered a delicious dish.

491
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,310
Love is the same.

492
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,650
Sour, sweet, bitter, and spicy?

493
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,320
Sour

494
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,920
is like this hawthorn cake.

495
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,890
It smells appetizing

496
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:28,410
but tastes incredibly sour,

497
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,350
just like the sour feeling you get

498
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,850
when you see him with someone else.

499
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,670
No!

500
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,540
If you want to hurt her,

501
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,230
you'll have to get over my dead body.

502
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,670
Sweet

503
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,170
is like this honey cake.

504
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,350
It gives an indescribable happiness

505
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,720
that makes you involuntarily smile,

506
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,880
much like the fluttering feeling—

507
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,610
Are you okay?

508
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,810
When you fall for someone.

509
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,580
Bitter

510
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,850
is like the unavoidable,

511
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,500
unforgettable,

512
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,080
and hard-to-let-go pain and heartache.

513
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:09,690
No!

514
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,240
And spicy

515
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,160
is like this braised tofu,

516
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,530
with an enticing color.

517
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:16,390
No!

518
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,110
Manyi?

519
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,390
Manyi?

520
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,400
Manyi?

521
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:33,800
Manyi, are you thinking of my brother?

522
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,500
How is that possible?

523
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:36,790
He...

524
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:38,070
He's so weak.

525
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,980
How could he possibly pull off those scenes that girls love?

526
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,150
Like the hero saving the damsel,

527
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,620
lifting a girl in his arms,

528
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,020
or kabedon?

529
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,330
He's got nothing to do with any of that, okay?

530
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,730
Are those things really important?

531
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,840
Of course.

532
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:55,320
How else can you show a boyfriend's power?

533
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,170
However,

534
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,000
just piling on sweet and romantic scenes

535
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,990
can get old.

536
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,210
You need to add some villains.

537
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,580
Otherwise, how will you create conflicts

538
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,310
and catch people's attention?

539
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,780
You need to make the love story dramatic and painful

540
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,570
so that anyone who reads it

541
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:14,580
feels the hurt.

542
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,420
I understand.

543
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,420
Just like

544
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,600
the love between my brother and you,

545
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:22,410
the more it hurts, the deeper the love grows.

546
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,750
Nonsense.

547
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,940
What we have is pure brotherhood.

548
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,900
Anyway, I've shared all my years of experience

549
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,070
with drama shows.

550
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,140
I'm feeling exhausted.

551
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,160
I need to go back and have a good rest.

552
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,410
Take some time

553
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,980
to really understand it.

554
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,680
Sweet

555
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,310
is like this honey cake.

556
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,410
It gives an indescribable happiness

557
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,070
that makes you involuntarily smile.

558
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,290
When I see you, I lower my head and smile.

559
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,050
Today, we love each other deeply.

560
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,000
When will it be my turn

561
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,750
for sweet love?

562
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,050
Sir, please give me back my drawing.

563
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,310
Calm down, little miss.

564
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,250
Since you're eager for love,

565
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,940
why don't you

566
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,840
let me teach you

567
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,800
what love is?

00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,660
Keep the drawing. It's yours now.

569
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,370
But I don't want the drawing,

570
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
I just want you.

571
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,190
Don't think about running away.

572
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:40,910
Come on.

573
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,910
Pack her up

574
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,470
and send her to my bed!

575
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:42,910
Help!

576
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,020
Help!
