[Episode 23]

3
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,230
Honey!

4
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:17,910
Manyi.

5
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,030
Cheng Manyi.

6
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,630
Cheng Manyi, why didn't you tell me

7
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,430
before you...

8
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:31,590
Honey.

9
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:39,590
Honey.

10
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,229
Where have you been?

11
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:42,710
I...

12
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,770
I've been looking for you.

13
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:46,870
I...

14
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:48,860
I...

15
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,070
I went to pick flowers.

16
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,070
Look.

17
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,509
Are they pretty?

18
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,830
Yes.

19
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,270
What's wrong?

20
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,630
It seems someone is afraid I might suddenly

21
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,030
leave him and disappear.

22
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:09,610
Could it be

23
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,340
that he has known my secret

24
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,870
but pretends not to?

25
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,360
You made me embarrassed.

26
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,150
That was because someone

27
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,990
intentionally hid that from me.

28
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,230
Didn't we agree to trust each other?

29
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,790
Amazing.

30
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,170
You've even learned to fight back.

31
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,000
But it's good that you know.

32
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,430
That way, I won't have to worry about

33
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,890
how to bring it up with you.

34
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,990
Honey,

35
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,450
I'm sorry for your suffering.

36
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,280
Love doesn't have to mean staying together forever;

37
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,770
having had it once is enough.

38
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,510
You know

39
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,630
I'm most afraid of sorrow and sadness.

40
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,150
Living in this world,

41
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,630
we are all passersby.

42
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,390
Mr. Wen,

43
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,530
you need to be a bigger man.

44
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,310
But how...

45
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,060
But how can I...

46
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,230
How can I bear it?

47
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,540
Don't...

48
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,350
Don't cry.

49
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,800
The first one to cry is a little dog.

50
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,890
Silly.

51
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,030
Don't worry.

52
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,710
I will use all my skills

53
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,570
to safely send you back

54
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,750
to your own world.

55
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,560
I will search every corner of the world

56
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,140
and eventually find you.

[Fengyin Pavilion]

58
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,080
The only person I have loved

59
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,400
from the beginning

60
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,860
is Wen Chenyi.

61
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,060
For him,

62
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,920
I would give everything.

63
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:49,230
From now on,

64
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,030
you and I will live our own lives

65
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,070
and never meet again.

66
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,020
Inside that treasure,

67
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,430
there's an ancient painting.

68
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,260
Within the hidden layer of that painting

69
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,220
is the late emperor's will,

70
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,070
which can prove that the Wen family

71
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,590
is the true lineage of Feng.

72
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,500
Cheng Manyi claims to be searching for the ancient painting,

73
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,630
but in reality, she is looking for the will.

74
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,910
Everything she does is for Wen Chenyi.

75
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,950
She is just using you.

76
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,570
Now even the warriors are under her command.【】

77

No matter my grand ambitions,

78
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,790
wealth, and honor—

79
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,400
I don't care about any of it.

80
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,340
I just want to live

81
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,120
a simple and ordinary life

82
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,750
with the one I love.

83
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,830
Manyi,

84
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,430
if you insist

85
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,860
on severing ties with me,

86
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,330
does that mean you really are going to

87
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,630
go all out with Wen Chenyi

88
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,570
as they said?

89
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,280
Guard!

90
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,240
Yes.

91
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,050
Keep a close watch on Wen's Mansion.

92
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,600
If Wen Chenyi makes any movements,

93
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,230
report it to me immediately.

94
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:13,910
Yes.

95
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,800
Is there any clue about the ancient painting?

96
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,060
Young Master, don't worry.

97
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,260
We will continue to search tirelessly.

98
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,640
Mr. Wen,

99
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,190
since we've searched all over Feng and still can't find it,

100
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,430
is it possible

101
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,530
that it's not even in Feng?

102
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,140
Where is the ancient painting?

103
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,370
Wen Chenyi,

104
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,130
why did you ask when you already know the answer?

105
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:45,909
No.

106
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,230
Grand Master Ning must know the location of the ancient painting

107
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,150
but

108
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,760
didn't tell because of the will.

109
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,530
The ancient painting must be in Feng.

110
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,830
Grand Master Ning has always been targeting the Wen family

111
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,240
because of that will.

112
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,510
Moreover,

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,660
he repeatedly tried to seize the academy's seal

114
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,100
and sent Mayor He to dig for treasures in Fuzhou before.

115
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,360
There must be a connection between the treasure

116
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,480
and the seal,

117
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,310
There must be a hidden secret within it.

118
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,330
Did you bring the seal?

119
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,409
It looks normal.

120
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,940
Young Master.

121
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,070
Young Lady is here.

122
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,270
She's asking for you.

123
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:46,990
Okay.

124
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,150
Am I really that beautiful?

125
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,159
Of course.

126
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,160
To me,

127
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,720
you're the most beautiful.

128
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,700
Honey.

129
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,150
Brother.

130
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,060
Honey.

131
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,700
What happened?

132
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,190
Look.

133
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,090
This is a painting of me by Wei.

134
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,040
She made me look quite pretty in the painting.

135
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,150
It captures my most beautiful appearance.

136
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,150
That's enough for me.

137
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,480
This seal...

138
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,980
We've gone through quite a bit for it.

139
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,900
Let's stamp it.

140
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,670
Okay.

141
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,670
Manyi?

142
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,600
My lady.

143
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,190
Honey.

144
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,430
Are you alright?

145
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,180
I'm fine.

146
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,550
Honey.

147
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,070
Look. What is that?

148
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:33,990
Honey.

149
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,510
Look.

150
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,190
It's...

151
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,430
It's...

152
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,130
It's the map of the academy.

153
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,650
Why is it only half?

154
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,710
Linglong Box?

155
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,950
I got it.

156
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,620
Honey, let's go.

157
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,230
Let's go home.

158
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,000
My lady.

159
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,670
Be careful.

160
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,370
Manyi.

161
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,030
Be careful.

162
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,570
I'm fine.

163
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,210
Let's go.

164
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,580
Be careful.

165
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,030
Be careful.

166
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,620
[Toilet]

167
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,490
At this point,

168
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,820
we have no choice.

169
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,880
Let's open it.

170
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,860
Why is the route on this map

171
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,270
exactly the same as the celestial trajectory

172
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,120
on the ancient painting?

173
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,910
And look at this well.

174
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,590
It connects the entire trajectory.

175
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,550
Could this well be the entrance?

176
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,550
Honey,

177
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,710
there's hope.

178
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,280
I can send you back.

179
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,900
Why did you say that?

180
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,320
Look.

181
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,340
This map is actually a treasure map.

182
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,150
And the ancient painting we've been looking for

183
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,880
is hidden within the treasure.

184
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,680
According to this map,

185
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,010
the treasure

186
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,170
is hidden underground in the academy.

187
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,840
So, Honey,

188
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,480
you can go home now.

189
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,830
Is this treasure

190
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,890
that legendary one known to everyone in Feng—

191
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,430
whoever has it will rule the world?

192
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,190
Won't this bring trouble?

193
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,360
Wen Chenyi,

194
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,810
listen to me.

195
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,630
You must stop searching for the ancient painting.

196
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,580
Otherwise,

197
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,520
when the secret is revealed to the world,

198
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,610
your Wen family will face a fatal disaster.

199
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:07,820
Honey.

200
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,290
It won't?

201
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,050
No.

202
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,110
[A Talented Girl Grows Up]

203
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,140
Yi,

204
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,390
you hastily summoned everyone here,

205
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,110
even alarmed your father-in-law.

206
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,470
What is this for?

207
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,040
Chenyi,

208
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,380
where's Manyi?

209
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,710
Father,

210
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:36,820
Mother,

211
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:37,920
Father-in-law.

212
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,140
Please accept my bow first.

213
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:41,770
What...

214
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,240
Yi,

215
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,770
just say it.

216
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,130
What happened?

217
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,160
Get up.

218
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,790
At this point,

219
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,610
I can't hide it from you anymore.

220
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,150
Manyi...

221
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,120
Her life is at stake.

222
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,390
What?

223
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,490
Brother.

224
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,270
Even you said so,

225
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,190
it must be true.

226
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,000
How could it be?

227
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,530
My poor daughter.

228
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,070
Yi,

229
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,350
I knew

230
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,550
you wouldn't have said this unless it was absolutely necessary.

231
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,460
Could it be

232
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,790
that you've already found a way to save her,

233
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,030
but it is extremely dangerous

234
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,710
and could harm everyone?

235
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,230
Right?

236
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,480
What is it?

237
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,130
Yi, please tell us.

238
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,640
As long as it can save Manyi,

239
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,310
it doesn't matter how dangerous it is.

240
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,550
There's nothing more important

241
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,870
than Manyi's life.

242
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,680
Brother, tell us.

243
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,230
Yi, hurry and tell us. I'm so anxious!

244
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,470
Right now, there's only one way to save Manyi.

245
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,590
But it would be a great offense against the world's rules

246
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,410
and could likely bring destruction

247
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,340
to both the Wen and Cheng families.

248
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,490
Moreover, the academy

249
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,140
might be destroyed.

250
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,640
Father, Mother,

251
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,610
Father-in-law.

252
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,810
Please forgive me for being an unfilial son.

253
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,700
No.

254
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,490
No.

255
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,420
Manyi!

256
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,360
No.

257
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,570
No.

258
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,090
Father, Mother, and my dad are old.

259
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,760
How could they

260
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,260
take risks because of me?

261
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,660
Daughter,

262
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,870
stop talking.

263
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,150
No need to say anything.

264
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,990
Silly girl,

265
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,660
we are a family.

266
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,550
Since we are a family,

267
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,990
no matter how tough it gets,

268
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,720
we'll get through it together.

269
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:35,570
Yi,

270
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,210
do whatever you want to do.

271
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,800
No matter the cost,

272
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,610
saving Manyi is what matters.

273
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,070
Okay.

274
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,040
Father, Mother,

275
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:54,780
Dad.

276
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,440
It was you who made me

277
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,940
feel at home

278
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,670
and experience parental love,

279
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,300
filling all my regrets.

280
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,770
This is my home.

281
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,750
I don't want to leave here.

282
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,190
I don't want to leave.

283
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,390
Don't cry, don't cry.

284
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,360
Honey,

285
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,150
you don't need to worry too much.

286
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,420
Whatever happens,

287
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,660
I'll be there for you.

288
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,470
Be a good girl.

289
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,390
Sleep now.

290
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,720
Brother.

291
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,540
This time,

292
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,430
you are going alone,

293
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,890
and it'll be inconvenient.

294
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,110
How can Jun and I

295
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,570
help you?

296
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,200
As long as it can save Manyi,

297
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,130
I'm willing to take great risks.

298
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,420
I heard from Jiaobai

299
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,700
that the academy is being watched.

300
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,990
Any reckless act will be noticed.

301
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,820
I appreciate your kindness,

302
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,450
but I must not involve you.

303
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,440
I will find another way.

304
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,130
Are there any clues?

305
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,040
This is the visitor list.

306
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,210
[Wen Chenyi, the Master in the academy, here to visit Ning You]

307
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,430
Wen Chenyi?

308
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,770
It seems the last person he saw

309
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,230
was Wen Chenyi.

310
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:08,680
Young Master,

311
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,060
should this be reported

312
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,349
to His Majesty?

313
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,270
If it really was him,

314
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:16,849
how could he leave such an obvious trace?

315
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,150
It must be someone framing him.

316
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,280
Besides, condemning him

317
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,609
based on just this name

318
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,190
would only alert him.

319
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:27,230
Here's what we're going to do.

320
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,690
First, keep it under wraps

321
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,150
and closely monitor the Wen family.

322
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,080
Yes.

323
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,690
Everyone,

324
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,210
with spring break approaching,

325
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,610
things are getting busy.

326
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,980
After discussion,

327
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,060
I now announce that starting today,

328
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,390
the academy

329
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,950
will begin its break early.

330
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,740
The date for resuming classes

331
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,630
is yet to be determined.

332
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,800
Good!

333
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,540
Let's go.

334
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,480
Quickly.

335
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:17,590
Okay.

336
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,690
[World's Greatest Academy]

337
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:44,710
[Wen Chenyi, the Master in the academy, here to visit Ning You]

338
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,380
Your Highness,

339
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,600
have a cup of hot tea to warm up your body.

340
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,240
What does that mean?

341
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,440
You could have intervened just now,

342
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,070
but you missed the opportunity because of hesitation.

343
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,830
To hesitate when action is needed

344
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,430
only leads to greater chaos.

345
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,670
You have known about the matter

346
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,640
of Grand Master Ning?

347
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,880
Grand Master Ning was killed by Wen Chenyi.

348
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,710
He must have

349
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,630
resolved to open the treasure

350
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,430
and overthrow the royal family.

351
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,730
Now, he is decisive in his actions,

352
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,260
and Cheng Manyi is fully assisting him.

353
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,670
Yet you

354
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,760
are still wavering.

355
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,950
As for whether Wen Chenyi has ulterior motives,

356
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,400
I'm not sure yet.

357
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,000
But Manyi

358
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,600
would never deceive me.

359
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,030
You are just trying everything

360
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,920
to use my hands

361
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,670
to eliminate the two of them.

362
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,400
I've noticed it for a long time.

363
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,470
That's right.

364
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,990
They have caused me to end up like this.

365
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,790
I hate them to the core.

366
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,440
But I dare to admit that.

367
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,550
Do you, Feng Qiwu?

368
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,510
You've always wanted to own Cheng Manyi, haven't you?

369
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,790
And now the opportunity is right in front of you.

370
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,760
As long as you get rid of Wen Chenyi,

371
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,670
she'll be yours.

372
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,440
Young Master,

373
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,640
Wen Chenyi hurriedly left the city with Cheng Manyi.

374
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,300
They are probably heading to open the treasure.

375
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:25,710
Let's go.

376
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,510
Why is it you two?

377
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,170
It should be me asking you.

378
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,420
Why did my night outing with Chenwei

379
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,830
alarm you, Your Highness?

380
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,300
And why did you bring so many soldiers

381
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,450
to chase us?

382
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,830
What did you call me?

383
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,240
Your Highness?

384
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,280
Cui Jun,

385
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,010
have you grown distant from me too?

386
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,670
Are you determined

387
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:21,950
to help Wen Chenyi?

388
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,490
We haven't changed.

389
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:26,800
You have.

390
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,120
But what's the point

391
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,370
of saying this now?

392
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,530
I'll only ask you one question.

393
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,210
Where are they?

394
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,290
Who are you talking about?

395
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,940
I don't know what you mean.

396
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,560
Cui Jun, let me tell you.

397
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,750
Don't make this harder than it needs to be.

398
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,850
You can arrest us if you want.

399
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,700
But what did Jun and I do wrong?

400
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,420
Even if you report it to His Majesty,

401
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,190
we won't be afraid of it.

402
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,150
Shut up!

403
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:02,700
Your Highness, there is a message delivered by carrier pigeon.

404
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,640
Hurry back to the city.

405
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:14,440
Let's go.

406
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,310
How about

407
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,770
we disguise ourselves as you and Manyi

408
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,190
to draw their attention?

409
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,660
This is a tactic called

410
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,890
"luring the tiger out of his den."

411
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,080
This way,

412
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,330
Manyi can go to the secret passage.

413
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,420
Although

414
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,800
Wei and I are not yet married,

415
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,400
I have long considered you all as family.

416
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:40,920
Brother,

417
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,400
the priority now

418
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,780
is to save Manyi.

419
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,420
Hurry up and open the palace gates.

420
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,100
The Fifth Prince has urgent military news

421
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,840
and must report to the Emperor immediately.

422
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,920
For the lasting achievements of Feng

423
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,610
and to secure imperial power,

424
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,340
I have no other choice.

425
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,750
Be careful.

426
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:04,430
Honey.

427
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:04,710
Young Madam.

428
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,170
My lady.

429
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,200
Hang in there.

430
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,710
We'll be there soon.

431
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:10,810
I'm fine. I just tripped.

432
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,680
Oh no!

433
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,560
I just tripped.

434
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,370
The Imperial Guards

435
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,570
are on their way here.

436
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,290
It looks like the Wen family's background

437
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:20,710
has been exposed.

438
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,460
Yi, take Manyi to the secret passage first.

439
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,650
They won't dare to hurt me.

440
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,800
I'll stop them at the gate.

441
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,260
Father.

442
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,070
Mr. Wen,

443
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,160
I'm going with you.

444
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,110
With my martial art skills,

445
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,260
I can hold them off for a while.

446
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:30,750
Okay.

447
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,440
I'm going too.

448
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,820
I'll go with Jun.

449
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,680
If it comes to it, we'll face death together as a family.

450
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,560
Okay, let's go.

451
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,300
No!

452
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:37,670
No.

453
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,620
This happened because of me.

454
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,310
If it brings disaster to my family,

455
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,630
I might as well die here.

456
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:46,140
No.

457
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:46,770
Manyi.

458
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,870
The Imperial Guards are approaching.

459
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,400
We can't stay here for long.

460
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,500
The secret passage leads outside the city.

461
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,550
Everyone, come with me.

462
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,280
Let's go!

463
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:55,780
Let's go!

464
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,830
Everyone,

465
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,330
Manyi and I

466
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,510
can only take you this far.

467
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,340
Cui Jun,

468
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,560
Jiaobai,

469
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,890
take good care of everyone

470
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,430
and make sure nothing goes wrong.

471
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,640
Manyi, don't worry.

472
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,470
I swear with my life

473
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,520
that I will guarantee everyone's safety.

474
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,360
Alright.

475
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,380
Stop crying.

476
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,480
Don't make it look like a final farewell.

477
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,700
Chenyi and I

478
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,960
have some matters to attend to first.

479
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,300
You all go ahead,

480
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,660
and we'll be there soon.

481
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,500
It's okay, Mother.

482
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:52,620
Mother.

483
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:53,390
Father.

484
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,680
Don't worry.

485
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,980
I will protect Manyi well.

486
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,070
It'll be fine.

487
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,020
Manyi,

488
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,830
I can't bear to part with you.

489
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,360
Take care.

490
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,580
Chenyi,

491
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,200
I'm entrusting Manyi to you.

492
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:20,880
Thank you.

493
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,280
Young Master.

494
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,940
-Be good, Dongqing.
-You must come back.

495
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,830
Take care.

496
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,430
Take care of yourself in the future.

497
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,590
Go.

498
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,370
Brother.

499
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,600
Manyi.

500
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,850
You must come back safely.

501
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,310
Good girl, Wei.

502
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,680
You must come back safely.

503
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:58,610
Don't cry.

504
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:00,530
Go.

505
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:17,740
Go.

506
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,720
Honey, be strong.

507
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,190
Honey, be strong.

508
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,430
Don't cry.

509
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,430
Let's go.

510
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,910
Take them down when you see them.

511
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,440
The rest of you, guard the gate of the academy.

512
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,440
Search!

513
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:03,960
Let's go!

514
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,360
This way. Hurry!

515
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,460
Hurry!

516
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,050
This way!

517
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:18,860
Your Highness,

518
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,990
the entire Wen family

519
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,000
has disappeared.

520
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:23,150
There's no way they could escape

521
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,380
so quickly in such a short time.

522
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,200
Unless...

523
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,460
it was through the secret passage.

524
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,670
Send out my orders.

525
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,830
Gather all the

526
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,590
registered craftsmen

527
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,750
in the capital.

528
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,390
Yes.

529
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,590
There are actually perpetual lights here?

530
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,270
According to the map,

531
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,870
this should be the place.

532
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,790
If that ancient painting is inside,

533
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,860
you and I will have to part ways.

534
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,940
I've said before,

535
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,430
no matter where you go,

536
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:22,160
I will search every corner of the world

537
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,280
to find you.

538
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:06,530
It seems this is

539
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,990
a relic left by my grandmother and the late emperor.

540
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,790
Gold may have its value,

541
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,430
but shared experiences are priceless.

542
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,480
To me,

543
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:21,040
this is the true treasure.

544
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:30,980
That looks like

545
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,530
a portrait of your grandmother in women's clothing.

546
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:36,950
Let's go.

547
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,090
Though

548
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,070
I didn't formally wed Wen Xian,

549
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,670
in my heart,

550
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,540
she has long been my legitimate wife.

551
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:56,030
Our marriage was filled with love,

552
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,460
and we had a son together.

553
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:00,600
However, due to the invading enemy and the repeated setbacks in the war,

554
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,370
the only way to ensure the peace of Feng is through a political marriage.

555
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,280
My wife, for the sake of the millions of people,

556
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,500
resolutely left

557
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,890
and we have not seen each other since.

558
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,510
After decades apart from my beloved wife,

559
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,440
when I saw her again,

560
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,600
she was on her deathbed.

561
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,450
We established this place together

562
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:23,070
to fulfill the regrets of our lives.

563
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,560
After my beloved wife's passing,

564
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,870
I have missed her throughout my life.

565
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,100
I come here often to commemorate her.

566
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,280
I worry that

567
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:37,210
the Wen family may face suspicion in the future.

568
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,150
Therefore, I have left a will

569
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,590
within the painting

570
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,660
as proof,

571
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,300
should it be necessary.

572
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,030
It turns out the late emperor was not a heartbreaker.

573
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,120
He had to make a choice.

574
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,160
Your Highness,

575
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,460
