[A Talented Girl Grows Up]

2
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,900
[Episode 24]

3
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,039
The ancient painting.

4
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,560
Wen Chenyi!

5
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,170
You deceived His Majesty

6
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,640
and attempted to rebel.

7
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:24,990
Do you admit your crimes?

8
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,930
The Wen family has never been disloyal.

9
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,070
We're taking

10
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,710
the ancient painting to save Manyi's life.

11
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:31,950
Feng Qiwu.

12
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,680
Look around.

13
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,360
There's no treasure.

14
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:36,750
Feng Qiwu.

15
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,170
As long as you agree

16
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,560
with me taking the painting for Manyi...

17
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,390
I'm at your disposal.

18
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,550
No!

19
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,930
Fine.

20
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,910
You have guts.

21
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,110
Feng Qiwu.

22
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,180
No!

23
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,390
Feng Qiwu.

24
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,710
These rebels are right in front of you.

25
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,590
What are you

26
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,390
waiting for?

27
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,190
Shut up!

28
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,290
Feng Qiwu.

29
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,240
I'll do anything

30
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,880
if you let him go.

31
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,039
You can have the ancient painting.

32
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,450
Interesting.

33
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,710
I thought

34
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,520
I could have whatever I wanted.

35
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,050
But now I understand.

36
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,350
Some things can't be forced.

37
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,460
Like I love you,

38
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,750
but you love him.

39
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,030
No!

40
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,040
Are you really willing to do anything?

41
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:45,900
Yes.

42
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,190
Manyi.

43
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,990
Including being with me?

44
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,670
Yes.

45
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,710
No, Manyi.

46
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,500
I don't want it!

47
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,160
No!

48
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,550
No!

49
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,590
No!

50
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,190
As long as he's alive,

51
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,010
you'll never see me.

52
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,470
I'll kill you!

53
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,430
Come on.

54
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,630
Listen, Feng Qiwu.

55
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,500
The moment I fell in love with her,

56
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,230
I decided I'd give up everything for her,

57
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,420
including my life.

58
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,340
So,

59
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,360
you can never take her away from me.

60
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,550
Wen Chenyi!

61
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,360
No!

62
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:36,910
No!

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,990
No!

64
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,430
No!

65
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,510
No!

66
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,230
Stop!

67
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,490
I didn't know you were so persistent.

68
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,970
Manyi!

69
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,770
Manyi, what's wrong?

70
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,700
Feng Qiwu.

71
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,399
Manyi doesn't have much time left.

72
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,980
Only the ancient painting can save her life.

73
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,990
Manyi.

74
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,150
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

75
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,390
Tell you

76
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,100
what?

77
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,100
That I'm dying?

78
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,300
So that you can never move on?

79
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,290
I'll get the painting.

80
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,620
Stay back!

81
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,030
Back off!

82
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,740
Or I'll kill you.

83
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,370
Feng Qiwu.

84
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,530
You are such a loser.

85
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,450
I put in so much effort.

86
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:02,640
I killed Grand Master Ning and framed Wen Chenyi.

87
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,860
I kept a watch on the Wen family

88
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,470
to tip you off.

89
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,590
But you still weakened

90
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,270
when it came to her.

91
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,230
You are so cruel.

92
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:57,650
Yes.

93
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,970
I hate Wen Chenyi.

94
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,480
But I love Manyi more.

95
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,510
There's no way

96
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,930
I'm gonna watch her die in front of me today.

97
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,900
Give me the painting!

98
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,930
No!

99
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,840
Give me the painting!

100
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,570
Stay back!

101
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:19,790
It's you.

102
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,630
Cheng Manyi.

103
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,870
It's you!

104
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,090
I was the World's Greatest Talented Woman.

105
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,920
People loved me.

106
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,700
I had a happy life.

107
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,140
I end up like this

108
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,010
because of you.

109
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,350
It was you.

110
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,630
You took away my honor

111
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,320
and my relationship.

112
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,920
You ruined my family.

113
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,970
You took everything from me!

114
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,010
I hate you!

115
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,200
I hate everyone who gave me this fate.

116
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,159
I hate you all.

117
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,050
You want this painting?

118
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,000
I want you

119
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,510
to live in pain forever.

120
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:09,680
No!

121
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,350
Go!

122
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,520
Run!

123
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,070
Feng Qiwu!

124
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:29,620
Manyi!

125
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,550
-Feng Qiwu!
-Feng Qiwu!

126
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,190
Manyi!

127
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:31,560
Yi!

128
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,110
Manyi!

129
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,040
-Manyi!
-Manyi!

130
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,510
Manyi!

131
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,150
My lady!

132
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:35,760
Manyi!

133
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,350
My lady!

134
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:36,870
Save him!

135
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,510
Hurry, help them!

136
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,230
How are you?

137
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,960
Are you okay?

138
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,430
Manyi, let's go.

139
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,020
Come on!

140
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:42,909
Help him!

141
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:43,490
Run!

142
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,610
[A Talented Girl Grows Up]

143
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,190
Young Master!

144
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,620
Young Master, wake up.

145
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,430
Young Master!

146
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,250
Young Master!

147
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,310
Young Master!

148
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,580
Young Master, you're awake.

149
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,650
I'm late.

150
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,080
Please forgive me.

151
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,900
Where are we?

152
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:23,890
Where is Manyi?

153
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,040
The cave had completely collapsed

154
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,200
when I got here.

155
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,240
We only had time to save you and Miss Du.

156
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,289
I don't know if Cheng Manyi

157
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:36,480
and the Wen family are still alive.

158
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,289
Manyi!

159
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,169
Young Master.

160
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,410
Young Master, you can't go.

161
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,550
I've ordered people to dig the cave

162
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,680
and search for them.

163
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:01,940
Tell them to stop.

164
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,980
Stop looking.

165
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,170
Young Master.

166
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,510
Leave.

167
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:12,710
Leave.

168
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,940
Keep up.

169
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,510
Father.

170
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,360
I saw it with my own eyes.

171
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,450
The Wens and the Chengs

172
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,640
all got buried in the ground.

173
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,960
That will...

174
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,200
The ancient painting was destroyed.

175
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,360
The will is gone.

176
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,250
In fact, the so-called treasure

177
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,930
is just some old things

178
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,620
from when Wen Xian and Grandfather were in love.

179
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,660
In order to dispel the suspicions,

180
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,040
the Wen family opened the cave

181
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,830
to destroy those things.

182
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,250
They weren't trying to rebel.

183
00:09:59,090 --> 00:09:59,990
Yeah.

184
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,340
I knew

185
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:05,750
the Wen family

186
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,400
had always

187
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,830
been loyal.

188
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,630
But they

189
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,530
had bad luck

190
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,900
and died.

191
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,650
-Manyi.
-Manyi.

192
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,710
Sit.

193
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,640
Here.

194
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,820
I'm okay, Dad.

195
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,410
Master.

196
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,240
Yi, Manyi.

197
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,600
Don't ever act alone.

198
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,970
It was too dangerous.

199
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,070
The cave collapsed and caused the junction between the dry well

200
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,270
and the cave to fracture.

201
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,370
Otherwise, I'd feel guilty for the rest of my life.

202
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:01,720
I wonder

203
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,840
if Feng Qiwu will keep

204
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,520
hunting us.

205
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,740
He won't.

206
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,770
Where should we go?

207
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,190
Somewhere no one can find us.

208
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,890
We'll live in seclusion.

209
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,820
There will be...

210
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,470
no more Wen family.

211
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,080
Here's my order.

212
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,300
[Wen's Mansion]

213
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:37,550
Posthumously confer the Wen family with the title of martyrs.

214
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,630
Build a temple

215
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,000
to commemorate them.

216
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:58,250
♫It's like deep and true love losing to time♫

217
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:05,460
♫Only sadness and wounds can be commemorated♫

218
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,680
Manyi. You should be safe now.

219
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:12,170
♫Just like movie plots and stories, only imperfections hold beauty♫

220
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,670
No one will

221
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,950
disturb your life anymore.

222
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:18,960
♫It can become destined regrets♫

223
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:26,820
♫When do we feel loved and indebted♫

224
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:33,920
♫It seems as if deep affection is captured in film♫

225
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,620
You're free.

226
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:40,970
♫Crying, laughing and fading, so the drama can be praised♫

227
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,530
I lit a lantern to say goodbye to you tonight.

228
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,590
We'll be parted for the rest of our lives.

229
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:47,350
♫The curtain falls, leaving an extra moment of warmth♫

230
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,230
Manyi.

231
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:54,570
♫I'll gradually be forgotten by time♫

232
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,150
This is farewell.

233
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,450
From now on,

234
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,210
all the love and hatred between us

235
00:12:55,410 --> 00:13:01,940
♫It's better to part ways than to gather with red eyes♫

236
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,110
is gone with the wind.

237
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,200
♫But you left in a hurry♫

238
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,490
Goodbye,

00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,370
Cheng Manyi.

240
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:10,580
♫Leaving me with a darkened theater♫

241
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,110
You're going to be my wife tonight.

242
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:31,610
Why don't you call me husband now?

243
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,130
No.

244
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,260
Come on.

245
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,600
Have you got the suits, crowns

246
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,000
and candies ready?

247
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,790
No, right?

248
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,770
Go get them ready.

249
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:39,480
Hurry!

250
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,770
The waters flow, the maples extend.

251
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,670
Deep...

252
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,540
In deep bamboo...

253
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,610
Flying birds...

254
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,550
Deep in the bamboo forest lies the tranquility.

255
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,300
You got it wrong. One more.

256
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,350
Honey.

257
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,310
It's done.

258
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,830
You are clever in mind,

259
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,250
skillful in hand,

260
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,910
and you are handsome.

261
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,800
No wonder I love you.

262
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,000
You...

263
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,550
I'll go get some paste and stick them up.

264
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,270
Wait here.

265
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,620
One more.

266
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,940
Where should I put this?

267
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,070
Here?

268
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,820
A little to the right.

269
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,860
Almost done?

270
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,000
Almost.

271
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,980
Wei. Cui Jun.

272
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,440
Look. I designed it for your wedding.

273
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,590
Do you like it?

274
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,110
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

275
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:30,750
I love it.

276
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,680
It's beautiful.

277
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,710
-I'll put it up.
-It’s beautiful.

278
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,870
I'll do it.

279
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,150
Stay here and rest.

280
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,670
We'll do it.

281
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,660
We can do it.

282
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,900
Look how happy they are.

283
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,570
They're finally getting married.

284
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,490
Growing old with the person you love

285
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,800
is the most beautiful thing.

286
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,790
Do it. Put it up there.

287
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,940
My lady,

288
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,230
why are you putting up white silk?

289
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,040
Jiaobai!

290
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,230
It's okay.

291
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,990
It's just the wrong color.

292
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,150
We can replace it.

293
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:15,770
It's fine.

294
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,070
Right. I'm not blind.

295
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,070
Replace it.

296
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,530
We'll get another one.

297
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,110
There are a lot there.

298
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,950
A lot.

299
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,480
Honey!

300
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,260

301
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,240
-Manyi!
-Manyi!

302
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:32,580

303
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,430
-Manyi!
-Manyi!

304
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,120

305
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,070
Manyi.

306
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,350
Hurry!

307
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:40,830
Honey!

308
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,560
Manyi!

309
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,000

312
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,970
Manyi!

313
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,570
Manyi!

314
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,110
Manyi!

315
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,470
Manyi!

316
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,310
She's awake.

317
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,910
My lady, how are you feeling?

318
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,590
What happened?

319
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:58,040
Why did she faint?

320
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,030
Stop. I'm not panicking.

321
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,390
Neither should you.

322
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,390
I feel better after spitting blood.

323
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,280
Besides,

324
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,000
I still have days left.

325
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,470
Don't worry.

326
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,020
Manyi, are you sure you're okay?

327
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,770
All right, go back to work.

328
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,800
Yi, take good care of her.

329
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:22,060
Let us know if anything's wrong.

330
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,890
Okay, Mom.

331
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,869
Go on.

332
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,920
[Wedding]

333
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,410
Well,

334
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,460
why don't you tell them the truth?

335
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:44,790
Tell them what?

336
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,930
That it really hurts?

337
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,120
Or that I'm going to leave?

338
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,270
They'll be worried about me if I tell them the former,

339
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,870
and even more worried if I tell them the latter.

340
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,860
I don't want to make them sad

341
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,620
when there's a wedding coming.

342
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,350
But wouldn't you regret it if you didn't

343
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,770
say goodbye to them?

344
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,480
I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't.

345
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,940
But rather than regret,

346
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,670
I want everything

347
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,170
to stay in the best moments.

348
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,510
My time is running out.

349
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,690
I still have things to do.

350
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,820
Go with me.

351
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,430
It smells good.

352
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,220
Yeah.

353
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,370
More chili.

354
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:40,890
Okay.

355
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,770
Let me try it.

356
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,510
Okay.

357
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,510
Dad.

358
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,770
You must be tired from chopping wood.

359
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,830
Dad. Mom. Try it.

360
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,790
Come on.

361
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,710
I made braised pork.

362
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,710
Manyi made it.

363
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,070
Here, Dad. Here, Mom.

364
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,650
Yeah.

365
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,010
Dad.

366
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,890
Let me try my daughter's cooking.

367
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,400
It smells good.

368
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,260
Is it good?

369
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,360
Is it good?

370
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,710
It's delicious.

371
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,610
Delicious.

372
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:36,910
Yeah. Come on.

373
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,290
This is my first time cooking for you.

374
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,460
I haven't been a good child.

375
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,980
I always caused trouble

376
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,090
and made you worry about me.

377
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,370
I'm so lucky

378
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,220
to be your daughter.

379
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,190
You are

380
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,640
the best daughter in the world.

381
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,670
Your cooking

382
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,970
is the most delicious thing in the world.

383
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,430
There's nothing wrong.

384
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,280
I just put in a little chili.

385
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,310
My sense of taste

386
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,490
isn't normal either.

387
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,120
It's not spicy.

388
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,770
I didn't cook it right.

389
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,260
Sir, your incense.

390
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,470
Take care.

391
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,820
Smells good.

392
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,150
Come on.

393
00:20:59,190 --> 00:20:59,980
What?

394
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,060
What?

395
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,050
We can't let them find out.

396
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,050
Silly.

397
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,630
It smells wonderful.

398
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,060
Fortunately, there's nothing wrong with my nose.

399
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:21,860
Sir, can we make our own incense?

400
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,270
Sure.

401
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,440
Help yourself.

402
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:26,430
Here.

403
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,490
Thank you.

404
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:29,850
Come on, honey.

405
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,820
Here. Sit.

406
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,710
What kind of incense do you want to make?

407
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,570
I noticed they've been having trouble sleeping.

408
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,010
I want to make them some soothing incense.

409
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:58,820
That's great.

410
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,280
They'll like whatever you give them.

411
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,540
Let me help you.

412
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,640
I want...

413
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,400
That.

414
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,480
This?

415
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,210
Okay.

416
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:11,650
Here.

417
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,890
Here.

418
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,780
Your parents are so nice to me,

419
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:30,260
but I can't repay them.

420
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,950
They make me feel at home.

421
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,020
I finally have a sense of belonging.

422
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,950
In my heart,

423
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:46,510
I already think of them

424
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,470
as my real family.

425
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,280
Silly.

426
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,070
They don't

427
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,520
want you to repay them.

428
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,300
They just want you to be safe.

429
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,690
So, darling,

430
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,210
you have a great responsibility.

431
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:26,370
You have to take care of them

432
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,390
for you and me.

433
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,030
Okay.

434
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,310
Done.

435
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:50,820
Great!

436
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,690
It's done.

437
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,700
There's no smell.

438
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,960
Let me try.

439
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,120
It smells good.

440
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,110
Who's there?

441
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:24,900
Be careful.

442
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,090
There's no one here.

443
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,180
It must

444
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,100
be the clerk.

445
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,640
It's beautiful.

446
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,890
Let's go home.

447
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,120
Cui Jun, Wei.

448
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,980
Why aren't you in your wedding suits?

449
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,840
Manyi

450
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,550
is leaving tonight?

451
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,810
She's been hiding it from you

452
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,290
because

453
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,280
she doesn't want you to be sad.

454
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,030
But deep down,

455
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,390
she really wants to say goodbye to you.

456
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,670
So, Wei, Cui Jun,

457
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,420
I would like to ask you

458
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,540
if we could have a farewell party for her

459
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,890
after your wedding.

460
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:42,550
We should said our farewells to her.

461
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,750
Brother,

462
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,750
why don't we

463
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,980
just turn the wedding

464
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,270
into a farewell party?

465
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:54,950
That's good,

466
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,510
but it will delay your wedding.

467
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,110
Every day is a lucky day

468
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,890
as long as we are together.

469
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,790
Manyi, we've been waiting for you.

470
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,220
Come.

471
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:13,900
Come on.

472
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,540
Come on.

473
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:15,880
Come on.

474
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:16,560
Come on.

475
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,840
[Goodbye, Manyi]

476
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:22,670
Manyi.

477
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,230
You're back.

478
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:23,830
My lady.

479
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,520
Come here.

480
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,430
Come on, Manyi.

481
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:26,870
Come on.

482
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:27,670
We're all here.

483
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,230
Let's eat.

484
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:31,950
Manyi, let's get drunk today.

485
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,680
Come on.

486
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,310
These are all your favorite dishes.

487
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,870
Sit. Manyi.

488
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,400
Come on.

489
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:39,900
A feast.

490
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,200
These are all your favourites, Manyi.

491
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,030
Come on.

492
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:45,950
Big meatball.

493
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,930
Put the meat in.

494
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:48,350
Eat.

495
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,230
Easy.

496
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,190
Put them all in.

497
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:50,910
All in.

498
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:53,550
It's good.

499
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,230
Here.

500
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,710
Come on.

501
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,250
Cheers.

502
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:08,790
Cheers.

503
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,500
Cheers.

504
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,210
Cheers.

505
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,030
Cheers.

506
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,870
Easy on the drinks.

507
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,910
Good wine.

508
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,870
Come on, let's eat.

509
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,110
Let's eat.

510
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,110
They all got my gifts

511
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,230
except you.

512
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,120
Are you upset?

513
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:34,470
No.

514
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,500
You are the best gift I can have.

515
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,170
Your brother

516
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:45,110
likes to keep everything to himself.

517
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,070
When I'm gone,

518
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,320
you should spend more time with him

519
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,690
and cheer him up.

520
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,320
Don't worry, Manyi.

521
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,090
But why

522
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,520
the good things in this world never last?

523
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,330
Rainbows disappear.

524
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,500
Glass breaks.

525
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,860
Although happiness is always fleeting,

526
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,390
it can be eternal as long as you remember it.

527
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:25,680
