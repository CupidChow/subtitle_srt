00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,030
Let me do it.

383
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,670
This must be the stolen goods left by Yu Yidao.

384
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,400
I thought this case would be difficult.

385
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,400
I didn't expect

386
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,840
to get a big clue so soon.

387
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,030
Here, Manyi.

388
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,600
You're one step closer to become

389
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,630
Feng State's No.1 Imperial Censor.

390
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,140
But to be honest,

391
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,270
I'm confused.

392
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:15,910
If this case

393
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,590
had been this easy,

394
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,340
why would they have sent us all the way here?

395
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,230
Manyi.

396
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,440
People in Fuzhou like sweet food.

397
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,850
You probably won't like the food here.

398
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,900
So I made you

399
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,380
your favorite spicy chicken.

400
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,310
Come on.

401
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,030
Try it.

402
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:38,170
I'll try it reluctantly.

403
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,560
Who said

404
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,970
she won't like the food here in Fuzhou?

405
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,020
Serve up.

406
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,100
We're in Fuzhou.

407
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,220
We have to try the local food.

408
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,470
Manyi,

409
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,110
I ordered everything on the menu.

410
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,000
There must be something you like.

411
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:09,400
This time, I won't give in.

412
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,850
Manyi is mine.

413
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,410
Manyi belongs to no one

414
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,880
but herself.

415
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,070
Manyi.

416
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:18,760
Here.

417
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,060
Manyi, try the fish.

418
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,120
Try this.

419
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,550
I want...

420
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,470
I want...

421
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:31,510
I want...

422
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,920
I want...

423
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,670
You two, stop it!

424
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,850
It's just a meal.

425
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,540
You don’t need to have a fight.

426
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,820
Your Highness, it’s inappropriate for you

427
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,330
to take someone else's food.

428
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,180
No one was eating it. Therefore I didn't take it

429
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,390
from anyone.

430
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,940
It's a competition at most.

431
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,050
Manyi.

432
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,070
Neither of you want to eat, huh?

433
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,300
Fine.

434
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
Let's get down to business!

435
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,270
The testimony,

436
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,220
the portrait

437
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,850
and the murder weapon

438
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,480
all point to Yu Yidao.

439
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,760
Looks like he's without doubt the murderer.

440
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,220
Don't you think it's strange?

441
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,110
What do you mean?

442
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:22,910
You're right.

443
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:27,430
The portrait is surprisingly consistent with the testimony.

444
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,070
Yes.

445
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,680
People's points of view on the same thing

446
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,210
and the same person

447
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,290
are affected by subjective factors.

448
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,290
They are bound to differ.

449
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,610
It's almost impossible to be identical.

450
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:40,230
Unless...

451
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,210
Unless they have worked out all the details

452
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,360
in advance.

453
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,120
Yes.

454
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,590
I think

455
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:47,990
we need to

456
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,270
see for ourselves.

457
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,000
We have to go deeper

458
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,500
to know the whole story.

459
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,040
This case is getting interesting.

460
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,180
It seems that finding him

461
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,260
is the only way we can get to the truth.

462
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,490
All the main roads in Fuzhou

463
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,120
are guarded by soldiers

464
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,660
in case refugees get around.

465
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,000
He needs a permit

466
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,230
to leave.

467
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,200
Yu Yidao must

468
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,890
still be in Fuzhou.

469
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,760
I'll post a reward for his whereabouts.

470
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,490
I'm sure we'll find him.

471
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,730
There are hundreds of thousands of people in Fuzhou.

472
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:21,520
It'll be like looking for a needle in a haystack.

473
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,720
We must find a way

474
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,410
to lure him out.

475
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:27,900
My Lords!

476
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:29,670
Go ahead.

477
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,540
Lord He sent me to inform you

478
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,010
we have captured Yu Yidao's accomplices.

479
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:34,920
Go get your reward.

480
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,980
Thank you, My Lord.

481
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,480
The bait's ready.

482
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:43,230
Now it's up to the fish to bite the hook.

483
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,730
Run!

484
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,180
Wang, come with me.

485
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,160
You've lost.

486
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,540
Surrender now.

487
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,440
You should know

488
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,260
you're helping an evil man.

489
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,240
Leaving you on this earth is a scourge to the people.

490
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,770
What are you talking about?

491
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,000
He's gone.

492
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,940
He managed to escape?

493
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,730
Go after him!

494
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:28,980
Yes!

495
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,840
Anyone who can catch

496
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:31,830
Yu Yidao

497
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,460
will be rewarded 1000 taels of gold.

498
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,320
Wait.

499
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:35,820
Well...

500
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,300
You don't have to go through so much trouble.

501
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,730
I have put a special spice

502
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,410
on the patrol wagon.

503
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,960
The bandit must have got it on his coat.

504
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,000
We can just send hunting dogs

505
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,230
to trace the scent.

506
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,180
My Lord, I've got something.

507
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,710
You guys wait outside.

508
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,540
No one acts without my order.

509
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,300
Mayor He.

510
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,770
Open the door for the Imperial Envoy.

511
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,390
Manyi?

512
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,890
Freeze! Hands up!

513
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,440
They are just ordinary people.

514
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,140
They're not bandits.

515
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,400
Did we get the wrong location?

516
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,890
Come at me.

517
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,520
Don't hurt innocent people.

518
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,160
The bandit still

519
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,520
cares about the people at this moment?

520
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,080
Sir.

521
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,020
There are many questions about the Fuzhou case.

522
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,680
The witnesses's testimonies

523
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,570
and the evidence all seem prearranged.

524
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,880
If you can give us some clues,

525
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:30,370
we can make things right as soon as possible.

526
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,780
We are not people who stand facts on their heads.

527
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,090
It's all for justice.

528
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:42,910
[Order]

529
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,930
I’m the Fifth Prince of Feng State.

530
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,150
If you still don't believe

531
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,110
our sincerity,

532
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:42,770
take me hostage.

533
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,670
I am Yu Yidao.

534
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,460
He Lian

535
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,980
did all of it.

536
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,770
The word is He Lian was ordered by someone powerful in the capital

537
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,170
to look for the treasure.

538
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,760
So he forced people to dig the dyke,

539
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,880
which led to the breach

540
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,020
and caused a disaster.

541
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,500
Hurry!

542
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,890
Hurry!

543
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,550
What are you doing?

544
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,370
Hurry!

545
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,850
Then He Lian tried to get rid of them

546
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,170
to cover it up

547
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,820
so that he could keep his job.

548
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,700
I happened to be traveling here.

549
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,220
I couldn't bear to see them die,

550
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,080
so I saved them.

551
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,230
That's why he accused me of banditry.

552
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,510
I want to kill that scoundrel

553
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:36,020
to seek justice for those who died in vain.

554
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,050
And Wang, who is still in prison.

555
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,610
He just said something fair

556
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,170
as the head of laborers.

557
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,740
I would gladly die

558
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,220
if I could bring justice

559
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,400
to the people.

560
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:53,980
Please help us.

561
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,810
Please help us.

562
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:55,990
Please help us.

563
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,150
-Please get up.
-Please help us.

564
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,340
Please help us.

565
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,550
Please help us.

566
00:26:59,550 --> 00:26:59,990
Please get up.

567
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:00,840
Get up.

568
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,510
-Get up.
-Get up.

569
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,320
Please get up.

570
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,250
Don't worry.

571
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,300
I swear

572
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,860
I will clear your names

573
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,980
and bring He Lian to justice.

574
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,950
I'll do my best

575
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,130
for my country and the people.

576
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,260
I won't let you down.

577
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,210
Me too.

578
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,070
Manyi's business

579
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:19,930
is my business.

580
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,920
Thank you, My Lords.

581
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,460
Thank you, My Lords.

582
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,610
My Lords,

583
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,660
I've got a lot of guards here.

584
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,790
We'll keep you safe

585
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:34,810
even if we fight to the death.

586
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,920
That old fox

587
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,790
wants to kill by our hands.

588
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,860
We've known the truth.

589
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,290
And you're the Imperial Envoy.

590
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,850
We should just go confront him.

591
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:47,410
No.

592
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,680
Mayor He's power is entrenched

593
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,900
in Fuzhou.

594
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,860
If we act rashly,

595
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,660
we'll only make him want

596
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,520
to kill us.

597
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,150
Then he'll put the blame

598
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:01,190
on the bandit.

599
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,350
He'll lose his job at most,

600
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,350
but we'll die.

601
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,930
Right!

602
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,130
You're a bandit.

603
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,910
On my order.

604
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,410
If anything happens...

605
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,140
Don't move!

606
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,880
Tell your men to back off,

607
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,370
or I'll kill her.

608
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,400
Back off!

609
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,230
So what if you kill me?

610
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,510
Mayor He is a good officer.

611
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,770
He'll bring you to justice.

612
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:48,560
Shut up!

613
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,550
She's the Imperial Envoy.

614
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,380
And he's the Fifth Prince.

615
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,250
If anything happens to them in Fuzhou,

616
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,100
I'm afraid

617
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,510
you can't handle the responsibility.

618
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,380
Yu Yidao, let the Fifth Prince

619
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,630
and the Imperial Envoy go.

620
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,800
We can talk this out.

621
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,520
Let them go?

622
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:09,240
They are my free pass.

623
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,160
Back off!

624
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,420
Back off!

625
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,350
Back off!

626
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,750
What are you waiting for?

627
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,920
-Go!
-Go!

628
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,100
Protect the Fifth Prince!

629
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,200
They will kill her.

630
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,120
Mayor He,

631
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,650
you must keep the bigger picture in mind.

632
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,380
Don't hurt the Imperial Envoy.

633
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,030
What are you waiting for?

634
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,650
Go after them!

635
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,000
Let them go. I'll give you a ransom.

636
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,270
What are you doing?

637
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,960
Get out of my way!

638
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,110
Mr. Yu.

639
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,830
Take the money to buy them food and medicine.

640
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:54,340
I appreciate it on behalf on them.

641
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,630
You're welcome.

642
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,260
May I know

643
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,730
your name?

644
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,200
I'm Wen Chenyi.

645
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,900
May I ask you,

646
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,910
is your grandfather Wen Xian?

647
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:10,970
Yes.

648
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,900
Do you have anything to prove it?

649
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,700
My grandfather gave me this jade pendant.

650
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,240
Your grandfather helped my grandparents a lot.

651
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,320
They followed him.

652
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,330
Before your grandfather retired,

653
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,830
he buried some secret treasure in Fuzhou

654
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,490
and asked my family to guard it for generations.

655
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:32,650
Secret treasure?

656
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:37,630
Is that what Mayor He is looking for?
