00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,880
[Episode 3]

3
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:34,810
They are so in love, making others envious!

4
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:38,560
I think it's just a show.

5
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,509
It's not real.

6
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,660
I made such a great sacrifice.

7
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,610
Don't forget what you promised me.

8
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,110
Break up and get ready for class.

9
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:55,940
Let's go.

10
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,540
[A Talented Girl Grows Up]

11
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,340
What a loss for me!

12
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,380
Was I out of your mind?

13
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,210
Why did I take the initiative?

14
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,200
I...

15
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,220
Mr. Zhang, you have been busy with your studies.

16
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,020
Yes.

17
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,020
Calm down.

18
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,360
Calm down.

19
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,740
Calm down.

20
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,440
Why are you here?

21
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,030
You're walking in the wrong direction.

22
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,490
The classroom is that way.

23
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,130
The World's Greatest Academy

24
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,670
was established by the ancestors of the Wen family.

25
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,270
Established since the beginning of this dynasty,

26
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,860
it is already a century old.

27
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,310
It is a model for all generations to come

28
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,370
and has a prominent reputation.

29
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,079
It's pretty prestigious.

30
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,010
It's a century-old school.

31
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,870
What do you mean?

32
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,160
I was praising the academy. Go on.

33
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,490
It's no exaggeration to say

34
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,570
its students are all over the world.

35
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,740
Every year,

36
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,190
we send many talents to the court.

37
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,240
And there are many well-known alumni.

38
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,250
I don't understand

39
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,590
your words.

40
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,350
You're not used to it yet?

41
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,310
There are

42
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,200
seven disciplines here: qin playing, chess, calligraphy, painting,

43
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,770
etiquette, music theory, and maths.

44
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,970
We take three days off every seven days.

45
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,570
For the first 4 days, we have classes of qin playing, chess, calligraphy, and painting.

46
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,290
And we learn etiquette, music theory, and maths for the later 3 days.

47
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,810
In every course, you can either pass or fail.

48
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,890
Only the ones who excel in every discipline can become

49
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,550
the pillars of the Feng State.

50
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,470
Don't you have a P.E. class?

51
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,620
A P.E. class?

52
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,680
Like…

53
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,510
riding or shooting arrows.

54
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,940
There are no such courses in the academy.

55
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,270
Can't you change the situation of discriminating

56
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,270
the practitioners of martial arts?

57
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,350
You're the World's Greatest Scholar, Wen Chenyi.

58
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,760
Shouldn't true education

59
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,950
be inclusive

60
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,550
and treat everyone equally?

61
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,430
Scholars and warriors alike

62
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,470
should be able to attend classes together

63
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,270
and receive the same education.

64
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,110
Manyi.

65
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:29,860
Sit.

66
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,190
Rise.

67
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,210
Bow.

68
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,260
Greetings, Master.

69
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,370
Sit down.

70
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,760
The lesson starts today.

71
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,659
Let's start with painting.

72
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,760
There are many schools of painting in our Feng State.

73
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,330
Manyi.

74
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:01,910
Manyi.

75
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,150
Portraits should capture both the physical traits and essence of the subject.

76
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,350
You talked a lot. You must be thirsty now.

77
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,260
To quench your thirst.

78
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,310
You're the best.

79
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,560
Unlike someone.

80
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,160
I did him a huge favor, but he didn't even offer me water.

81
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,060
But Manyi,

82
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,660
you were amazing.

83
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,550
You actually thought of using the word "Green tea"

84
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,260
to describe Du Yaqin.

85
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,600
You know I was talking about her?

86
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,890
So smart.

87
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,630
Manyi, is there any word

88
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,740
to describe my brother?

89
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,110
Butterfly.

90
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,970
Russian doll.

91
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,520
"Butterfly" is easy to understand.

92
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,409
What's a "Russian doll"?

93
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,310
Because he suddenly appeared

94
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,990
to be a totally different person.

95
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,190
He acted like a child.

96
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,170
Keep your voice down.

97
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,590
Don't let anyone else know about this.

98
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,070
What's wrong?

99
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,390
Is it serious?

100
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,590
I don't want to hide it from you.

101
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,100
My brother was poisoned

102
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,210
when he was nine.

103
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,260
Poisoned?

104
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,160
What poison? Who did it?

105
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,660
We don't know.

106
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,770
My parents have searched everywhere for famous doctors.

107
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,510
But they were only able to detoxify 70% of the poison.

108
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,440
The rest still remains in his body.

109
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,590
Therefore, every time my brother has a fever,

110
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,260
he'll go through a drastic change in temperament

111
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,390
and mentally revert to the age of nine.

112
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,680
But don't worry, Manyi.

113
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,190
He'll recover once the fever subsides.

114
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,470
His health won't be affected.

115
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,510
It's just that our whole family

116
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,350
attentively cares for him and strictly guards him.

117
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:42,190
I don't know why he had a fever last night.

118
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,690
Whenever he had a fever, he'd have a relapse.

119
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,680
It must have been because of me.

120
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:51,990
What?

121
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,630
No.

122
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,650
Last night, he helped me…

123
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,550
Mr. Wen.

124
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,830
I think Cheng Manyi

125
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,990
must have known the schools of painting very well.

126
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,510
She isn't paying attention.

127
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,820
Why don't we invite her to show her painting skills

128
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,270
so that we can learn from her?

129
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,390
You can paint if you want.

130
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,750
Why are you picking on me?

131
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,110
I really want to see your expertise.

132
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,170
Or are you afraid of making a fool of yourself

133
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,800
so you dare not draw?

134
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,150
Exactly.

135
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,530
It's not that I don't dare.

136
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,390
I just don't want to.

137
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,250
You're right.

138
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,180
You're so talented that you might look down on us,

139
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,740
not even willing to paint for us.

140
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,090
Those who know you well would say that you think highly of yourself.

141
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:36,350
Those who don't might think you don't live up to your name.

142
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,510
Honey, you worked hard last night.

143
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,580
How about...

144
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,470
How about I paint one first?

145
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,050
Consider it a modest piece to inspire better works.

146
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,180
Okay.

147
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,790
What is that?

148
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,710
It's elegant

149
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,750
and exquisite.

150
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,440
Not vulgar.

151
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,470
Is your painting called

152
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,100
a couple of Mandarin ducks playing in the pond?

153
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,330
Who is the male Mandarin duck? Who is the female one?

154
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,280
She just can't simply paint.

155
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,210
Why did she paint Mandarin ducks?

156
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,270
I'll take the challenge.

157
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:37,710
Let me do it.

158
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,940
This is my work.

159
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,150
The Painting of Flower and Stamen.

160
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,020
What is that?

161
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,770
It lacks any clear structure.

162
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,200
And its meaning is vague.

163
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,410
Can't you understand?

164
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,340
The Painting of Flower and Stamen.

165
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,470
Wonderful.

166
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,900
This painting

167
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,830
is carefree

168
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,310
and unruly.

169
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,270
Besides,

170
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,010
it's imbued with Zen aesthetics.

171
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,150
It's really wonderful.

172
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,440
How can you tell there are stamens?

173
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,790
Good!

174
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,400
Good!

175
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,650
Manyi is indeed the world's greatest talented woman.

176
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,040
Amazing.

177
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,140
How does it feel that you meant to hurt others

178
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,530
but ended up affecting yourself?

179
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,260
If I'm not mistaken,

180
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,710
the butterflies were attracted by the honey water.

181
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,020
You're smart.

182
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,000
Thanks for your cooperation.

183
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,530
It's not tiring for a couple to work together.

184
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,080
You won't be able to fool everyone so easily next time.

185
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,150
Don't worry. I have you.

186
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,900
Guan! Guan! Cry the fish hawks…

187
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,430
Guan! Guan! Cry the fish hawks…

188
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,430

191
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,170
A mild-mannered good girl…

192
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,310
A fine match for the gentleman.

193
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,230
A fine match for the gentleman.

-Let's go eat.
-Let's go.

201
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,310
Manyi, the class is not over yet.

202
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:38,520
Well,

203
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,240
my sister-in-law is the World's Greatest Talented Woman.

204
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,290
She's known all about tone patterns, rhymes,

205
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,980
and antitheses.

206
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,390
Don't be overly eager for victory.

207
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,720
Adapt a strategic and measured approach.

208
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,750
If you act rashly, your defeat will be like a landslide.

209
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,660
I can hit the lantern directly.

210
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,630
Look carefully.

211
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,950
It's my turn.

212
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,280
Mr. Wen is here.

213
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,320
Manyi, I'm done.

214
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,320
I won.

215
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,040
My brush is no good. Swap it with me.

216
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,920
How is that possible? The brushes are the same.

217
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,400
Swap it.

218
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,070
No.

219
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:38,590
Go ahead.

220
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,390
Don't grab it.

221
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,410
What are you doing?

222
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,740
I want this brush, too.

223
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,260
Swap it.

224
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,420
Don't.

225
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,160
Young Madam is really calm and fearless in a crisis.

226
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,500
She'll meet His Majesty in three months.

227
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,100
And she's not anxious at all.

[March High-intensity Study Plan]

229
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,190
What is this?

230
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,150
Miss Cheng, you have a poor literature foundation,

231
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,400
and you're lazy and don't want to study.

232
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,900
Whenever I think about meeting His Majesty,

233
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,650
I can't sleep at night.

234
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,200
To prevent your identity

235
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,550
from being discovered by His Majesty

236
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,910
and that we get killed,

237
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,170
I specially prepared you

238
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,160
the March High-intensity Study Plan.

239
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,700
Study plan?

240
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,260
Seven subjects: qin playing, chess, calligraphy, painting, etiquette, music theory, and maths.

241
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,450
You'll focus on one subject

242
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,630
and practice calligraphy for two hours every day.

243
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,260
The seven-day circulation will never stop in the three months

244
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,030
until you finally meet His Majesty safely.

245
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,300
Only at that time can I be at ease.

246
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,660
Sorry for disturbing you. Goodbye.

247
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,560
Then this painting...

248
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,110
Have you found the ancient painting for me?

249
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,640
If you perform well,

250
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:58,140
this painting can be a reward for you.

251
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,320
Mr. Wen, I can't wait

252
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,710
to start learning.

253
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,250
We have to go step by step.

254
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,500
Let's start with learning the characters, which is the simplest.

255
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,470
Take a look.

256
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,010
Which characters don't you know?

257
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,710
You should ask me which characters I do know.

258
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,930
It seems

259
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,780
I underestimated how illiterate you are.

260
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,580
Who are you calling illiterate?

261
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,170
I just don't understand the characters of your country.

262
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,240
If you don't believe me,

263
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,590
I'll write something

264
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,260
to see if you know it.

265
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:38,990
Okay.

266
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,870
[Wen Chenyi is a big idiot]

267
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:02,840

00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,080
Yi.

269
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,220
Big.

270
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:09,910
What?

271
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:14,910
I wrote

272
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:20,200
"Wen Chenyi is a big idiot."

273
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,730
Don't bluff me.

274
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,740
Come on, learn the character "Luan."

275
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:35,110
It sometimes means confound. For example, "confounding one's journey with setbacks and troubles."

276
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:38,510
It also means disturb or disrupt.

277
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,630
To maintain personal moral integrity while disrupting the fundamental principles.

278
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,990
Sometimes, it means destruction.

279
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,180
I have a stomach ache. I need to go to the toilet.

280
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,790
You're awake?

281
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,110
Yes.

282
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,710

[Luan]

284
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,180
Look at the character.

285
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,670
Why don't I teach you to memorize characters with limericks?

286
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,460
Listen.

287
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,520
The character "Luan":

288
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,900
Two mountains, one above and one below.

289
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,550
A tiny person is in the middle.

290
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,540
There's a wall on the left side.

291
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:47,790
The right side is more difficult to climb over.

292
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,410
Got it?

293
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,570
Yes, I guess…

It's midnight.

298
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,339
Do I still need to study at midnight?

299
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,910
You have to finish today's tasks before you go to bed.

300
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,410
Only by finishing everything you're supposed to learn

301
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,869
can you go back and rest.

302
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,630
Go on.

303
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:27,000
No, I have to think of a way.

Isn't this my…

307
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,320
I wanted to collect someone's painting.

308
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,760
If you disagree, I can return it to you.

309
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,870
Why destroy it? What a pity.

310

376
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:10,770
I will risk my life to avenge you.

377
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,570

to make you happy.

380
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,070
I will always listen to you.

381
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,980
I will never make you angry.

382
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,230
Come here.

383
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,560
Why didn't you say what I taught you?

384
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,770
I can't say things against my will.

385
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,000
Because I will never bully you.

386
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,290
Not even when I grow up.

387
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,860
You are so cute when you are a kid.

388
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,290
Unlike now.

389
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,040

390
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,760
Sure.

391
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:50,260

He's so good.

449
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,890
I used to sneak here

450
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,910
to watch him practice martial arts.

451
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,820
So, you also want to be a hero?

00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:23,810
Of course.

453
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,640
But Father doesn't allow it.

454
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,070
He said that practicing martial arts is a crooked path,

455
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,030
so he forced me to study.

456
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:33,560
But now I'm seriously ill.

00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,070
Even if Father agrees,

458
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,530
I can't practice anymore.
