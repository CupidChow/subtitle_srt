00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,840
How dare you touch her?

10
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,030
I wouldn't dare. Please spare me.

11
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,870
It's like the heart-pounding sensation

12

13
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,300
Which hand of his touched you?

14
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,110
This is the price for laying a finger on her.

So much!

20
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,490
It seems I was being unnecessary by bringing supplements.

21
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,690
Just put it anywhere.

22
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,300
Put it here.

23
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,860

24
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,829

If it keeps going like this,

34
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,080
I'll either die from boredom

35
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,910
or explode from too many supplements.

36

I just want to get some fresh air

37

Let go of her.

92
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,080
You can't restrict her freedom.

93

377
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,230
Miss Chenwei.

378
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,840
When you finish the ending,

379
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,760
please make haste

380
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,120
to deliver it to my mansion.

381
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,290
What do you think?

382
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,550
Rest assured, Grand Master Ning,

383
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,950
I will not disappoint.

384
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,579
Now, everyone,

385
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,119
I'll stop here.

386
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,040
Farewell.

387
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:11,510
Thank you, Grand Master!

388
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,390
Grand Master Ning. Please go back.

389
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,270
Interesting.

390
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,140
It's good to be recognized.

391
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,880
I need to hurry home and figure out the ending.

392
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,319
Well,

393
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:25,200
I also want to know the ending of "Solely for You".

394
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,250
Why don't I stay and help?

395
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,030
Okay.

396
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,090
But

397
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,280
you'll have to stay in my room.

398
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,850
Don't disturb my brother and sister-in-law.

399
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,910
Typically, according to the plot in dramas,

400
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,270
those who come forward so boldly

401
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,720
are often just decoys.

402
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,070
The real mastermind

403
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,870
is always extremely careful

404
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,260
and well-hidden.

405
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,870
Manyi. Don't you think

406
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,470
Grand Master Ning's behavior a bit strange?

407
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,830
What's so strange about it?

408
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,810
You've never seen

409
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,420
the crazy book fans we have.

410
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,850
Things can get way more dramatic than this.

411
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,070
Let's go quickly.

412
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,850
[Fengyin Pavilion]

413
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,090
Letter of Commitment?

414
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:33,310
[Letter of Commitment]

415
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,410
Since everything is fake,

416
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,310
from now on,

417
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,140
you cannot escape.

418
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,000
[West Gate]

419
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,950
[West Gate]

420
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,210
We've heard that the Feng State governs through literature,

421
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:03,140
with the World's Greatest Academy being famous throughout the world.

422
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,790
Today, we from Sangyi are here

423
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,980
to inform you that you don't deserve that title

424
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,380
of "World's Greatest,"

425
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,900
nor are you worthy of it.

426
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,660
Bad news!

427
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,070
Bad news!

428
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,340
The Sangyi Academy has entered the city with the diplomatic delegation.

429
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,690
They've raised their banners

430
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,900
to provoke us and hurled insults at us.

431
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,770
They even boasted,

432
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,210
saying there is no match for them in literature.

433
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:45,530
How dare they talk nonsense?

434
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,900
I'll offer a thousand taels of silver to anyone who can defeat them!

435
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,120
Calm down.

436
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,520
Look at how flustered you all are,

437
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,090
behaving in a manner unbefitting of scholars.

438
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,440
The Emperor's decree!

439
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,600
Here's His Majesty's oral decree.

440
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,230
To welcome the Sangyi delegation,

441
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,570
Mr. Wen and Cheng Manyi

442
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,860
will represent the academy

443
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,370
in tomorrow's literary duel.

444
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,010
Yes, Your Majesty.

445
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,380
Yes, Your Majesty.

446
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,890
Yes, Your Majesty.

447
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,590
The Five Heroes of the Feng State, famous throughout the land!

448
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:34,890
Feng State, Feng State, victory will be ours!

449
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,220
Feng State, Feng State, victory will be ours!

450
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,640
Feng State, Feng State, victory will be ours!

451
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,700
The Emperor has arrived!

452
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,950
The Crown Prince has arrived!

453
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:58,030
Long live the Emperor!

454
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:01,890
Long live the Crown Prince!

455
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,510
Rise.

456
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,150
Thank you, Your Majesty.

457
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,530
The time has come.

458
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,440
The literary duel can now begin.

459
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,680
Everyone,

460
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:15,160
the annual literary duel competition

461
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,650
has arrived as scheduled.

462
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,560
According to this year's rules set by Sangyi,

463
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,640
the competition

464
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,580
will follow a best-of-five format.

465
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,190
Both sides can freely send out participants,

466
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,900
and as long as one wins within the designated time, they are victorious.

467
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,690
Who will claim victory in this competition?

468
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,250
Let's wait and see.

469
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,180
Next,

470
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,290
I declare

471
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,750
the grand literary duel between the Feng State and Sangyi,

472
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,090
a contest unmatched throughout the ages,

473
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,530
officially begins!

474
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,590
Bravo! Bravo!

475
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,720
For the first round,

476
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,240
"The Graceful Dance."

477
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,720
Both sides, please send your participants.

478
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,260
I shall accept this challenge.

479
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,400
Thank goodness.

480
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,190
We're sure to win this round.

481
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,360
As for "The Graceful Dance,"

482
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,450
it involves random changes in music,

483
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,490
and both participants must dance impromptu.

484
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,750
The one who hits the beats precisely and dances elegantly,

485
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,030
with no mistakes

486
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,670
within 15 minutes, will win.

487
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,310
I must say,

488
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:45,400
Du Yaqin's skills are quite formidable.

489
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,560
Don't get careless.

490
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,720
Sangyi's strength

491
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,550
is far more than what it appears.

492
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,150
With such skills, do they really think they can win?

493
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,350
Unless they cheat...

494
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,610
What're those?

495
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:28,900
What's going on?

496
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,470
Are you okay?

497
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,720
They used dirty tricks.

498
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,790
Du Yaqin's feet are injured.

499
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,360
Unable to win, you resort to foul play.

500
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,890
You're breaking the rules!

501
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,930
This time, the rules

502
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,310
were set by Sangyi.

503
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,050
The only restriction was the time.

504
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,930
There was no mention of other methods being off-limits.

505
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:51,980
So,

506
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,250
it's not against the rules.

507
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,200
What should we do?

508
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,060
Are we just going to admit defeat?

509
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,160
If this continues,

510
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,810
her feet will be ruined.

511
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,910
Graceful and poised, like a tree standing tall,

512
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,750
unmatched in elegance, Du Yaqin.

513
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,250
Graceful and poised, like a tree standing tall,

514
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,750
unmatched in elegance, Du Yaqin.

515
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:34,250
Graceful and poised, like a tree standing tall,

516
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,810
unmatched in elegance, Du Yaqin!

517
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,790
Sorry.

518
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,580
I didn't expect my little prop would injure you.

519
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,110
Despicable!

520
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:16,390
The first round goes to Sangyi.

521
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:20,750
The women of the Feng State are just as capable as the men!

522
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,900
Good.

523
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,720
Our Sangyi is indeed impressive!

524
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,520
That's right.

525
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,650
So infuriating!

526
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,080
For the second round,

527
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,890
"Spinning Poetry Dictation."

528
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,570
Both sides, please send out your participants.

529
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,790
We've already lost the first round.

530
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,790
We can't afford to lose the second one.

531
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,910
Who's going up next?

532
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:44,590
I'll go.

533
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,470
Who's attacking me?

534
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,910
It seems the Feng State has someone competing.

535
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:54,170
You used sneaky tricks behind the scenes. How despicable!

536
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,460
Go, Cui Jun!

537
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,020
"Spinning Poetry Dictation" involves

538
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,450
both sides observing the poetry

539
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,710
spinning on the rotating prayer wheels.

540
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,170
The first to silently memorize

541
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,630
the ancient poem within 15 minutes will win.

542
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,080
If you are afraid,

543
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,260
it's still not too late to forfeit now.

544
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,620
Don't get me wrong.

545
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,950
I'm more than happy to have this chance.

546
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,230
Thank the heavens

547
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,990
for giving me this opportunity to claim victory.

548
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:58,040
This round is practically tailor-made for Cui Jun.

549
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,360
With his eagle eyes,

550
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,250
Sangyi

551
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,540
is just shooting themselves in the foot.

552
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:06,490
I'm only worried they might have more tricks up their sleeve.

553
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,430
Cui Jun, come on!

554
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,200
Why are they getting physical?

555
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,280
Looking for trouble?

556
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,080
What are you doing? That's too much!

557
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,740
You've got the courage to compete but not the courage to lose, huh?

558
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,810
Talented people gather at Fengxian Terrace,

559
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:58,240
the travelers from faraway Sangyi feel at home.

560
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,420
Your Majesty, these two lines of poetry

561
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,420
also symbolize

562
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,240
the deep friendship between us.

563
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:17,390
The second round goes to Sangyi.

564
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:22,070
Friendship comes first, competition second.

565
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,070
It took our Sangyi students

566
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,940
three years

567
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,120
to achieve this level of success.

568
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,660
You won't blame me, will you?

569
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,520
How could I blame you?

570
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,280
You've already done your best.

571
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,370
It's them who used underhanded tactics.

572
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,130
For the third round,

573
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,650
"Melodic Recognition."

574
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:44,370
Both sides, please send out your participants.

575
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:45,910
This is bad.

576
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,510
We lost the second round, so you'll have to compete now.

577
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,870
Going up is no big deal. Losing is.

578
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,050
Looking at Feng Qiwu,

579
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,330
he doesn't seem like someone who can win.

580
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,600
Well.

581
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,280
Since it's certain we'll lose,

582
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,990
the punishment is unavoidable.

583
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,160
So, I might as well go up

584
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,620
and end this competition.

585
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,410
Go. Do your best!

586
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,860
He's trying to

587
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,430
take the blame for losing the match on himself

588
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,720
so that you don't have to compete.

589
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,600
Is he crazy?
