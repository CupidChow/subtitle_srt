That's a lot of money.

78

[17]

376
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:47,430
Bingo!

377
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,230
Young Madam, come on!

378
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,240
[47]

379
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,270
You are in.

380
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,490
I'm seven.

381
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,390
Let me see.

382
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,300
[7]

383
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,710
I'll reluctantly

384
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,460
pair up with you.

385
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,480
But can you recognize me based on the silhouette?

386
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,120
It's simple.

387
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,360
Easy said than done.

388
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,530
If you don't recognize me,

389
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,390
I will...

390
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,950
What?

391
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,290
I'll do whatever I want.

392
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,930
The lucky ladies

393
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,760
can get ready in the backstage.

394
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,200
Please.

395
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,230
This way, please.

396
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,070
This way.

397
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,510
My lady, you can do it!

398
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,970
Young Madam, you can do it!

399
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,760
Brother, come on!

400
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,560
Mr. Wen.

401
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,790
The talented men who come with the beauties,

402
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:44,220
please wait to come to the stage.

403
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,550
I've remembered her dress and posture.

404
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,780
It will be easy for me to find my goddess.

405
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,530
Come on.

406
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,700
Now, try to find her!

407
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,970
That's her, right?

408
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,560
He'll think of me as her, right?

409
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,730
Who will be my destined one?

410
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,710
Will he recognize me?

411
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,070
Or...

412
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,910
recognize me wrongly?

413
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,870
My goddess likes drawing.

414
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:35,870
One of them is writing and the other is holding the drawing board.

415
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,750
But which one is her?

416
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:16,410
Wen Chenyi, you pig head, what are you doing?

[A Talented Girl Grows Up]

442
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:07,010
Today is the happiest day since I come to Feng State.

443
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:12,300
All the delicious food, fun things, and nice things,

444
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,320
I've done it all.

445
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,910
What else have you prepared?

446
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,500
Next...

447
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,630
Let's take a look.

448
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:26,630
Old Crow.

449
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:38,810
[Enjoying Qin Pavilion]

450
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,400
Here's His Majesty's order.

451
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:37,530
The Double Seventh Lantern Festival is lively today.

452
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:38,880
It is thriving just like the past.

453
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,540
In order to entertain the people,

454
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,740
we've specially added a poetry battle.

455
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,370
I appoint the World's Greatest Talented Woman, Chen Manyi,

456
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:47,870
to participate.

457
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,610
What is the Old Crow doing?

458
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,970
Today, all the talented people are here.

459
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,490
Here,

460
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:02,200
I specially imitated the winding stream party.

461
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,570
It's such a classical and elegant custom.

462
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,090
The poem says, "The wine cup goes with the flow."

463
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,730
The bamboo tube has already been set to flow with water.

464
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:12,200
The wine cup flows from the top

465
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,460
and slowly flows down.

466
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,490
When the cup stops in front of you,

467
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,990
you have to make a poem.

468
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,440
If you can't compose a poem,

469
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,110
you have to drink three cups as punishment.

470
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,920
That's the rule.

471
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,030
You can sit next to me later.

472
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,190
To show fairness,

473
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,150
I've invited Mr. Wen to be the judge.

474
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,280
He will not participate in the battle.

475
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,290
I'm afraid it's unfair.

476
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,620
Why are you here?

477
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,680
I came to seek justice for you.

478
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:44,640
Your Highness, what do you mean?

479
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:47,530
The wine cup floats from upstream to downstream.

480
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,830
If it floats here,

481
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,040
it will definitely spin.

482
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,150
Then the probability of staying

483
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,680
will be greatly increased.

484
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,880
It's not fair for Cheng Manyi.

485
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,520
Really?

486
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,550
Why can't I see it?

487
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,230
You're blind in mind.

488
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,900
No matter how many eyes you have,

489
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,900
it's useless.

490
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,840
Listen up, everyone.

491
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,180
I protest.

492
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,850
As far as I know,

493
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,970
the Fifth Prince was just punished by His Majesty.

494
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,590
Do you want to be grounded?

495
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,390
Shameless old man.

496
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:21,750
Your Highness,

497
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,140
may I have a word with you?

498
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,750
Okay.

499
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,440
Excuse me. Excuse me.

500
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,760
Excuse me.

501
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:41,080
Unfortunately, it's not allowed to enter the inner court,

502
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,960
so I don't know the situation.

503
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,440
I can't help Manyi either.

504
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,860
It's not that hard.

505
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,110
If I carry you on my back, won't you be able to see?

506
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,760
Really?

507
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,630
Leave it to me.

508
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,650
I hereby announce

509
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,810
the Poetry Competition begins.

510
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,530
Good.

511
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,290
Du Yaqin.

512
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:35,060
Please compose a poem.

513
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,480
Look carefully.

514
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,970
Sparse stars, faint moonlight in the empty courtyard.

515
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:52,230
Sorrow and resentment, like clouds and rain, are reflected on a lotus face.

516
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:55,540
After a night of wind and rain, flower petals are scattered about.

517
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,800
The red fragments drift and wither, covering everything.

518
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,380
This poem really moves me.

519
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,350
It's not good at all.

520
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,370
It’s not good.

521
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:07,430
The Fifth Prince doesn't know poems.

522
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,430
Mr. Wen, please evaluate.

523
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,950
I smell tea.

524
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,900
Why do you like someone else's husband so much?

525
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,900
The entire poem carries a sense of resentment.

526
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,510
If it's limited to

527
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,010
personal romantic matters between men and women,

528
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,410
it feels rather lowbrow.

529
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,390
I...

530
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,940
Mr. Wen is right.

531
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:32,360
Surely, the World's Greatest Talented Woman, Cheng Manyi,

532
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,010
must have a broad mind.

533
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,620
Please look forward to it.

534
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,270
You are setting me up again.

535
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,770
Okay, continue.

536
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:01,640
Du Yaqin.

537
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,920
Compose another poem.

538
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:09,550
Water splashes, and rolling waves shimmer.

539
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:12,190
Wooden strings hum with a soothing tone.

540
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,690
Rain softly moistens the cloud-fringed hair.

541
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,080
Flowers bloom within the lotus heart.

542
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,140
Good.

543
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,220
Go on.

544
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,040
Du Yaqin.

545
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,580
A thousand miles chasing the wind-blown bird, bright and clear.

546
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,000
Waving butterflies, as fleeting as an inch.

547
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,280
Falling flowers and flowing water reflect unfulfilled love.

548
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,540
Why don't mandarin ducks pair up.

549
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,990
The cup is full.

550
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,160
Stop.

551
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,120
I hereby announce that

552
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,130
the Poetry Competition

553
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,390
is over.

554
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:15,410
Mr. Wen, good idea.

555
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,240
You're indeed the king of ideas.

556
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:18,980
Manyi.

557
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,670
As expected of me.

558
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:23,670
Winning effortlessly from start to finish

559
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,000
without any challenge.

560
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,250
An ordinary chosen one.

561
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,140
Manyi.

562
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,520
Do you really think you're lucky?

563
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,830
Am I wrong?

564
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,560
Manyi told me that

565
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,860
you already know her fake identity as a talented woman.

566
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,670
Yes.

567
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:41,040
I'm here for this.

568
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,520
I'm afraid the Vice Censor-in-Chief Du is secretly scheming,

569
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,120
so it's likely that Manyi's secret will be exposed to the public.

570
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:48,340
I have an idea.

571
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,110
What is it?

572
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,170
Mr. Wen, please go ahead.

573
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,060
Do you know that

574
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,550
magnets can both attract

575
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,060
and repel?

576
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:57,960
I see.

577
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,200
Place a magnet

578
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:02,230
at the bottom of the wine cup

579
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:05,360
and then placed a repelling magnet at Manyi's location.

580
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,580
In this way,

581
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,850
Manyi will be safe.

582
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:13,940
You two are smart.

583
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,380
Not bad.

584
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,000
His Majesty held the Poetry Competition today,

585
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,920
yet Miss Cheng didn't have a chance to compete.

586
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,410
What a disappointment.

587
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,790
Am I right?

588
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,060
Yes.

589
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,300
What?

590
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,840
This shameless old man.

591
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,920
Trying one scheme after another.

592
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,080
What are you doing?

593
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,400
In my opinion,

594
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:38,060
why don't we compose a poem impromptu?

595
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,650
Point at anything

596
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,280
and have Miss Cheng

597
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,750
and the other talented people take turns composing poems.

598
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,940
If this gets out,

599
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,700
it'll be a grand literary event in  our Feng State.

600
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,940
That makes sense.

601
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,820
Come, let’s welcome Miss Cheng.

602
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,240
Okay.

603
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,010
Old Crow doesn't have moral ethics.

604
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,270
He wants a wheel battle

605
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,980
so it will be me against all of them.

606
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,620
You've disgraced

607
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,450
the reputation of the scholars.

608
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:06,270
Miss Cheng is known as the World's Greatest Talented Woman.

609
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,200
She doesn't dare to fight.

610
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,930
Could it be the title of 'Talented Woman'

611
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,180
is not accurate?

612
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:16,540
Or could it be that Mr. Wen

613
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,920
was dishonest back then?
