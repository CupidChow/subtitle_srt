1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
An Bi Xiao

2
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,540
a dream

3
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,840
somewhere

4
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,380
You haven't had a good Marat Богor

5
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,440
So don't expect me to drink it alone

6
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,180
You won't laugh that's why

7
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:52,920
Come back

8
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,020
What do you mean?

9
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,520
What's the matter?

10
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,160
Especially your States delicious

11
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,160
Okay. Mei Bao, come and help me.

12
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,160
Take it out. Take it out.

13
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,160
Open it all.

14
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,160
Miss, I'm sorry.

15
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,160
Excuse me, we have a rule in the bar.

16
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,160
We have to pay the bill first, then drink.

17
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,160
Mei Bao, go and pay the bill.

18
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,160
Ya Nan, you pay the bill.

19
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,160
Okay.

20
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,160
Mei Bao, come and help me.

21
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,160
Miss, this wine is very expensive.

22
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,160
It's much better.

23
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,160
Ya Nan, you can go home now.

24
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,160
Okay.

25
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
What do you want?

26
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
Drink.

27
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,160
Wine is for drinking, not for pouring.

28
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,160
Who said wine can only be drunk with the mouth?

29
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,160
I don't care what you came here for.

30
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,160
These wines are all my guests.

31
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,160
They are all very expensive.

32
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,160
If you want to waste them, I won't sell them.

33
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,160
You earn more than I do.

34
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,160
You save every penny.

35
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,160
It's different from me.

36
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,160
My credit card is paid by men.

37
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,160
Everything I have is paid by men.

38
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,160
Miss, I'm sorry.

39
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,160
Miss, your credit card.

40
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,160
This is the difference between you and me.

41
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,160
Mei Bao, close the door.

42
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,160
Miss, we are going to work. Please leave as soon as possible.

43
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,160
Have you ever kept a man?

44
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,160
Are there men willing to pay for you?

45
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,160
Let alone living a luxurious life.

46
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,160
Your son, are there men willing to spend a penny?

47
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,160
Are there men willing to help you?

48
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,160
You are not that kind of person.

49
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,160
So, don't touch my things again.

50
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,160
His past, present, future, will never be yours.

51
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,160
And,

52
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,160
tell your precious son not to follow me.

53
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,160
Hi, Mei Bao.

54
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,160
Mom.

55
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,160
I told you not to touch him. Why did you do this?

56
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,160
I didn't touch him. I'm an officer.

57
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,160
I'm a surveillance officer.

58
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,160
They think I'm that black-handed.

59
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,160
You... You're driving me crazy.

60
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,160
I'm so tired.

61
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,160
What's wrong?

62
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,160
We made a big deal tonight.

63
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,160
That's good news.

64
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,160
What's good news? Tell me.

65
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,160
Go ask that tree.

66
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,160
He drank the most tonight.

67
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,160
He didn't drink.

68
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,160
Didn't drink.

69
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,160
He's drawing.

70
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,160
He's drawing.

71
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,160
He's drawing.

72
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,160
That's crazy.

73
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,160
Then why did Gao Qi spend so much money to pick flowers?

74
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
Like me?

75
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,160
Or like my Gu Zhu Ying Dong Shui?

76
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,160
He pointed at my mom and said,

77
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,160
don't call your handsome son to investigate me.

78
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
That's enough.

79
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,160
I knew you would be mad at him.

80
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,160
Actually, that's good.

81
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,160
My mom doesn't like you.

82
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,160
Plus, I'm mad at my dad.

83
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,160
By then, we'll be a family.

84
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,160
You'll comfort your dad who broke up with you.

85
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,160
He'll think you're the most important and reliable person in his life.

86
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,160
When you talk to him about your relationship with Wan Jia,

87
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,160
he'll be so happy.

88
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,160
I'll tell him that I'm still with Zui Yue when I'm in a good mood.

89
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,160
It's a good thing.

90
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,160
Is it that simple?

91
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,160
No.

92
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,160
Your mom came back to save the family?

93
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,160
Of course.

94
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,160
My mom is a woman who needs love like me.

95
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,160
You didn't see her cook for my dad and me.

96
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,160
In her heart, nothing is more important than me and my dad.

97
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,160
So in my opinion,

98
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,160
she's with your dad because she wants to stimulate him.

99
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,160
She wants my dad to re-emphasize her.

100
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,160
If you really mean it,

101
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
then it's good.

102
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,160
Baby, before I left,

103
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,160
I was going to take Hengzhi to have breakfast with the chief.

104
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,160
And he's going to be the third person in his product.

105
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,160
That's how they're related.

106
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,160
If a man doesn't love so deeply,

107
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
how can he make such a promise?

108
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
Hello?

109
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,160
I haven't called you all day.

110
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
I'll stop by this shift.

111
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,160
Looks like you have to work today.

112
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,160
I need to talk to Jimmyarsi.

113
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
Jimmy ri is right.

114
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,160
I'll be back today.

115
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,160
What can I do for you?

116
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,160
Thank you very much.

117
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,160
Hello?

118
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,160
Hello, leads.

119
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,160
Mr. Zhuo?

120
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,480
т

121
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,360
I want to introduce you to the project you mentioned.

122
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,120
Let's meet first.

123
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,440
I heard you said that.

124
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,880
Is there a problem with this project?

125
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,800
Yang Youjin also has a high-quality project.

126
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,960
He put the financial products into the high-value bank.

127
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,160
I want to know,

128
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,280
do you really want to fight with him?

129
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,280
Do you know why I like to participate in the auction?

130
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,320
As long as someone competes with me,

131
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,120
I'm particularly interested.

132
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,800
I understand that.

133
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,400
But for a risk,

134
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,160
is it worth it?

135
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,680
If you fight with Ying,

136
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,240
there will always be a loser.

137
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,720
And no matter who helps him,

138
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,720
Gao Qi will always be the winner.

139
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,440
Dear, are you on the way?

140
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,840
I have something to do at the company.

141
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,560
The bank guarantee will be transferred to me another day.

142
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
Another day?

143
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,120
What day?

144
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
I can't tell you.

145
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
I have to hang up.

146
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,160
Mr. Wu has something to do.

147
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,240
Let's do it another day.

148
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,320
Okay, bye.

149
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,720
It's okay.

150
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,400
Xu, help me call Mr. Ying.

151
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,160
Ask Mr. Jin from the high-value bank.

152
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,640
Okay.

153
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,680
Business is not waiting for people.

154
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,400
I have to tell the general company.

155
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,640
I hope Mr. Zhou and Mr. Wu can hold the business.

156
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,280
Okay, I will be by your side.

157
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
Push it harder.

158
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
I'm leaving.

159
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,120
Look at this.

160
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,840
Dear, are you really willing to accept a man

161
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,640
to give you a diamond ring?

162
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,040
Of course.

163
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,640
Otherwise, why would I come with you?

164
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,120
But do you know what it means for a woman to accept a man's diamond ring?

165
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,200
Dear, I'm not a little girl.

166
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,400
Of course I know what you think.

167
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,960
Oh, my God. So you agree to my proposal?

168
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,120
You Jin,

169
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,840
you used your English to make my guarantee

170
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,800
and put my financial project on the bank.

171
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,560
It's a great friendship for a woman without a background.

172
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,480
Besides, we are not young.

173
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,840
It's rare to meet someone you love.

174
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,520
Don't waste your time.

175
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,640
I'm afraid I don't like all the diamonds here.

176
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,240
Oh, don't worry, dear.

177
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,240
I will fulfill your wish.

178
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,920
As long as you like it, I can do it.

179
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,600
I'm a rich man.

180
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,440
I'll make sure it's all ready.

181
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,120
Don't you like it?

182
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,680
You don't like it?

183
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,760
No.

184
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,040
Let's see something else.

185
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,880
I want to tell you something.

186
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,800
I'm really lucky.

187
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,800
I can meet you in Shanghai.

188
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,040
I'm the same, dear.

189
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,840
My company is upstairs.

190
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,960
I swear it's my first time here.

191
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,640
You're a good man.

192
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,840
Yes, I am.

193
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,240
Don't you like it?

194
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,320
No.

195
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,720
Is there anything else?

196
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,360
Sorry.

197
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,040
What can I do for you, sir?

198
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,680
Display the wedding days.

199
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,200
Nine months later,

200
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,240
our wedding day.

201
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,200
It's no more.

202
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,840
Show me the results.

203
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,120
Poção, ever 뒈, you go next.

204
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,280
Let me do your State Lab fifty times.

205
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,560
Call the boss.

206
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,720
Tell him Mr Ying is here.

207
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,120
Don't worry. There will be good news.

208
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,080
Take your time.

209
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,520
Then you sit for a while.

210
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,160
Okay.

211
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,520
I'll get you some diamonds.

212
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,640
Hello, Mr Ying.

213
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,520
Please.

214
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,760
Please sit.

215
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,880
Mr Ying, may I ask for some help?

216
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,960
My friend's ring is loose.

217
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,080
I want to change it.

218
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,920
Sorry, Qian.

219
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,960
Please excuse me.

220
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,360
Okay.

221
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,760
Do you want to change it?

222
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,080
It belongs to your mother.

223
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,360
I think it's not appropriate to collect them.

224
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,920
Your ring

225
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,920
What if it's broken?

226
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,920
Change this to the size of the tool.

227
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,920
Okay.

228
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,520
I...

229
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,320
This ring is probably not just for one card.

230
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,920
I bought it in England.

231
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,120
It was sold for 30 cents a card

232
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,520
more than 20 years ago.

233
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,920
Okay, wait a minute.

234
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,320
Hello, uncle.

235
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,120
I told you to close the door and think about it.

236
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,720
But you came here to play.

237
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,720
Shopping with your girlfriend is a game.

238
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,920
You are doing the same thing as me.

239
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,520
Are you talking to your father like this?

240
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,720
Youjin.

241
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,720
Forget it.

242
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,520
It's good for a boy to have some opinions and ideas.

243
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,920
You two are just a pair of dogs.

244
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,320
Mr. Yin, your card cannot be used.

245
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,720
Impossible. Try again.

246
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,920
It really can't be used.

247
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,720
Otherwise, you will be in trouble.

248
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,120
I don't have cash. Try again.

249
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,720
Forget it. You can use mine.

250
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,520
Okay, wait a minute.

251
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,320
I need to trouble you with something.

252
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,920
I need you to sign some documents.

253
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,520
If possible,

254
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,120
let your girlfriend wait a while and come to my office.

255
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,120
Okay?

256
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,320
Okay.

257
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,920
Wait a minute.

258
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,720
What's wrong?

259
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,520
The door is locked.

260
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,320
Sit down.

261
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,320
Are you okay?

262
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,520
You can play with girls like that.

263
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,920
And you gave your mother's ring to her.

264
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,320
Can you admit that you have a headache?

265
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,120
It's not normal.

266
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:08,720
Is it normal?

267
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,320
It's not normal.

268
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,120
What do you mean?

269
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,720
I thought you forgot about my mother.

270
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,920
I didn't expect you to remember.

271
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
I'm so happy.

272
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,920
Hey, boy, don't be afraid to mention it.

273
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,120
I said it's a ring.

274
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,720
Yes, that's right.

275
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,920
If I don't give my mother's ring to Wan Jia,

276
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,920
she will be caught by Gao Qi sooner or later.

277
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,520
Instead of being so mean to you,

278
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,920
I'd better give it to someone else.

279
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,120
I know you love your mother very much.

280
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,920
But these years...

281
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,320
Sorry.

282
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
Hello?

283
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,120
Yes, no problem. You can choose.

284
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,720
What?

285
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,720
Don't worry about the wedding.

286
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,920
I will satisfy all your wishes.

287
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,920
Take care.

288
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,320
Bye-bye.

289
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,320
Dad, this woman is very ambitious.

290
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,520
She can't even look at you.

291
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,520
She's willing to marry you.

292
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,920
She must have a purpose.

293
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,120
Can't you see it?

294
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,720
I'm really happy that you can think like that.

295
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,120
By the way, son,

296
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,520
one day you will grow up and have a baby.

297
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,320
If we get married,

298
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,120
will you leave me alone?

299
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,120
Dad, no matter what you become,

300
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,520
I will take care of you and be filial to you.

301
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,120
That's enough.

302
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,120
I can't leave you. I believe you.

303
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,520
But at the same time, I believe in her.

304
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,520
But we are the only family.

305
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,920
Gao Qi is not.

306
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,720
He's playing with you and Wu Yuting.

307
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,720
He and Wu Yuting have already gone to the bank

308
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,720
to make a guarantee for him in the financial project.

309
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,120
It's great that you can think like that.

310
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,920
But I'm very clear.

311
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,720
Wu Yuting is a coward.

312
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,720
Dad is on her side.

313
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,920
Okay, I have a lot of things to do.

314
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,320
You should reflect on my words.

315
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,720
Everything is true.

316
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,120
Everything is true.

317
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,320
I'm leaving, son.

318
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,720
Son, reflect on it.

319
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,320
Everything is true.

320
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,720
Six million in the diamond ring as a wedding diamond.

321
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,120
It's so grand.

322
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,320
After Mr Ying comes down to pay,

323
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,720
change it according to my size.

324
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,920
Okay.

325
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,320
You are a good blue-and-white.

326
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,520
But a little dark.

327
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,920
People say that the person who gives the diamond is not good.

328
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,720
And the diamond is not good either.

329
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,720
I've forgotten the person who gives the ring.

330
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,720
So it doesn't matter whether it's good or not.

331
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,120
You told him not to go to the bank with me.

332
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,000
I see it let him go to his dad.

333
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,880
That's right.

334
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,920
Did they sacrifice you?

335
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,920
They definitely didn't.

336
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,720
There are no such men in the market.

337
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,920
Perhaps, they started doing this to movie lovers.

338
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,320
That's right.

339
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,960
It's strange that a couple around you

340
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,760
I'm sorry.

341
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,760
Where is Mr Ying?

342
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,760
Mr Ye.

343
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,760
You're back. I should go.

344
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,760
Go?

345
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,560
You haven't got off work yet?

346
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,960
My resignation letter

347
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,160
is on your desk.

348
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,760
I'll disappear in a month.

349
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,560
What do you mean?

350
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,160
Mr He, your phone.

351
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,160
Hello?

352
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,960
Mengjie, Gao Qi is getting better.

353
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,960
She's strong.

354
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,960
Let's go.

355
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,960
Amber,

356
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,960
I know you love beef.

357
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,960
So I asked them to bring you

358
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,960
the best and freshest.

359
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,960
Please enjoy.

360
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
Thank you.

361
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,960
Did your mom call you often?

362
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,960
No.

363
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,960
I heard from Zao Qiao that Ying Youjing

364
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,960
brought her to the jewelry store

365
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,960
and bought her a 6 million dollar bill

366
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,960
to propose to her.

367
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,960
Your mom is really smart.

368
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
She can make Ying to promise her

369
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,960
to promote her investment project

370
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,960
to the high-end bank.

371
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,960
That's because you don't help her.

372
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,960
You're so annoying.

373
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,960
That's because your daddy's

374
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,960
rationality is not spoiled.

375
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,960
Don't mention her.

376
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,760
How's school?

377
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,760
This afternoon,

378
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,760
everyone was looking forward to the future.

379
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,760
I suddenly realized

380
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,760
that I have nothing to say.

381
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,760
Because I've been afraid

382
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,760
of everything.

383
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,760
Of course.

384
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,760
Who can enjoy the result

385
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,760
that others can't enjoy

386
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,760
even after graduation

387
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,760
and struggle for decades?

388
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,760
What else can you say?

389
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,760
You're not the only one

390
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
who's in the luck.

391
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,760
My vice president

392
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,760
has no money to spend.

393
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,960
Actually, I'm doing well now.

394
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,960
So I have the right

395
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
to work hard for my classmates.

396
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,960
Then they will be with me

397
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,960
like now.

398
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,960
The future vice president

399
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,960
An Po.

400
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,960
Although I'm biased

401
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,960
and gave such a big position

402
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,960
to my daughter,

403
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,960
I must ask you

404
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,960
to promise me some conditions.

405
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,960
Conditions?

406
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,960
Of course.

407
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,960
There's no lunch that's free.

408
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,960
Tell me.

409
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,960
Okay, the first one.

410
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,960
You can't

411
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,960
let your classmates

412
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,960
to be with you

413
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,960
as you like.

414
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,960
You should know

415
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,960
that our hotel has a brand

416
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,960
and quality.

417
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,960
Everyone

418
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,960
must pass strict screening.

419
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,960
Only after the assessment

420
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,960
can they be hired.

421
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,960
How do you know

422
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,960
that my classmates are not qualified?

423
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,960
Stop it.

424
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,960
Experience is to be accumulated.

425
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,960
There's no way to be perfect.

426
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,960
So,

427
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,960
when you officially

428
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
become the vice president

429
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,960
of our hotel,

430
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,960
all your assistants

431
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,960
and people under you

432
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,960
must be arranged by Dada.

433
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,960
You're so smart.

434
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,960
You're so smart.

435
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,960
The second one.

436
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,960
I hope you can break up with Kang Zirui.

437
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,960
I can't tolerate

438
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,960
my daughter Wu Yuting

439
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,960
to live with others outside.

440
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,960
An Po,

441
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,960
you have no future

442
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,960
with him.

443
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,960
Now, you're just

444
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,960
wasting time with him.

445
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,960
One day,

446
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,960
you'll see

447
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,960
that Dada's decision

448
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,960
is right.

449
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,960
I'm sorry, Dada.

450
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,960
No way.

451
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,960
I suggest you

452
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,960
to go after your mother.

453
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,960
I think

454
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,960
she's with Yujin

455
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,960
for the sake of the excitement.

456
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,960
Because you don't love her.

457
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
Don't think

458
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,960
about love so highly.

459
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,960
Love is the most

460
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
important thing

461
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,960
in your mother's life.

462
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,960
In her eyes,

463
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,960
only money

464
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,960
can make her move forward.

465
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
Thank you for your kindness, Dada.

466
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,960
I'd rather make a mistake.

467
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,960
It's my own decision.

468
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,960
I won't regret

469
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,960
no matter what.

470
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,960
If this is

471
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,960
what you want,

472
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,960
I'm sorry.

473
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,960
I won't be the vice-president.

474
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,960
I'll find someone else.

475
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,960
Mommy.

476
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,960
An Po.

477
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
Honey.

478
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,960
This is

479
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,960
a pretty little gift

480
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,960
I saw upstairs.

481
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,960
It's for you.

482
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,960
Thank you.

483
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,960
What are you doing here?

484
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,960
I'm here to see my daughter.

485
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,960
Any questions?

486
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,960
Amber.

487
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,960
This is

488
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,960
a professional market survey

489
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,960
I did for you

490
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,960
in the US.

491
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,960
Your second-hand store

492
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,960
is very popular in the US.

493
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,960
If you want,

494
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,960
I can help you

495
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,960
open a chain store in China.

496
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,960
I'll help you.

497
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,960
Really?

498
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,960
My F&A

499
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,960
can really open in the US?

500
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,960
Of course.

501
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,960
As long as you're willing

502
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,960
to develop with me in the US,

503
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
I can also

504
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,960
use my connections

505
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,960
to help

506
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
Con-Zi-Rui

507
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
enter Hollywood.

508
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,960
You don't need

509
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
to worry about your future path.

510
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
You can also

511
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,960
be with the man you love most.

512
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
No one

513
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,960
can force you

514
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,960
to do anything else

515
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,960
in the future.

516
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,960
I'm sorry.

517
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,960
No one can force you

518
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,960
to do anything you don't like.

519
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,960
What do you mean

520
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,960
by saying that

521
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,960
in front of Amber?

522
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,960
I don't understand

523
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,960
what you're thinking.

524
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,960
Please tell me

525
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,960
what you want.

526
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,960
Since you're asking me,

527
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,960
I'll be straightforward.

528
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,960
I want my daughter.

529
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,960
You want your daughter?

530
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,960
May I ask you something?

531
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,960
Have you spent

532
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,960
time and energy

533
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,960
on your daughter?

534
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,960
Have you ever cared about her?

535
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,960
Have you spent

536
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,960
every birthday with her?

537
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,960
When she was sick,

538
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,960
did you take care of her

539
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,960
and accompany her?

540
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960
When she was in love,

541
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,960
did you talk to her

542
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,960
in person?

543
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,960
Now you're talking

544
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,960
in front of me

545
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,960
that you want your daughter.

546
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,960
You want your daughter?

547
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,960
This is the funniest joke

548
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,960
I've ever heard this year.

549
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,960
I don't think it's funny at all.

550
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,960
Yes,

551
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,960
I'm not a good mom.

552
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,960
But I can make up for

553
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,960
what you just said.

554
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,960
You can't

555
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,960
give me a chance.

556
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,960
May I ask you something?

557
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,960
Do you know your daughter?

558
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,960
Do you know what

559
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,960
she likes to eat?

560
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,960
Do you know which country

561
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,960
she likes to travel to?

562
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,960
Do you know

563
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,960
who her best friend is?

564
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,960
You don't know anything.

565
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,960
You can't say anything.

566
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,960
I love you.

567
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,960
We have a lot of time.

568
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,960
I can take it slow.

569
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,960
Gao Qi,

570
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,960
what you see

571
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,960
is the benefits

572
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,960
behind your daughter.

573
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,960
You only love yourself.

574
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,960
You won't love anyone.

575
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,960
You're wrong this time.

576
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,960
Amber was born

577
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,960
in my pregnancy in October.

578
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,960
I'm different

579
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,960
from others.

580
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,960
A person who will take

581
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,960
his daughter as a business

582
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,960
and do the math

583
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,960
will have love in his heart.

584
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,960
This is your

585
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,960
false love for me.

586
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,960
This is not fair to me.

587
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,960
Fair?

588
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,960
How dare you

589
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,960
say that in front of me?

590
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,960
I want to ask you,

591
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,960
have you been fair

592
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,960
to us both these years?

593
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,960
So I came back

594
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,960
to make up for you.

595
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,960
No matter how hard I try,

596
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,960
you don't accept me.

597
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,960
It doesn't matter.

598
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,960
But you can't

599
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,960
refuse my compensation

600
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,960
for my daughter.

601
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,960
I promise you

602
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,960
I will give

603
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,960
the best to Amber.

604
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,960
Let her go abroad

605
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,960
with me for five years.

606
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,960
Five years?

607
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,960
I can't stand

608
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,960
my daughter

609
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,960
to be with others

610
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,960
for five years alone

611
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,960
and five years in pain.

612
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,960
I'm telling you,

613
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,960
China is the best

614
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,960
place in the world.

615
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,960
Amber is where I am.

616
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,960
You come and go.

617
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,960
You leave and go.

618
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,960
Do you know

619
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,960
that others have feelings too?

620
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,960
I'm not your pawn.

621
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
I won't follow

622
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,960
the direction you want.

623
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,960
Anyway,

624
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,960
I will never give you

625
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,960
what you want.

626
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,960
You have to make a bet.

627
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
Amber will definitely

628
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,960
go to America with me.

629
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,960
I've never lost anything

630
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,960
that I want.

631
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,960
You can start a fight.

632
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,960
What are you talking about?

633
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,960
Don't play dumb.

634
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,960
What do you want

635
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,960
to do to let my daughter go?

636
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,960
As long as I can afford it,

637
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,960
I'll ask you to bargain.

638
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,960
I will never allow

639
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,960
anyone to hurt Amber.

640
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,960
I will not allow Amber

641
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,960
to be harmed.

642
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,960
Do you understand?

643
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,960
Do you really think

644
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,960
that my love for my daughter

645
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,960
can be bought with money?

646
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,960
It can't be bought with money,

647
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,960
but it can be bought

648
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,960
with a lot of money.

649
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,960
I'm telling you,

650
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,960
you can buy it

651
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,960
with a lot of money.

652
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,960
You're on the side of Ying,

653
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,960
you're the master of the game.

654
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,960
You still want to be on my side,

655
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,960
you don't want to leave empty-handed, do you?

656
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,960
Before I regret it,

657
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,960
you have to start the price.

658
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,960
Otherwise,

659
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,960
you'll be in vain.

660
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,960
Wu Yuting,

661
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,960
you're tough and tough.

662
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
You're great.

663
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,960
I don't want to be

664
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,960
harmed by the same woman

665
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,960
for the second time.

666
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,960
Okay, I want this price.

667
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,960
One hundred million.

668
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,960
What can you guarantee?

669
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,960
I won't see my daughter again.

670
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,960
One hundred million

671
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
can buy Amber's

672
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,960
safety and happiness.

673
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,960
It's worth it.

674
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,960
Then you have to promise

675
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,960
that you will never let Amber

676
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,960
know that you have received this money.

677
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,960
One hundred million.

678
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,960
One hundred million.

679
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,960
A ticket of one hundred million.

680
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,960
You can pay it back right away.

681
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,960
Wu Yuting,

682
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,960
you rejected

683
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,960
the offer

684
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,960
and didn't even give me

685
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,960
a chance.

686
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,960
The most ruthless person

687
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,960
is not me,

688
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,960
but you.

689
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,960
I will make this cold-blooded

690
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,960
snake-eared character

691
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,960
a good one.

692
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,960
Okay, baby,

693
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,960
I'm going home.

694
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,960
Be gentle.

695
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,960
Dad,

696
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,960
do you know that

697
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,960
we're going to

698
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,960
a big customer meeting

699
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,960
in Canada today?

700
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,960
Why didn't you go?

701
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,960
I asked Gao Qi to go.

702
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,960
I'm relieved that she's doing her job.

703
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,960
And don't forget, son,

704
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,960
all these antiques

705
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,960
must be collected.

706
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,960
Gao Qi doesn't like them.

707
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,960
I'm going to the store.

708
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,960
I'll be back soon.

709
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,960
Bye.

710
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,960
Dad,

711
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,960
I'm going to the store.

712
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,960
I'll be back soon.

713
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,960
Bye.

714
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,960
Bye.

715
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,960
Bye.

716
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,960
Bye.

717
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,960
Bye.

718
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,960
Bye.

719
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,960
Bye.

720
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,960
Bye.

721
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,960
Bye.

722
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,960
Bye.

723
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,960
Bye.

724
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,960
You'll never see us again.

725
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,960
If you break up with Gao Qi,

726
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,960
I can't see theolegan Bueno again.

727
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,960
This is different.

728
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,960
How you separate with that woman I don't care.

729
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,960
Thissnime with Gao Qi we won't22

730
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,960
understand?

731
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,960
Dad!

732
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,960
Dad, I know you're doing this for my own good.

733
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,960
But you know me.

734
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,960
I've been working hard all my life.

735
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,960
I've been making money, raising you, and raising you.

736
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,960
Now that you've grown up, you should be able to understand me.

737
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,960
I've never been in love in my life.

738
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,960
Now that I'm well, I have a woman who loves me and I'm happy.

739
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,960
You should be happy for me.

740
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,960
I have feelings, understand?

741
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,960
You're not talking about feelings.

742
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,960
You're playing with fire and self-pity.

743
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,960
You're playing with you!

744
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,960
It's two different things.

745
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,960
I'll ask you one last time.

746
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,960
Which one of us are you?

747
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,960
You're my son.

748
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,960
She's my woman.

749
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,960
I want both of them.

750
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,960
Be more careful, Dad.

751
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,960
What age are you?

752
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,960
Son, don't worry.

753
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,960
I'm very clear.

754
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,960
I've never been in love in my life.

755
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,960
I know you love me.

756
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,960
Take a break.

757
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,960
Don't worry.

758
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,960
It's okay.

759
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,960
Don't forget to buy all the antiques.

760
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,960
Don't forget.

761
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,960
I'll buy all the antiques.

762
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,960
Gao Qi doesn't like them.

763
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,960
I'll buy them all.

764
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,960
Good day, what did you buy?

765
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,960
Oh my God.

766
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,960
Yingdong, Yingdong.

767
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,960
I'm really angry.

768
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,960
It's not me.

769
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,960
Who?

770
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,960
I'm sorry.

771
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,960
I'm sorry.

772
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,960
I'm just curious.

773
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,960
I want to see her.

774
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,960
Are you okay?

775
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,960
Fortunately, I'm fine.

776
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,960
But she broke your love.

777
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,960
What should I do?

778
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,960
You're my love.

779
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,960
If you really think there's a risk,

780
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,960
we can do nothing.

781
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,960
I'll figure it out myself.

782
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,960
No, Mr. Gao.

783
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,960
I'm sincere to you.

784
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,960
I'm 100% sure.

785
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,960
I'm telling you,

786
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,960
I'll do it.

787
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,960
I'm sure.

788
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,960
Do you dare to break your family's uniform?

789
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,960
Do you want to try?

790
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,960
No.

791
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,960
Galaxy,

792
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,960
The number of users is 500.

793
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,960
This is a brand new dress.

794
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,960
I just took it out of the closet.

795
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,960
If I put it in the store,

796
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,960
it may have been robbed by someone.

797
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,960
Okay.

798
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,960
You'd better keep it yourself.

799
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,960
I don't think it's suitable for me.

800
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,960
You and Yindong will soon become

801
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,960
a couple that everyone likes.

802
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,960
How can I get a hug from a pretty dress?

803
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,960
Can her father accept me?

804
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,960
This is not what Yindong's girlfriend,

805
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,960
the future Mrs. Ying,

806
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,960
and the future famous painter say.

807
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,960
You are already half a public figure.

808
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,960
So you will soon receive

809
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,960
a large number of fans, media and audience's reviews.

810
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,960
I have to pack you up.

811
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,960
Well,

812
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,960
Uncle Ying will accept you.

813
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,960
Thank you, Anba.

814
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,960
I'd better give this dress back to you.

815
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,960
I really don't have a chance to wear it.

816
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,960
Okay.

817
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,960
This is for Yindong.

818
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,960
He helped me a lot.

819
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,960
Okay?

820
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,960
Can I ask you a question?

821
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,960
I loved him.

822
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,960
But Yindong and I never started.

823
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,960
You want to ask me

824
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,960
if I loved Yindong.

825
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,960
I loved him.

826
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,960
But it was a long time ago.

827
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,960
We are now

828
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,960
a relationship beyond a boyfriend and girlfriend.

829
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,960
It's a very pure friendship.

830
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,960
Don't tell me you still care about this.

831
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,960
Of course not.

832
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,960
I just want to ask you

833
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,960
if you think Yindong and I

834
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,960
are a match.

835
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,960
A match?

836
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,960
What is a match?

837
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,960
A happy relationship is a match.

838
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,960
A sad relationship is not a match.

839
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,960
I don't know.

840
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,960
But I'm a match with Zirui.

841
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,960
I don't care about anything.

842
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,960
What if

843
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,960
your father doesn't like you two?

844
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,960
Will you give up your father for Zirui?

845
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,960
Yes.

846
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,960
Will you do it for the rest of your life?

847
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,960
Will you?

848
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,960
Why is love so clear?

849
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,960
My daddy is not qualified to

850
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,960
break up with Zirui.

851
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,960
His love with my mommy

852
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,960
was a failure.

853
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,960
Amber, I'm sorry.

854
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,960
I didn't mean to make you

855
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,960
think about unhappy things.

856
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,960
But I'm really confused now.

857
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,960
Can you tell me

858
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,960
whether your mom chose your father

859
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,960
or Yindong's father?

860
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,960
I don't know.

861
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,960
I can't get involved in their affairs.

862
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,960
Amber,

863
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,960
why are you so anxious?

864
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,960
Love is a happy thing, isn't it?

865
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,960
I don't know.

866
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,960
I'm really worried about Yindong.

867
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,960
I don't want him to fight with his father for me.

868
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,960
I don't want his father to give up

869
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,960
his high-class choice.

870
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,960
No way.

871
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,960
You're thinking too much.

872
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,960
No one is better than my mommy

873
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,960
to get along with my daddy.

874
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,960
And

875
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,960
Ying Youjing is definitely

876
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,960
better than my daddy.

877
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,960
Hello?

878
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,960
Yindong.

879
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,960
Wanjia is with me.

880
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,960
She probably didn't hear

881
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,960
your call.

882
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,960
That's good.

883
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,960
Amber,

884
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,960
the worst thing is

885
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,960
Gao Qi and my dad are together.

886
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,960
How could my mommy

887
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,960
be with your daddy?

888
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,960
It's true.

889
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,960
No way.

890
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,960
Don't say it's impossible.

891
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,960
Go back to school with Wanjia.

892
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,960
We'll talk when we meet.

893
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,960
Wanjia?

894
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,960
Your phone is not working.

895
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,960
She doesn't want to see you.

896
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,960
She wants to rethink your relationship.

897
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,960
She thinks that

898
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,960
being with you

899
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,960
is the happiest thing

900
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,960
she has ever had.

901
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,960
I'm sorry.

902
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,960
I'm sorry.

903
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,960
But

904
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,960
what makes her sad is

905
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,960
that she thinks

906
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,960
she can't go into your world.

907
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,960
Your dad's objection

908
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,960
puts a lot of pressure on her.

909
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,960
She feels insecure.

910
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,960
Actually,

911
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,960
I'm the same as Kang Zirui.

912
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,960
But I don't have the courage of Wanjia.

913
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,960
She doesn't want you to face your father

914
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,960
because of love.

915
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,960
She doesn't want you to

916
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,960
face your father.

917
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,960
If

918
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,960
we both have to lose our father

919
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,960
to get love,

920
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,960
will you still love me?

921
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,960
You know,

922
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,960
my answer makes me think

923
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,960
that I only love myself.

924
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,960
I understand.

925
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,960
It turns out

926
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,960
that we are both too selfish.

927
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,960
I want to make it clear

928
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,960
about my mother's relationship.

929
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,960
So that

930
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,960
our relationship situation

931
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,960
will be clear.

932
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,960
I'm afraid that the result

933
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,960
will be more horrible than we expected.

934
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,960
Thank you.

935
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,960
You're so honest with me.

936
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,960
You love Kang Zirui.

937
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,960
I don't know

938
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,960
why I'm saying this to you.

939
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,960
I thought

940
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,960
I would tell everyone about Yu Ping.

941
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,960
Oh, right.

942
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,960
Don't worry.

943
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,960
It's a key to the flower room.

944
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,960
It's good

945
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,960
that

946
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,960
my father has become so strange.

947
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,960
He's so warm.

948
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,960
My mother is getting further away from me.

949
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,960
You won't wait for others

950
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,960
to show their judgement.

951
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,960
As long as you don't leave him,

952
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,960
no one will leave you.

953
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,960
Zirui and I haven't broken up yet.

954
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,960
You two are not in the same boat.

955
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,960
We're not in a relationship.

956
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,960
We

957
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,960
will go to the end

958
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,960
We don't need any reason

959
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,960
We've been through too much

960
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,960
That's what we can't expect

961
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,960
We

962
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,960
will go to the end

963
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,960
We don't have any excuses

964
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,960
When you need it most

965
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,960
We can

966
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,960
keep it in our hearts

967
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:19,960
Da da da

968
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:27,960
Da da da

969
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,960
There is a saying

970
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,960
That you must keep it in your heart

971
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,960
And you will promise

972
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,960
Let me go

973
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,600
I'm holding the rain

974
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,940
Teach me to stop

975
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,480
The chest is moving forward

976
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,840
I've been hurt

977
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:56,040
There are also grudges

978
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,480
You must be with me

979
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,920
Tear and wine

980
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,320
Let's shout together

981
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,600
Let's hold our mouths

982
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,560
Let's stay on the street of drunkenness

983
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,960
We will go to the end

984
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,160
No need for any reason

985
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,320
Too many feelings in your heart

986
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,680
That's what I'm afraid of

987
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,240
We will go to the end

988
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,560
No need for any reason

989
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,120
When the strong there,

990
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:43,520
our best

991
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,100
在我们的肍

992
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:53,500
Be together
