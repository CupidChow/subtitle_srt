1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Thank you for watching!

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I've got so much.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm destined to get no love.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I have daddy, that's enough.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Daddy will love me forever.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You will.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm with you.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I will create our love.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Only I know your pride and sin.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Because we grew up together.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Only when I'm with you,

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
can we make up for our loss.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Why are you with me now?

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Because two people together

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
need to experience a lot of things.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yutong,

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
are you serious?

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Are you really serious now?

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I still have the courage to cry with you.

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Are you okay now?

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Is he okay with you now?

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm okay now.

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I haven't met him yet.

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Will I miss the scenery from yesterday?

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Will I be able to understand the person who loves me?

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I will be brave to ask you the rest of the way.

57
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Thank you for the warm hug you gave me.

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I will be brave to ask you the rest of the way.

59
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Thank you for the warm hug you gave me.

60
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I will be brave to ask you the rest of the way.

61
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Thank you for the warm hug you gave me.

62
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Thank you for the warm hug you gave me.

63
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Thank you for the warm hug you gave me.

64
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Thank you for the warm hug you gave me.

65
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm back.

66
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Jiajia.

67
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Jiajia.

68
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Jiajia.

69
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Jiajia.

70
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Jiajia.

71
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I came to Shanghai alone.

72
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I don't have a family here.

73
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Even if I don't work here now,

74
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
you will always be my family.

75
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Of course.

76
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I only give you a warning.

77
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Whoever is responsible for you,

78
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
you will be with whoever.

79
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Who is this person?

80
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
How is the job I did for my student?

81
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's not good.

82
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I quit.

83
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I quit my job too.

84
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I will not work at the jewelry store anymore.

85
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Next month, I can be at ease.

86
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I will manage my own bar.

87
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Why?

88
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Isn't it good?

89
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I learned it from you.

90
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You speak so fast.

91
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You can't speak it back.

92
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Do you regret it?

93
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I don't regret it.

94
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I...

95
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Ouyang Qiao.

96
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You took the picture, right?

97
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
How is that possible?

98
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I am the first witness.

99
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Now Yingdong is in Amber's house.

100
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Tell me.

101
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Shouldn't we do something tonight?

102
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What?

103
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I am waiting for the result.

104
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What should we do?

105
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What about Kang Zirui?

106
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Don't worry about Kang Zirui.

107
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
He is a master of the love scene.

108
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
This blow is nothing to him.

109
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But it's hard to say about Wan Jia.

110
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Wan Jia is in the hospital.

111
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What?

112
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's so serious.

113
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Ding Yi.

114
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Jia Jia.

115
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You are awake.

116
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You scared us.

117
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Why are you here?

118
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You are not dead yet.

119
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You almost died.

120
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Why are you so careless?

121
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You didn't even turn off the gas.

122
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
He is not dead.

123
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's good that he is dead.

124
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's all in vain.

125
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Don't talk nonsense.

126
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's not a good time.

127
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
What's wrong?

128
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What happened?

129
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
My stomach hurts.

130
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Don't talk.

131
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You didn't want to kill yourself, did you?

132
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You didn't want to say it, did you?

133
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Okay.

134
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'll call Yingdong and ask what happened.

135
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Don't call him.

136
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I don't want to talk to him.

137
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Tell me what happened.

138
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Did Yingdong bully you?

139
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Don't ask.

140
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Don't ask.

141
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I don't want to talk about him.

142
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Did you kill yourself because of Yingdong?

143
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I didn't.

144
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Why would I kill myself for someone who broke up with me?

145
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I saw him and Amber kissing.

146
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
They were together.

147
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Where are you going?

148
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I want to talk to her.

149
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I can't solve any problems.

150
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Sit down.

151
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Jiajia is the weakest and needs company.

152
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'll call Yingdong and ask what happened.

153
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Jiajia.

154
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Jiajia.

155
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Don't cry.

156
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
If Yingdong is really like this,

157
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
he doesn't deserve you to be in love.

158
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And I heard from Yingdong that

159
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
even if the whole world abandoned you,

160
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I would still be by your side and protect you.

161
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Tianyi.

162
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I was wrong.

163
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Is it too late for you to choose me now?

164
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I finally know

165
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
that you are always the best for me,

166
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
not Yingdong.

167
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
How can I be so stupid?

168
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So stupid.

169
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Hello.

171
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Hello.

172
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Director Kang.

173
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
How is the photo I took?

174
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Can you be a photographer?

175
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You are not good enough to be a photographer.

176
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You are not good enough to be a dog team.

177
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Okay, I'll interview you now.

178
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
How do you feel now?

179
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's normal for men and women to be in a relationship.

180
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm not sure if I can be a photographer.

181
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm not sure if I can be a photographer.

182
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's normal for men and women to be in a relationship.

183
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Besides,

184
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
it's normal for men and women to be in a relationship.

185
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Amber and I have broken up peacefully.

186
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Since she has a boyfriend so soon,

187
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I wish her good luck.

188
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Kang Zirui is Kang Zirui.

189
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
He is different.

190
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
He is a drunk old man.

191
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You are fine,

192
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
but it doesn't mean that others are fine.

193
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Have you ever thought about your sister Kang Weiwei?

194
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
My sister?

195
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What does she have to do with this?

196
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It seems that Director Kang is not thoughtful enough.

197
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Do you know that Wanjia committed suicide because of Yingdong?

198
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And Han Dingyi likes Wanjia for a long time.

199
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And Han Dingyi likes Wanjia for a long time.

200
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Now that the family is in trouble,

201
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
do you think Han Dingyi will not take care of Wanjia?

202
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Do you think Han Dingyi will not take care of Wanjia?

203
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What if the two of them are in love again?

204
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What if the two of them are in love again?

205
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Your sister Kang Weiwei

206
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
will definitely become a double-edged sword.

207
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Xiaoliu, I'll go out for a while.

208
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Jiajia,

209
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
why are you so confused?

210
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
What if something happens to you?

211
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What if something happens to you?

212
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What if something happens to me and your father?

213
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What if something happens to me and your father?

214
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Mom, I told you.

215
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm not confused.

216
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I didn't commit suicide.

217
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I was really careless.

218
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I forgot to turn off the gas.

219
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I promise I will be careful in the future.

220
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I promise I will be careful in the future.

221
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I told you earlier.

222
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's not safe for a girl to live outside.

223
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's not safe for a girl to live outside.

224
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's better to move back home.

225
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's better to have a father and a mother to take care of you.

226
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's better to have a father and a mother to take care of you.

227
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That's right.

228
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Mom and Dad,

229
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
it's not as serious as you said.

230
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Look, I'm fine now.

231
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Look, I'm fine now.

232
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm fine now. Look at you.

233
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Silly girl.

234
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Your father is worried about you.

235
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
He's worried about you.

236
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
He's worried about you.

237
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
He's worried about you.

238
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
We don't know what kind of temper he has.

239
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Brother,

240
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
this is not right.

241
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What's wrong?

242
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Look, in this situation,

243
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
the one who is with him is Yingdong.

244
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
After all, we are hundreds of people.

245
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Where is Weiwei?

246
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
That's right.

247
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Didn't she come with you?

248
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
She...

249
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
went out to buy something.

250
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I have to call Yingdong.

251
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
She might be busy and not receive the message.

252
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm leaving first.

253
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'll call you when I'm done.

254
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Look at the picture.

255
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Don't call her.

256
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I said don't call her.

257
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
How can I?

258
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Wei Yangqiao hung up.

259
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Wei Yangqiao is not well.

260
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
How can he make such a big deal?

261
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
He pretended not to know.

262
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
He called his mother.

263
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
He said something happened to the family.

264
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I don't understand.

265
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Did he call me?

266
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Yingdong called me.

267
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Hello, Yingdong.

268
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Hello, Yingdong.

269
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm sorry.

270
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm sorry.

271
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm sorry.

273
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm sorry.

274
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm sorry.

276
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm sorry.

277
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm sorry.

278
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm sorry.

279
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm sorry.

280
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm sorry.

281
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm sorry.

282
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm sorry.

283
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm sorry.

284
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm sorry.

285
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm sorry.

286
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm sorry.

287
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm sorry.

288
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm sorry.

289
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm sorry.

290
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm sorry.

291
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm sorry.

294
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm going to send the lottery ticket to Wan Jia.

295
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,400
Is she okay?

296
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,200
Don't worry.

297
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,000
She's fine.

298
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,800
I'm fine too.

299
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,200
I have a bad signal.

300
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,800
I'll hang up now.

301
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The End

302
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,600
Why are you so careless?

303
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,400
Wan Jia.

304
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Are you still feeling unwell?

305
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,200
Are you still feeling unwell?

306
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,600
I'm fine.

307
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,600
I'll get better.

308
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,800
Everything is over.

309
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
The End

310
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,200
Help me sit up.

311
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
The End

312
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,600
Goodbye.

313
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,200
I brought you your favorite noodles.

314
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,000
I'll make you some.

315
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,200
Thank you for remembering me.

316
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,200
Jiajia.

317
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,600
We're always best friends.

318
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,000
I won't do anything that makes you unhappy.

319
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,400
I'll give you everything you want.

320
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
The End

321
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,600
Why is he here?

322
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,000
I want to take over the world.

323
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,400
Brother.

324
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,400
Come home with me.

325
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
What are you doing?

326
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm staying here with Jiajia.

327
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,200
There's Ding Yi and Ying Dong.

328
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,000
I don't need you.

329
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
The End

330
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,400
Kang Zirui.

331
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,800
Why are you here?

332
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,800
You have the right to talk about me.

333
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,000
We broke up.

334
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,000
It's none of your business.

335
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Brother.

336
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,800
Can you stop being so stubborn?

337
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,800
This is a ward.

338
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,800
Come on. I'll go with you.

339
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,400
Don't bother Jiajia.

340
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,800
Wait.

341
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,400
Since I'm here,

342
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,200
I'll make it clear.

343
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,000
Ying Dong.

344
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You broke up with Wanjia not long ago.

345
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
You want to be with Amber, right?

346
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,800
And you, Ding Yi.

347
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,600
Since you want to be with my sister,

348
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,000
you should treat her well.

349
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,800
Don't get in my way.

350
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,400
I'll make it clear to you two.

351
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,000
One is my sister.

352
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,800
The other is my sister.

353
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,800
If anything happens to them,

354
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,600
I won't let you off.

355
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,600
What's wrong?

356
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,800
You're still talking?

357
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,200
Speak!

358
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,000
Tell me.

359
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,600
I'm thinking too much.

360
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,800
This is not the case.

361
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,000
Brother.

362
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,200
We're best friends.

363
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,600
No one can affect our relationship.

364
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,200
Can you stop trying to get away from me?

365
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,800
Shut up!

366
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,800
You're not talking?

367
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,000
Fine.

368
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,600
You two can see for yourselves.

369
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,600
What are you doing?

370
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,200
It's already dawn.

371
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm so tired.

372
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,800
I'm going to sleep.

373
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,600
I'm going to sleep.

374
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,600
I'm going to sleep.

375
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,600
I'm going to sleep.

376
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,600
I'm going to sleep.

377
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,600
I'm going to sleep.

378
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,400
It's already dawn.

379
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,600
Yes.

380
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,200
It's already dawn.

381
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,400
So bad things will disappear.

382
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,000
No.

383
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,400
This is not an ordinary thing.

384
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,200
This is just the beginning.

385
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,000
Actually, I think

386
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,400
it's a good thing that Kong Sijui

387
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,000
has opened all the books.

388
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,600
So we don't have to hide

389
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,600
the truth from others.

390
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,400
Do you remember

391
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,600
when you were in school,

392
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,400
you always chased Yingdong away?

393
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,200
You liked him so much.

394
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,600
So you two being together

395
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,200
is something that will happen sooner or later.

396
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,200
You don't have to blame yourself.

397
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,200
But what about Wan Jia?

398
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,000
What does she think?

399
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,600
Wan Jia and Yingdong broke up

400
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,000
is also something that will happen sooner or later.

401
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,200
It's not right to not be a couple.

402
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,400
What you're doing now

403
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,600
is to find a good way

404
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,400
to get better soon.

405
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,000
You didn't invent the breakup.

406
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,400
Why are you sad?

407
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,400
You won't.

408
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,400
Since I was born,

409
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
it's the first time I've seen Yingdong so sad

410
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,200
and so lost.

411
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,400
The moment he put the ring on me,

412
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,600
I suddenly felt that I should help him.

413
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,600
After all,

414
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,080
he always had a high-class

415
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,600
and good singing skills.

416
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,200
Everyone's life roles are chosen by themselves.

417
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,200
Let me ask you.

418
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,800
Do you know Yingdong?

419
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,400
I used to worship him seriously.

420
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,200
Now,

421
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,600
I really don't know.

422
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,400
Maybe it's because the relationship between me and Ziyue

423
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,200
has made me mature too much.

424
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,000
I know that

425
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,200
love is not that absolute.

426
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,200
I see.

427
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
Although

428
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,000
Jia Jia and I

429
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,400
are not as close as Weiwei and her,

430
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,000
I'm so happy

431
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,000
to treat these two girls

432
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,000
as my best friends.

433
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,200
I can't

434
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,000
explain to the Wang family.

435
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,800
Seeing his eyes on the bed,

436
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,800
I feel sorry for him.

437
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,600
But I can't give everyone an answer.

438
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,000
I don't want Yingdong

439
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
to lose his heart in front of everyone.

440
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,200
Do you know?

441
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,600
In my opinion,

442
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,000
the Wang family and Weiwei

443
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,800
don't want to lose a good friend like you.

444
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,800
In other words,

445
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,600
even if you lose someone,

446
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,600
the old will leave and the new will come back.

447
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Love is the same.

448
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,200
Love is even more so.

449
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,800
It's really hard for us young people to fall in love.

450
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It's too tiring.

451
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,000
Yes, it's very hard.

452
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,400
If love is like

453
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,000
him coming,

454
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,000
but you don't want to go,

455
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,000
that's good.

456
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,000
You can leave all your beautiful memories here.

457
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,800
If you delete all the bad memories,

458
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,600
that's good.

459
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,800
No one will believe anyone.

460
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,800
You're so straightforward.

461
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,800
Yes.

462
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,400
I'm telling you everything

463
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,800
that all men dare not say.

464
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,200
In fact, the feeling of being with you

465
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,200
is much more comfortable than being with Yingdong and Zirui.

466
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,200
You don't have to think about anything

467
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,800
and you don't have to pay for your life.

468
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,400
You finally start to appreciate me.

469
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,400
Mom, why are you here?

470
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,600
The Wang family committed suicide.

471
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,800
You're still chasing Amber out.

472
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,200
I knew you were here from the sixth sense.

473
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,200
It's just a breakup.

474
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,200
What's so great about it?

475
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,200
Go home.

476
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,200
I have a lot to tell Amber.

477
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,800
Amber, don't listen to her.

478
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,200
It's all nonsense. It's all fake.

479
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,000
Don't believe her.

480
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,000
How can you say that about your son?

481
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,200
Shut up.

482
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,600
Go home with me.

483
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,400
Go.

484
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,000
Let's talk another day.

485
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,800
Hurry up.

486
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,600
What are you doing? Tell me.

487
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,400
How shameless.

488
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,200
Stop talking nonsense.

489
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,800
How can I see anyone in the future?

490
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,400
Honey,

491
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,200
are you really ready

492
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,400
to leave the second store

493
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,200
to my jewelry store?

494
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,000
Yes.

495
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,000
Look at Ying's situation now.

496
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,000
He can't leave the store empty.

497
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,000
But, Ye,

498
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,400
you know that most of my customers are old.

499
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,800
They are very picky.

500
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,000
So I hope you

501
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,600
can let a professional chef take care of it.

502
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,400
For example, Miss Meng...

503
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,000
What?

504
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,400
Hua Mengjun.

505
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
You mean the one who looks like your friend's wife?

506
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,600
Yes, that's her.

507
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,000
No problem.

508
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,600
But she was a little emotional

509
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,400
some time ago.

510
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,200
She said she wanted to resign.

511
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,000
My customers couldn't bear to leave her.

512
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,600
So I took this opportunity

513
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
to find a table

514
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,400
and bring her back.

515
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,800
Yes.

516
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,200
How is Ying's situation now?

517
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,600
Ying is in a terrible situation.

518
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,800
She hasn't woken up yet.

519
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,400
It's like her business.

520
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,600
She can't be a good person anymore.

521
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,600
All banks will not help her.

522
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,400
You don't have enough money

523
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,800
to pay the rent for the second half of your life.

524
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,400
Yes.

525
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
We are old friends.

526
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,800
We should save some money.

527
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,800
Gao Wei.

528
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,400
But I want to remind you.

529
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,800
You are always right about Ying.

530
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,000
Gao Qi is your ex-wife.

531
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,400
I've been prepared for this.

532
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,800
I've been in the business for years.

533
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,200
I've been very careful.

534
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,400
You don't believe me?

535
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,200
To be honest,

536
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,200
I still don't understand.

537
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,800
Why are you so lucky

538
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,600
that you didn't get a high-class job?

539
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,400
I was able to get a full-time job.

540
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,800
Thanks to an old friend's reminder.

541
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,000
I don't believe it.

542
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,800
What?

543
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,200
Tell me.

544
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,000
What's your relationship with Amber?

545
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,800
Did you hook up with her?

546
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,800
I don't have a relationship with Amber.

547
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,200
But it doesn't mean I don't have a relationship with her.

548
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,400
What?

549
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I'm warning you.

550
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,400
Don't touch Amber.

551
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,800
I hate rich people the most.

552
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,800
Do you know that?

553
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,800
Mom.

554
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,400
Are you afraid that my precious son

555
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,000
will be taken away by someone else?

556
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,200
Don't worry.

557
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,600
I'm just using the money

558
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,200
that I don't have.

559
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,200
I'll take him back.

560
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,600
You think your mom won't marry you?

561
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,800
Let me tell you.

562
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,400
When I was working at the jewelry store,

563
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,400
many men gave me jewelry.

564
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,400
I didn't want to marry them.

565
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,800
How about this?

566
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,600
I'll ask Amber to introduce her dad to you.

567
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,200
What did you say?

568
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,000
Wu Yuting is pretty good.

569
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,200
Say that again.

570
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,000
She's really good.

571
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,800
Wu Yuting is the national chicken who has won many women's basketball.

572
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,800
Besides,

573
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,200
you've quit your job.

574
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,800
Where are you going to meet Fu Hao?

575
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,400
I'll kill you.

576
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,400
I'll kill you.

577
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,600
Mom.

578
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,400
How can you talk to your mom?

579
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,200
I'll open my mouth and eat.

580
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,000
Is it too late for me to choose you?

581
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,800
I finally know

582
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,800
that you're the best for me.

583
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,800
Not for Yingdong.

584
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,000
I'm in love with another beauty

585
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,000
She likes him

586
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,000
On the other side of the sea

587
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,000
I've seen him for a year

588
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,400
Even the yearning is a sign

589
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,000
Close your eyes and open your eyes

590
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,000
The fireworks are burning

591
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,200
Time is like a flood

592
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,000
The first night of the year

593
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,000
Will be every day

594
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,200
Come closer to me

595
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,600
He saw me

596
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,800
How can he find

597
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,200
The familiar face on the left

598
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,600
It's too simple for him

599
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,200
Because he can see

600
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,200
The story is about him

601
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,200
I'm looking for you.

602
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,200
Why are you wearing a white hula hoop?

603
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,800
You're not going to the funeral?

604
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,800
Is this your clothes?

605
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,200
I found it. Thank you.

606
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,000
When did you start dating Guo Qing?

607
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,800
Who?

608
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,200
You.

609
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,200
Who?

610
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,400
I knew you wouldn't admit it.

611
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,200
How dare you touch the director's daughter?

612
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,400
Who is the director's daughter?

613
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,600
I'm not talking to you.

614
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,200
I'm not talking to you.

615
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,200
Hello.

616
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,200
Is she the director's daughter?

617
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,200
She has told her father that you two are close.

618
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,200
Huang Youxi, you don't want to graduate, do you?

619
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,800
I'm bothering her.

620
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,600
You say, you say.

621
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,200
Isn't this a clear complaint against me?

622
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,200
Cheating my teacher.

623
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,200
You are so pitiful this time.

624
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,400
You are so bad.

625
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,200
It's because someone is out of the picture.

626
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,200
You are so bad.

627
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,000
Who will believe you when something happens?

628
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,200
Hello, what are you talking about?

629
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,200
I didn't hear you.

630
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,200
I think this is 80% true.

631
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,800
Huang Youxi, you can tell me.

632
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,600
This is all your own.

633
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,200
I'm already like this.

634
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,600
You are still in the same boat.

635
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,800
Are you friends or not?

636
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,200
All right, don't talk about my brother.

637
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,200
Think about him once.

638
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,200
The key is still Qing.

639
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,200
What do you think of others?

640
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,200
You don't believe me, do you?

641
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,200
You know I'm thin.

642
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,200
No wonder that girl wants you to be handsome.

643
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,200
All the girls want to send you something, right?

644
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,200
Hello.

645
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,200
Why is it you again?

646
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,200
What?

647
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,200
Me?

648
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,200
Hello, I'm Ye Feifei, the referee of the historical period.

649
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,200
I'm your new schoolmate.

650
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:02,200
By the way, I'm the main writer of the new issue.

651
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,200
So please support me.

652
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,200
Huang Youxi.

653
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,200
You know my name?

654
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,200
You are a celebrity.

655
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,200
All the women are writing for you.

656
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,200
That's great.

657
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,200
I dare to ask you.

658
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,200
Your love life is so chaotic.

659
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,200
Who are you with now?

660
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,200
I'm tired.

661
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,200
I don't want to see anyone.

662
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,200
I want to be alone.

663
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,200
Why are you so ungrateful?

664
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,200
Okay, I won't bother you.

665
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,200
I'm leaving.

666
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,200
Bye.

667
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,200
What?

668
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,200
She is the daughter of the new director?

669
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,200
Oh my god.

670
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,200
How can I have such a son?

671
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,200
Mr. Lan, can you help me transfer the film?

672
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,200
Can you write me a recommendation letter?

673
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,200
Recommendation letter?

674
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,200
I don't want to help you.

675
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,200
You know what your son is like.

676
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,200
He is full of flaws and is full of flaws.

677
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,200
How can I recommend him?

678
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,200
I can't lie to you, right?

679
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,200
Okay, okay.

680
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,200
I'll solve this myself.

681
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,200
Thank you.

682
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,200
You're welcome.

683
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,200
You also go to college in Bohan University?

684
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,200
Yes, I'm in the history department.

685
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,200
What a coincidence.

686
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,200
My two sons are also in the college.

687
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,200
Really?

688
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,200
That's so lucky.

689
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,200
You are classmates.

690
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,200
By the way, why did you buy so many things alone?

691
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,200
My bar staff resigned.

692
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,200
So I have to do all these work by myself.

693
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,200
At this time, my sons are in the college.

694
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,200
Why are you staying here?

695
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,200
I'm looking for a part-time job.

696
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,200
Because the rent is not cheap.

697
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,200
Really?

698
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,200
That's great.

699
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,200
I'm also looking for someone.

700
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,200
Our bar is short of people.

701
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,200
Go to my bar and see if you can get used to it.

702
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,200
Really?

703
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,200
Of course.

704
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,200
You are my son's schoolmate.

705
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,200
I'm sorry.

706
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,200
Let's go and see.

707
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,200
You can call me Meng in the future.

708
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,200
I'm Meng. I'm Yue Fei Fei.

709
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,200
Fei Fei.

710
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,200
Meng, I'm sorry.

711
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,200
I'm late.

712
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,200
Let me help you.

713
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,200
It's okay. Someone helped me.

714
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,200
Why are you here again?

715
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,200
I want to believe in fate.

716
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,200
Thank you for your help.

717
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,200
It's no use to have a son.

718
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,200
It's better to have two daughters.

719
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,200
Two handsome daughters.

720
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,200
Yes.

721
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,200
You are Lin Xi.

722
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,200
Meng, this bar is so beautiful.

723
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,200
Can I take a look?

724
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,200
Of course.

725
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,200
There is a stage where you can sing.

726
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,200
Yes.

727
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
Can I take a picture?

728
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,200
Yes.

729
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,200
It's not easy to find a good man.

730
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,200
Is this bar yours?

731
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,200
No.

732
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,200
I'm the one who takes care of it.

733
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,200
I make money to pay my son for college.

734
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,200
Meng is really capable.

735
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,200
Your husband must be very happy.

736
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,200
Meng is a mother and a father.

737
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,200
There are many good women in the world.

738
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,200
It's not easy to find a good man.

739
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,200
Then I won't find him.

740
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,200
I'm sorry.

741
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,200
I'm sorry.

742
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,200
I won't find him.

743
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,200
It's like finding a man at my age.

744
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,200
Feifei, you are so sweet.

745
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,200
How about working here for a few days?

746
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,200
Really?

747
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,200
Of course.

748
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,200
Thank you so much.

749
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,200
You can take a look.

750
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,200
OK.

751
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,200
Take a look.

752
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,200
Are you really going to let him work here?

753
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,200
Yes.

754
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,200
I have a relationship with him.

755
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,200
It's time.

756
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,200
Why don't you go back to the V-Live?

757
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,200
I want to wait a while.

758
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,200
Tell me.

759
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,200
Is it because of Wanjia,

760
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,200
you and Dingyi are hiding from each other?

761
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,200
Mom.

762
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,200
Hello.

763
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,200
What's wrong?

764
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,200
Let's go to dinner.

765
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,200
I'll bring you after dinner.

766
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,200
I'm in no hurry.

767
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,200
You can talk to Weiwei for a while.

768
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,200
Weiwei.

769
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,200
Did you intentionally hide from me these two years?

770
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,200
You think too much.

771
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,200
It's just a coincidence.

772
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,200
It's just a coincidence.

773
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,200
Hand in hand, I can give up everything

774
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,200
I'm a loser.

775
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,200
I want to be like a bug

776
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,200
I'm not that big.

777
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,200
I say

778
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,200
Men, women

779
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,200
Have other people's thoughts

780
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,200
It's hard to grow up.

781
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,200
I'm afraid of feeling lacking

782
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,200
Men, women

783
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,200
The more I want to answer

784
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,200
The more I can't keep up with the pace

785
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,200
Farewell is the wrong way to bear

786
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,200
The End

787
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,200
There is a word

788
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,200
No need to say it out

789
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:25,200
You will not hesitate to reach out

790
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,200
Be a blessing for me

791
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:35,200
I will not hesitate to reach out

792
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,200
I will not hesitate to reach out

793
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,200
Be a blessing for me

794
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,200
I will not hesitate to reach out

795
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,200
Be a blessing for me

796
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,200
I have been hurt

797
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,200
There are also sorrow

798
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,200
You must be with me

799
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:06,200
I cry for a long time

800
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,200
Let's shout together

801
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,200
Let's keep our mouth shut together

802
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:18,200
Let's stay on the street of the drunk

803
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,200
I will not go to the end

804
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,200
No need for any reason

805
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,200
I have experienced too much in you

806
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,200
That is the most important thing for me

807
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,200
We will go to the end

808
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,200
We will have the end

809
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,200
When we need each other the most

810
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,200
We can stop the time

811
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:52,200
In our era

812
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,200
Together

813
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,200
Together

814
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,200
Together
