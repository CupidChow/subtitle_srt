D higher être

2
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:39,400
Hour

3
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,200
Something happened to your employee.

4
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,040
You being such an asshole, tell me, what's up?

5
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,860
Good joke.

6
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,480
About thatим sparrowữacked asshole Cuong?

7
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,240
Don't forget who� ayud Padamana did this mess up.

8
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,840
The number you're the one who called.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You want to dig my grave?

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You're still far from it.

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
My job is to investigate what others can't.

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Why do you give up working with me?

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Didn't I say that we're friends after breaking up?

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We are forever partners in work.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You're the hunter, I'm the hunter.

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You plan every news.

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's a one-way street.

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Light women should focus more on their work.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Why don't we work together again?

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Hey, don't think I'll let you go.

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll kill you and your bitch.

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll make a news article and ruin your life.

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
When I'm out of the house, I'll go to see your boss.

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'll tell him everything.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Wait and see.

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Do you have to hate me?

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yes.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
How could you do this?

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You're too much.

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
My phone.

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Let go of me!

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Are you mad or what?

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Are you aside or what?

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm not going there anymore.

35
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What happened?

36
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I think your ex is going there.

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,480
But they need to try.

38
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,280
Guys, you can't leave me alone.

39
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,000
Oh my God, it hurts my heart so much...

40
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,000
Lhasa!

41
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

42
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm so sorry.

83
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,540
D elf

84
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,220
0

85
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,880
0

86
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,940
0

87
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,160
You wanna cry?

88
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,820
Give me my shoulder.

89
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,400
Then wipe me with a knife and a tear.

90
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,820
Why do you have to cry?

91
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,060
Don't hate your ex-boyfriend.

92
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,060
Sadness and tears are the price of love.

93
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,060
If you're not happy, I'll kiss you again.

94
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,060
You're a pervert.

95
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,060
Think about Yang Guang.

96
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,060
I'm sorry.

97
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,060
You look so beautiful.

98
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,060
We're just doing an interview.

99
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,060
I'm not taking pictures.

100
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,060
You don't have to be so formal.

101
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,060
That's not good.

102
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,060
A person's words are related to his mood.

103
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,060
And the mood will be influenced by the way he dresses.

104
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,060
If you want my interview to be wonderful,

105
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,060
I have to dress up.

106
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,060
You're too much.

107
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,060
Let's get started.

108
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,060
Okay.

109
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,060
Actually, today I'm going to talk about

110
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,060
a new program of the school.

111
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,060
In this program,

112
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,060
we will talk about the growth experiences of each school.

113
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,060
Students can learn about the school.

114
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,060
As the first guest,

115
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,060
I want to ask you

116
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,060
from appearance to family history

117
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,060
and even personality.

118
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,060
I have to ask you.

119
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,060
Feifei, you made the right choice.

120
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,060
You can ask me.

121
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,060
I'll answer you.

122
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,060
Okay.

123
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,060
Since you're so cooperative,

124
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,060
I think you know what everyone wants to know.

125
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,060
It's not your family situation

126
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,060
or learning state,

127
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,060
but the love history.

128
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,060
So I don't know if it's convenient for you to answer.

129
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,060
Of course it's convenient.

130
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,060
I'm not like those girls who are shy.

131
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,060
Isn't it just a relationship?

132
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,060
Love is as important as eating.

133
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,060
Everyone needs to eat.

134
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,060
Everyone needs to fall in love.

135
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,060
Why not?

136
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,060
I'm happy to share it with you.

137
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,060
Okay, let's try your first love.

138
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,060
Keke,

139
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,060
put the things you need to prepare for the meeting

140
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,060
on my desk.

141
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,060
Okay, boss.

142
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,060
Are you going back with me?

143
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,060
I want to buy a dress.

144
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,060
Go and get ready.

145
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,060
Boss Wu, can I help you?

146
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,060
You work here?

147
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,060
You haven't graduated from school yet.

148
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,060
It seems that you have a good skill.

149
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,060
I was hired by Pog.

150
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,060
Pog?

151
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:00,060
It seems that you're not a good student.

152
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,060
I'm not a good student.

153
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,060
I'm a good student.

154
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,060
I'm a good student.

155
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,060
It seems that the so-called famous stores

156
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,060
don't have strict standards for hiring.

157
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,060
Boss Wu, are you dissatisfied with my service attitude?

158
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,060
It's okay, I can ask my colleague for help.

159
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,060
No need.

160
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,060
I always pay attention to the quick and accurate.

161
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,060
Time is money.

162
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,060
I won't waste my time on these boring things.

163
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,060
You can see the dress.

164
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,060
This is the latest one.

165
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,060
Hello?

166
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,060
Hello?

167
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,060
Yes.

168
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:45,060
I told you that we can't exceed the price of the dress.

169
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,060
Otherwise, we'll lose money.

170
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,060
What?

171
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,060
You've already made a bid?

172
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:56,060
Then tell the organizer that we're in a hurry.

173
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,060
You have to find a way for me.

174
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,060
Don't come to work tomorrow.

175
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,060
You...

176
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,060
I...

177
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,060
Sir!

178
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,060
Uncle Wu!

179
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,060
Uncle Wu!

180
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,060
Uncle Wu!

181
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,060
Go, go, go!

182
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,060
Uncle Wu!

183
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,060
Wake up!

184
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,060
My first love is Kang Zirui.

185
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,060
I think everyone knows this.

186
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,060
But the first person I like is not him.

187
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,060
It's Yingdong.

188
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,060
But for some reasons...

189
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,060
You know, sometimes love can't solve problems.

190
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,060
You have to meet the right person at the right time.

191
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:46,060
So, I'm with Kang Zirui, who can't be with a single person.

192
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:52,060
But I think it's a good thing that God arranged it.

193
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,060
If I hadn't seen that part of Kang Zirui,

194
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,060
I wouldn't have matured so quickly.

195
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,060
Your father is a married man.

196
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:06,060
Will his relationship with you have any impact?

197
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,060
Of course it will.

198
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,060
That's why I'm looking forward to love.

199
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,060
Actually, I do want my father to fall in love.

200
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,060
But he rejects all the girls I introduce to him.

201
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:24,060
Is your father a confidant or a lover?

202
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,060
No way.

203
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,060
My father will never fall in love without my consent.

204
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,060
What if I knew this person before?

205
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,060
Excuse me.

206
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,060
Hello?

207
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,060
What?

208
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,060
My father has a heart attack?

209
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,060
I have to go.

210
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,060
Okay, I'll be right there.

211
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,060
What happened?

212
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,060
My father is in the hospital.

213
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,060
Excuse me, we'll meet again.

214
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,060
I'm sorry.

215
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,060
I'm sorry.

216
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,060
I'm sorry.

217
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,060
I'm sorry.

218
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,060
I'm sorry.

219
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,060
I'm sorry.

220
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,060
I'm sorry.

221
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,060
I'm sorry.

222
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,060
I'm sorry.

223
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,060
I'm sorry.

224
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,060
I'm sorry.

225
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,060
I'm sorry.

226
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,060
I'm sorry.

227
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,060
I'm sorry.

228
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,060
I'm sorry.

229
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,060
I'm sorry.

230
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,060
I'm sorry.

231
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,060
I'm sorry.

232
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,060
I'm sorry.

233
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,060
I'm sorry.

234
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,060
I'm sorry.

235
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,060
I'm sorry.

236
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,060
I'm sorry.

237
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,060
I'm sorry.

238
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,060
I'm sorry.

239
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,060
I'm sorry.

240
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,060
I'm sorry.

241
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,060
I'm sorry.

242
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,060
Uncle Wu, you're awake.

243
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,060
Have some water.

244
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,060
You...

245
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,060
You've been here all this time?

246
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,060
Yes, I've been waiting for you to wake up.

247
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,060
Why don't you leave?

248
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,060
This world is not as cold as you think.

249
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,060
Your daughter is my friend.

250
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,060
Even if she's not,

251
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,060
I'll help you if I see a stranger in trouble.

252
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,060
Besides,

253
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,060
Wu Anpo is so fierce.

254
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,060
If she knew I was going to die,

255
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,060
she would kill me.

256
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,060
All right.

257
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,060
You're all right.

258
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,060
You're safe now.

259
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,060
You're safe now.

260
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,060
Are you kidding me?

261
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,060
If you really have a problem,

262
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,060
you should have someone

263
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,060
to help you.

264
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,060
You're so mean.

265
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,060
Daddy, are you all right?

266
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,060
You scared me.

267
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,060
Let me see.

268
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,060
It's all right, baby.

269
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,060
I won't leave you.

270
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,060
Besides,

271
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,060
there are so many bad people out there.

272
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,060
I can't be at ease.

273
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,060
It's all right.

274
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,060
All right.

275
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,060
You want to get together?

276
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,060
I won't bother you anymore.

277
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,060
I'll go to the bathroom.

278
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,060
I'll go to the bathroom.

279
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,060
I'll go to the bathroom.

280
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,060
I'll go to the bathroom.

281
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,060
I'm leaving.

282
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,060
Bye.

283
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,060
Who's that?

284
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,060
Wait.

285
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,060
What?

286
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,060
When I'm discharged,

287
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,060
come to my house for dinner.

288
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,060
I'll thank you for taking me to the hospital.

289
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,060
I, Wu Yuting,

290
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,060
never owe anyone anything.

291
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,060
All right.

292
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,060
Remember to prepare some good wine and good food.

293
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,060
Take care of yourself.

294
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,060
See you later.

295
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,060
You scared me.

296
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,060
It's all right.

297
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,060
I'll go to the bathroom.

298
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,060
Here, have some water.

299
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,060
Thank you.

300
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,060
Director,

301
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,060
there are some reporters over there.

302
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,060
I think they're just gossiping.

303
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,060
How can there be so much money to play with them?

304
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,060
Gossiping is not only for digging,

305
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,060
but also for making.

306
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,060
These reporters

307
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,060
are nothing to me.

308
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,060
I'm not a reporter.

309
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,060
I'm a reporter.

310
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,060
I'm a reporter.

311
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,060
I'm a reporter.

312
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,060
I'm a reporter.

313
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,060
I'm a reporter.

314
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,060
Full of snack?

315
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,060
I'm full.

316
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,060
I'm a reporter.

317
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,060
I'm a reporter.

318
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,060
With such special lifecycle,

319
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,060
such 실� circuit or such silly calmeric factory,

320
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,060
it all enables to make all these Reno traveler Sanini,

321
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,060
they can make everything.

322
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,060
Look.

323
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,060
Especially that deputy.

324
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,060
See?

325
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,060
Everyone shelves��

326
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,060
to you just shyly.

327
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,060
There are a lot of ingredients.

328
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,060
Hello?

329
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:25,060
Hello, Yingdong, it's me, Kang Zirui.

330
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,060
Is Amber with you?

331
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,060
No, why are you looking for her?

332
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,060
You have to watch Amber, don't let her get close to Ye Fei Fei.

333
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,060
She is from the Gaozi team.

334
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,060
And she is probably here to get revenge.

335
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,060
You have to protect Amber.

336
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,060
Hello?

337
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,060
Hello, I'm Zirui.

338
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,060
I have a letter for you.

339
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,060
I hope you have a good time.

340
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,060
I'll see you in the next video.

341
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,060
Bye.

342
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,060
I'm a little bit lost.

343
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,060
I'm lost in the drama.

344
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,060
It's almost time.

345
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,060
We'll go to the hotel later.

346
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,060
I'll go with you.

347
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,060
Brother.

348
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,060
You're here.

349
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,060
Zirui, come here.

350
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,060
Why are you here?

351
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,060
I have something to discuss with Yingdong.

352
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,060
Why are you with him?

353
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,060
You'll know in a while.

354
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,060
Now we are on the same page.

355
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,060
Go and sit down.

356
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,060
Let's go.

357
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,060
Okay.

358
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,060
Zirui.

359
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,060
Come on.

360
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,060
Come on.

361
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,060
Yingdong, why did you call us here?

362
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,060
You'll know in a while.

363
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,060
Be quiet.

364
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,060
We are here to play a game.

365
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,060
What game?

366
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,060
What game?

367
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,060
The name of this game is

368
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,060
The Way of the Sun.

369
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,060
What game?

370
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,060
We are good friends.

371
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,060
There's nothing to hide.

372
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,060
Take out your student ID.

373
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,060
Student ID?

374
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,060
Why do you need it?

375
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,060
Take it out first.

376
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,060
You young people are so boring.

377
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,060
What's so fun about student ID?

378
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,060
Take it.

379
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,060
Who's afraid of who?

380
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,060
I should have shown you my student ID.

381
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,060
I saved you a lot of time when I was taking pictures.

382
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,060
You've seen it before.

383
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,060
Ye Fei Fei.

384
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,060
Where's your student ID?

385
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,060
I forgot it at home.

386
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,060
I can't get it.

387
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,060
I'll give it to you.

388
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,060
She won't have a student ID.

389
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,060
Because she's not a student of our school.

390
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,060
What did you say?

391
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,060
Mom.

392
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,060
Yingdong was right.

393
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,060
I've checked.

394
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,060
There's no one like her in our school history department.

395
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,060
Why did you take it?

396
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,060
Yes.

397
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,060
I'm not a student of this school.

398
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,060
Fei Fei.

399
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,060
Why did you do that?

400
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,060
Because...

401
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,060
I've always liked a guy in this school.

402
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,060
I really want to get close to him, so...

403
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,060
Okay.

404
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,060
Tell me.

405
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,060
Who's the guy you're in love with?

406
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,060
It's...

407
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,060
So annoying.

408
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,060
It's more than I thought.

409
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,060
I'm not a rich guy.

410
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,060
Okay, don't guess.

411
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,060
That guy is a rich guy.

412
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,060
He's more than me.

413
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,060
Okay, don't waste time.

414
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,060
Let me tell you the truth.

415
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,060
Ye Fei Fei.

416
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,060
I've seen you before.

417
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,060
You're a reporter in a entertainment magazine.

418
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,060
Your nickname is Cixi.

419
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,060
Right?

420
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,060
You're a rich guy?

421
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,060
Yes.

422
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,060
I'm a rich guy.

423
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,060
Then why did you come to our school?

424
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:27,060
Do you want to investigate my father and Gao Qi?

425
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,060
Yes, I came for this.

426
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:37,060
Actually, I think your father and Gao Qi are not that important.

427
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,060
They're not important.

428
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,060
I came for this.

429
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:45,060
Actually, I think your father and Gao Qi are not that important.

430
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:49,060
They can make the public think that your father is the rich guy.

431
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:54,060
And I also reported about your relationship with Amber.

432
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:59,060
Everyone thought that you were a family of the rich.

433
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,060
So you're a family of the rich.

434
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,060
It's just a hope.

435
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,060
You're a rich guy.

436
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:13,060
You're destined to inherit a fortune.

437
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,060
Congratulations, Mengjie.

438
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,060
This is not a normal marriage.

439
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,060
This is called a dream.

440
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:28,060
It means that you have a chance to make up with your old love.

441
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:43,060
Mengjie, this photo is half of the whole picture.

442
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,060
There seems to be another person next to it.

443
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,060
Where is he now?

444
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,060
Stop!

445
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,060
Amber!

446
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,060
Amber!

447
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,060
What are you doing?

448
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,060
Let go!

449
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,060
Let go!

450
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,060
What are you thinking?

451
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,060
Do you know how dangerous it is to be with him?

452
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,060
Is it safe?

453
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,060
Safe?

454
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,060
Tell me what is safe?

455
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,060
Is it safe to be with you?

456
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,060
When I chose to be with you,

457
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:23,060
I was under the pressure of being scolded by the Wan family.

458
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:26,060
Although I know that your family may be in a bankruptcy,

459
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,060
I still feel very safe.

460
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,060
Because you need me.

461
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,060
If Ye Fei Fei makes Gao Qi's life difficult,

462
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,060
and your family's money is back,

463
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:38,060
will you still need me?

464
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,060
Silly girl!

465
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,060
Why are you so stupid?

466
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:47,060
Your love has nothing to do with money or interests.

467
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,060
Promise me.

468
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:52,060
Don't think about it alone anymore, okay?

469
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:57,060
Lin Dong, I'm really scared.

470
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,060
Because I'm the only heir to my father.

471
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,060
I don't have any brothers or sisters.

472
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:06,060
So I can only find someone to hold me.

473
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:10,060
I've already missed Dr. Kang Zui.

474
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:13,060
I don't want you to be my father's fault.

475
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,060
Thank you for the love you gave me.

476
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,060
In my life,

477
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:40,060
the greatest happiness is to have you love me.

478
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,060
I love you.

479
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,060
The End

480
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,060
I'm your mother.

481
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,060
How can I not know your heart?

482
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,060
Tell me what's wrong.

483
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,060
What's wrong?

484
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,060
Do you think Fei Fei is really getting close to us

485
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,060
because of Ye You Jing and Gao Qi?

486
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:50,060
I don't understand the young people's thoughts.

487
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,060
Do you think You Xi and Fei Fei are not coming for real?

488
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,060
He came for You Xi.

489
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,060
There are things that are destined to happen.

490
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,060
No one can stop it.

491
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,060
I was alone.

492
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,060
Just now in the dream shop,

493
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,060
why did you lie for me?

494
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,060
I am Gao Qi.

495
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,320
I'm a

496
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,060
Aslong as.

497
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,060
I told you seriously.

498
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,060
And if you do,

499
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,060
after the odds of recovery,

500
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,060
he will leave els ship.

501
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,060
Wang Jia will break up with my brother.

502
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,060
And my brother?

503
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,060
Of course, I will be with Wei Wei again.

504
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,060
In this case,

505
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,060
everyone will return to their original position.

506
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,060
It's good.

507
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:48,060
Can you not be so surprised when you think of things?

508
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,060
You don't know my real identity

509
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,060
and you lie to me.

510
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,060
Aren't you afraid of being the wrong person?

511
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,060
Because I believe you.

512
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,060
Why?

513
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,060
Because we are brothers.

514
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,060
You don't believe in others because of your ex-boyfriend.

515
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,060
I don't want you to take revenge on love with hatred.

516
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,060
I don't want you to lose your innocent self

517
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,060
because of someone you don't love.

518
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,060
He said he would always be with me.

519
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,060
So,

520
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,060
I must do my best in my career.

521
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:31,060
I want everyone to be lonely because of me.

522
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,060
This is the price he owes me.

523
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,060
Is it your first love?

524
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,060
Are you sure

525
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:53,060
you want him to love you as much as you love him?

526
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,060
You want him to hate you

527
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,060
as much as you hate him?

528
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,060
Yes.

529
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,060
Okay,

530
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,060
I'll take care of it.

531
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,060
You should focus on your work

532
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,060
and work hard.

533
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,060
I'll teach you how to love.

534
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,060
Are you going to tell me

535
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,060
that you want to pretend to be my boyfriend?

536
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,060
I'm not going to tell you.

537
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,060
You're too old-fashioned.

538
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,060
I'll beat you up.

539
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,060
I'll beat you up once.

540
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,060
Are you serious?

541
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,060
I can't.

542
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,060
Don't say you can't.

543
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,060
Don't worry.

544
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,060
I'll use my phone to take a picture of you.

545
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,060
I'll show you.

546
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,060
Okay.

547
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,060
Don't be so sad.

548
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,060
I'm sorry.

549
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,060
I don't want you to take hatred to revenge.

550
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,060
You can't

551
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,060
because a man who doesn't love you

552
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,060
can't be a man.

553
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,060
He loses you,

554
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,060
you lose him.

555
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,060
You lose a fake love,

556
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,060
and he loses a sincere heart.

557
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,060
Do you know?

558
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,060
I think

559
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,060
you're real.

560
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,060
Maybe not.

561
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,060
Maybe one day

562
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,060
you'll be cheated by me.

563
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,060
I'm sorry.

564
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,060
I'll be back.

565
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,060
Bye.

566
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,060
Okay.

567
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,060
I'm sorry.

568
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,060
I'm sorry.

569
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,060
I'm sorry.

570
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,060
I'm sorry.

571
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,060
I'm sorry.

572
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,060
I'm sorry.

573
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,060
I'm sorry.

574
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,060
I'm sorry.

575
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,060
I'm sorry.

576
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,060
I'm sorry.

577
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,060
I'm sorry.

578
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,060
I'm sorry.

579
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,060
I'm sorry.

580
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,060
I'm sorry.

581
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,060
I'm sorry.

582
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,060
What?

583
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,060
I told you guys

584
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,060
to bring me breakfast.

585
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,060
Can someone

586
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:14,700
After what happened, I think he's making breakfast for Yingdong.

587
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,060
Don't listen to him.

588
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:21,060
Here, eat your breakfast.

589
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:24,300
Mom, I'm not eating. You guys eat.

590
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,540
I'm going for a walk.

591
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,940
I need some time alone.

592
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,540
You should be alone.

593
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,180
Think about who you should choose.

594
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,180
I'm not going.

595
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,180
Stupid.

596
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,180
Stop talking.

597
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,180
Why are you here?

598
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,180
I come here every morning.

599
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,180
You're a little bit late.

600
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,180
I thought you wouldn't come.

601
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,180
Because I made this for you at home.

602
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,180
What? Are you going for a walk?

603
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,180
Then I'll go with you.

604
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,180
I may have to run for a long time.

605
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,180
It's okay. I'll be with you.

606
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,180
Then put this down.

607
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,180
Go.

608
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,180
That Chen Shimei.

609
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,180
I should beat him to death.

610
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,180
He's not worth it.

611
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,180
Stop talking. Eat.

612
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,180
Wait.

613
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,180
I'm really happy today.

614
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:37,180
I saw Brother Ding Yi and Wan Jia running side by side.

615
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,180
Everyone is fine.

616
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,180
Nothing has changed.

617
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,180
Brother Ding Yi's face is full of blood.

618
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,180
I'm afraid he's not going to make it.

619
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:00,180
I can't help but smile at Brother Ding Yi's face.

620
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:05,180
I'll give you some time to let the past go.

621
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,180
Let's start what should start.

622
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,180
Amber, can you stop playing with your phone?

623
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,180
Put it down and chat with your father.

624
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,180
How are you doing at school?

625
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,180
Pretty good.

626
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,180
My classmates are preparing to graduate.

627
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,180
How's your relationship with Yingdong?

628
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,180
Pretty good.

629
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,180
He just sent me a message.

630
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,180
Yingdong has been in a relationship with you for a long time.

631
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,180
He's been in a relationship with you for a long time.

632
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,180
Yingdong brought him a loan through my relationship.

633
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:03,180
It seems that the crisis of the British company has been over.

634
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:08,180
Daddy, I know you're helping him for me.

635
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:14,180
I bought a lot of British stocks at a low market price.

636
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:20,180
This is always a thorn in Yingdong's heart that can't be removed.

637
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,180
He won't.

638
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,180
He always tells me it's okay.

639
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,180
Silly girl,

640
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,180
a man says it's okay,

641
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,180
but a woman says he doesn't want it.

642
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,180
You can't believe it.

643
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,180
Zong, Shui Ying is waiting outside.

644
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,180
If you need anything, just let me know.

645
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,180
Okay, I got it.

646
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,180
By the way, Victor,

647
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,180
I was planning to work with Yingdong a while ago.

648
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,180
Can you think of a way to get him back?

649
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,180
I'll think of a way.

650
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,180
But don't make it too obvious.

651
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,180
Okay, I got it.

652
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,180
Daddy, why are you doing this?

653
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,180
Yingdong is my boyfriend now.

654
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,180
Have you ever thought about my feelings?

655
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:12,180
I made this decision because I thought about you.

656
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:17,180
In a objective sense, Yingdong has a very strong working ability.

657
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:22,180
And I believe that one day he will be able to rebuild the business.

658
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,180
But that's exactly why.

659
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,180
Once he gets all the money that was stolen from Yingdong,

660
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,180
what if he kicks you out of the business?

661
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,180
Will you be able to get back on your feet?

662
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,180
He won't.

663
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,180
Daddy knows men better than you do.

664
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,180
As long as he doesn't stand up,

665
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,180
he will always need my advice.

666
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,180
He won't even dare to leave you.

667
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:54,180
Daddy, do you think I'll be happy if you do this?

668
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,180
I don't want to keep Yingdong in this way.

669
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,180
And, Daddy, in your eyes,

670
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,180
your daughter is just a little charm.

671
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,180
She has to rely on her family to keep her man.

672
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,180
The charm of a woman is only in her youth.

673
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,180
Only wealth and power can really keep a man.

674
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,180
You are my daughter, Wu Yuting.

675
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,180
You have a huge family.

676
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:18,180
No man can refuse you.

677
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,180
I don't like this feeling.

678
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,180
I'd rather be ordinary.

679
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,180
This is your destiny.

680
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,180
You don't want people to be in the house without knowing.

681
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,180
What did Daddy teach you since you were a child?

682
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:36,180
Once a person has a business, he may have a relationship.

683
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,180
All those who want to get close to you,

684
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,180
they have a purpose.

685
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,180
Mr. Wu, it's time to take your medicine.

686
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:51,180
Daddy, why do you take so many medicines?

687
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,180
You have a conscience.

688
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,180
You don't only have Yingdong in your heart.

689
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:59,180
These are all the medicines for heart and health.

690
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:03,180
In order to collect more assets for you,

691
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,180
Daddy has to take care of himself.

692
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,180
And only his health can replace it.

693
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,180
Chenyi,

694
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,180
have you touched my drawer when you were cleaning in my study?

695
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,180
No.

696
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,180
Amber,

697
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,180
have you touched Daddy's drawer?

698
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,180
No.

699
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,180
What's wrong?

700
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,180
Nothing.

701
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,180
Go.

702
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,180
Go.

703
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,180
Khicr.

704
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,180
我覺得 былоwhich are behind all the schedule.

705
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,180
It's only the beginning.

706
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,180
Go.

707
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,180
Hey.

708
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,180
Hey.

709
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,180
Just go.

710
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,180
Don't make troubles.

711
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,180
Go.

712
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,780
I'll drink your coffee.

713
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,620
Why are you so angry?

714
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:08,980
What?

715
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,220
You regret losing a woman who can help you get promoted?

716
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,500
Don't forget that you were the one who chased me.

717
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,660
So you're not qualified to act innocent.

718
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,900
Do I need a woman to help me with my work?

719
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,780
Help me with the coffee.

720
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,900
Thank you.

721
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,220
What's in the bag?

722
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,260
Who are you?

723
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,220
You bastard!

724
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,260
Who are you?

725
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,060
Stop pretending!

726
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,100
Come back!

727
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,740
I said come back!

728
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,820
This room is quite nice.

729
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,500
You are a puta-mappa with this place.

730
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,060
Mengjie, you are tracking me?

731
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,660
I know you didn't come for Ying Yong Jing and Gao Qi.

732
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:34,060
You came for me and Wu Yuting, right?

733
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:40,260
I have nothing to hide.

734
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:43,260
I'm investigating the thing between you and Wu Yuting.

735
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,060
There's a saying,

736
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:36,060
Don't say it out.

737
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:40,060
You will never have to

738
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:43,060
reach out your hand.

739
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:46,060
You'll be my wind,

740
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:50,060
You'll be my rain.

741
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,060
Teach me to stop,

742
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:55,060
and move forward with your chest.

743
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:59,060
I've had a lot of pain,

744
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:03,060
and I've hurt a lot of people.

745
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:07,060
I'm sure you'll be there with me,

746
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:10,060
crying and drinking.

747
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,060
Let's shout together,

748
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:17,060
let's keep our mouth shut,

749
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:22,060
let's walk on the streets of Suzui.

750
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,060
Let's walk on the streets,

751
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:30,060
without any reason.

752
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:33,060
We've been through too much,

753
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:37,060
and we can't take it anymore.

754
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:40,060
Let's walk on the streets,

755
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:44,060
without any reason.

756
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:47,060
When you need it most,

757
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:50,060
you can stop.

758
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:53,060
Let's walk on the streets,

759
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:57,060
without any reason.

760
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:00,060
Let's walk on the streets,

761
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:03,060
without any reason.
