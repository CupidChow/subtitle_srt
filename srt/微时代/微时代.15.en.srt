1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

4
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,440
You

5
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,120
How about the food you just ate?

6
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,900
Of course

7
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,900
Because what you eat is not the most important thing.

8
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,900
Who you eat with is the most important thing.

9
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,900
Look, they are so jealous of me.

10
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,900
But I look like I'm a bit inferior to you.

11
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,900
You're lying.

12
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,900
They don't know what to appreciate.

13
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,900
Your singing is better than any other.

14
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,900
Then can I be a singer?

15
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,900
Of course you can.

16
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,900
But I don't have privacy anymore.

17
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,900
I still want to be an ordinary person.

18
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,900
Then I'll be happy.

19
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,900
Maybe an ordinary day is also happy.

20
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,900
It's almost like this soy sauce fried dough sticks.

21
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,900
Look, if we eat soy sauce fried dough sticks every morning,

22
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,900
and put them on our table,

23
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,900
we'll think they are very ordinary.

24
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,900
But if we eat fish and meat every day,

25
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,900
you will miss them very much.

26
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,900
So the most ordinary and simple

27
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,900
is probably the most precious.

28
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,900
Why do you say that?

29
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,900
Isn't there a song called soy sauce fried dough sticks?

30
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,900
It's about this simple and long-lasting love.

31
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,900
I'll sing it for you.

32
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,900
Okay.

33
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,900
I know you and I are like soy sauce fried dough sticks.

34
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,900
It's best to go back like this.

35
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,900
You need my silly smile.

36
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,900
I need your hug.

37
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,900
I want you to come back like this.

38
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,900
Hi, I'm back.

39
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,900
The library in Shanghai is really bigger than Guangzhou.

40
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,900
It seems that you really rarely come to the library.

41
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,900
I can find any data online.

42
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,900
Monitor, who told you that you must find data in the library?

43
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,900
There is another name,

44
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,900
which is love.

45
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,900
Can't you speak loudly in the library?

46
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,900
Do you know what is the word?

47
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,900
Do you know that when I was in middle school in Guangzhou,

48
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,900
I often saw you in the library.

49
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,900
I didn't dare to sit down and read with you.

50
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,900
I just looked at you secretly in the corner.

51
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,900
I often think that if one day I can go to the library with you,

52
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,900
it would be great to read a book face to face.

53
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,900
That kind of quiet and beautiful picture

54
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,900
came to my mind many times.

55
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,900
This wish has never been realized.

56
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,900
Who said it can't be realized?

57
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,900
We are going to read now.

58
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,900
This is too smooth.

59
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,900
Do you know that the library is like a maze?

60
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,900
The library is like a maze.

61
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,900
You go in first. I'll count to twenty.

62
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,900
I'll come to you later.

63
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,900
Are you playing hide and seek with me?

64
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,900
I'll count to twenty first.

65
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:58,900
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

66
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,900
Hello.

67
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,900
You are here.

68
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,900
How do you know?

69
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,900
Because you said in an event that

70
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,900
the book you like the most is the book of Samo.

71
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,900
Your mother likes it too.

72
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,900
Thank you for paying attention to me.

73
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,900
Can I tell you what book you like to read?

74
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,900
I like Harry Potter.

75
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,900
One, two, three, four.

76
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,900
I'm back. Here you are.

77
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,900
Thank you.

78
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,900
Be careful.

79
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,900
Have a seat.

80
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,900
Here you are.

81
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,900
Thank you.

82
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,900
I'm sorry.

83
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,900
I'm sorry.

84
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,900
I'm sorry.

85
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,900
I'm sorry.

86
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,900
I'm sorry.

87
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,900
I'm sorry.

88
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,900
I'm afraid you're not used to it.

89
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,900
This is very simple.

90
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,900
No.

91
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,900
There are fish, vegetables and meat.

92
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,900
It's very rich.

93
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,900
Thank you, Squad Leader Ding Yi.

94
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,900
Thank you for what?

95
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,900
This is what I should do.

96
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,900
No, you don't understand.

97
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,900
Since I walked on the path of singers,

98
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,900
I've been playing in the reality and the cold entertainment circle every day.

99
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,900
I've gradually forgotten who I am.

100
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,900
It's like wearing a mask for a long time,

101
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,900
and I can't take it off.

102
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,900
The fame and fortune that I have is loneliness.

103
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,900
Love is lonely.

104
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,900
Love is lonely too.

105
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,900
But this loneliness is all repaid, isn't it?

106
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,900
People always envy things that they don't have.

107
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,900
Just like you envy our freedom.

108
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,900
Do you know how much we envy you?

109
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,900
You are the star of the show.

110
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,900
You can call the wind and the rain.

111
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,900
Your words and actions

112
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,900
can attract the people of the day.

113
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,900
I think young people nowadays like idols

114
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,900
because they can't see hope in their lives.

115
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,900
They can't find the way forward.

116
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,900
If you can be an idol like me,

117
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,900
it's a miracle.

118
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,900
Xiao Ai,

119
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,900
do you know why people are unhappy?

120
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,900
Why?

121
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,900
Because they don't know that someone is happier than them.

122
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,900
And they don't know that someone is unhappy than them.

123
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,900
So every time I encounter something,

124
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,900
I tell myself,

125
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,900
it's good,

126
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,900
maybe it will be worse.

127
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,900
If you lose V-Log,

128
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,900
will you be happy too?

129
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,900
There is no such thing as a never-ending feast.

130
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,900
Just like us, young people,

131
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,900
how much they love their school life.

132
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,900
But one day, they will graduate.

133
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,900
You are a pessimist who is not romantic.

134
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,900
Then you are a romanticist who enjoys the day.

135
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,900
Of course.

136
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,900
Otherwise, how could I be confident

137
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,900
from the past to the present,

138
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,900
how could I convince you

139
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,900
to accompany me, an idiot,

140
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,900
and to go on a date?

141
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,900
It's good.

142
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,900
In my memory,

143
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,900
you are a person who does not actively hold girls.

144
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,900
Do you know why?

145
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,900
I have a hand sweat.

146
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,900
A man has a hand sweat

147
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,900
because he is nervous.

148
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,900
You don't have to be nervous.

149
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,900
I am more nervous than you.

150
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,900
We are here.

151
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,900
Thank you for being with me today.

152
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,900
I am really happy.

153
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,900
This is for you.

154
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,900
This is the love letter I wrote for you for the second time.

155
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,900
It's not good.

156
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,900
Don't laugh at me.

157
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,900
I won't.

158
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,900
I will be happy.

159
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,900
I will be happy.

160
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,900
I will be happy.

161
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,900
Then let's end the class today.

162
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,900
See you next time.

163
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,900
See you next time.

164
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,900
I will be happy.

165
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,900
Brother Lin,

166
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,900
don't worry.

167
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,900
Wan Ba and Wan Ma came to our restaurant today.

168
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,900
They will definitely do what they promised.

169
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,900
I understand.

170
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,900
How was your date today?

171
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,900
I was happy.

172
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,900
By the way,

173
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,900
this is what she wrote to me after the date.

174
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,900
Let me see.

175
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,900
Class monitor Ding Yi,

176
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,900
your first date after you left,

177
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,900
your mood was exciting and complicated.

178
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,900
How much rest can a handsome guy have

179
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,900
when he is with a girl?

180
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,900
Will you have the opportunity to open your eyes

181
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,900
and read this letter?

182
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,900
I just want to tell you that

183
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,900
I am very happy today.

184
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,900
Thank you.

185
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,900
Give me a beautiful memory.

186
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,900
That's great.

187
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,900
The moonlight is very bright today.

188
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,900
You have a new beginning in every aspect.

189
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,900
Congratulations.

190
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,900
What do you want to say?

191
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,900
How about you write a love letter to Wang Dong Yu

192
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,900
and add your girlfriend's beauty?

193
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,900
What are you talking about?

194
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,900
Look at your clothes.

195
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,900
It's really dirty.

196
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,900
This school uniform

197
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,900
has attracted a lot of girls.

198
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,900
Really, Eddie?

199
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,900
Did you really fall in love with Ding Yi

200
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,900
when you were in high school?

201
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,900
Of course.

202
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,900
It's a happy thing

203
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,900
to date class monitor Ding Yi

204
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,900
like me.

205
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,900
You didn't laugh at Brother Ding Yi

206
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,900
when he was with the flower shop.

207
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,900
You almost laughed your teeth off.

208
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,900
It's so romantic.

209
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,900
I plan to go on a date

210
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,900
in the same clothes as your brother.

211
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,900
I guess my brother is more active than you.

212
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,900
He probably wears a kindergarten uniform.

213
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,900
But I think

214
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,900
it's possible that Han Bin Yi falls in love with you.

215
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,900
Because it's so difficult for a man to fall in love with a woman.

216
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,900
In love,

217
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,900
besides loving him and him loving you,

218
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,900
it's more important to find your own presence

219
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,900
in the other person.

220
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,900
That sense of need is very precious.

221
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,900
If one day

222
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,900
you find that he doesn't need you,

223
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,900
you are nothing

224
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,900
in his life.

225
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,900
That feeling

226
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,900
is the most heart-breaking

227
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,900
and the most disappointing.

228
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,900
You have never been in love.

229
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,900
Why are you acting like a master of love?

230
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,900
I have never been in love.

231
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,900
But I have friends

232
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,900
who are born for love

233
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,900
and die for love.

234
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,900
I am shocked just by looking at you.

235
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,900
Come on.

236
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,900
Friends are friends.

237
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,900
Love is love.

238
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,900
If two feet are together,

239
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,900
it will be a little bit natural.

240
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,900
Hello.

241
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,900
Are you here for dinner or for flowers?

242
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,900
Dinner.

243
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,900
Dinner, right?

244
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,900
Xiao Jing,

245
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,900
take care of the two guests.

246
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,900
Okay.

247
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,900
Take care.

248
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,900
Take care.

249
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,900
Take care.

250
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,900
Take care.

251
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,900
Welcome to the room.

252
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,900
We love, the pizza is here.

253
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,900
Please enjoy.

254
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,900
Here, I brought it for you.

255
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,900
The restaurant staff

256
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,900
came in at once.

257
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,900
It is really a celebrity effect.

258
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,900
You mean my exposure

259
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,900
can lead to the business of this restaurant?

260
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,900
Of course.

261
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,900
Now is the era of the popular pursuit.

262
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,900
You can make your favorite idol

263
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,900
sit in the restaurant.

264
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,900
Who doesn't want to come?

265
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,900
By the way,

266
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,900
have you selected the scene

267
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,900
of my new song, Love, MV?

268
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,900
No.

269
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,900
I am still choosing the scene.

270
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,900
No need to choose.

271
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,900
Here.

272
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,900
Mei Bao.

273
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,900
What's up?

274
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,900
Give the key to Meng.

275
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,900
Give it to Meng?

276
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,900
What's wrong?

277
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,900
I quit.

278
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,900
You quit?

279
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,900
Why?

280
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,900
Does Meng know?

281
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,900
Goodbye.

282
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,900
Since the MV shooting location

283
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,900
is set in the flower shop,

284
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,900
we have to use

285
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,900
the resources and advantages there.

286
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,900
Combine those

287
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,900
precious and unique flowers.

288
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,900
A flower represents a mood.

289
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,900
Show the love of

290
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,900
happiness, sweetness, sadness and disappointment

291
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,900
with different flowers.

292
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,900
I don't think it's good.

293
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,900
Why?

294
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,900
Is it a bit over?

295
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,900
Because the name of my song

296
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,900
is called Love, MV.

297
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,900
It's the first time

298
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,900
I fell in love with someone.

299
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,900
It's sweet and sad.

300
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,900
I think

301
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,900
it should be

302
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,900
more dramatic

303
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,900
to show the heroine's

304
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,900
sense of conflict

305
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,900
and not being rational.

306
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,900
It suits my song better.

307
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,900
But if it's like this,

308
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,900
the trailer will not be good.

309
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,900
I don't think so.

310
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,900
I think so.

311
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,900
You said

312
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,900
you would compare

313
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,900
my old self

314
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,900
with my present.

315
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,900
Do you think it's a good idea?

316
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,900
This is interesting.

317
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,900
Let's try the special makeup.

318
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,900
Dear, are you still busy?

319
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,900
I have prepared the wine.

320
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,900
I'll wait for you.

321
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,900
Director Kang,

322
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,900
didn't you say

323
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,900
you would have a meeting?

324
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,900
I have to go.

325
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,900
I have to go.

326
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,900
I have to go.

327
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,900
Didn't you say

328
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,900
you would have a meeting?

329
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,900
We are in a deadlock.

330
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,900
Can you be more professional?

331
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,900
Okay.

332
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,900
Hello.

333
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,900
The number you have dialed is power off.

334
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,900
Hello.

335
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,900
The number you have dialed is power off.

336
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,900
Sorry.

337
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,900
The subscriber you dialed...

338
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,900
I'm busy.

339
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,900
Forget about our last night's date.

340
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,900
Liar.

341
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,900
Pigeon king.

342
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,900
I'm really sorry, my little princess.

343
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,900
It's my fault this time.

344
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,900
I was wrong.

345
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,900
I will make it up to you next time.

346
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,900
I'm sorry.

347
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,900
I'm sorry.

348
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,900
I'm sorry.

349
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,900
I'm sorry.

350
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,900
I'm sorry.

351
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,900
I'm sorry.

352
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,900
I'm sorry.

353
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,900
I'm sorry.

354
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,900
I'm sorry.

355
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,900
I'm sorry.

356
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,900
I'm sorry.

357
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,900
I'm sorry.

358
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,900
I'm sorry.

359
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,900
I'm sorry.

360
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,900
I'm sorry.

361
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,900
Liar.

362
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,900
Liar.

363
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,900
You always make trouble.

364
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,900
Liar.

365
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,900
Liar.

366
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,900
accesses the world's arrives.

367
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,900
Okay?

368
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,900
Are you okay Li?

369
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,900
I think I lost��, too.

370
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,900
Sorry.

371
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,900
I almost fell in love with you.

372
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,900
Th danned GFㄟE��봆.

373
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,900
I didn't even limе you up on feet and called you for help.

374
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,900
Give him.

375
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,420
Please.

376
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,900
Please.

377
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,900
Hey bad guy you...

378
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,900
Miss Wu, you are a very expensive girlfriend.

379
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,900
I have to make money to be able to go out with you.

380
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,900
I can't accept that you spend all the time shopping for yourself.

381
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,900
I'm willing to go out with a poor director like you.

382
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,900
What else do I care?

383
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,900
Since you think I don't have you in my heart, why are you still looking for me?

384
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,900
Tang Zirui, I'm so good to you.

385
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,900
Are you so fair to me?

386
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,900
Don't you know that love is not fair?

387
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,900
It's not fair.

388
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,900
If someone is good to you, you love him.

389
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,900
It's called a exchange of values.

390
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,900
If someone is not good to you, you still love him.

391
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,900
This is true love.

392
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,900
Nonsense.

393
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,900
Who has such a woman?

394
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,900
Why not?

395
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,900
Mei Bao, Wei Wei, and even Eddie, aren't they all?

396
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,900
You're going around and around to say that Eddie has charm, right?

397
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,900
What's wrong with Eddie?

398
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,900
To like Han Dingyi, he chose the MV location to be in the flower shop restaurant.

399
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,900
He even wants to play the MV with the high school girl.

400
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,900
In my opinion, this is true love.

401
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,900
It's true romance.

402
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,900
Idiot, you think it's cute, right?

403
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,900
Then I'll go to the hospital tomorrow to put on a row of high-heels.

404
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,900
See if you're still romantic.

405
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,900
Let go.

406
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,900
Why are you holding me? Let go.

407
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,900
Let go.

408
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,900
You scared me.

409
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,900
I told you to let go. You let go.

410
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,900
You're home.

411
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,900
What?

412
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,900
Why don't you get off the car?

413
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,900
How about we play cards outside?

414
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,900
Idiot, we've been playing cards all night.

415
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,900
Then go back to your hotel.

416
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,900
I'll start working.

417
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,900
And then I can't sleep at home alone.

418
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,900
Don't you have a bear?

419
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,900
He's already spoiled.

420
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,900
I'm more handsome now.

421
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,900
You're so meticulous.

422
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,900
Be careful your dad knows.

423
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,900
He'll be sad.

424
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,900
I don't care if he's sad or not.

425
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,900
Didn't someone say that Eddie is a lover of his daughter's last life?

426
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,900
Then since I've been with him in my last life,

427
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,900
I'm going to be with my sister in this life.

428
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,900
I can't get your dad's approval for a day.

429
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,900
Our relationship will never be confirmed.

430
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,900
Don't worry about my dad not liking you.

431
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,900
These are temporary.

432
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,900
Since I was a kid, my dad has been worried about me.

433
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,900
He loves me a lot.

434
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,900
One day he's cold.

435
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,900
He'll be not used to it.

436
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,900
Don't worry.

437
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,900
He'll get used to it soon.

438
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,900
Let's talk about the future.

439
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,900
Go back and rest early.

440
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,900
I'm really going to work tonight.

441
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,900
Come.

442
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,900
Let me kiss you.

443
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,900
Kiss me.

444
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,900
I'm going.

445
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,900
Bye.

446
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:04,900
If I didn't meet you

447
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,900
I wouldn't be who I am

448
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,900
We said we'd be friends

449
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,900
Even if we can't hold hands

450
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,900
Actually, I still have a lot to say

451
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,900
I haven't finished talking to you

452
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,900
There are still a lot of books

453
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:34,900
I haven't sent you the bookmark

454
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:41,900
Actually, I still want to walk with you

455
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:47,900
Let our youth not go to waste

456
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:54,900
As long as there are memories, there is no regret

457
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,900
I have to take photos of this bookmark

458
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,900
It's the same wherever I put it

459
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,900
So don't be polite

460
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,900
I want to ask how you feel about this song

461
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,900
I think it's a painful love triangle

462
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,900
It's very modern

463
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,900
But I'm not in love

464
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,900
If you ask me to say something, I can't say it

465
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,900
Drink some water

466
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,900
Thank you

467
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,900
Then...

468
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:57,900
Do you think I'm familiar with this character?

469
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,900
It's okay

470
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,900
It's best if it's like this

471
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,900
Actually, people who don't know anything

472
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,900
are happier than people who know everything

473
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,900
We must not lie to ourselves

474
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,900
So we must be happy

475
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,900
Mom, I'm only twenty-seven years old

476
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,900
Do you want to settle my marriage so early?

477
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,900
Let the seeds of love spread more

478
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,900
Don't let the world be disappointed and despair

479
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,900
What are you talking about?

480
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,900
How many times have I told you not to hit my head?

481
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,900
It will be stupid

482
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,900
You are lazy every day

483
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,900
Can you learn from Kang Weiwei?

484
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,900
How can I compete with her?

485
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,900
She looks like a woman, but she's more manly than a man

486
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,900
Have you ever seen a normal person who can feed fifty people?

487
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,900
Let me tell you

488
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,900
There is only one woman who can make this kind of potential

489
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,900
She fell in love with a man

490
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,900
Don't tell me you don't know she loves my brother

491
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,900
I'm just asking

492
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,900
Your brother and Ai Di are in love again

493
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,900
Is there a play?

494
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,900
I don't think so

495
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,900
Let me analyze

496
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,900
Now, she has a Kang Weiwei who is with her every day

497
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,900
There is a dreamy and forgotten player in the play

498
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,900
And then, at most, Ai Di is a number-plugger

499
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,900
I know my brother

500
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,900
I think he is still waiting for the players to return after the game

501
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,900
Why is your brother like Mr. Lan?

502
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,900
He picked up things that he didn't want

503
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,900
You are so annoying

504
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,900
People in love are all crazy

505
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,900
So I won't touch your son

506
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,900
Let me tell you

507
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:51,900
If you don't get Mei Bao back, you will do all the work at home

508
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,900
Mom

509
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,900
Love is so hard

510
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,900
Okay, I'll reply to you later

511
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,900
Thank you

512
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,900
Mr. Pan

513
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,900
Great

514
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,900
The client is going to hold a party of 20 people

515
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,900
We will be responsible for the flowers and food

516
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,900
Really?

517
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,900
Yes

518
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,900
Great, we have a guarantee of the performance

519
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,900
But I haven't agreed

520
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,900
Why not? Are you stupid?

521
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,900
No, you are

522
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,900
You are the only chef in our restaurant

523
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,900
You have to finish 20 people's food in two hours

524
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,900
How is that possible?

525
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,900
It's all possible

526
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,900
I can do it

527
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,900
But I don't want to miss such a big opportunity

528
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,900
I'm still worried

529
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,900
Why don't you ask the private owner to come and help?

530
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,900
Come on

531
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,900
This is the first big business in our restaurant

532
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:04,900
I don't want to have four people in my life

533
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,900
Why are you laughing?

534
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,900
I just think women are too hard

535
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,900
You think I won't mind?

536
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,900
I'll get a three-point

537
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,900
That's not a problem

538
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,900
Why are you standing here? Call her

539
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:26,900
Tomorrow is the second date you and Adi have a first love

540
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,900
Don't be late

541
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,900
You have to leave a good impression

542
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,900
I'm leaving tomorrow. Are you okay?

543
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,900
Why are you so crazy?

544
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,900
I said okay

545
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,900
You can't come back until tomorrow

546
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,900
Look what you did

547
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,900
You did something so stupid

548
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,900
Do you know how precious these watches are?

549
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,900
My daughter, Wu Yuting

550
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,900
She's always with a director who doesn't fit in

551
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,900
And then to support her

552
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:15,900
She sold her father's collection to the market at a low price

553
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,900
Where do you want my face to be?

554
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,900
First love

555
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,900
How can a first love be so cheap?

556
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,900
What's wrong with my dress?

557
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,900
You never hit me when you were a kid

558
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,900
You're still asking for a beating?

559
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,900
You

560
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,900
What are you doing?

561
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,900
You want to leave home?

562
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,900
I'm telling you

563
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,900
Don't think I can't live without you

564
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,900
Look

565
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,900
Your little three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten

566
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,900
They're all here

567
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,900
I haven't touched any of them

568
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,900
I'm sorry, I've wronged you

569
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,900
Baby, let me see

570
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,900
Don't touch me

571
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,900
It's all about Kang Zirui

572
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,900
Before you met him

573
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,900
When did we have a fight?

574
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,900
It's not Kang Zirui's fault

575
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,900
Why not?

576
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,900
You're in love and you're back together

577
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,900
Look at you

578
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,900
What have you become?

579
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,900
You've become a little girl I don't know

580
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,900
What do I want these watches for?

581
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,900
What do I want these watches for?

582
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,900
What do I want them for?

583
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,900
What do I want them for?

584
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,900
What do I want them for?

585
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,900
What do I want them for?

586
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,900
Daddy

587
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,900
Don't touch me

588
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,900
Daddy

589
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,900
Give Zirui a chance

590
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,900
Be patient and get to know him

591
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,900
Daddy

592
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,900
Love is very pure

593
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,900
It's completely different from business

594
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,900
Do you think your life experience is very rich?

595
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,900
I'm telling you

596
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,900
When you're in business

597
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,900
You just have to follow the contract

598
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,900
It's much more simple than love

599
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,900
I've been studying in international universities since I was a kid

600
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,900
I just hope you can meet some people with good qualities

601
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,900
If you're with Yingdong today

602
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,900
I won't worry at all

603
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,900
Yingdong and I have been fated

604
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,900
Then you and Kang Zirui are fated?

605
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,900
He's such a romantic

606
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,900
Will he stay for a girl like you?

607
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,900
I don't want to have a day when my daughter

608
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,900
Will be jealous of some women who are not in the same class

609
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,900
By then you will lose your dignity

610
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,900
Lose your pride

611
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,900
Lose your confidence

612
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,900
How much will you believe?

613
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:54,900
I will never allow Kang Zirui to destroy my precious daughter

614
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,900
My precious first love

615
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,900
I order you to break up with him right now

616
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,900
No

617
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,900
Zirui will love me forever

618
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,900
I will never leave him

619
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,900
I will marry him

620
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,900
He is my first love

621
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,900
Even if what you say will happen in the future

622
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,900
I will not regret

623
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,900
I admit my fate

624
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,900
Good

625
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,900
I think you've had enough

626
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,900
No matter what

627
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,900
If you don't break up with Kang Zirui

628
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:32,900
I will do everything I can to make him disappear in the director's mirror

629
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,900
Daddy

630
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,900
Maybe you will hate me now

631
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,900
But one day you will understand

632
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,900
Daddy is protecting you

633
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,900
Victor, go get ice cubes and towels

634
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,900
Give the girl a face massage

635
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,900
Okay

636
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,900
Stop

637
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,900
I don't want a face massage

638
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,900
I just want to make this face out

639
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,900
Let the people outside see

640
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,900
How did you abuse his daughter?

641
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,900
Daddy

642
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,900
What's wrong with you?

643
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,900
Why are you crying?

644
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,900
Who bullied you?

645
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,900
Daddy wanted us to break up

646
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,900
He said if I didn't break up with you

647
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,900
He would make you disappear in front of the director

648
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,900
I've never seen Daddy so angry

649
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,900
He has never hit me since he was a kid

650
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,900
He hit me today

651
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,900
You are so sad

652
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,900
Your father is also very sad

653
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,900
I don't want to make things difficult for you

654
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,900
Let's break up

655
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,900
I am free

656
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,900
I don't need to be discriminated

657
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,900
I don't want to break up with you

658
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,900
I beg you not to break up with me

659
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,900
I don't want to leave you

660
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,900
Don't be like this

661
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,900
I don't want to break up with you

662
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,900
I don't want to leave you

663
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,900
I don't want to break up with you

664
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,900
I don't want to break up with you.

665
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,900
Really?

666
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,900
Yes.

667
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,900
What should I do?

668
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,900
I don't know.

669
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,900
How about this?

670
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,900
We pretend to break up and then secretly fall in love.

671
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,900
If I don't know,

672
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,900
he won't be hard on you.

673
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,900
You want me to be a newbie director

674
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,900
and play the underground with you?

675
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,900
Are you challenging my dignity?

676
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,900
What dignity?

677
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,900
Is it more important than our relationship?

678
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,900
Yes, it is.

679
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,900
Since we fell in love,

680
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,900
you never made a compromise for me.

681
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,900
It's always been me

682
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,900
who gave up my principles and dignity

683
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,900
to save you.

684
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,900
You only care about me.

685
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,900
You only care about dignity.

686
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,900
You never cared about me.

687
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,900
To be honest,

688
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,900
you just don't love me enough.

689
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,900
It has nothing to do with love.

690
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,900
You just don't want to compromise for me, right?

691
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,900
Yes.

692
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,900
You're too selfish!

693
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,900
I'm sorry.

694
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,900
Hello.

695
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,900
Is Eddie here?

696
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,900
Are you Han Di Yi?

697
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,900
I am.

698
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,900
Eddie was asked to go to a meeting.

699
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,900
Here's your note.

700
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,900
Can I sit here and wait?

701
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,900
Sure.

702
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,900
I've been waiting for you for years.

703
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,900
Can you wait for me for a few hours?

704
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,900
Love is invincible.

705
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,900
Love is invincible.

706
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,900
Let's go eat.

707
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,900
Let's go.

708
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,900
Mr. Han, let's go eat.

709
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,900
You can wait a little longer.

710
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,900
Let's go.

711
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,900
Let's go.

712
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,900
Mr. Han, please wait a little longer.

713
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,900
I'm sorry.

714
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,900
Are you busy?

715
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,900
Mr. Han,

716
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,900
I'm back.

717
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,900
Didn't you go to the meeting?

718
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,900
It's the first time I'm taking a long-term leave.

719
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,900
Did you come back?

720
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,900
Besides, nothing is more important than this.

721
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,900
Do you need any help?

722
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,900
Write down the menu.

723
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,900
Okay.

724
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,900
Here you are.

725
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,900
It's delicious.

726
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,900
Thank you.

727
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,900
What's the excuse?

728
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,900
When you're most important,

729
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,900
can you keep your head up?

730
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,900
There's a saying,

731
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,900
don't say anything.

732
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:32,900
You're not going to be able to do anything.

733
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,900
You're not going to be able to do anything.

734
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,900
You're not going to be able to do anything.

735
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,900
You're not going to be able to do anything.

736
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,900
You're not going to be able to do anything.

737
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,900
You're not going to be able to do anything.

738
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,900
You're not going to be able to do anything.

739
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,900
You're not going to be able to do anything.

740
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,900
You're not going to be able to do anything.

741
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,900
You're not going to be able to do anything.

742
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,900
You're not going to be able to do anything.

743
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,900
You're not going to be able to do anything.

744
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,900
You're not going to be able to do anything.

745
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,900
You must be with me,

746
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,900
crying and drinking.

747
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,900
Let's shout together,

748
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,900
let's keep our mouth shut together,

749
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:16,900
let's stay on the street where we're drunk.

750
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,900
We'll walk to the end,

751
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:24,900
without any reason.

752
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,900
If you've gone too far,

753
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:30,900
you still can't get it back.

754
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,900
We'll go to the end,

755
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,900
without any reason.

756
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,900
When we need each other,

757
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:44,900
we can stand on our feet.

758
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:50,900
Let's stay together

759
00:44:50,900 --> 00:45:06,900
let's keep our mouth shut.
