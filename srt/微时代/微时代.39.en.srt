00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Cut! Everyone worked hard!

40
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Half an hour break!

41
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Thank you!

42
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Thank you!

43
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You've been sunbathing by the beach for so long.

44
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's really bad for your skin.

45
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I just washed my clothes. They're clean.

46
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Thank you.

47
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I want to take a 10-minute nap.

48
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Come and call me later.

49
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Okay.

50
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Tashi got a cold.

51
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He suddenly came to a warm place.

52
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
He's not used to the weather.

53
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He's sleeping outside again.

54
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Let him take medicine on time.

55
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Take care of him.

56
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Thank you, doctor.

57
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You can go.

58
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I took care of him when he was sick.

59
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Miss Luo fell ill because she was shooting an advertisement for our company.

60
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm the boss. I should take care of him.

61
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Miss Luo is the leading actress in this shooting.

62
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
She's important.

63
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm not taking care of him. Who else will?

64
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Mr. Ying is worried about his health.

65
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm afraid he can't even take care of himself.

66
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
How can I know if I don't try?

67
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Besides, Director Kang manages the entire team.

68
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
If you quit,

69
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
the work will be stopped.

70
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I can't afford such a big loss.

71
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Can you afford it?

72
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay, okay, okay.

73
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Don't argue.

74
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm his manager.

75
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'll stay with Luo Yi.

76
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Didn't you just take the medicine?

77
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You're not feeling well, are you?

78
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Okay, go ahead.

79
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Ding Yi will take care of me.

80
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Is he experienced?

81
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I said okay.

82
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You invited a friend, didn't you?

83
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You don't have to go with him.

84
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And your director.

85
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Don't you have to rush to work?

86
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You can go ahead.

87
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I can take care of him.

88
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Weiwei, you stay.

89
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's more convenient for a girl to be here.

90
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Okay.

91
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Okay.

92
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Don't worry, Director Ying.

93
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'll take care of the work.

94
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Okay.

95
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'll get back to work.

96
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'll go.

97
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Are you busy?

98
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I've been here for so many days.

99
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't have time to spend with you.

100
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'll take you to see the local opera tonight.

101
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
At half past six.

102
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000

I'm sorry.

139
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,320
What's wrong with your foot?

00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,200
Mr. Lin, I'm very sorry.

Wait for me at the snow house.

I was really too careless.

147
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,840
I forgot about you

148
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,040
when I was talking about the business.

149
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,640

150
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,500
How about this?

151
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,600
I'll treat you to a big meal tomorrow.

152
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,280
No need.

153
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,640
Don't be angry.

154
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,680
I didn't mean it.

155
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,160
It's scarier because you didn't mean it.

156
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,160
In your heart,

157
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,720
I don't want to eat anything.

158
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,200
Wan Jia, it's like this.

159
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,540
Hello?

160
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,720

Your father and Mr. Lin are looking for me.

166
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,440
You go back and rest first.

167
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,000
I'll come to you later.

168
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,000
Miss Lu, you haven't eaten anything since this morning.

169
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,520
It's not good to go on like this.

170
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,960
I want to eat something.

171
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,920

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,320
the lunch is ready.

185
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,160
We're taking time to prepare.

186
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,620
Miss Lu,

187
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,540
we're helping you enough.

188
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,700
Did you say

189
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,000
The lunch with eggs or rice?

190
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Okay.

191
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,880
Try it first.

192
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,680
Try it.

193
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
How is it?

194
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,480
It's delicious.

195
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,840
Wei, you're not going to be your brother's assistant anymore.

196
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,520
Just come to me. I'll hire you as the chef.

197
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,440
She likes cooking so much.

198
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,120
It's all because of her brother.

199
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
Why?

200
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Here.

201
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,680
We've never had parents since we were kids.

202
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,000
We worked in the kitchen at Wan's.

203
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,680
One summer, a construction team came to film.

204
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,760
My brother became a temporary worker.

205
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,560
When the crew left,

206
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,920
my brother left with the doctor.

207
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,120
No wonder you and Wan are so close.

208
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,400
My parents-in-law have always been very good to me.

209
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,400
But I'm still afraid of losing them.

210
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,640
Maybe it's because I've never had parents since I was a kid.

211
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,480
I'm sorry.

212
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,000
I was thinking, if I learn how to cook,

213
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,680
even if I become all alone one day,

214
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,760
I'll be able to live a life of peace.

215
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,240
I didn't know you two had such a story.

216
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,440
This time, I was also going to see my brother

217
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,480
because you were filming an ad.

218
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,880
I was so happy then.

219
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,840
Look at the child she loves.

220
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,320
She adores my brother so much.

221
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,200
She sends the chicken and moon to his house every day.

222
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,760
Don't pretend to understand me.

223
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,280
I have to understand me.

224
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,960
Then who do you need to understand you?

225
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,320
I just want my brother to understand me.

226
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,760
I'm looking forward to it every day.

227
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,680
Wan.

228
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,720
You made so many delicious dishes for me.

229
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,160
I'm so grateful to you.

230
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,600
Then tell me more about my brother.

231
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,920
We haven't seen each other for so long.

232
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,560
I want to know more about him.

233
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,280
I know everything you want to know.

234
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,920
When the time comes,

235
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,680
you'll go to dad.

236
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,840
Is that so?

237
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,760
Wait a second.

238
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Are you happy even though it's late?

239
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,360
Do you have a plan to wake up soon?

240
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,760
Thank you for your hard work. I'll treat everyone to coffee.

241
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,480
Then I'll go buy it. What would you like to drink?

242
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,440
C-C-C-C-C-Coffee!

243
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:54,920
What about you?

244
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,800
Two Specials.

245
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,760
Two Specials?

246
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,720
Three Americanos.

247
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,760
I'll go buy it. I'll be right back.

248
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,400
Could you give me five cups of coffee?

249
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,600
Okay, one second.

250
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,120
Thank you.

251
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,560
Miss, this is your coffee.

252
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,440
Oh, thank you. This is the money.

253
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,200
Thank you.

254
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,120
Here it is. Here it is.

255
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,920
Coffee is here.

256
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,480
Why are you so slow?

257
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,800
Mr. Lin, here's your coffee.

258
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,520
Here, Mr. Lin.

259
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,120
Thank you.

260
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,640
Here, here, here. Give me two cups of coffee.

261
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,640
You guys go get it yourself. Don't spill it.

262
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,160
Okay, I'll go.

263
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,840
What's wrong? Let's go.

264
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,280
Wei Wei, where's your bag?

265
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,840
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no.

266
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,360
I'll go look for it.

267
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,360
I'll go look for it on the other side.

268
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,120
Excuse me, have you seen a blue bag over there?

269
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,520
No, sorry, sorry.

270
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,360
Bag, blue bag.

271
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,360
No, no.

272
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,640
Is there any?

273
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,520
Where did you put it?

274
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,440
Go over there and ask.

275
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,440
Let's go.

276
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,360
How is it?

277
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,360
I can't find it.

278
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,360
I didn't even get 15 shots.

279
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,360
I've already given him the Shanghai number.

280
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,360
Youxi is back.

281
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,360
Where's yours?

282
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,360
I've already looked at the map.

283
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,360
None?

284
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,360
I can't find it anymore.

285
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,360
Don't worry, you'll definitely find it.

286
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,360
I put it on that chair.

287
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,360
What are you doing here?

288
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,360
Brother, I'm sorry.

289
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,360
I didn't mean to.

290
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,360
If I had known, I wouldn't have bought that coffee.

291
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,360
Kang Wei Wei, you're too much.

292
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,360
You ruined everyone's blood with a cup of coffee.

293
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,360
Is it okay to say sorry?

294
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,360
Do you know how much trouble you've caused?

295
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,360
Do you know how serious the consequences will be if you can't hand over the film?

296
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,360
How serious the consequences will be?

297
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,360
How serious the consequences will be?

298
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,360
Isn't it just losing money?

299
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,360
I'll just quit school and work to get you the money.

300
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,360
Kang Wei Wei, you're a jerk!

301
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,360
You ruined the results we've been chasing day and night.

302
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,360
You ruined the dreams of these young people.

303
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,360
You ruined everything they've worked hard to do.

304
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,360
You ruined me.

305
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,360
You ruined the trust I've built up over the years.

306
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,360
Did you buy all this with money?

307
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,360
I really don't know what you've been doing all these years.

308
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,360
I'm telling you, Kang Wei Wei, you've disappointed me.

309
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
Kang Zirui!

310
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,360
Seven years, seven months, eighteen days, three thousand five hundred and thirteen days and nights.

311
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,360
Have you ever thought about how I feel?

312
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,360
I didn't blame you for leaving without a word.

313
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,360
I've been waiting for you to come back every day since the beginning.

314
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,360
But I didn't even get a letter.

315
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,360
It's the New Year, and everyone has a family reunion.

316
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,360
But I can only watch it on my phone.

317
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,360
I thought you'd be back soon.

318
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,360
But then I realized I couldn't wait any longer.

319
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,360
I couldn't wait any longer.

320
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,360
So I started living my life independently.

321
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,360
Then one day a man came to my house and told me that he lived with me.

322
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,360
He's Kang Zirui. He's my brother.

323
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,360
Have you ever thought about how I feel?

324
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,360
I disappointed you.

325
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,360
Have you ever given me hope?

326
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,360
Do you think I'm your sister?

327
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,360
Kang Zirui, you bastard!

328
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,360
Sister, I'm sorry.

329
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,360
I never thought of this.

330
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,360
Don't worry. I'll take full responsibility.

331
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,360
Sorry to bother you.

332
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,360
What's this?

333
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,360
Acting.

334
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,360
Mr. Ying, someone has to take responsibility for this.

335
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,360
Now I need to report to the head office.

336
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,360
Mr. Lin, don't be angry.

337
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,360
I'll take care of this.

338
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,360
It's okay. You still have us.

339
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,360
It's okay. It'll all pass.

340
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,360
So are we going to wait here for the news or go back to Shanghai?

341
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,360
We'll go back to Shanghai first.

342
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,360
We'll board the plane first. Maybe we'll have good news when we get back.

343
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,360
Yes. God will bless us, right?

344
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,360
It's okay. Let's go.

345
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,360
Let's go.

346
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,360
Tell me.

347
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,360
Did something happen between your brother and Amber on Bali Island?

348
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,360
Of course not.

349
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,360
Amber is very kind.

350
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,360
She doesn't like games.

351
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,360
Tell me.

352
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,360
Does Yingdong know that you like Wanjia?

353
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,360
Why are you asking this?

354
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,360
Of course.

355
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,360
If he knew that you liked him and you were in love with Wanjia,

356
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,360
he wouldn't be your friend.

357
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,360
I think he doesn't know that Yingdong is very kind to me.

358
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,360
In my son's world, there is no bad person.

359
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,360
In order not to let a good girl miss you,

360
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,360
I gave you this ring.

361
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,360
From now on, whoever you like, give it to whoever you like.

362
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,360
What?

363
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,360
I gave it to my future daughter-in-law.

364
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,360
I gave it to my future daughter-in-law.

365
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,360
What?

366
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,360
You don't accept the gift I gave to my future daughter-in-law?

367
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,360
Okay, fine.

368
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,360
So now we just talk about the price.

369
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,360
I want to know how much price total...

370
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,360
I'm sorry. I gotta do stuff to do.

371
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,360
Okay? Call you later.

372
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,360
Honey, what's up?

373
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,360
Shouldn't you give me an explanation?

374
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,360
Why did my credit card's amount of money drop from 2 million to 200 thousand?

375
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,360
I don't want you to get into trouble because of too much money.

376
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,360
Honey, you can buy a name card, a name card, or a car.

377
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:18,360
But I will never allow you to waste your money and time on useless kids.

378
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,360
They lost the ad.

379
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,360
I can wait for compensation.

380
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,360
Why do you have to pay for it yourself?

381
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,360
This is an investment without compensation.

382
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,360
Then tell me, what is an investment without compensation?

383
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,360
You have no friends in the past month or two.

384
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,360
I'm sorry. I'm different from you.

385
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,360
I need friends.

386
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,360
Amber, you're too naive.

387
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,360
I'm telling you, the country is the country.

388
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,360
People are the people.

389
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,360
People are divided into three groups.

390
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,360
You should have friends.

391
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,360
I'm telling you, only those with a good reputation can be friends with you.

392
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,360
These kids value your status and your identity.

393
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,360
That's why they're here to be friends with you.

394
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,360
People climb high, and water flows low.

395
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,360
One day, you will lose your value.

396
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,360
They will kick you out.

397
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,360
So you used my credit card?

398
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,360
My little princess,

399
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,360
you should know that no one loves you more than your father.

400
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,360
Do you love me?

401
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,360
Stop joking!

402
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,360
I've never heard of this in my family!

403
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,360
You're really spoiled by me.

404
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,360
You can't even tell who's the owner of the family.

405
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,360
Do you know who's the owner of the family?

406
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,360
I'm the owner of the family!

407
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,360
Even if you freeze my account,

408
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,360
I'll still try to help Kang Wei Wei and her siblings get through this.

409
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,360
I'm not that heartless!

410
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,360
If you don't listen to me, you'll be kicked out one day!

411
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,360
Even if I get kicked out, I'll still be seven years old.

412
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,360
Don't think everyone is afraid of you.

413
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,360
God sent me to cure your heart.

414
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,360
It's me!

415
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,360
You!

416
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,360
You!

417
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,360
Yingdong is discussing this with his father in the office.

418
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,360
Mr Lin has already reported to the head office.

419
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,360
And we have to hurry up and make a new commercial.

420
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,360
Everything will be better if we have a film.

421
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,360
I didn't expect that you guys would have such a bad time

422
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,360
after what happened to us.

423
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,360
Yeah, we can't live without you.

424
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,360
I don't care.

425
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,360
We have to find a way to get the money.

426
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,360
Otherwise, we can't get any of them.

427
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,360
Princess, why are you more anxious than the person?

428
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,360
He's angry.

429
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,360
He wants to prove it to his father.

430
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,360
Parents always think that we're kids and can't do anything.

431
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,360
This time, we have to prove it to them.

432
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,360
As long as we can unite and become one,

433
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,360
we will never lose to them.

434
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,360
How about this?

435
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,360
I'll divide the money for the flowers.

436
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,360
No, how much can the flowers make?

437
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,360
Don't waste your money.

438
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,360
How about this?

439
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,360
Let's take out our living expenses.

440
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,360
We can get as much as we want.

441
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,360
We can think of a way to get the rest.

442
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,360
Don't ask me for help.

443
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,360
I don't have money.

444
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,360
I'm a shaman.

445
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,360
Actually, I don't have much money.

446
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,360
Why are you guys so unreliable?

447
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,360
We're counting on you.

448
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,360
You're so stubborn.

449
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,360
I won't trouble you.

450
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,360
Gu Wei.

451
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,360
How can you do this?

452
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,360
Gu Wei is like a family.

453
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,360
His brother is in trouble.

454
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,360
Do we have to help him?

455
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,360
Maybe your business has nothing to do with me.

456
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,360
But from now on,

457
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,360
Wei Wei's business is my business.

458
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,360
I'm sure I can help.

459
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,360
That's right.

460
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,360
We can make a film together in Bali.

461
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,360
We can do it now.

462
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,360
Guys,

463
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,360
if you want to make money,

464
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,360
why don't you have a party?

465
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,360
Yes, a party.

466
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,360
I didn't expect to be the queen of the party.

467
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,360
A party can sell tickets.

468
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,360
But a party has a good theme.

469
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,360
I'm a good seller.

470
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,360
That's true.

471
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,360
Princess,

472
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,360
although you're famous,

473
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,360
I want to see you.

474
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,360
You can go to school

475
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,360
or go to your house.

476
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,360
Just wait at the door of the house.

477
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,360
It's not that difficult.

478
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,360
You can't be so mean.

479
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,360
Really?

480
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,360
According to my reputation,

481
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,360
is this seller enough?

482
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,360
Miss Lu.

483
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,360
Miss Lu.

484
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,360
We don't have time to delay the party.

485
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,360
The re-run of the anti-corruption advertisement

486
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,360
must be done immediately.

487
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,360
So the funds must be in place first.

488
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,360
I will make the original advertisement plan

489
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,360
a budget表 again.

490
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,360
Oh, right.

491
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,360
And the invitation.

492
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,360
The invitation must be very gorgeous.

493
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,360
And there are no restrictions.

494
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,360
It's a show of honor.

495
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,360
Let the invited people feel

496
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,360
that they are real VIPs.

497
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,360
Then,

498
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,360
they can pay for the best price.

499
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,360
I'll be responsible for the design of the invitation.

500
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,360
I'm an art student.

501
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,360
I'm good at this.

502
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,360
Then I'll be responsible for the reception.

503
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,360
I'm good at the girl circle of boys.

504
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,360
They won't hate me.

505
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,360
I'll take the responsibility for the girl.

506
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,360
Let's be together.

507
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,360
I think you want to be a girl.

508
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,360
I want to be your sister.

509
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,360
Okay.

510
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,360
Then it's settled.

511
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,360
This is the fund needed by the meeting.

512
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,360
I'll pay for this.

513
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,360
Why are you here?

514
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,360
Zuo Yi is here.

515
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,360
I'm responsible for the advertisement.

516
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,360
I can't just sit and watch.

517
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,360
You're really good at this.

518
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,360
The party hasn't started yet.

519
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,360
Someone is willing to go up and buy a bag.

520
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,360
Smile.

521
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,360
Amber,

522
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,360
tell me the budget of the party.

523
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,360
I'll pay you tomorrow.

524
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,360
Then thank you.

525
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,360
No need.

526
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,360
I'll take care of my own business.

527
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,360
I don't need anyone's help.

528
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,360
Lu Lu,

529
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,360
didn't you say there was a problem?

530
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,360
We have to solve it together.

531
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,360
I, Kang Zirui, have come this far

532
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,360
because of my own efforts.

533
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,360
I don't need anyone's help.

534
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,360
Brother,

535
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,360
he's a good person.

536
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,360
How can he be a loser?

537
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,360
I'm too enthusiastic.

538
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,360
I don't care about this.

539
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,360
Mr. Ding, I'm late.

540
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,360
Mr. Ding, don't go.

541
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,360
Amber,

542
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,360
I'll go after him.

543
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,360
You stay here.

544
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,360
Let's discuss the party.

545
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,360
You're the organizer.

546
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,360
Okay.

547
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,360
You should go too.

548
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,360
I'm sorry.

549
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,360
I'll go to the bathroom.

550
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,360
My stomach hurts. I'll go to the bathroom.

551
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,360
Ding Dong,

552
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,360
wait.

553
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,360
Kang Zirui

554
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,360
didn't mean anything.

555
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,360
He was just upset

556
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,360
because he lost the bag.

557
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,360
Don't mind him.

558
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,360
Did you come here

559
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,360
just to explain to me?

560
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,360
I didn't come here for him.

561
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,360
Then for whom?

562
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,360
I'm worried about you.

563
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,360
I know you're kind and want to help everyone.

564
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,360
You're here today

565
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,360
not because of the bag

566
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,360
but because you care about him.

567
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,360
I care about you.

568
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,360
I want to help him.

569
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,360
I don't want him to be upset.

570
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,360
He's not the Luo Yi I knew.

571
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,360
Everyone changes.

572
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,360
Sometimes,

573
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,360
we don't know each other.

574
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,360
We don't want to know each other.

575
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,360
Don't you always

576
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,360
resist being understood by others?

577
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,360
I'm sorry.

578
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,360
I was selfish

579
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,360
and brought you to Bali.

580
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,360
And

581
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,360
I forgot to go to the gate of the temple

582
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,360
to apologize to you.

583
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,360
I'm sorry.

584
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,360
Thank you.

585
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,360
You said

586
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,360
sorry to me twice.

587
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,360
Can I understand

588
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,360
that

589
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,360
you have two small

590
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,360
sisters?

591
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,360
I envy you.

592
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,360
I'm not in a good mood.

593
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,360
Let's go for a walk.

594
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,360
It's okay if you can't help.

595
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,360
We can save money.

596
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,360
Amber,

597
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,360
how much do you need to pay

598
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,360
to sell all these things?

599
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,360
Amber,

600
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,360
do you want to sell this necklace too?

601
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,360
This is your father's

602
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,360
18th birthday gift.

603
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,360
This necklace

604
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,360
costs millions.

605
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,360
What?

606
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,360
Millions?

607
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,360
Amber,

608
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,360
I'll take you to the temple.

609
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,360
Which beauty do you want to chase?

610
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,360
You can't catch up with

611
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,360
Yindong in less than an hour.

612
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,360
Don't worry.

613
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,360
The best answer

614
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,360
is to go home tonight.

615
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,360
This answer

616
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,360
is beyond my control.

617
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,360
Don't be so rude.

618
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,360
The person I like

619
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,360
is not a player.

620
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,360
The person I like is...

621
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,360
What did you say?

622
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,360
It's me.

623
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,360
Listen,

624
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,360
Yindong always peeks at me.

625
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,360
Really?

626
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,360
You're so funny.

627
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,360
How can you be so good at joking?

628
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,360
You...

629
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,360
You...

630
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,360
Forget it.

631
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,360
Let's talk about the necklace.

632
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,360
Do you really want to sell this necklace?

633
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,360
Of course.

634
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,360
My dad won't give me money, so I'll sell it.

635
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,360
We're even.

636
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,360
You really want to sell it?

637
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,360
It's so expensive.

638
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,360
You like Kang Zirui's brother.

639
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,360
Did you fall in love with him in the case game?

640
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,360
Hua Youxi!

641
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,360
Don't make up rumors about me.

642
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,360
How could I like his brother?

643
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,360
It's impossible.

644
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,360
I can't like Kang Zirui.

645
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,360
Impossible!

646
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,360
Are you kidding me?

647
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,360
You scared me.

648
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,360
Weiwei,

649
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,360
listen.

650
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,360
I'm not doing this to help your brother.

651
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,360
I'm just doing this to help you.

652
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,360
We're good sisters.

653
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,360
Amber, I love you.

654
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,360
Come on.

655
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,360
I know.

656
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,360
I'm a beautiful and kind person.

657
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,360
Who wouldn't like me?

658
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,360
The door!

659
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,360
You're so handsome.

660
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,360
Get out!

661
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,360
You're being bullied again.

662
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,360
Miss Fang,

663
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,360
which award ceremony is it today?

664
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,360
It's not an award ceremony.

665
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,360
I'm looking for a party outfit.

666
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,360
Okay, please wait a moment.

667
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,360
You still miss him?

668
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,360
Who?

669
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,360
The shopkeeper.

670
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,360
Who else?

671
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,360
I don't miss him.

672
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,360
You can't hide your eyes from me.

673
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,360
He's acting in front of me.

674
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,360
Go find him if you want.

675
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,360
I'll give you a holiday.

676
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,360
He's with someone else now.

677
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,360
I'd better not bother him.

678
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,360
You're a gentle and kind person.

679
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,360
Miss Fang,

680
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,360
this is a new dress for our movie.

681
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,360
I think it suits you.

682
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,360
I'll pick a suit for her.

683
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,360
Okay.

684
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,360
I don't need it.

685
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,360
You're going to a party.

686
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,360
Don't you need a suit?

687
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,360
Take her to the bathroom.

688
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,360
Brother,

689
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,360
why are you drinking alone?

690
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,360
I saw the player coming back.

691
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,360
It was Yingdu's assistant who drove her back.

692
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,360
I'll send a photo to Amber

693
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,360
and we'll talk about it.

694
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,360
Go ahead.

695
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,360
I'll drive you back.

696
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,360
You're a big boss.

697
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,360
Don't ask me to sell you the photo.

698
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,360
You're so stubborn.

699
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,360
If I were you,

700
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,360
I'd fall in love with another woman

701
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,360
at the fastest speed.

702
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,360
To be honest,

703
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,360
I think

704
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,360
you're a good guy.

705
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,360
You're talking nonsense

706
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,360
before you drink.

707
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,360
Don't talk about drinking.

708
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,360
I'll be a nightmare when I'm drunk.

709
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,360
Yes, I just finished my makeup.

710
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,360
I'm going home to change.

711
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,360
I'm looking forward to it.

712
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,360
Really?

713
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,360
Let's go.

714
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,360
Daddy.

715
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,360
Get in the car.

716
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,360
I'll call you later.

717
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,360
What?

718
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,360
It's a wrong way.

719
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,360
Let's go somewhere else.

720
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,360
I don't want to go to the party

721
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,360
with Uncle Zhu.

722
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,360
I hope you can meet

723
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,360
someone that's good at it.

724
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,360
Don't go to the party

725
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,360
with a good-for-nothing.

726
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,360
I must do it today.

727
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,360
I'll go.

728
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,360
I'll go.

729
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,360
I'll go.

730
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,360
I'll go.

731
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,160
No, I have to attend the party today.

732
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,160
I'm the party planner.

733
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:11,960
If I don't attend,

734
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,160
the party will be cancelled.

735
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,760
It's fine if it's cancelled.

736
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,960
Without you, the earth will spin.

737
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,360
Without you, they will have fun.

738
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,760
Do you think you're important to them?

739
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,560
They're important to me.

740
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,960
Waiter, stop the car.

741
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,960
Don't stop the car.

742
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,560
Ignore him.

743
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,560
Daddy,

744
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,560
you won't let me go today, will you?

745
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,560
I won't change my decision.

746
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,160
I won't change my decision either.

747
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,560
If you don't stop the car,

748
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,360
I'll jump into the car.

749
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,360
Okay, okay, stop the car.

750
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,360
Did you contact Amber?

751
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,160
She hasn't answered my call.

752
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,360
I called her this afternoon,

753
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,360
but her phone is still turned off.

754
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,360
Hello.

755
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,360
Why are you all here?

756
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,760
Amber hasn't come yet.

757
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,760
She hasn't come yet?

758
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,760
Why are you here?

759
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,960
No way.

760
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,560
Your mother asked me to keep an eye on you.

761
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,360
I have to keep an eye on you.

762
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,560
That's right.

763
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,560
There are so many rich men here.

764
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,360
Maybe we'll be separated.

765
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,760
Is Amber here yet?

766
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,760
No.

767
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,760
Did she contact you?

768
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,760
No.

769
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,560
I can't reach her now.

770
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,760
Miss, you're angry again.

771
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,360
You suddenly decided not to come.

772
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,360
Miss, you can't be angry.

773
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,360
That's not necessarily true.

774
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,960
Forget it.

775
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,560
I'll do it if the party doesn't work.

776
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,760
This is my fate.

777
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,160
Don't give up yet.

778
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,560
Even if Amber can't come,

779
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,160
the party will continue.

780
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,360
At the worst, I'll buy all the tickets.

781
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,560
Thank you.

782
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,560
You really don't have to.

783
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,960
We've paid so much.

784
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,960
Can you not save money?

785
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,360
Amber!

786
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,760
Amber!

787
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,960
No one can stop us from holding this party.

788
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,760
Including my father.

789
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,760
Amber, thank you.

790
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,560
I got a message.

791
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,560
She said she's on her way here with Luo Yi.

792
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,760
That's great.

793
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,360
But Amber,

794
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,160
you're the queen of the party.

795
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,160
Are you going to dress like this?

796
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,360
Don't worry.

797
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,360
I'll be the queen of the party tonight.

798
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,960
Queen of the party?

799
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,560
Luo Yi is so beautiful today.

800
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,560
Today, everyone is handsome and beautiful.

801
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,960
Then,

802
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,360
you won't help anyone you want to choose.

803
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,160
Amber.

804
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,360
You're the queen of the party.

805
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,360
You're so fast.

806
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,160
You're handsome.

807
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,560
Yes, I'm dressing like a fan.

808
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,560
Today, I'll choose the most handsome one.

809
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,960
Tonight, I'll be the queen of the party.

810
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,560
Goodbye.

811
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,760
Everyone is here.

812
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,760
Let's go in.

813
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,560
Let's go.

814
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,960
Let's go.

815
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,960
Come on.

816
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,560
Come on.

817
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,160
What's wrong?

818
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,960
I've put the photos of the party

819
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,960
in your iPad.

820
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,560
Let me see.

821
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,360
Why are they all photos of me and Yingdong?

822
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,360
Yes.

823
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,760
My job is to record the photos of your work.

824
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,560
But in many times,

825
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,360
I can't remember the photos.

826
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,760
I can't remember.

827
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,160
But in many times,

828
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,560
I found a pair of eyes

829
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,360
that were secretly looking at you.

830
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,760
So I recorded them.

831
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,960
I guess

832
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,360
your heart is also secretly looking at it.

833
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,160
I think you're a child.

834
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:23,160
Why do you always pretend to know me?

835
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,360
No.

836
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,160
I just think

837
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,760
you two can't let each other go.

838
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,960
Thank you.

839
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,160
Thank you.

840
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,160
Thank you.

841
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,160
Thank you.

842
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,960
Thank you.

843
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,960
Thank you.
