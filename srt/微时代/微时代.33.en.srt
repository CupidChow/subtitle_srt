00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,080
Chapter 12

2
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,360
Mijie, are you still mad?

3
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,340
Yes, I do.

4
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,080
I'm just absolument sure that your friends think that what happened to you accidently.

5
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,380
They say you're well to both parties.

6
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,520
Experience good things as you can.

7
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,960
Promise.

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,040
See you later.

9
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,040
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,040
Thank you for today.

11
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,040
It's nothing.

12
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,040
It's my duty to be a celebrity.

13
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,040
Unlike you.

14
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,040
Do you have to be so aggressive?

15
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,040
Can't we stop fighting?

16
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,040
You can't even stand up tomorrow.

17
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,040
I'll return all your things to you.

18
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,040
No need.

19
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,040
I know you're rich.

20
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,040
But I don't want to take you for free.

21
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,040
I'll feel uneasy.

22
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,040
You misunderstood.

23
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,040
I mean you have to continue working.

24
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,040
But I'll sign a new contract with you.

25
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,040
A new contract?

26
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,040
A first-class girlfriend.

27
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,040
Why should I be your first-class girlfriend?

28
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,040
No one can make my sister like you.

29
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,040
And she likes your cooking.

30
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,040
Do you understand?

31
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,040
Don't you have manners?

32
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,040
As long as my sister likes it,

33
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,040
I can do anything.

34
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,040
She's your sister, not mine.

35
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,040
Why should I be your first-class girlfriend?

36
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,040
Because my sister has cancer.

37
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,040
She's brain-dead.

38
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,040
I'll do anything to make her happy.

39
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,040
Do you understand?

40
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,040
It's a declaration.

41
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,040
I won't accept any unreasonable or perverted demands.

42
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,040
And I'm afraid you're a person who doesn't keep his word.

43
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,040
I'm afraid I'll agree to be your first-class girlfriend.

44
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,040
And you'll break the contract.

45
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,040
Don't worry about that.

46
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,040
I'm more afraid of being broken.

47
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,040
I'll record the contract now.

48
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,040
The so-called first-class girlfriend.

49
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,040
As my girlfriend,

50
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,040
I'll take care of her during my sister's illness.

51
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,040
Whether she's in the hospital or at home,

52
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,040
I'll take care of her.

53
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,040
I'll meet all the unreasonable and happy demands.

54
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,040
And during this period,

55
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,040
I won't have to accept any unnecessary demands.

56
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,040
Are you satisfied?

57
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,040
We agreed on this.

58
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,040
I'll just be with your sister.

59
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,040
But I won't stay overnight.

60
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,040
You don't think I want to do anything to you, do you?

61
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,040
That's impossible.

62
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,040
That's good.

63
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,040
Oh, right.

64
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,040
If my sister tells you about my childhood,

65
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,040
you don't have to listen carefully because you don't need to understand.

66
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
You don't have a fixed working time.

67
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,040
You'll be here as long as my sister needs you.

68
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,040
If my sister needs you to stay and spend the night with her,

69
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,040
I'll pay you double.

70
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,040
Did you keep your word in your heart?

71
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,040
I just said I won't stay overnight.

72
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
My sister is a patient.

73
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,040
If you refuse to make her feel bad and sick,

74
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,040
will you be able to take the responsibility?

75
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,040
I promise you that my girlfriend's monthly salary is 100,000 yuan.

76
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,040
Then...

77
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,040
What about my previous assistant?

78
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,040
I'll keep it.

79
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,040
When you're on duty, I'll give you the 200,000 yuan you've already used.

80
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,040
And I'll cooperate with India.

81
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,040
Then...

82
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,040
Okay.

83
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,040
If you need it,

84
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,040
you can force it yourself.

85
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,040
But don't even think about the other things.

86
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,040
If you have a little bit of monthly salary,

87
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,040
we'll immediately end the game.

88
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,040
Okay.

89
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,040
I'll swear to God.

90
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,040
If you break the promise, I'll pay you 1 million.

91
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,040
And you have to keep this a secret from me.

92
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,040
If you let him know, even if you break the promise,

93
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,040
you'll have to pay me 1 million.

94
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,040
If you think there's no problem,

95
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,040
I'll give this contract to the lawyer.

96
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,040
The contract is three months.

97
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,040
Why three months?

98
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,040
Because...

99
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,040
Because my sister won't have surgery to cut off the important parts of her brain.

100
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,040
If the doctor says she won't have surgery,

101
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,040
she can live for at most three months.

102
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,040
If she doesn't have surgery,

103
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,040
at least she can be happy for the next three months.

104
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,040
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,040
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,040
Don't worry, I'll like you.

107
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,040
I'm not that bad.

108
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,040
But from tomorrow on, you'll be my girlfriend.

109
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,040
At least dress up.

110
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,040
Miss Kang, we're here.

111
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,040
Miss Kang, Mr. Ou wants to see you.

112
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,040
What time tomorrow?

113
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,040
I have class tomorrow morning.

114
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,040
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

115
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,040
I'll send you to Mr. Ou's house after class.

116
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,040
Okay.

117
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,040
I'll be right there.

118
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,040
I'm sorry.

119
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,040
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,040
I'm sorry.

121
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,040
Hello?

122
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,040
Hello?

123
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
Hello?

124
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,040
Come in, please.

125
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
Dad.

126
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,040
Hello, Mr. Ou.

127
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,040
Dad,

128
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,040
the cooperation between Yingdong and Ou Hui has progressed.

129
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,040
Oh.

130
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,040
Ou Hui wants to see you?

131
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,040
What's the progress?

132
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,040
How is it going?

133
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,040
Ou Hui didn't refuse to cooperate with our company.

134
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,040
I'm reading the proposal to him.

135
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:59,040
I promised him that the restaurant will be opened in all the super five-star hotels in our five major cities.

136
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,040
To establish the first-class restaurant brand for him.

137
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,040
He's just reading the proposal, but he hasn't made it official.

138
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,040
It seems that the future of the merger period will not be short.

139
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,040
I understand. I will try my best.

140
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,040
I asked him to arrange for me to meet Ou Hui several times, but he always refused.

141
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,040
But you spent a short time to get close to him.

142
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,040
What exactly is this?

143
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,040
We just used some young people's methods.

144
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,040
Actually, it's nothing. People are all emotional.

145
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,040
We are the same age, and we can talk.

146
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
So we made a love card.

147
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,040
No matter what method you use,

148
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,040
as long as this contract doesn't be signed,

149
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,040
all the happy and sad things will be just talking.

150
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,040
Daddy, can't you say something that can inspire people?

151
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,040
Sometimes, hitting is also a way to encourage.

152
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,040
I understand. I will sign this contract.

153
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,040
If there's nothing else, I'll go back to work.

154
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,040
Okay.

155
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,040
Baby, here is your favorite black truffle chocolate.

156
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,040
I'll take it for you.

157
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,040
No need.

158
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,040
I already bought the sports glasses. I have them on me.

159
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,040
You don't want a boyfriend?

160
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,040
Is he my boyfriend?

161
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,040
He's just your boyfriend.

162
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,040
He's not necessarily your husband.

163
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,040
Even if he is your husband, he's not necessarily your husband.

164
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,040
Young people of your generation are easy to get together because of impulse.

165
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,040
But it's easier to break up because of impulse.

166
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,040
Even if one day you marry Yinglong,

167
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,040
he's just my daughter's husband to me.

168
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,040
My husband, my grandson's father,

169
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,040
no matter what, he's an outsider.

170
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,040
I will never give him this family business.

171
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,040
Do you have to calculate it so carefully?

172
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,040
Amber, Yingdong's ex-girlfriend has a family of ten thousand who are not married yet.

173
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,040
You have to be careful.

174
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,040
Baby is a man.

175
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,040
I know it very well.

176
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,040
A man fights for money and power.

177
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,040
And money and power are your lucky charm.

178
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,040
You have to be careful.

179
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,040
You can't let it go.

180
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,040
If you don't, you'll never have a boyfriend.

181
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,040
I'm sorry.

182
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,040
I'm sorry.

183
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,040
I'm sorry.

184
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,040
I'm sorry.

185
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,040
I'm sorry.

186
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,040
I'm sorry.

187
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
I'm sorry.

188
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,040
I'm sorry.

189
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,040
I'm sorry.

190
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,040
I'm sorry.

191
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
I'm sorry.

192
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,520
I

193
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,800
This is a small difference from before graduation.

194
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,600
Anyway, I can only endure three months.

195
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,360
Anyway, I can only endure three months.

196
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,720
You're in such a high company, you still want to endure?

197
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,880
Mr. Gao, ignore him.

198
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,640
What do you want from us?

199
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,440
Jia Jia and Ding Yi have something to talk about.

200
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,920
But I don't have time to go back to Vila to help.

201
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,320
So I think I should resign.

202
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,760
Please tell Ding Yi

203
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,920
I won't go to the restaurant to work after I'm too busy.

204
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,240
I've already paid the rent for Vila.

205
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,080
It will be paid immediately.

206
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,080
So you can let them pay the rent.

207
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:53,000
You gave me all the money you earned for Vila.

208
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,040
Anyway, I don't need this money now.

209
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,160
Just lend it to him.

210
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,640
Okay.

211
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,360
Okay, I won't argue with you anymore. Let's continue talking.

212
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,080
I'm going out.

213
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,080
Bye.

214
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,080
Bye.

215
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,480
Mr. Tang really made a lot of money.

216
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,800
He's always in a good mood.

217
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,120
You think he's never seen the world like you?

218
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,720
He won't trust anyone.

219
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,720
You've been looking for a man who can help you.

220
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,240
And you're still going to study abroad.

221
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,040
Are you crazy, Hua Yuexi?

222
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,560
You just got a new boyfriend.

223
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,160
You're the reason I made this choice.

224
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,880
What did I do to you?

225
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,360
What did I do to you?

226
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,040
Let me ask you.

227
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,440
How long did you stay with me?

228
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:10,800
How many times did you hold my hand?

229
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,920
How much space did you have in your heart?

230
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:22,920
Hua Yuexi, why can't you be like other lovers to me?

231
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,440
Because you're too ordinary.

232
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,960
You don't deserve me.

233
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,200
Thank you, Hua Yuexi.

234
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,360
Even though you're so ordinary,

235
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,800
when I'm with you,

236
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,240
it's the most comfortable time for me.

237
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,760
The most familiar time.

238
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,560
You're pretty aggressive.

239
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,000
Was I?

240
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm sorry.

241
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's so early.

242
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You're early, too.

243
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
In fact,

244
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I came here to see if I could see you

245
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
after you quit.

246
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Good.

247
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
We should have talked face to face.

248
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Actually,

249
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I'll talk about quitting sooner or later.

250
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Because I want to see if there are any other places

251
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
where I can have an internship after graduation.

252
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And there are many things in the store.

253
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I've already taught Wan Jia how to manage it.

254
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Wan Jia wouldn't want you to leave.

255
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
There are many things in the store.

256
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
No one is more suitable than you.

257
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Give everyone some time.

258
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
We'll all get used to it.

259
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You should go to the store as soon as possible.

260
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Jiajia should have arrived.

261
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What about you?

262
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm fine.

263
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Me?

264
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You're still worried about me?

265
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Do you really think I'm not kind?

266
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm telling you,

267
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
no matter what happens in the future,

268
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'll make myself happy.

269
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Don't worry about others.

270
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Jiajia needs your care more than I do.

271
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So,

272
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
you're going to start a new life?

273
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Even if I don't start now,

274
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I'll start sooner or later.

275
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Ding Yi,

276
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
we've all grown up.

277
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
You should think about

278
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
how to go on your own path.

279
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
We used to be happy together.

280
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
But it's all in the past.

281
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I didn't expect you to be so determined.

282
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You're more relaxed than me.

283
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Of course.

284
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
How can you be worthy of the name

285
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Mr. Kang?

286
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You left me many beautiful memories.

287
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But it's all in the past.

288
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Are you really

289
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
not going to the studio?

290
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'll go to the studio as a friend.

291
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I often go to Guanggu.

292
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
After all,

293
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
the female host of the studio is Wan Jia.

294
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm here.

295
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Why are you two here?

296
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Sit down.

297
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
We'll talk about the cooperation

298
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
between Ou Hui and Yin Dong.

299
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
We'll go to Guangjie

300
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
and make a whole look.

301
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
What kind of look?

302
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
My sister will be discharged soon.

303
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Your outfit will be a burden

304
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
for my sister.

305
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You...

306
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Well,

307
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
men

308
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
are not good at expressing themselves.

309
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
But Mr. Ou is good at it.

310
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's good to change your look

311
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
occasionally.

312
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Am I right?

313
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I don't like him.

314
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
How can he be so vulgar?

315
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Don't worry.

316
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'll give you a big surprise.

317
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You can talk about your business.

318
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I'll take Weiwei to the toilet.

319
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Let's go.

320
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Let's go.

321
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Hello.

322
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Hello.

323
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Hello.

324
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Hello.

325
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Hello.

326
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Anba,

327
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
a dress here is so expensive.

328
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I don't want to buy it.

329
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Do you remember

330
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
why we came here today?

331
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
To change.

332
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
We don't need to pay anyway.

333
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
But...

334
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
But what?

335
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It's a must-have for every woman

336
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
to buy a dress without paying.

337
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Choose whatever you like.

338
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
So expensive.

339
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Let's try this dress.

340
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Okay.

341
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Please come with me.

342
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Let's go.

343
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I have a business to attend to.

344
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You can find your girlfriend

345
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
and that man and woman.

346
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Man and woman?

347
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I mean the one who doesn't have a woman's taste,

348
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
doesn't know how to get along with men,

349
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
doesn't know her position,

350
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Kang Weiwei.

351
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Actually,

352
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Weiwei is pretty good.

353
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
But her personality is straightforward.

354
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
She is quite a little person.

355
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
But you didn't see it.

356
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
If you can see less, then see less.

357
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I have to protect my eyes.

358
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Mr. Ou.

359
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
They are back.

360
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
How is it?

361
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Do you like my rhythm?

362
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Not bad, right?

363
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Oh my God!

364
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I didn't know that Weiwei

365
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
is so beautiful.

366
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Okay, not bad.

367
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
You don't have the experience of wearing high heels.

368
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
You are walking in a hurry.

369
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Three months.

370
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
After three months,

371
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I will be like before.

372
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Let's go.

373
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Let's go.

374
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I'm sorry.

375
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Are you okay?

376
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I'm fine.

377
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
You should see a doctor.

378
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Otherwise, you will get swollen.

379
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Oh, it doesn't matter.

380
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I will ask Yindou to send me home.

381
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
You can go to Yingzhou with me.

382
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
But I'm not going to eat with her today.

383
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I'm going to eat with her sister.

384
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Who paid your salary?

385
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Who paid you?

386
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Did I arrange it or you did?

387
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Weiwei, listen to Mr. Ou.

388
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Go.

389
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
But...

390
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Go to the party with me.

391
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Then we will go to the party together.

392
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
It's okay.

393
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Go.

394
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Go.

395
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Be careful.

396
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Do you think Weiwei and Ou Hui will have a chance to develop?

397
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Didn't you see Ou Hui looking at Weiwei's eyes?

398
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
The flowers are gone.

399
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Now it depends on whether Weiwei will give Ou Hui a chance.

400
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I think she can use this new relationship to forget Ding Yi.

401
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I hope she won't get hurt again.

402
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I'm sorry.

403
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I'm sorry.

404
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I'm sorry.

405
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I'm sorry.

406
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I'm sorry.

407
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm sorry.

408
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I hope she won't get hurt again.

409
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I need to go home and rest.

410
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Help me take my bag.

411
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Okay.

412
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I'll take you to the hospital.

413
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Be careful.

414
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I'll go home first and then go tomorrow.

415
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Kang Zirui?

416
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Amber?

417
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Xiaowei, go back to the studio first.

418
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Tell them that the call was rejected today.

419
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Okay.

420
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Thank you.

421
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Why are you here?

422
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I'm waiting for Yingdong to pick me up.

423
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Do you think this is Yuan's house?

424
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
You know how to pick him up.

425
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I thought you could talk in fucking Chinese.

426
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Say my language.

427
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Hot drinks or cold drinks like?

428
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
You can go to any place in except Piping.

429
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
But now it depends on what I do and work.

430
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
How did you get hurt?

431
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I fell down the stairs when I was doing the same thing with the actor.

432
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
It must have been the actress.

433
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Is this answer important to you?

434
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
No.

435
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
In my life, the most successful thing is to get back together with Yindong.

436
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
The most failed thing is that I didn't get to be with Yindong.

437
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I let you have a chance to get into it.

438
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Really? Let me think.

439
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Have we ever been in love?

440
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Why can't I remember?

441
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Goodbye.

442
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I'm sorry.

443
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
You're finally here.

444
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
What's wrong?

445
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Miss, I'm looking for something.

446
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Why did you lose it?

447
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Come here.

448
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I have a white box with something very important.

449
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I have to find it.

450
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
If it's at home, it won't be lost.

451
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
So don't worry.

452
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Jun, look, is this the box?

453
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Where did you find it?

454
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
In Mr. Ou's room.

455
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I told you I could find it.

456
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
When did my brother go to his room?

457
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I don't know.

458
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Weiwei.

459
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Look.

460
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
This is me.

461
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
This is Xiao Hui.

462
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
This is the only family photo of Xiao Hui and me.

463
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
This is also our only memory.

464
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
In Malaysia,

465
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
we have a family that is not rich,

466
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
but very happy.

467
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
We have parents who love us.

468
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
This photo was taken on the day Xiao Hui entered school at the age of seven.

469
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
That day,

470
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
mom made us red-fish,

471
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
and chestnut roast duck.

472
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Xiao Hui and I love it.

473
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
We ate it very well.

474
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
But mom and dad didn't move a single piece.

475
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I asked mom, I said,

476
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
why don't you eat it?

477
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Mom said she wasn't hungry.

478
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I knew it was mom and dad who fed us.

479
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
After eating,

480
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
we went to school happily.

481
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
When we got home,

482
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
we knew

483
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
that they were dying in the fire.

484
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
This is why Xiao Hui

485
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
was always reluctant

486
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
to cook these two dishes.

487
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
No wonder

488
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
all her restaurants

489
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
don't have these two dishes.

490
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
That year,

491
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I was 13 years old.

492
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Xiao Hui was only seven years old.

493
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
The only house that mom left

494
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
was taken by the debtors.

495
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Since then,

496
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Xiao Hui and I have never eaten a meal.

497
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
When we were hungry,

498
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
we ate other people's food.

499
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
When we were sleepy,

500
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
we slept under the bridge

501
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
in other people's rooms.

502
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Until one day,

503
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Xiao Hui and I

504
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
were stuck in a trash can

505
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
in a restaurant.

506
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
A boss

507
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
took us in

508
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
and gave us a job.

509
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Xiao Hui and I

510
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
are still doing it.

511
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Weiwei,

512
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
go to the supermarket with me.

513
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I want to make

514
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
a red-and-white fish and roast duck for Xiao Hui.

515
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I'll buy you whatever you want.

516
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
It's not convenient for you to go out

517
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
in a wheelchair.

518
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I want to pick it myself.

519
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I'm afraid I won't have a chance

520
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
to go with her in the future.

521
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
But...

522
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Don't say but.

523
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
If I sneak out next time,

524
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
you'll pay for it.

525
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Let's make a deal.

526
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Come back as soon as you buy

527
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
what you want.

528
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Let's go.

529
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Wait, wait.

530
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Tomatoes.

531
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Buy some tomatoes.

532
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Sister,

533
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
my auntie just bought tomatoes this morning.

534
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Don't take it.

535
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Then buy some fruits.

536
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Xiao Hui loves fruits.

537
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
My auntie just bought fruits.

538
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
They're all fresh.

539
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Today our task is to buy

540
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
red-and-white fish, roast duck and roast duck.

541
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
If you buy anything again,

542
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I'll take you home.

543
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Okay, okay.

544
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I'll listen to you.

545
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Xiao Hui's calling.

546
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Hello?

547
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Where did you take my sister?

548
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
We went out to buy something.

549
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Who told you to take her out?

550
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
What if something happens?

551
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Or you get a cold?

552
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Can you take the responsibility?

553
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I...

554
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Don't explain.

555
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I'll tell you when we get home.

556
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
But...

557
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Hello?

558
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
What's wrong?

559
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Are you okay?

560
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I'm fine.

561
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Look,

562
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I just called you.

563
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
And you took so many things.

564
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Take them back.

565
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I'll go wash the dishes.

566
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Weiwei, wait.

567
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Okay.

568
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Dad!

569
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I'm back.

570
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Where's my sister?

571
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
In the kitchen.

572
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Look, Weiwei,

573
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
who told you to take my sister out?

574
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I can break the contract now

575
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
without your permission.

576
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I...

577
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Xiao Hui.

578
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Weiwei, come.

579
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I'm back.

580
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
We'll talk after dinner.

581
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
What did you cook today?

582
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Look,

583
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I cooked your favorite dishes.

584
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
All the dishes today

585
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
were bought by me and my sister.

586
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And I made them for you.

587
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Come, sit down.

588
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Why are you still standing?

589
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I'm happy today.

590
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Let's drink some wine.

591
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Sister,

592
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
the doctor said you can't drink.

593
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I'll drink a little.

594
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Drink with me.

595
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Okay.

596
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Come on, let's drink.

597
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Cheers.

598
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I wish you good health.

599
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Xiao Hui,

600
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
try it.

601
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
See if it tastes like before.

602
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It's delicious.

603
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Cheers.

604
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Come on, drink some more.

605
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Sister,

606
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I can't drink anymore.

607
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
The doctor said

608
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
you don't have to drink so much.

609
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I won't drink anymore, okay?

610
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Xiao Hui often doesn't come to dinner.

611
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
It's rare for him to come here once.

612
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Xiao Hui will drink with you tomorrow.

613
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Xiao Hui, Weiwei,

614
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
you two drink some more.

615
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Come on.

616
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Pour some for Xiao Hui.

617
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
And then, Weiwei,

618
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
drink some more.

619
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
You can't waste such a good wine.

620
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Come on, you two drink some more.

621
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Come on, hurry up, Weiwei.

622
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Come on, drink some more.

623
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Weiwei, when will you come back?

624
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I want to talk to you.

625
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Weiwei is not coming tonight.

626
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I'll go to the hospital.

627
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Okay.

628
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I'll be there.

629
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Okay.

630
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I'll be there.

631
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Okay.

632
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I'll be there.

633
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Okay.

634
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I'll be there.

635
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Okay.

636
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I'll be there.

637
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I'll talk to you now.

638
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I ignore she.

639
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
You increasing.

640
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
He had too much.

641
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
So he's ignoring.

642
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,640
OK.

643
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,200
Weiwei, are you OK?

644
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Weiwei, talk to me.

645
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
If you don't talk, I'll go inside.

646
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

647
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,560
Oh, good Lord!!!

648
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,560
Ohh, cool taste!

649
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,560
You don't seem to like delicious food.

650
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,560
My goodness, what a bad style.

651
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,560
Really?)

652
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,560
What?

653
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,560
Where's older person?

654
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,560
You don't have a lot of stuff, right?

655
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,800
Faena.

656
00:40:50,800 --> 00:41:06,400
Berlin, February

657
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,400
I'm sorry.

658
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,400
Where am I?

659
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,400
Why am I in the bathtub?

660
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,400
This is my room.

661
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,400
You drank too much last night.

662
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,400
You passed by my room and didn't leave.

663
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,400
You were in the bathtub and didn't come out.

664
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,400
Did you hit me?

665
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,400
Why are you so uncomfortable?

666
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,400
Of course.

667
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,400
You slept in the bathtub all night.

668
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,400
Your sleeping posture is so horrible.

669
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,400
All kinds of saliva and snot.

670
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,400
Your snoring sounds like thunder.

671
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,400
You made me sleep all night.

672
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,400
You lied to me.

673
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,400
Get up and wash your face.

674
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,400
I'll take you out for a walk.

675
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,400
I'm coming.

676
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,400
Why should I listen to you?

677
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,400
Because you're my girlfriend.

678
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,400
This is your job.

679
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,400
You like cooking so much.

680
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,400
I like it very much.

681
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,400
Every time I see the food that others like to eat, I'm very happy.

682
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,400
I feel very fulfilled.

683
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,400
I heard that you need money to pay for my rent.

684
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,400
Is that restaurant yours?

685
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,400
That's my best friend's restaurant.

686
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,400
I think you're really strange.

687
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,400
Why are you so nice to others?

688
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,400
I'm sorry.

689
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,400
