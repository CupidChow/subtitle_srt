99
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I can't control my emotions

100
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Are you hungry?

101
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yes

102
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Let's have a dinner

103
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Kang Zirui

104
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Ember, why are you here?

105
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I should be the one asking this

106
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What are you doing here?

107
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm here to talk to Mr.Kang.

108
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Who are you talking to?

109
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Amber, don't do that.

110
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Let me go.

111
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Let me go.

112
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Amber.

113
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Let me go.

114
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Brother, why are you here?

115
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Let me go.

116
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Run.

117
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Blood.

118
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I didn't mean to do that.

120
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's all your fault.

121
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Why are you always getting into trouble?

122
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Who are you talking to?

123
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm talking to you.

124
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Let's go to the hospital.

125
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Thank you for coming with me.

126
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Thank you.

127
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Don't be so polite.

128
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You usually help us.

129
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
We'll help you do that little thing today.

130
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's what you should do.

131
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Are you upset because of Ding Xiao?

132
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You're funny.

133
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's easy to solve your problems.

134
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But you can't solve them when you're facing yourself.

135
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You can't be selfish.

136
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'll give you a drink.

137
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Come on.

138
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Don't think about those unhappy things.

139
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Today, we'll drink with you.

140
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Let's drink to our heart's content.

141
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm not drunk.

142
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What about them?

143
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
They're not drunk.

144
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
They're not drunk.

145
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Don't mind them.

146
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Let's drink.

147
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Let's drink.

148
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Let's drink.

149
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Let's clean up these things.

150
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And plan everything.

151
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Got it?

152
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Son.

153
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Why are you calling me all night?

154
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What happened?

155
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I can't get through to Youxi.

156
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Brother Ding.

157
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What's wrong with you?

158
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I have something to tell you.

159
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm telling you,

160
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
only when you find him,

161
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
can you find him.

162
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Even Xiaoqiu doesn't answer his phone.

163
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Xiaoqiu is in a relationship?

164
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What's wrong?

165
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I can't get through to Youxi and Xiaoqiu.

166
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
This brat.

167
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
He's lying about Mr. Lan.

168
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I scolded him a few times and he ran away from home.

169
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Son, don't worry.

170
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Your mother played this game too much when she was young.

171
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's okay.

172
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
She gave all the pocket money this month to Mei Bao.

173
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Mei Bao can't play any tricks.

174
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Don't worry.

175
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Mom, we agreed.

176
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Xiaoqiu is in a bad mood.

177
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
We'll go to karaoke with her.

178
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But I went and she's not here.

179
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I can't even get through to Wanjia.

180
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Usually,

181
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
there will be an accident in this situation.

182
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
What accident?

183
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Mei Bao.

184
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Did Youxi call you?

185
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
No.

186
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm her most stressed girlfriend.

187
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm the one she doesn't want to see.

188
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
She won't call me.

189
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Don't worry.

190
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'll call Wang Qiao and ask him when I get home.

191
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Okay?

192
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'll ask him.

193
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Don't worry.

194
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Wanjia is with San Mao.

195
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
San Mao will send her home.

196
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Mom,

197
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
they don't answer their phones.

198
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Do you think something happened to them?

199
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Something happened?

200
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What happened?

201
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What's this place?

202
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
How did I know?

203
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Hello?

204
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Hello, Mr. Hua.

205
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Do you need to stay here today?

206
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
No.

207
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
If you don't,

208
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
please file a return form before midnight.

209
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Okay.

210
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Thank you.

211
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Do you know

212
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
how we got here yesterday?

213
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
A taxi driver came to pick you up last night.

214
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
He left a message on the front desk.

215
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
The fare has been taken from your wallet.

216
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Is that all?

217
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
That's all?

218
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That's all.

219
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Okay.

220
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Thank you.

221
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Goodbye.

222
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I remember now.

223
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
We were at KTV yesterday.

224
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
They all left.

225
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Only us two are left.

226
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Oh no.

227
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
They must have been looking for us all night.

228
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
What should we do?

229
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
What should we say?

230
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
How should we explain it?

231
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
How should we explain it?

232
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
We didn't say anything.

233
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Just say it.

234
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
No.

235
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Why?

236
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
We were in the same room,

237
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
in the same bed,

238
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
in the same hotel,

239
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
and all night.

240
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Who would believe us?

241
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
They are your friends.

242
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
They will believe you.

243
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Even if they believe me,

244
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
what if others find out?

245
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
They will believe me.

246
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And Huayou Xi.

247
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Whatever Huayou Xi says,

248
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
it will become smelly.

249
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
The most important thing is

250
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
you don't know what to do.

251
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What about you?

252
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
We can't say we are together.

253
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You can be one of them.

254
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I can be one of them.

255
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Just say we have never seen each other.

256
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
That's it?

257
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What are you doing?

258
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm taking a leave.

259
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
10,000 per person.

260
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Hello, Mr. Hua.

261
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I have booked a hotel room for you.

262
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Please accept it.

263
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
1,500 yuan.

264
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
How can it be so expensive?

265
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Last night,

266
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
when the taxi driver

267
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
brought you two here,

268
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
the hotel room was already full.

269
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So I gave you two a room for two.

270
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
The price is a little more expensive

271
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
than the room for one.

272
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm sorry.

273
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The room is a little more expensive.

274
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
A little more expensive?

275
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It's like this.

276
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
The room is much more luxurious

277
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
than the room for one.

278
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It has a double-bedroom, double-bedroom bathtub

279
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
and a double-bedroom bed

280
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
designed specifically for one.

281
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I believe you will have a good experience.

282
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I've never experienced anything

283
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
that is really luxurious.

284
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Would you like to have a drink?

285
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Yes.

286
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Please wait a moment.

287
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Thank you.

288
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Have breakfast.

289
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
What breakfast?

290
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Let's go.

291
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
1,500 yuan for one night?

292
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I don't want breakfast.

293
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Who is this girl?

294
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I told you, you don't know her.

295
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Brother.

296
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Zirui, are you okay?

297
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Are you serious?

298
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You're the one who's handsome.

299
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
What are you doing?

300
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Zirui.

301
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
My father and the director here are good friends.

302
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I've already asked Uncle to give you the best doctor.

303
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Let me see if you're okay.

304
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Director Kang, don't touch him.

305
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
What's wrong, sister?

306
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You're still laughing.

307
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Do you want me to take your glasses off?

308
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What are you afraid of?

309
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Didn't the doctor just say that

310
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
you didn't hurt your eyes?

311
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's okay if the wound heals.

312
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Don't worry.

313
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Besides,

314
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
even if you and I really become a pair,

315
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
we will still be the most handsome couple.

316
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
What are you doing?

317
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm going to take a picture of this precious picture.

318
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'll see who dares to say that my sister doesn't have a woman's taste.

319
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Then I'll show it to her.

320
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Tell her what the real woman's taste is.

321
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Okay.

322
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Stop crying.

323
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
From now on,

324
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I don't want anything.

325
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
As long as I have my sister,

326
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
that's enough.

327
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Just say it.

328
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I want to talk to you about business.

329
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Did you find out what news your sister has?

330
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's not just news.

331
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's a big news today.

332
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
My son is good at it.

333
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
There's still a big news.

334
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Come on.

335
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Tell me.

336
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
This news has three levels of subversive.

337
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
How can it be so easy to get a woman's taste?

338
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm not going to tell you.

339
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm going to tell you.

340
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm going to tell you.

341
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Three levels of subversive.

342
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
How can it be so easy to give you?

343
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Give me.

344
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I can't give it to you.

345
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I can't give it to you.

346
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm having a hard time with this news.

347
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'll give you the credit card.

348
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You bastard.

349
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You're a scumbag.

350
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
This is not a scumbag.

351
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Think about it.

352
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's definitely a fair trade.

353
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Besides,

354
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
if I don't return the credit card,

355
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
the bank will have a record.

356
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I can't afford to buy a house in the future.

357
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Do you want me to live with my husband forever?

358
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
All right, all right.

359
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Tell me.

360
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Give it to me.

361
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Do you really want to see it?

362
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Be prepared.

363
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Hello.

364
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Now I know

365
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
why Wan Jia and Xiaoju

366
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
didn't come back last night.

367
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Lin Dong.

368
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Did Wan Jia call you today?

369
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
No.

370
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
What about last night?

371
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Nothing. What's wrong?

372
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Nothing.

373
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I thought you two were in touch.

374
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
We haven't reached the point

375
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
where we can report to the police every day.

376
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I don't like this either.

377
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Do you like your girlfriend

378
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
to stick to your every move every day?

379
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Wan Jia.

380
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Why are you here?

381
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
We were just talking.

382
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And you came.

383
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I have a friend's birthday.

384
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I came to see

385
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
if there was any suitable gift.

386
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Then you can look around.

387
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
By the way,

388
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
why didn't you call last night?

389
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
My phone is out of battery.

390
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Your phone is out of battery?

391
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Where did you go?

392
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I...

393
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I was with Amber.

394
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
With Amber?

395
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Yes.

396
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
All night?

397
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
We talked all night.

398
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Then we talked.

399
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I didn't notice

400
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
that my phone was out of battery.

401
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
When did you have

402
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
so much to talk to Amber?

403
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
We...

404
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
We were just talking about

405
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
the love affair.

406
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
She wanted to buy a new painting

407
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
in the store.

408
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
She wanted to ask me

409
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
for my opinion.

410
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I...

411
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Yingdong.

412
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Yingdong.

413
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Wan Jia.

414
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Yingdong.

415
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Wan Jia.

416
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
How could you lie?

417
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
We were with Amber.

418
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Where were you last night?

419
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I...

420
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I...

421
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Enough.

422
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Don't force her anymore.

423
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Listen.

424
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
We were together last night.

425
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You two were together?

426
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I know you won't believe it.

427
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
But we really

428
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
didn't do anything.

429
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
No.

430
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
We were singing together.

431
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Why were you two together?

432
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
You were together all night?

433
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Dingyi, listen to me.

434
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
We were really singing last night.

435
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
But we were drunk.

436
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
The first-time we met,

437
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
we were taken to the hotel.

438
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
We slept in our own rooms.

439
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
But nothing happened.

440
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Then...

441
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Mom.

442
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Mom.

443
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I can't stand it anymore.

444
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I'm dying, Xiao Qiao.

445
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Persistence.

446
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Persistence is victory.

447
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Good luck.

448
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Give me your phone.

449
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
No.

450
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
You asked me to keep your phone.

451
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
If I give it to you now,

452
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
you'll send a message to Kang Zirui.

453
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I have a full-auto machine now.

454
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
If you can't hold on,

455
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I'll listen to you.

456
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Good luck.

457
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Xiao Qiao.

458
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Please.

459
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Give me your phone.

460
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I promise.

461
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I won't send her a message.

462
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I'll see if she sent a message.

463
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I've checked it for you.

464
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
No. Don't worry.

465
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
You're so stubborn.

466
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
You're so stubborn.

467
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
You're talking about me or her?

468
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Both.

469
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I'll check it.

470
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Xiao Qiao,

471
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
can you give me your phone?

472
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It's useless for you to pretend to be cute.

473
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Now is the critical time.

474
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
You have to hold on.

475
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
A man's heart is not returned.

476
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You are Amber.

477
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Does this make sense?

478
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I've been holding on for four days.

479
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I've broken the record.

480
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,240
MAMURA.

481
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,400
What happened?

482
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,120
She's gonna kill herself.

483
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,680
How come I heard nothing about Zirui?

484
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,400
I assumed she had decided to salesman.

485
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,320
So, it's the new heading.

486
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,800
There's so much...

487
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,080
She joined the 👉 crew.

488
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,680
Oh, no...

489
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,680
There are so many actresses in the crew.

490
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,680
And those makeup artists, makeup artists, and little sisters are with her.

491
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,680
What if she forgets me after the show?

492
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,680
Is the crew so chaotic?

493
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,680
What should I do?

494
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,680
I'm sorry.

495
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,680
I'm sorry.

496
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,680
Let's have dinner together tonight.

497
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,680
Xiao Qiu asked me out for dinner.

498
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,680
Xiao Qiu asked everyone out for dinner?

499
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,680
Are you deaf? I said I know.

500
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,680
Don't you understand the meaning of this dinner?

501
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,680
Isn't it about the relationship between the actors and the actresses?

502
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,680
I said you're a fool.

503
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:12,680
First of all, it's not certain whether the relationship between the actors and the actresses will be cleared or not.

504
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,680
I'm sorry.

505
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,680
We have to be prepared.

506
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,680
If we get married, it's best for you.

507
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,680
Who are you angry at at this time?

508
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,680
If they announce their relationship,

509
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,680
then...

510
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,680
I haven't thought about it.

511
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,680
You go by yourself. I don't want to go.

512
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,680
Are you stupid?

513
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,680
Can you go after Wan Jia? This dinner is important.

514
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,680
The food is here. Did you open the door?

515
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,680
Coming.

516
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,680
What's wrong?

517
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,680
I'm sorry. I'm late for school.

518
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,680
Sit down.

519
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,680
Okay, sit here.

520
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,680
You're the host.

521
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,680
Xiao Qiu.

522
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,680
Sit down.

523
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,680
Okay, everyone is here.

524
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,680
I've been preparing for a long time.

525
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,680
It's time to talk about it.

526
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,680
Don't be so serious.

527
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,680
I don't want to eat.

528
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,680
I won't eat.

529
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,680
You're just here to eat hot pot.

530
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,680
If you have something to say, say it.

531
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,680
Xiao Qiu.

532
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,680
Say it.

533
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,680
I support you.

534
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,680
I want to tell everyone

535
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,680
that Wan Jia and I

536
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,680
are very ordinary friends.

537
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,680
I hope you don't misunderstand.

538
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,680
Yes, we were drunk that day.

539
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:20,680
We really spent the night at the hotel.

540
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,680
But we didn't do anything.

541
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,680
We didn't do anything.

542
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,680
So I hope you don't misunderstand.

543
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,680
Xiao Qiu, it's not right.

544
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,680
I hope people who hear you say that

545
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,680
don't feel like they're here.

546
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,680
You're right.

547
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,680
No matter if it's a misunderstanding,

548
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,680
as long as one person misunderstands,

549
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,680
there's hope, right?

550
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,680
Mom, you're so wise.

551
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,680
Go away.

552
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,680
It's none of your business.

553
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,680
Wan Jia, did you hear what Samo said?

554
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,680
Do you have anything to say?

555
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,680
Mengmeng, I really don't have anything.

556
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,680
We're just friends.

557
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,680
Yes.

558
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,680
I believe you.

559
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,680
But I want to ask you.

560
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,680
What's your relationship with Ding Yi?

561
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,680
We're good friends.

562
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,680
Good friends?

563
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,680
Mom.

564
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,680
Everyone knows that Ding Yi likes you.

565
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,680
Mom.

566
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,680
You don't dare to say anything.

567
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,680
I'll tell you today.

568
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,680
Wan Jia.

569
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,680
How much has Ding Yi done for you?

570
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,680
Don't you know?

571
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,680
As long as you think about it,

572
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,680
you'll know why.

573
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,680
Are these things done by friends?

574
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,680
Did he do so much for you

575
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,680
just because he likes you?

576
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,680
Mom, stop it.

577
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,680
You don't want me to say it

578
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,680
because you don't dare to face this relationship.

579
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,680
You're afraid that you'll lose your friends.

580
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,680
Don't be afraid to lose him.

581
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,680
Fate is yours.

582
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,680
You can't force it.

583
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,680
He rarely finds a fool like you.

584
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,680
Losing you is his loss.

585
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,680
Wan Jia, I want to make it clear.

586
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,680
Because you're not sure about your feelings,

587
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,680
Ding Yi doesn't dare to confess to you.

588
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,680
If you don't like him,

589
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,680
let him give up.

590
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,680
He's been with you for so many years.

591
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,680
Do you know how much he lost because of you?

592
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,680
If it weren't for you,

593
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,680
he would have found a girlfriend long ago.

594
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,680
Don't you think you're too selfish?

595
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,680
Besides, between Han Ding Yi and Ying Dong,

596
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,680
you chose Ying Dong.

597
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,680
There's nothing wrong with that.

598
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,680
I can understand. Who doesn't have a heart of gold?

599
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,680
But you can't marry into the rich family again.

600
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,680
You have to find a backup.

601
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,680
You have to be comforted and coaxed.

602
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,680
You have to find a way to adjust your happiness.

603
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,680
You want too much.

604
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,680
You're too selfish.

605
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,680
Who do you love?

606
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,680
I want you to make it clear.

607
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,680
My son and my brother

608
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,680
are my life.

609
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,680
Enough. Enough.

610
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,680
Don't say anymore.

611
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,680
Mom,

612
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,680
I know you don't want me to be hurt.

613
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,680
But I don't want you to hurt Wan Jia.

614
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,680
I'm really nothing to Wan Jia.

615
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,680
I just treat her like my sister.

616
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,680
Meng Jian, I'm sorry.

617
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,680
I really didn't know I made so many people unhappy.

618
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,680
I don't know what other people think of me.

619
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,680
But I want to tell you

620
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,680
that there's only one person I like.

621
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,680
He is Ying Dong.

622
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,680
I'm a little uncomfortable. I'm leaving.

623
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,680
You guys eat slowly.

624
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,680
I'm sorry. I'll leave you two alone.

625
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,680
Wan Jia!

626
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,680
I'll go take a look.

627
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,680
Wan Jia!

628
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,680
Why did you do this?

629
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,680
I'm embarrassed.

630
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,680
What's wrong?

631
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,680
Are you still talking to Meng?

632
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,680
She's talking too much.

633
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,680
But think about it.

634
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,680
She's usually her brother.

635
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,680
She's usually her biological son.

636
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,680
You're the only one she can sacrifice.

637
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,680
Take it easy.

638
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,680
Are you listening to me?

639
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,680
What are you talking about?

640
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,680
I want to ask.

641
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,680
Meng said that.

642
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,680
What do you think happened between you and Han Lin Yi?

643
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,680
Do you think

644
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,680
that I've broken up

645
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,680
with Ying Dong?

646
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,680
Did you explain it to him?

647
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,680
I don't know how to explain it.

648
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,680
Because I'm afraid that

649
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,680
he won't believe me.

650
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,680
If there's no basic trust

651
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,680
between two people,

652
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,680
what's the point of being together?

653
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,680
I don't know.

654
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,680
What's the point of being together?

655
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,680
Go to sleep.

656
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,680
Wei Wei.

657
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,680
Am I really

658
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,680
a bad woman?

659
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,680
Of course not.

660
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,680
But I think Meng is right.

661
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,680
I want everything.

662
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,680
I want everything.

663
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,680
I never thought about their feelings.

664
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,680
I'm sorry.

665
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,680
You're just insecure.

666
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,680
You don't want to lose them.

667
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,680
You're afraid that your rejection

668
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,680
will hurt them.

669
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,680
I think Meng is right.

670
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,680
If it weren't for me,

671
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,680
Han Lin Yi

672
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,680
would have found his happiness long ago.

673
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,680
And between Ying Dong and me,

674
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,680
it might not be love at all.

675
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,680
Every woman wants to marry into the rich family.

676
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,680
And Ying Dong

677
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,680
might just be a newbie.

678
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,680
Because he doesn't know me.

679
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,680
He's curious.

680
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,680
So

681
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,680
there's no love between us.

682
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,680
Han Lin Yi likes you.

683
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,680
It's his freedom.

684
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,680
Even if you don't reject him,

685
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,680
he can choose to like you or leave you.

686
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,680
It's his choice.

687
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,680
Don't let everything

688
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,680
be your own.

689
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,680
Although Ying Dong is a rich man,

690
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,680
who says that a rich man doesn't have true love?

691
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,680
If you want to marry into the rich family,

692
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,680
it doesn't mean you don't have feelings for him.

693
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,680
Who says that a rich man and true love can only be chosen by two?

694
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,680
But now,

695
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,680
I can't even look at myself.

696
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,680
I don't deserve to have any of them.

697
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,680
I don't allow you to say that.

698
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,680
You're always the cutest little princess.

699
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,680
You deserve to have the best thing.

700
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,680
Wei Wei,

701
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,680
it's so nice to have you.

702
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,680
I love you!

703
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,680
I have to go to a meeting later.

704
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,680
You can tell me if you have anything.

705
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,680
I think my dream is about to end.

706
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,680
What?

707
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:41,680
Do you know that I've been dreaming for the past two months?

708
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,680
I don't know when this dream will come true.

709
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:51,680
But I'm really afraid of the day when I'll wake up from this dream.

710
00:37:51,680 --> 00:38:02,680
Now that I think about it, I should wake up from this dream.

711
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,680
You mean you're not happy with me?

712
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:15,680
I'm happy. But this happiness is not real.

713
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,680
It's like a movie.

714
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,680
I'm an actor and an audience.

715
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:31,680
As an actor, I hope this movie can last forever.

716
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:41,680
But as an audience, I know that movies will come to an end.

717
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,680
Time flies.

718
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,680
Are you in a good mood today?

719
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,680
I'm calm.

720
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,680
What do you want to say?

721
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,680
I want to say...

722
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,680
Hello?

723
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,680
Okay, I'll be there tonight.

724
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,680
I'm sorry, but I have to go to a meeting.

725
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,680
Can't you stay for five more minutes?

726
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,680
I can't even stay for a minute.

727
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,680
I'm sorry.

728
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,680
Hello?

729
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,680
Brother Ding, do you know where I am?

730
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,680
I don't know. Is he still not back?

731
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,680
Yes. I can't get through the phone. I'm afraid he'll get in trouble.

732
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,680
We talked all night yesterday. I don't feel very well.

733
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,680
Is it because of what my mother said that it's stimulating her?

734
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,680
I think so.

735
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,680
Don't worry. Maybe she just wants to be alone for a while.

736
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,680
Let's split up. We'll call you when we get the news.

737
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,680
Okay.

738
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,680
Oh, my God!

739
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,680
I can't believe it.

740
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,680
It's too late.

741
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,680
I'm back.

742
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,680
I'm sorry.

743
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,680
I'm sorry.

744
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,680
I'm sorry.

745
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,680
I'm sorry.

746
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,680
I'm sorry.

747
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,680
I'm sorry.

748
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,680
I'm sorry.

749
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,680
I'm sorry.

750
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,680
I'm sorry.

751
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,680
It doesn't matter who mentioned it.

752
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,080
The important thing is...

753
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,880
we can't be together anymore.

754
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,480
If you've decided to break up with Yingdong,

755
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,080
I support you.

756
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:28,880
But you don't want to break up with such a good man like Yingdong?

757
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,880
If I'm with him because of his identity,

758
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,880
is this love called love?

759
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:42,080
If I'm with him because of this,

760
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,080
then I'll be the one I despise the most.

761
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,080
Our family has grown up.

762
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,080
We know what we want.

763
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,080
Then you can be with him.

764
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,280
What do you know?

765
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,880
After you broke up with Yingdong,

766
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,680
do you want to be with Ding Yi?

767
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,480
I don't know.

768
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,080
I don't know anything.

769
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,080
Don't think about it.

770
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,680
I'm here.

771
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,080
I'll be with you.

772
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,280
I'll be with you.

773
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,480
Brother Ding Yi.

774
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,080
Weiwei told me I couldn't find you.

775
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,280
I'm glad you're okay.

776
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,480
Ding Yi.

777
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,080
I have a favor to ask of you.

778
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,280
I'm sorry.

779
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,480
I'm sorry.

780
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,680
I'm sorry.

781
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,880
I'm sorry.

782
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,080
I'm sorry.

783
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,280
I'm sorry.

784
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,480
I'm sorry.

785
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,680
I'm sorry.

786
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,880
I'm sorry.

787
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,080
I'm sorry.

788
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,280
I'm sorry.

789
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,480
I'm sorry.

790
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,680
I'm sorry.

791
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,880
I'm sorry.

792
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,080

I'm sorry.

796
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,880
I'm sorry.

797
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,080
I'm sorry.

798
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,280
I'm sorry.

799
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,480
