1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,720
Where's your neck though?

2
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,040
Hanging out with Ha 14?

3
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,780
Yeah.

4
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,980
Okay, we're done here.

5
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,440
What happened to you?

6
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,080
That's none of your business.

7
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,880
He's not the sir都是aa.

8
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,840
No problem.

9
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,500
I don't know anything about you.

10
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,120
That was an vulgar remark.

11
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,120
that youilingual.

12
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,700
I thougt you're using someone for the same game

13
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:24,700
to

14
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,720
force someone

15
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,720
to

16
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,120
You'll never be able to control your emotions.

17
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,320
You've been living a good life.

18
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,320
How come you're so good-hearted?

19
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,320
Tell me what's wrong with me.

20
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,120
You left home without a reason.

21
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,120
Why should I care?

22
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,120
She left a letter.

23
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,720
No one wrote it.

24
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,120
She only mentioned the name Hua Youxi.

25
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,320
She also said she'd never forgive you for your insult.

26
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,120
What did you do?

27
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,120
What did I do?

28
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,120
I'm leaving.

29
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,120
I'm not leaving.

30
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,120
Did you really leave without a reason?

31
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,320
I really didn't.

32
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,720
You've been bad at school.

33
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,120
I don't blame you.

34
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,920
You're born a love-sick.

35
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,120
You're just like your dad.

36
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,720
You're irresponsible.

37
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,320
You didn't even know how to clean up after you broke up.

38
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,320
Look at you.

39
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,520
You made the director's daughter run away from home.

40
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,720
Look at you now.

41
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,320
The school doesn't want you anymore.

42
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,320
How can I go out and meet people?

43
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,520
How can I have a son like you?

44
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,520
Mom.

45
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,720
Say something and I'll stop.

46
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,720
You're so stubborn.

47
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,320
Look at your brother.

48
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,720
He's never let me worry about anything.

49
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,720
He's always taken care of everything.

50
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,320
If you have a brother like him,

51
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,520
I'll be grateful to God.

52
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,520
What did you say?

53
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,720
You're wrong.

54
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,920
It's not good.

55
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,120
He made you angry.

56
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,320
Just don't throw me away.

57
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,520
If I had known you were like this,

58
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,120
I wouldn't have let you out.

59
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,920
You shouldn't have let me out.

60
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,520
You're a good woman.

61
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,520
You're a good woman.

62
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,520
You're really not a good woman.

63
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,920
I'm telling you.

64
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,520
You're a bad woman.

65
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,520
I'm telling you.

66
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,520
You're a bad woman.

67
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,520
You're really making me angry.

68
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,520
No wonder the school doesn't want you.

69
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,520
They don't want you.

70
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,720
Yeah.

71
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,320
No one wants me.

72
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,520
My dad doesn't want me.

73
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
I'm fine.

74
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,120
I know my dad's surname is Han.

75
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,120
What about me?

76
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,520
I don't even know my dad's surname.

77
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,720
No.

78
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,520
I told you not to say anything.

79
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,520
Okay.

80
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,520
Everyone is in a bad mood.

81
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,720
Say a few words.

82
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,720
What's wrong with you?

83
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,720
What's wrong with my family?

84
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,720
You want my mom?

85
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,720
Fine. I'll give up.

86
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,720
My mom can't see me anyway.

87
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,920
Hua Youxi!

88
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,120
Apologize!

89
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,320
Why should I apologize?

90
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,720
It's enough that you're here.

91
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,720
I'm just a fish in the water.

92
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,720
Dingyi, call Mr. Lan.

93
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,720
Tell him to teach this irresponsible thing a lesson.

94
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,920
No need to talk.

95
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,720
No need to bother him.

96
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,720
I'm just a bad person.

97
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,720
I'm not going back to school.

98
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,920
I'm not going to study.

99
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,720
Come back!

100
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
Mom.

101
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,720
Mom.

102
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,920
Don't worry.

103
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,720
She's just angry.

104
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,920
I'll go get her.

105
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,920
Don't go.

106
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,120
Stay with Meng.

107
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
I'll go get her.

108
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,720
Okay.

109
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,720
Why are you so angry?

110
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,720
Actually,

111
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,120
Meng was a little too much.

112
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,120
Who says you're a coward?

113
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,120
You're pretty good at playing games.

114
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,120
I'm the worst at anything

115
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,120
besides studying.

116
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,120
Do you know my nickname?

117
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,120
What?

118
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,320
Playing games?

119
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,720
Then you must fight with me next time.

120
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
Okay.

121
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,120
I'll wait for you to finish your book.

122
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,520
You're so brave.

123
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,720
By the way,

124
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,720
have you really never seen your father?

125
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
No.

126
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,720
You didn't think of going to see him?

127
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
I did.

128
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,920
Why not?

129
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,120
I have no clues.

130
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,120
Did Meng ever mention you?

131
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,320
She's very strict.

132
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,320
I think my dad must have hurt her badly.

133
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,120
I must have hurt her badly today.

134
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,720
Mom.

135
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
Don't be sad.

136
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,720
I'm here.

137
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,720
I'm here.

138
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
I'm here.

139
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,720
I'm here.

140
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
I'm here.

141
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,720
I'm here.

142
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,720
I'm here.

143
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,720
I just sent a message to Feifei.

144
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,720
They're together.

145
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,720
It's okay.

146
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
She's not angry.

147
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,720
She said she wanted to.

148
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,720
I've never had a son like her.

149
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,720
I'd rather not have a son like him.

150
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,720
What kind of mom has a son like that?

151
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
You're just like her.

152
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,720
You're so willful.

153
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
You're here to teach your mom?

154
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,720
How dare I?

155
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
I think she's very good.

156
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,720
It's not easy to raise our son.

157
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
I don't want to know my dad.

158
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,720
You're here to make her happy again?

159
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,720
Mom.

160
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
Mom.

161
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,720
Actually, she's been so mean to you.

162
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
She wants you to care more about her.

163
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
Look.

164
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
How cute you two were when you were little.

165
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
Look at this picture.

166
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,720
You've been so quiet and honest since you were little.

167
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,720
Look at your brother.

168
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,720
He's been naughty since he was little.

169
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,720
He's a bad boy.

170
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,720
He's just like his dad.

171
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
Mom.

172
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
Is your father still alive?

173
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
He's not dead.

174
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,720
Does he have a wife now?

175
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,720
I don't know.

176
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,720
Why?

177
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,720
I don't know.

178
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,720
I don't know.

179
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,720
Mom.

180
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
Mom.

181
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,720
Mom, have you eaten?

182
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,720
I'm angry.

183
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,720
Come on.

184
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,720
Come on.

185
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,720
Hit me.

186
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
Mom, are you leaving?

187
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,720
You didn't sleep all night, did you?

188
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,720
Come with me.

189
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,720
I'm afraid I might not be able to help you.

190
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,720
Let's go.

191
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,720
Director.

192
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,720
Okay, I'll be there.

193
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,720
I'll be there.

194
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,720
I'll be there.

195
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,720
I'll be there.

196
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,720
I'll be there.

197
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,720
I'll be there.

198
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,720
I'll be there.

199
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,720
I'll be there.

200
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,720
Director.

201
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
This is the mother of Hua Youxi.

202
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,720
This is Director Guo.

203
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720
You can talk.

204
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
Come in.

205
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
Hello, Director.

206
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
Please sit down, Mrs. Hua.

207
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
I'm sorry.

208
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,720
I'm a single mother.

209
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,720
I haven't married.

210
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,720
I brought up two children.

211
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,720
You can call me Mrs. Hua.

212
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,720
I've heard that

213
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
your eldest son Han Dingyi is different from your younger son, right?

214
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
Yes.

215
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,720
I was too stubborn.

216
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,720
I didn't study hard.

217
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,720
I didn't find a responsible father for my child.

218
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,720
So the child has caused you a lot of trouble at school.

219
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,720
As a parent, I really apologize.

220
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,720
Hello, everyone.

221
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,720
If you can make Youxi and everyone feel better,

222
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,720
we will be happy.

223
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,720
Okay.

224
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,720
You and Weiwei go out first.

225
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
I'll drive myself.

226
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,720
And we will take Mengjie with us.

227
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,720
Youxi cried yesterday.

228
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,720
Don't worry, Xiaofei.

229
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,720
Youxi sings well.

230
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,720
Anyone can sing it back.

231
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,720
See you at the TTP.

232
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,720
Okay.

233
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,720
I'm going.

234
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,720
Bye.

235
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,720
Bye.

236
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,720
My little princess.

237
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,720
Daddy.

238
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,720
Where are you going to play the little flying crab tonight?

239
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,720
I'll tell you a secret.

240
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,720
My dear daughter has a secret that she can't tell daddy.

241
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,720
Daddy, you're so talkative.

242
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,720
It's just a friend who is in a bad mood.

243
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,720
Let's sing and chat with him.

244
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
Which friend has such a big face?

245
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,720
You don't know even if I tell you.

246
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,720
Yingdong.

247
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,720
Daddy.

248
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,720
Yingdong went on a business trip to Australia.

249
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,720
You don't even remember this, do you?

250
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,720
Who is that?

251
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,720
It's...

252
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,720
The one you hate very much.

253
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,720
Hua Youxi.

254
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
Don't go.

255
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,720
Why?

256
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,720
What's her identity? What's your identity?

257
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,720
Well, tonight daddy will be with you at home.

258
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,720
Don't go, okay?

259
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,720
No.

260
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,720
He helped me when I was in trouble.

261
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,720
How can I be so ungrateful?

262
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,720
Then tonight Xiaofei and daddy will be all packed.

263
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,720
But you can't go.

264
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,720
No.

265
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,720
You're so smart.

266
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,720
Baby, that kind of place is for drinking.

267
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,720
I'm afraid you'll be in danger.

268
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
If you're really worried about me,

269
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
then you can go with me.

270
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,720
Do you dare?

271
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,720
For my dear daughter, I'm willing to go anywhere.

272
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,720
Hurry up, hurry up. Who else is there?

273
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,720
Hurry up.

274
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,720
Princess, you're finally here.

275
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

276
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,720
Uncle Wu, welcome.

277
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
Uncle Wu.

278
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Uncle Wu.

279
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,720
Welcome to the hotel.

280
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,720
Welcome.

281
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
Welcome.

282
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,720
Welcome.

283
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,720
Welcome.

284
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,720
Welcome.

285
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
Welcome.

286
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,720
Welcome.

287
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,720
Welcome.

288
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,720
Welcome.

289
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,720
Welcome.

290
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,720
Welcome to our party.

291
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,720
Please sit down.

292
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
Sit down.

293
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,720
Sit down.

294
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
What are you doing? Your dad called you.

295
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,720
Who dares to sing?

296
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,720
He can't sing.

297
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,720
I can't do anything.

298
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,720
I can't stand it.

299
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
I can't stand it.

300
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,720
Uncle Wu, I'll sing a song for you.

301
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,720
No, no, no.

302
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,720
You're young.

303
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,720
Thank you.

304
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,720
We have two distinguished guests tonight.

305
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,720
Shall we invite them to sing?

306
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
Yes.

307
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,720
Let's invite Mengjie first.

308
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,720
Yes.

309
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,720
Feifei, you sing.

310
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,720
You sing well.

311
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,720
Mengjie, come on.

312
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,720
Come on.

313
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
Come on.

314
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,720
Come on.

315
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,720
I have another question.

316
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,720
Shall we invite Uncle Wu and Mengjie to sing together?

317
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,720
Sing together.

318
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,720
Sing together.

319
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,720
Sing together.

320
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,720
Sing together.

321
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,720
Sing together.

322
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
Sing together.

323
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,720
Sing together.

324
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,720
Daddy, you're the one who insisted on coming with me.

325
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,720
Why don't you come and play?

326
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,720
Hurry up.

327
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,720
Sing together.

328
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,720
Sing together.

329
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,720
Sing together.

330
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,720
Sing together.

331
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,720
Will you still love me tomorrow?

332
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,720
Yes.

333
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:08,720
Twin Bars

334
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,720
www.cult market.com

335
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,720
I still remember

336
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,720
whether you still love me tomorrow

337
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,720
I have already understood the rules of love

338
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,720
Although I can love you, I don't know what to do

339
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:56,720
I believe that one day you will leave

340
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,720
But tomorrow, will you still love me?

341
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,720
There is a story, but only one theme

342
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,720
I know your final choice

343
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,720
All love can only have one result

344
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:32,720
I know that it is definitely not me

345
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:40,720
Since I have loved you, why do I really have you?

346
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:47,720
Even if you leave, there will not be too much sadness

347
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,720
The melody of midnight is already singing

348
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:01,720
This is a perfect dream

349
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,720
Good! Good!

350
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,720
Since everyone is here today, I will make it clear

351
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:29,720
Honorable Miss Hua, I hope you can discipline her

352
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,720
I don't want her to appear near my daughter

353
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,720
Little friend, don't think too much

354
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,720
You and my daughter will not have any results

355
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,720
I will not let you go

356
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,720
Did you hear that? Don't come near her

357
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,720
Can you show your face? Get up

358
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,720
Emma, let's go

359
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,720
Go! Go!

360
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,720
It's you again! You are making trouble for me

361
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,720
You are so angry with me

362
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,720
Brother, brother, what are you doing?

363
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,720
What?

364
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,720
I'm hungry, can you eat?

365
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,720
Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat

366
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
I'm so tired

367
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,720
Did you call me yesterday?

368
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,720
My mother went to the bar last night

369
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,720
I guess she is drunk

370
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,720
Women usually just want to send out the fire in their hearts

371
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,720
Do you have a number?

372
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,720
Number?

373
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,720
If I have a number, why would I have a number?

374
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,720
But maybe she has fallen in love with me

375
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,720
And she is deeply in love with my man

376
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,720
I don't know if you have a man

377
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,720
I want to tell you something

378
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,720
You are full of smell

379
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,720
You need to wash it

380
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,720
No way, I use perfume every day

381
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,720
Come on, come on

382
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,720
Come on

383
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,720
Come on

384
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,720
Come on, let's wash it together

385
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,720
It's dirty

386
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,720
Okay

387
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,720
Why are there two cups?

388
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,720
Is there an outsider here?

389
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,720
What are you doing?

390
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,720
What are you doing?

391
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,720
What are you doing?

392
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,720
Why don't you wear clothes?

393
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,720
What are you doing?

394
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,720
Why are you here?

395
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,720
Why am I not here?

396
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,720
Why are you so surprised in the morning?

397
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,720
Mom, when did you come to my house?

398
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,720
She asked me to change clothes

399
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,720
Who asked you to change clothes?

400
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,720
I brought Feifei back

401
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,720
I asked her to sleep there

402
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,720
Because she drank with me and talked with me

403
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,720
To comfort me

404
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,720
Why are you talking to me and my brother?

405
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,720
Why are you talking to an outsider?

406
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,720
Outsider?

407
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,720
You still have the nerve to say

408
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,720
Yesterday Meng told me that you usually talk to her

409
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,720
It's just routine

410
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,720
No trouble at all

411
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,720
No

412
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,720
Don't be so naughty

413
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,720
I know my mom

414
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,720
My mom won't give up on others

415
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,720
I tell you

416
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,720
What I said last night is true

417
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
I tell you

418
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
Don't be so naughty

419
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,720
Don't be so embarrassing in front of Wu Luting

420
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,720
Do you hear me?

421
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,720
Okay, okay, okay, I hear you

422
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,720
Feifei, are you hungry?

423
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,720
I'll make you breakfast

424
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,720
Okay

425
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,720
You and us have breakfast and then go to school, okay?

426
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,720
Brother, brother, brother

427
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,720
Why are you asking me?

428
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,720
Ask an outsider

429
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,720
Why? Are you jealous?

430
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,720
Yes, how?

431
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,720
Why share someone else's love?

432
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,720
You say you are not childish

433
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,720
Who saw you dancing in the morning?

434
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,720
Go and put on clothes

435
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,720
I didn't dance

436
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,720
Feifei, what do you want to eat?

437
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,720
As long as it's made by Meng, I like to eat

438
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,720
You are the most considerate

439
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,720
Don't peek

440
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,720
Don't let me know

441
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,720
Who is looking at you?

442
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,720
Who is it? So early

443
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,720
Mr. Pang, come and have breakfast

444
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,720
I'll go to the door

445
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,720
Good morning

446
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,720
Morning, come in

447
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,720
You guessed wrong

448
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,720
It's not Kang Weiwei, it's Wanjia

449
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,720
Sooner or later, the position of Kang Weiwei will be replaced by Wanjia

450
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,720
Who will be the last?

451
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,720
Come, come

452
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,720
What are you knocking?

453
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,720
Mr. Pang

454
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,720
Where are you going?

455
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,720
When are you going to escape from my brother?

456
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,720
How did I escape?

457
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
I sang with you yesterday

458
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,720
You really want to break up with my brother so unknowingly?

459
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,720
What is the break-up?

460
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,720
I never got married with him

461
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,720
Don't be a ostrich anymore, okay?

462
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,720
You have a place to go

463
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,720
You have a place to go

464
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,720
You have a place to go

465
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,720
You have a place to go

466
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,720
You have a place to go

467
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,720
You have a place to go

468
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
You have a place to go

469
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,720
You have a place to go

470
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,720
You have a place to go

471
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,720
You have a place to go

472
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,720
You have a place to go

473
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,720
You have a place to go

474
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,720
You have a place to go

475
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,720
You have a place to go

476
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,720
You have a place to go

477
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,720
You have a place to go

478
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,640
Yet you are still trying tosighs καμε

479
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,180
If you did not want to go, I will not come

480
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,800
I have come to get something

481
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,480
It's in your extent

482
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,440
But難 consistently

483
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,640
You directly

484
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,320
You have to wake up so early.

485
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,560
And I have to make breakfast for you guys.

486
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,640
I'm really fine now.

487
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,240
I can sleep well every day.

488
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,480
Really.

489
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,840
Don't worry about me. Go back and eat.

490
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,320
You don't care?

491
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,240
Let's go.

492
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,960
Let's have breakfast together.

493
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,680
I'm not going.

494
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,480
I'm not going.

495
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,240
I'm going to kick your ass.

496
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,880
Wait, wait.

497
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,240
Weiwei.

498
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,720
You're here.

499
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,440
Breakfast is ready. Let's eat together.

500
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,040
Amazing.

501
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,320
So cool.

502
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,520
You're late.

503
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,160
The porridge is ready.

504
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,840
Great. I have porridge.

505
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,160
I'm hungry too.

506
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,400
I'll get you some porridge.

507
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,000
Weiwei.

508
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,800
I wanted to call you here.

509
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,040
But you're too asleep.

510
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,800
I can't wake you up.

511
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,360
Come on, let's eat.

512
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,240
So good.

513
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,560
Xiao Jia.

514
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,340
school

515
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,360
I'll cook for you every day if you like.

516
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,360
You're the best.

517
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,360
You can go to Dingyi's house and cook for us every day.

518
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,360
If I want to eat, I'll come to you.

519
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,360
You're so fake.

520
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,360
Since Dajin is here,

521
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,360
I'll make it clear.

522
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,360
Wanjia,

523
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,360
I've been thinking about this for a long time.

524
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,360
I've been wanting to ask you.

525
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,360
If Yingdong comes after you,

526
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,360
will you treat my brother well?

527
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,360
Will you come to my house every morning and walk around?

528
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,360
Youxi!

529
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,360
Have you gone mad?

530
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,360
Why are you so ugly?

531
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,360
Shut up.

532
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,360
I'm helping you.

533
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,360
I'm afraid you'll be kicked out

534
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,360
after you're a scarecrow.

535
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,360
Youxi, stop talking.

536
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,360
Shut up.

537
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,360
I'm helping you.

538
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,360
I've never seen you so stupid.

539
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,360
You can't even fight for the one you love.

540
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,360
You even gave it to someone else.

541
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,360
Youxi,

542
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,360
you've misunderstood me.

543
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,360
I've never treated Dingyi

544
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,360
as an emergency or substitute.

545
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,360
I won't use him.

546
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,360
That's the best.

547
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,360
I'll give him a few more hours.

548
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,360
You're not eating?

549
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,360
No.

550
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,360
You're acting like a star.

551
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,360
I'm full.

552
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,360
I'm full.

553
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,360
Youxi,

554
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,360
you're not well.

555
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,360
I'll be back later.

556
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,360
I'll be back later.

557
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,360
I'll be back later.

558
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,360
I'm always waiting for you to come back to me.

559
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,360
I'll be back.

560
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,360
I'll be back.

561
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,360
Well, Wei,

562
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,360
I didn't drive yesterday.

563
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,360
Can you take me to school?

564
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,360
Bye, Mom.

565
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,360
I'm going to bed.

566
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,360
Ye Fei Fei!

567
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,360
Ye Fei Fei!

568
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,360
Why did you drive our car?

569
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,360
I'll give it back to you if you want it.

570
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,360
If you can't get it, then you're mine!

571
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,360
Stop driving!

572
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,360
Ye Fei Fei!

573
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,360
Give me the car!

574
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,360
Stop!

575
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,360
Stop driving!

576
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,360
Hurry up!

577
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,360
I said, stop driving!

578
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,360
Hurry up!

579
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,360
Are you okay?

580
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,360
Why did you steal my car?

581
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,360
What?

582
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,360
You don't want to?

583
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,360
So, you're not angry

584
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,360
because you stole it?

585
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,360
It's mine!

586
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,360
Yes, it's yours.

587
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,360
Then tell Wan Jia that it's yours.

588
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,360
Okay, don't be sad.

589
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,360
You're so stupid.

590
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,360
Fight for what you like.

591
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,360
Don't keep everything in your heart.

592
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,360
You'll get sick.

593
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,360
What happened?

594
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,360
I'm fine.

595
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,640
Where are you going?

596
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,040
To Ding Ying's place?

597
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,520
To school.

598
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,040
Why do you have to go to school?

599
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,200
Han Ding Ying is at home, not school.

600
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,600
Fei Fei.

601
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,680
I have a thesis to write.

602
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,600
I won't talk nonsense.

603
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,760
And...

604
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,120
There is one thing you got wrong.

605
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,440
This car...

606
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,160
This car...

607
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,880
is different from Ding Ying's.

608
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,440
I bought it from the store.

609
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,680
It was mine from the beginning.

610
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,760
But Ding Ying's is not.

611
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,160
The person he loved was Wan Jia.

612
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,840
Not me.

613
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,000
What era is this?

614
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,960
Who cares about who he is?

615
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,200
If you like him, you should fight for him.

616
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,840
And I asked Bei Bao.

617
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,520
Wan Jia gave up on Han Ding Ying.

618
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,000
Jia Jia and I are best friends.

619
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,680
I won't hurt her for any reason.

620
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,320
Among us three,

621
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,760
whoever leaves,

622
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,280
whoever hurts first,

623
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,840
friendship is always the most precious thing.

624
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,760
I won't hurt Jia Jia and me

625
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,320
for stealing what I want.

626
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,960
Excuse me.

627
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,800
You love him, he doesn't love you.

628
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,360
You want him to feel bad.

629
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,480
You don't understand.

630
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,920
Yes.

631
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,480
I don't want to understand.

632
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,160
Your self-pitying thinking.

633
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,880
Let's go. Get in the car.

634
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,960
I'll take you back to school.

635
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,280
I really don't understand

636
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,160
why I have a fool like you.

637
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,200
Hold on tight.

638
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,040
Director, can you think of a way

639
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,360
to send Hua Youxi abroad as a exchange student?

640
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,440
I don't know.

641
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,400
Hua Youxi is not good enough.

642
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,080
She usually gets half of the grades.

643
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,440
Can she get a degree?

644
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,040
Director, I'm being straightforward.

645
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,080
Why are you suddenly concerned about Hua Youxi?

646
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,840
She's been hanging around Amber lately.

647
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,360
I want to think of a way

648
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,880
to stop her from showing up in front of my daughter.

649
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,200
That's a headache.

650
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,880
I don't know what to do.

651
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,360
I don't know what to do.

652
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,320
That's a headache.

653
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,360
Hua Youxi is not good enough to get a degree.

654
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,360
Let's see if she has any other strengths.

655
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,560
Then we'll send her abroad in this name.

656
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,960
Lan, what do you think we should do?

657
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,720
You've already found a director.

658
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,000
And she promised you to give her some time to think.

659
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,640
I think there's still a chance.

660
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,520
Youxi is a bad luck.

661
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,520
If there's no chance,

662
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,400
she'll have a hard time.

663
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,320
It's not that serious.

664
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,480
It's normal for a 20-year-old man to pursue a girl.

665
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,000
He'll be able to get a job as soon as he graduates.

666
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,720
Really?

667
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,440
Yes.

668
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,640
Lan, can you do me a favour?

669
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,640
I can.

670
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,640
I'll help you if I can.

671
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,520
Can you recommend a way to exchange students for Youxi

672
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,160
and send her abroad?

673
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,880
It's unlikely.

674
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,880
Because of her performance and grades,

675
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,400
she'll be lucky to graduate.

676
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,040
It's a good thing.

677
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,400
It's a good idea to send her abroad.

678
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,320
She'll get to read more books.

679
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,920
It's better than staying with you.

680
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,400
Yes, you're right.

681
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,880
Look, you've found a way for me.

682
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,520
But there's still a problem.

683
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,800
It's expensive to study abroad.

684
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,200
I don't know if you can afford it.

685
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,960
I can't transfer the shares to the bar.

686
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,480
It's about money.

687
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,480
Youxi

688
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,360
Director.

689
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Sit down.

690
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,000
No, no.

691
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,400
I'll stand.

692
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,400
Do you know why I called you here?

693
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,560
Director, can you not fire me?

694
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,160
Your daughter and I are innocent.

695
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,440
And if I'm fired,

696
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,360
my mother will be very sad.

697
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,040
My daughter is back home.

698
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,200
She has delusional delusions.

699
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,720
You can put a stop to her.

700
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,120
Really?

701
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,080
Great. Thank you, director.

702
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,240
You don't have to thank me.

703
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,320
You can thank your mother.

704
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,360
My mother?

705
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,360
Your mother came to school a few days ago.

706
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,440
She pleaded for you.

707
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,520
She was worried about your future.

708
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,760
She said it wasn't your fault.

709
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,240
It was her mother's fault.

710
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,840
She didn't give you a good family.

711
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,920
She even accepted the punishment for you.

712
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,200
She even proposed to be a volunteer at school.

713
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,480
Your mother left you alone.

714
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,480
It's not easy for you and your brother to grow up.

715
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,040
You must be sensible.

716
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,000
You must repay your mother.

717
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,440
You must become a man who is strong and strong.

718
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,800
Do you understand?

719
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Yes.

720
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Do you really want to sell this ring?

721
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,600
I need money.

722
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I want to send Youxi abroad to study.

723
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,200
I understand.

724
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,200
It's great to be a mother.

725
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,200
But Meng, I have to remind you.

726
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,200
This is very precious.

727
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,800
Once you sell it, you may never get it back.

728
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,880
You're so generous.

729
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,400
I'll do anything for my son.

730
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:07,400
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

731
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
I'm so tired.

732
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,200
I'm so tired.

733
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,280
It's so beautiful.

734
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Amber, you deserve it.

735
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,280
You look like a star.

736
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,280
Really? You're good.

737
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,080
You're so good at it.

738
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,160
Let me see.

739
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,680
You look like a professional photographer.

740
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,760
Look.

741
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,440
You look exactly like a professional photographer.

742
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,920
Of course I'm a professional.

743
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I used to take photos of stars.

744
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,600
Stars?

745
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,080
I used to be the latest.

746
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,960
You used to be the latest?

747
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,040
Yes.

748
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,120
Which star do you like?

749
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,200
I like...

750
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,800
Luo Yi.

751
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,280
I'm not practicing.

752
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,760
I'll go get changed.

753
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,840
I'm sweating too.

754
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,920
I'll go take a shower.

755
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,560
I'll go too.

756
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,200
You're so stubborn.

757
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,880
You shouldn't mention it.

758
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,760
Wait for me.

759
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,960
I did it on purpose.

760
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,960
Feifei said she likes Luo Yi.

761
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,160
Don't you hate her?

762
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,720
I've never hated Luo Yi.

763
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,720
Of course not.

764
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,800
How can I hate you?

765
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,480
What are you talking about?

766
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,040
Nothing.

767
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,120
We're just talking about our past.

768
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,680
Let's go take a shower.

769
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,760
Feifei, help me open the bag.

770
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,840
Let's go.

771
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,720
A small phone.

772
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,880
Are you lonely?

773
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,720
Let's play some games.

774
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,720
What are you doing?

775
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,800
Nothing.

776
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,880
I'm helping them.

777
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,600
I need to go to the bathroom.

778
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,680
You can help them.

779
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,960
One, two, three.

780
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,040
Brother Qing.

781
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,600
Why are you here?

782
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,680
We're playing the lala team at school.

783
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,760
We're here to help you.

784
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,840
We're here to help you.

785
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,800
We're playing the lala team at school.

786
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,880
We're tired.

787
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,960
We want to drink something.

788
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,920
Are you not welcome?

789
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Of course I am.

790
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,080
Come inside.

791
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,080
I'll go get something for you.

792
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,160
Let me help you.

793
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,640
You go.

794
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,200
Okay, I'll help you.

795
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,560
You two dance.

796
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,440
Hello.
