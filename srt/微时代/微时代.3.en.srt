1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

4
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You

5
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You

6
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Let's go eat

7
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Okay

8
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Thank you for coming

9
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Brother Li

10
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm off work

11
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm going home

12
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Okay, take care

13
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Bye

14
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Ding Yi

15
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Send the flowers to Wan Niang's house tomorrow

16
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I want to give her a surprise

17
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I hope she can see the flowers and send them to me

18
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Thank you

19
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The story is simple

20
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
He fell in love with a man

21
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He likes her

22
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
On the other side of the sea

23
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So love is simple

24
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Not simple, very ordinary

25
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Will be cold, will be simple

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But love is simple

27
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The story is simple

28
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Not simple

29
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He fell in love with a man

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
He likes her

31
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
On the other side of the sea

32
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
After a year

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Even the yearning is cut off

34
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Close your eyes and open your eyes

35
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The words change

36
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Time is like a blue eye

37
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The story is simple

38
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
He thought he could see

39
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He is a fool in the story

40
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Jing Jing

41
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Drink some

42
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Drink some

43
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Wait a minute

44
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Wait a minute

45
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Don't think about it

46
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
He has a master

47
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Who?

48
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Look, look, look

49
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Wan Jiang

50
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You don't know

51
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Why are you here?

52
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Miss you

53
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Come and see you

54
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But I have two classes left

55
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I have to go to a meeting

56
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I will pick you up at the meeting

57
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Not much time

58
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Do you have anything to say to me?

59
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I received the flowers you gave me

60
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Do you like it?

61
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Or do you like my sudden appearance?

62
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I guess you both like it

63
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm leaving

64
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm leaving

65
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So romantic

66
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
If you are a co-pilot, you should be five years old

67
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

68
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Go

69
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Have a good marriage

70
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I actually saw the Indian and the Chinese playing hand in hand

71
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I thought Amber was a great actress

72
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I didn't expect there would be a god show

73
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
No wonder Hua Youxi dares to sell her love flower for money

74
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Hua Youxi, share the gossip with me, you will die

75
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I won't die, but it's not good

76
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Tell me

77
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I don't want to spend money

78
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Then we can share it in private after graduation

79
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's still a few months

80
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
No, no, no, listen to me

81
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
If I really drink too much

82
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I don't know if I have that

83
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What? Really?

84
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Of course I know I'm handsome

85
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I know you have a crush on me

86
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But you can't lie to me

87
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's not right

88
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You said I lied to you

89
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You mean you didn't remember what happened that night, right?

90
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
That's right

91
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Great

92
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't remember that either

93
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm afraid this will be a big crime

94
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But I tell you Hua Youxi

95
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You still owe me in this life

96
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You are too scary to a young man in this life

97
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Don't talk nonsense in this life

98
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Okay, I'll tell you

99
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Okay, I've decided

100
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I...

101
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What have you decided?

102
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What's good?

103
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You want to destroy the evidence?

104
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I tell you, this child must be born

105
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What are you doing?

106
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm not 22 years old and I haven't graduated yet

107
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yes, Mengjie, I haven't graduated either

108
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
My money is unlimited

109
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I tell you, 50,000 yuan is not enough to buy me

110
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Shut up

111
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You will graduate in a few months

112
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
After graduation, get married immediately

113
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The child is like a pet

114
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Why is there no man in this world?

115
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I will take care of you

116
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Don't go out and make trouble for me

117
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What should I do?

118
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Oh my god

119
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Is the Japanese food delicious?

120
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yes, especially the grilled beef

121
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I've never eaten such delicious beef

122
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You really know how to eat

123
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The most famous food in your family is the grilled beef

124
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
If you want to eat it, just tell me

125
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'll let the boss buy it at any time

126
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Don't bother me

127
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I don't care

128
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's not a bother, it's a request

129
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I must let you eat the best and freshest food

130
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What else do you want to eat?

131
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Dessert?

132
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Do you want to turn me into a pig?

133
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I've eaten too much recently

134
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
No, I have to lose weight

135
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Lose weight?

136
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Why does everyone have to lose weight?

137
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Are you sure we like lean meat?

138
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Let's go, what else do you want to eat?

139
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I can stay with you for an hour

140
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You still have something to do?

141
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I have a meeting

142
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's upstairs

143
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'll go up after I finish you

144
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Since your time is so precious

145
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Let's not waste our time on food

146
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Can you give me a gift?

147
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Okay, who's gift is it?

148
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's Mr. Kang's birthday

149
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Kang Weiwei?

150
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Give me some advice

151
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
From a boy's point of view

152
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What kind of gift do you like?

153
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You treat him like a boy?

154
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Not me, but everyone

155
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
How about a wallet?

156
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Or a leather bag?

157
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
He and you...

158
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You two are not...

159
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Mr. Kang often says he has two wives

160
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
One is his motorcycle

161
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And the other is me

162
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
We grew up together

163
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
He likes to cook

164
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And he likes to take care of me

165
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
We are good friends

166
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Who don't talk much

167
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
We are so-called best friends

168
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Does he have a crush on someone?

169
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I don't think so

170
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I think he and Han Dingyi are a good match

171
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You think so?

172
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I think they are a good match

173
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I asked him before

174
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What kind of boy he likes

175
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
He always said he didn't know

176
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
He didn't like someone

177
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
He didn't know what it feels like to like someone

178
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's weird

179
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Is Han Dingyi chasing him?

180
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't know

181
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Han Dingyi, come on

182
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Come on

183
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Does Han Dingyi like you?

184
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Before I got together with you

185
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Was he chasing you?

186
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
No

187
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
He just treats me like a sister

188
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I don't know which one you would choose

189
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
A low-key practical

190
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
A noble and luxurious

191
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
If the prices are the same

192
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Which one would you choose?

193
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I said wallet

194
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I would choose

195
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The one you chose

196
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I would give you water every day

197
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You would grow up soon

198
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What's the use of growing up?

199
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You won't bloom even if you grow up

200
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Who said I wouldn't bloom?

201
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You will not bloom

202
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I will not bloom

203
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I will not bloom

204
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I will not bloom

205
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Who said I wouldn't bloom?

206
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Why don't you say anything?

207
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Why are you so quiet?

208
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm not being quiet

209
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You are too immersed in yourself

210
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I thought you were going to

211
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
become a Buddha

212
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You said you would bloom if you grow up?

213
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yes

214
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But

215
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You don't seem to know how to dress

216
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:49,140
But you can just wear a

217
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You are wrong

218
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yes

219
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
This cactus is from someone else

220
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Who?

221
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Han Dingyi

222
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yes

223
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
He sent a new batch of goods to the flower shop

224
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And gave it to me

225
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You two have a problem

226
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Don't say that

227
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Everyone has a problem

228
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
How can you tell us?

229
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I saw you this time

230
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I saw him the other day

231
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I knew you two had a problem

232
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Otherwise, why did he give you flowers for nothing?

233
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
First, cactus is not a flower

234
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Second, how can it be for nothing?

235
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
How can it be for nothing?

236
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Why is it for nothing?

237
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You forgot it when I guessed

238
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
But you really forgot this time

239
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
My heart is beating fast

240
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
That's enough

241
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I was just kidding

242
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You are so petty

243
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You are the first girlfriend on your birthday

244
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
How could you forget me?

245
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I forgot

246
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Open it and see if you like it

247
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Someone sent me a birthday gift

248
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
with a pot of cactus

249
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
This is for you

250
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I like it

251
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You

252
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Just kidding

253
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
As long as you like it

254
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm going to take a shower

255
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Remember to eat at home tomorrow

256
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'll send you home for dinner

257
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Of course

258
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Why hasn't he come yet?

259
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Why don't you call him?

260
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Hello, brother

261
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Where are you?

262
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm on the set now

263
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I have two pages left

264
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
How long do you have left?

265
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
About three hours

266
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Don't wait for me

267
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You eat first

268
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Hello, brother

269
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Remember to eat

270
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Don't worry

271
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I had dinner on the set

272
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You eat first

273
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm not talking to you

274
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm shooting now

275
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Bye

276
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
How?

277
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
He said we should eat first

278
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
He has three more hours to finish

279
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Every year when my brother is not around

280
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I spend my birthday alone

281
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
He finally came back this year

282
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm alone on my birthday

283
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
What's the difference between being around and not around?

284
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
When your brother was not around

285
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
we were still together

286
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You were happy, weren't you?

287
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'll call someone else

288
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Okay, I'll call someone else

289
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
No one answered

290
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What about you?

291
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
No one answered

292
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
We're here

293
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Come on

294
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Meng, you're here

295
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Mom

296
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Great

297
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I knew you made the dishes

298
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And you didn't move

299
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
We can eat together

300
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Mr. Keng

301
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
The chef in our bar is off work

302
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
We'll borrow all these dishes

303
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Come on

304
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Come on

305
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Come on

306
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Let's go

307
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Take them all

308
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Thank you

309
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Take them all

310
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Thank you

311
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Take them all

312
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Thank you

313
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Thank you

314
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'll get you two bowls of noodles

315
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And the vegetables

316
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's your birthday

317
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Why are you eating so sour?

318
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Let's go out

319
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'm not going

320
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm not in the mood

321
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You can't eat this

322
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Let's go

323
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
We'll take you to eat something good

324
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It's your birthday

325
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Let's go

326
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Let's go

327
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Mr. Keng

328
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
We've been away for so long

329
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The restaurant is closed

330
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What should we do?

331
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Forget it

332
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm not hungry anyway

333
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Let's go back

334
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
We're at the flower shop

335
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Wait for me

336
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I have something to leave

337
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Wait for me

338
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Hurry up

339
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Okay

340
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Wait for me

341
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Wait for me

342
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Wait for me

343
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Xingyi

344
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Motie

345
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Demi

346
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Happy birthday

347
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Look

348
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Happy birthday to you

349
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Happy birthday to you

350
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Happy birthday to me

351
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Happy birthday to you

352
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Happy birthday

353
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You are getting more and more handsome

354
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You knew it

355
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You lied to me with them

356
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
How can I lie?

357
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's a kind lie

358
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
A kind lie doesn't count

359
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
See, I told you not to be a spy

360
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
She is starting to doubt my character

361
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's your memory problem

362
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Okay, it's okay

363
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Sister

364
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Brother

365
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Happy birthday

366
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Why are you so good at acting?

367
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I thought you were really not coming

368
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You forgot that I am the director

369
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
If I can't fool you, I won't do it

370
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So, this show is for you and me

371
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I am not that careful

372
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
The planner is her

373
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Why did you do this?

374
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Because I think this is a surprise for you

375
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
What surprise?

376
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It's not a surprise

377
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Okay, okay, stop it

378
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's my turn

379
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Come on, Weiwei, happy birthday

380
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I hope we can have a long life

381
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Thank you, give me a hug

382
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Mr. Kang

383
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I didn't prepare any gift for you today

384
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I will give you a gold-plated doll

385
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You are so lucky

386
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Weiwei, this is from India

387
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
He is going to have a meeting today

388
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
He asked me to give you a kiss

389
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Happy birthday

390
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Give me a kiss

391
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
He said that just now

392
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Now I said that

393
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Happy birthday, I love you forever, baby

394
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Thank you

395
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Happy birthday

396
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Who said that I won't come?

397
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It's the prince

398
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
The prince is here

399
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
The prince is here

400
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
You are so handsome

401
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I have been with the prince since I was a child

402
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
How can I not come to see you?

403
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I was all because of you when I was away

404
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You should be careful

405
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
What?

406
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Be careful that your baby is stolen by me

407
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm afraid of you

408
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Come here, we will compete fairly

409
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Money

410
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm scared

411
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Meng

412
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
These are all from my family

413
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Yes

414
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I also told a lie to make you feel happy

415
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Thank you, Meng

416
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Let's eat, I'm starving

417
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Wait, there is one last gift

418
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Xiao Jiu

419
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Bye

420
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Thank you, Xiao Jiu

421
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Do you know that Xiao Jiu prepared this?

422
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It's better than the lunch at the hotel

423
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Great

424
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Cheers

425
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I want to say that I am really really really happy today

426
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
We should drink to celebrate

427
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Let's drink to celebrate our birthday

428
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Let's drink to celebrate

429
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Cheers

430
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
How can we let Wei Wei drink alone?

431
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Let's drink together

432
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Cheers

433
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
What should we do?

434
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Come on, let's drink together

435
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Cheers

436
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Don't be bored

437
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Come on, my dear classmate

438
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
My best friend

439
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And the most handsome prince of our school

440
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Let's drink

441
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Of course

442
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Yes, I have a personality

443
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Amber and my brother

444
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Brother, you really touched me today

445
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Although I'm not your director

446
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
But a huge surprise

447
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Amber, thank you for your birthday gift

448
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Come on, cheers

449
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Cheers

450
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Happy birthday

451
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Thank you, brother

452
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
You just picked me up

453
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Cheers

454
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Thank you, really

455
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Today is a big surprise

456
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Cheers

457
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Cheers

458
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Xiao Jiu, your cooking is so good

459
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I'll let you be my teacher

460
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Okay

461
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Wish us a long life

462
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Happy birthday

463
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Thank you

464
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Let's drink

465
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Are you all from our school?

466
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Yes

467
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
What?

468
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Your students are all excellent

469
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Very good, right?

470
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Are we all excellent?

471
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Xiao Jiu, you want to be our teacher, right?

472
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
No

473
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
How can I be your teacher?

474
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm just an ordinary student

475
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Don't say that

476
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
If we have a cooking major

477
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
You must be the first one to be my teacher

478
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And the first one to graduate

479
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
No

480
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Can you take me to your school

481
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
A little earlier?

482
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Yes, right now

483
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Okay, let's go now

484
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
No, not today

485
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Sit down

486
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Listen to me

487
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
What?

488
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I like someone

489
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Who?

490
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Are you drunk?

491
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
No

492
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
She is a friend of mine

493
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
She came to Shanghai

494
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
If I'm not wrong

495
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
She should be in the same school as you

496
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Which class?

497
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I don't know

498
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Xiao Jiu

499
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
If you believe me

500
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I can help you check it out

501
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
But if you tell me her name

502
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
What will you call her?

503
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
It's a secret between us

504
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Secret

505
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Her name is Ding Shaorou

506
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I don't know

507
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Ding

508
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Ding

509
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Ding

510
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Shaorou

511
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Wait

512
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Don't forget

513
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I'm used to it

514
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
How can I forget

515
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Make a wish

516
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Yes, make a wish

517
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Then we will be

518
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Friends for ten lifetimes

519
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Come on

520
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
What's wrong?

521
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Come on

522
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Why do you want to be my girlfriend?

523
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Come on

524
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Come on

525
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Come on

526
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Come on

527
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Qi

528
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I want to cook for Xiao Jiu

529
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Because I want her to taste my cooking

530
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Good cook

531
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Do you need help?

532
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Yes, you all leave

533
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Ok, we will go together

534
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Go, go

535
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Weiwei

536
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Go, go, go

537
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Thank you, Weiwei

538
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Thank you, Weiwei

539
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Thank you, Weiwei

540
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Thank you, Weiwei

541
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Thank you, Weiwei

542
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Thank you, Weiwei

543
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Thank you, Weiwei

544
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Thank you, Weiwei

545
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Thank you, Weiwei

546
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Thank you, Weiwei

547
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Thank you, Weiwei

548
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Thank you, Weiwei

549
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Thank you, Weiwei

550
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Thank you, Weiwei

551
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Thank you, Weiwei

552
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,020
She is diversified

553
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,000
She is discipline

554
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
She is common sense

555
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:15,380
She is

556
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Here.

557
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,320
Eat this.

558
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,720
Okay, okay. I'll eat this.

559
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Drink.

560
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,040
Is it good?

561
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,160
It's good.

562
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,000
If you like it,

563
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,200
I'll cook it for you every morning

564
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,800
as long as you live in Shanghai.

565
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,280
I'm sorry.

566
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,160
It's good.

567
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,000
Why are you looking at me?

568
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Eat. Hurry up.

569
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,400
I'm so happy today.

570
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,920
I'm having breakfast with the three men

571
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,920
I love the most in my life.

572
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,320
I'm so happy.

573
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,400
Let's have a bottle of red wine.

574
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,400
No.

575
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,600
You're drinking so early.

576
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,600
No.

577
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,920
Let's go.

578
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,360
Xiao Jiu,

579
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,640
you're the only one who can help.

580
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,640
Okay.

581
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,400
He asked him to keep the penalty.

582
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,400
Keep it.

583
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,400
It's for his own good.

584
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
Drink.

585
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,800
I'll listen to you.

586
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,200
I won't drink.

587
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,200
Good boy.

588
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,600
Here.

589
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,600
Eat more.

590
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,800
Here, Xiao Jiu.

591
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,200
Hurry up.

592
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,400
Xiao Jiu.

593
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,800
Mom wants you to eat breakfast

594
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,200
in your life.

595
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
What's wrong?

596
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,600
I'm full.

597
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,600
I'm full. I'll eat.

598
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,400
You're not eating?

599
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,600
Eat.

600
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,000
Wash the kitchen dishes.

601
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,400
Okay.

602
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,600
Did you call Mei Bao?

603
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I didn't call her.

604
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Why didn't she answer?

605
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,800
Why didn't she answer?

606
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,000
She could answer all kinds of questions.

607
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,400
Like, I miss you, I love you.

608
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,000
She usually answers a lot of questions.

609
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,400
Remember to call her sooner or later.

610
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,400
Mom,

611
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,400
why did you like Mei Bao so much?

612
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,400
You'll know in a few months.

613
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
Xiao Meng.

614
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,400
Where do you want to go?

615
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,400
I have to go to the school on a Sunday.

616
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,800
I asked Wei Wei to go to the cooking school.

617
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,800
I want to see it.

618
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,000
You don't even take a day off on Sundays?

619
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,800
Do you like Mei Bao?

620
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,600
You're so mean.

621
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,400
What?

622
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,600
Morning.

623
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,600
Morning, Uncle.

624
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,400
Morning.

625
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,600
Did you have breakfast?

626
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,800
Yes.

627
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,000
I came to thank you

628
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,600
for the delicious breakfast.

629
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,600
What breakfast?

630
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,600
Don't pretend.

631
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,600
I know my sister too well.

632
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,600
She can do nothing but music and music.

633
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,600
And the taste of the dragon bun

634
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,600
was definitely not made by her.

635
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,600
So I should believe you.

636
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,600
Meng told me to keep it from you.

637
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,600
Don't worry.

638
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,600
I won't tell her.

639
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,600
But you've worked hard.

640
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,600
You've been working as a slave every morning.

641
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,600
If you feel embarrassed,

642
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,600
you can teach me your cooking skills.

643
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,600
Sure.

644
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,600
Just treat it as a gift from me

645
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,600
when you cut vegetables in the morning.

646
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,600
Let's go.

647
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,600
Okay.

648
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,600
Xiao Jiao.

649
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,600
What's the best way to find your girlfriend?

650
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,600
As long as I post an article online

651
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,600
and Ding Xiao Zhou recognizes you,

652
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,600
my mom will definitely take revenge on me.

653
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,600
This kind of thing makes my dad

654
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,600
focus on the right and left.

655
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,600
That's the best way.

656
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,600
Xiao Jiao, welcome.

657
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,600
This is where you learn cooking?

658
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,600
Yes.

659
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,600
I'm busy with school.

660
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,600
But I'll come here every week

661
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,600
to learn cooking.

662
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,600
My teachers like me very much.

663
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,600
So I can borrow it for free.

664
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,600
Why do you like cooking so much?

665
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,600
Because I like to see people

666
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,600
having a happy face when they eat.

667
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,600
Not bad.

668
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,600
Xiao Jiao,

669
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
why don't you teach me

670
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,600
how to cook your special dish?

671
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,600
I'm not cooking a dish.

672
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,600
I'm cooking a pastry.

673
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,600
What's a pastry?

674
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,600
A pastry is a sweetened pastry.

675
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,600
When it's baked,

676
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,600
it'll become soft and fluffy.

677
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,600
It won't be too sweet when you eat it.

678
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,600
It's like a lover's dish.

679
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,600
Xiao Jiao.

680
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,600
Xiao Jiao.

681
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,600
Are you thinking about that girl?

682
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,600
How far have you two developed?

683
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,600
Nothing much.

684
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,600
We've never started.

685
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,600
I'm not sure.

686
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,600
We've never started.

687
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,600
Here.

688
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,600
The dishes.

689
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,600
Get some flour and remember to come back.

690
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,600
Okay.

691
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,600
The dough.

692
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,600
The dough.

693
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,600
The dough.

694
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,600
The dough.

695
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,600
The dough.

696
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,600
The dough.

697
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,600
The dough.

698
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,600
The dough.

699
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,600
The dough.

700
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,600
The dough.

701
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,600
The dough.

702
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,600
The dough.

703
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,600
The dough.

704
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,600
The dough.

705
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,600
The dough.

706
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,600
The dough.

707
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,600
The dough.

708
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,600
The dough.

709
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,600
The dough.

710
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
The dough.

711
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,600
The dough.

712
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,600
The dough.

713
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,600
The dough.

714
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,600
The dough.

715
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,600
The dough.

716
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,600
The dough.

717
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,600
The dough.

718
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,600
The dough.

719
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,600
The dough.

720
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,600
The dough.

721
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,600
The dough.

722
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,600
The dough.

723
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,600
The dough.

724
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,600
The dough.

725
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
The dough.

726
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,600
The dough.

727
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,600
The dough.

728
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,600
The dough.

729
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
The dough.

730
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,600
The dough.

731
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,600

732
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,600
The dough.

733
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,600
The dough.

734
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,600
The dough.

735
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,600
The dough.

736
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,600
The dough.

737
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,600
The dough.

738
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,600
The dough.

739
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,600
The dough.

740
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,600
The dough.

741
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,600
The dough.

742
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,600
The dough.

743
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,600
The dough.

744
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,600
The dough.

745
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,600
The dough.

746
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,600
The dough.

747
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,600
The dough.

748
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600
The dough.

749
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,600
Wow, it smells so good.

750
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,600
Xiao Zheng,

751
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,600
look at these two desserts.

752
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,600
They really make your heart flutter.

753
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,600
One is like you.

754
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,600
The other is like a piece of meat.

755
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,600
Do you think they look alike?

756
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,600
Do you want to try it?

757
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,600
Of course.

758
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,600
Let's take a picture of them first.

759
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,600
This is

760
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,600
a kiss for you.

761
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,600
Xiao Rou,

762
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,600
I'm going to try your first bite of love.

763
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,600
How is it?

764
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,600
It's so good.

765
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,600
Uncle,

766
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,600
can you tell me

767
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,600
what's the secret recipe?

768
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,600
There's no secret recipe.

769
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,600
Cooking is an important thing.

770
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,600
It's good for your health and mind.

771
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,600
Food represents a person's feelings.

772
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,600
If you break up,

773
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,600
whatever you eat, it's not good.

774
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,600
But if you miss her,

775
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,600
you'll feel good even if you're sick.

776
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,600
Right?

777
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,600
Uncle,

778
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,600
why don't we make more

779
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,600
and take them to school?

780
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,600
Maybe you can meet Ding Xiao Rou.

781
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,600
If that's the case,

782
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,600
you can feed her

783
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,600
the birthday gift you made for her.

784
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,600
Let's go.

785
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,600
Let's go.

786
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,600
Uncle,

787
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,600
this is our studio.

788
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,600
The students of Design and Engineering

789
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,600
come here to see the flowers every day.

790
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,600
There are too many things we care about.

791
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,600
I can't wait to see them all.

792
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:15,600
I'm waiting for you to be the best.

793
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,600
We have two options.

794
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,600
When you need me the most,

795
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,600
you can hold my hand.

796
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,600
One word

797
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,600
I don't need to say

798
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,600
You'll be

799
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,600
I don't need to say

800
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,600
You'll be

801
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,600
I don't need to say

802
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,600
You'll be

803
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,600
I don't need to say

804
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,600
You'll be

805
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,600
I don't need to say

806
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,600
You'll be

807
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,600
I don't need to say

808
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,600
You'll be

809
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:13,600
It's okay.

810
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:20,600
Are you sure?

811
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,600
Let's shout out loud

812
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,600
Let's keep our mouth shut

813
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:32,600
Let's stay on the streets of Suzui

814
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,600
We'll go to the end

815
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,600
We don't need any reason

816
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,600
There are too many things in your heart

817
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,600
That's what we can't handle

818
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,600
We'll go to the end

819
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,600
We don't need any reason

820
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,600
When we need each other the most

821
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,600
We can stand on our own feet

822
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:05,600
In our times

823
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,600
Together
