1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,420
I was thinking about what to do...

2
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,860
Normally I'm most attached to my life.

3
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,800
But I don't want to make my life more stressful.

4
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,780
Don't you want to go to the capital?

5
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,580
해요

6
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,580
I'm not done yet.

7
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,580
Yes, yes.

8
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:07,580
But I think we should stop those unnecessary messages.

9
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,580
This is the most painful thing for me now.

10
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:17,580
Yu Yi, maybe one of you brothers will be very happy.

11
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,580
I'll take responsibility for this.

12
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,580
You're not the kind of person to be nice.

13
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,580
You're not fair to you.

14
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,580
I think you should call your brother out and take responsibility.

15
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,580
Contact Youxi and ask her to come here.

16
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,580
It's okay. It will be okay.

17
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,580
Trust me.

18
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,580
What's wrong?

19
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,580
Your phone has a message.

20
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,580
Mr. Shi Liang is looking for me.

21
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,580
Let's go.

22
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,580
Okay.

23
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,580
Xiao Qiao, Hua Youxi is leaving.

24
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,580
Playing games like women.

25
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,580
Playing games like women.

26
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,580
Playing games like women.

27
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,580
Playing games like women.

28
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,580
Playing games like women.

29
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,580
Playing games like women.

30
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,580
Hua Youxi playing games.

31
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,580
Playing games like women.

32
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,580
Playing games like women.

33
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,580
Playing games like women.

34
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,580
Playing games like women.

35
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,400
Playing parallel games like women.

36
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,580
Playing games like women.

37
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,580
The The rope line is wrong.

38
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,580
I can help you to get out of there too.

39
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,580
What's wrong with you?

40
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:50,580
It's wrong but it is because you are losing contact with my characters.

41
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,580
Play games! Play games!

42
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,580
Play games! Play games!

43
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,580
Play games! Play games!

44
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,580
Mr. Yang.

45
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,580
I think before we start the discussion,

46
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,580
do you have something to say to Miss.

47
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,580
Eddie?

48
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,580
With sincerity.

49
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,580
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,580
I think the person you're most sorry for is not me.

51
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,580
Brother.

52
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,580
I'm sorry for making you and mom worried.

53
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,580
It's okay.

54
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,580
There's always a way to reduce the loss.

55
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,580
I've thought about it.

56
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,580
I'm a bad person anyway.

57
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,580
Do you think Hua Youxi is very good?

58
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,580
Hua Youxi!

59
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,580
What the hell are you playing?

60
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,580
I'm not as good as you.

61
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,580
Do you want to know why?

62
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,580
Because I never got pregnant.

63
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,580
Are you stupid?

64
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,580
Are you scared?

65
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,580
All your pocket money is with me.

66
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,580
Even your eyes.

67
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,580
You can only see my eyebrows.

68
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,580
Are you a man?

69
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,580
Hua Youxi!

70
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,580
I've been playing with you from the beginning to the end.

71
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,580
Hua Youxi, I'm playing with you!

72
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,580
I'm going to turn you into a piece of shit.

73
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,580
I'm going to turn you into a piece of shit.

74
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,580
Today, all the people who were fooled by Hua Youxi,

75
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,580
I declare.

76
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,580
I'll help you double your pay.

77
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,580
I'm not sure if I can be the second.

78
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,580
Who dares to be the first?

79
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,580
Hua Youxi!

80
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,580
Let's go.

81
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,580
Are you okay?

82
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,580
I'm fine.

83
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,580
I'm fine.

84
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,580
I'm fine.

85
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,580
I'm fine.

86
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,580
Are you okay?

87
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,580
I'm fine.

88
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,580
You're so stupid.

89
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,580
Let's go.

90
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,580
How will you face the game in the future?

91
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,580
I have authority to decide the fate of my first love.

92
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,500
it's enough

93
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,020
Keep going!

94
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,780
explanation

95
00:08:49,580 --> 00:09:01,580
The most beautiful treasure in life is the past.

96
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:09,580
Although the poor only have happiness,

97
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:19,580
the old clothes are still on my body.

98
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:27,580
The winter that is still hot and snowy

99
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:33,580
is singing three songs.

100
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:39,580
The summer night that is full of warmth

101
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:45,580
is floating in the wind.

102
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:52,580
Now we have changed,

103
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:58,580
we are busy with life.

104
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:05,580
But when you think of the past,

105
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:11,580
your eyes will shine.

106
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,580
Thank you, I don't hate games anymore.

107
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,580
Actually, a man who is emotional and willful,

108
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,580
and has poor management skills,

109
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,580
is not necessarily a bad person.

110
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,580
Otherwise, Mei Bao wouldn't treat him like this.

111
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,580
I really appreciate Mengjie.

112
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,580
Do you know why I will sing the songs she likes tonight?

113
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,580
Because she told me that

114
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,580
when she was young, she had expectations for love.

115
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,580
Although she was disappointed every time,

116
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:55,580
her heart was always full of tears,

117
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,580
and she was always fighting.

118
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,580
This is my mother.

119
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,580
She is a young girl who has not grown up.

120
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,580
Mengjie told me that

121
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,580
everyone makes mistakes,

122
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,580
but they have to be brave.

123
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,580
Even if it is a wrong beginning,

124
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,580
there will be a happy ending.

125
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:21,580
Sometimes the fate of two people is really a little bit worse.

126
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,580
But it is because of that little bit,

127
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,580
that there is a difference in nature.

128
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,580
I'm sorry.

129
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,580
Actually, I don't regret at all meeting you in Shanghai.

130
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,580
I don't regret either.

131
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,580
We used to know each other.

132
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,580
And because of my words,

133
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,580
you can become a revolution.

134
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,580
Monitor.

135
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,580
I have a request. Can you promise me?

136
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:03,580
Can I have a first love dream for you?

137
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,580
What is it like?

138
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,580
When you miss me, write to me.

139
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,580
Instead of texting and calling,

140
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,580
when we go out on a date,

141
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,580
hold each other's hands.

142
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,580
Even if you don't say a word, you can hear each other's heartbeat.

143
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,580
When you send me home,

144
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,580
give me a big hug or a kiss.

145
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,580
When I get old,

146
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,580
when I think of your eyes,

147
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,580
I will proudly say to myself,

148
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,580
I have a very happy first love.

149
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,580
Okay.

150
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,580
My new album is called Little Love.

151
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:20,580
This album is dedicated to the first love of youths in the world.

152
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:24,580
My first love is a young man who is a little girl.

153
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,580
I am a little girl.

154
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,580
I am a little girl.

155
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,580
I am a little girl.

156
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,580
I am a little girl.

157
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,580
I am a little girl.

158
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,580
My first love is a beautiful misunderstanding.

159
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:50,580
But the handsome monitor has always stayed in the heart of the spoiled girl.

160
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:56,580
Love has overcome all the noise.

161
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,580
Let the love of Jenny become the love of today.

162
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:04,580
Let me love again.

163
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,580
Even if he doesn't fall in love,

164
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,580
he can find his first love's dream.

165
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:14,580
It is the greatest happiness in my life.

166
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,580
Where isapped?

167
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,580
Where are you taking it, little, raccoon?

168
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,580
I am beginning to hate on you.

169
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:52,580
And you are not difficult.

170
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,580
Would youopa give me a kiss me?

171
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,580
What a видue!

172
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,580
Andrey,

173
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,580
Do you believe it?

174
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,580
Stop it.

175
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,580
If I were you, I would go to the treasure house and find her.

176
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:13,580
What she did for you is a man's pride, a woman's failure.

177
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,580
Hey, she lied to me.

178
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,580
I've been like a ghost for the last two months.

179
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,580
I haven't calmed down.

180
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,580
I'll make you feel bad.

181
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,580
Don't make a fuss.

182
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,580
Come to me.

183
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,580
Son, if you're not feeling well,

184
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,580
you can take my mother's medicine.

185
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,580
Enough, mom.

186
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,580
Stop it.

187
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,580
You've got it all wrong.

188
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,580
I'll erase it from my memory.

189
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,580
Women have a problem with love.

190
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,580
They have a problem with their brains.

191
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,580
Yes.

192
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,580
Some women are going through a lot with you.

193
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,580
They want to get back their first love.

194
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,580
What's wrong with you?

195
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,580
Are you in a bad mood?

196
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,580
No.

197
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,580
By the way,

198
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,580
how are you and Yingdong?

199
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,580
I'm fine.

200
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,580
Don't worry.

201
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,580
I'll talk to Yingdong later.

202
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,580
Let's see what he thinks.

203
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,580
At worst, I'll quit.

204
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,580
Don't worry.

205
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,580
I'm fine.

206
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,580
Mom,

207
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,580
can you give this to Xiao'ai for me?

208
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,580
I want to do something romantic every day.

209
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,580
This is romantic enough.

210
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,580
Mom will help you with the delivery.

211
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,580
I'm going to take a shower.

212
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,580
I'm going to work.

213
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,580
I'm going to work.

214
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,580
It seems that men have to suffer from setbacks at work.

215
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,580
That's why God made up for it in love.

216
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,580
Will you fall in love with a woman

217
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,580
for her first love?

218
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,580
Me?

219
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,580
How difficult it is for a man to fall in love with a beautiful woman.

220
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,580
I'm afraid that Yingdong is still a famous singer.

221
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,580
Why are you all looking at me?

222
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,580
I'm not that curious.

223
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,580
I'm afraid that Ding Yi

224
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:12,580
is afraid that he won't pursue other girls for Wanjia.

225
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,580
Isn't it good to change like this now?

226
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,580
And if Yingdong knows about this,

227
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,580
he may change his mind

228
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,580
and help our V-Live restaurant again.

229
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,580
So that everyone will be happy.

230
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,580
I'm happy for my brother.

231
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,580
What a good woman!

232
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,580
Good women are not fashionable at this time.

233
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,580
Good women are bullied by you boys.

234
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,580
Mom,

235
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,580
if you meet the person you loved,

236
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,580
will you adjust yourself

237
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,580
and fall in love with her again?

238
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,580
It depends on whether your mother is willing to do it.

239
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,580
Go.

240
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,580
Give me back the treasure.

241
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,580
Take it.

242
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,580
I haven't come to Li's house for two months.

243
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,580
So?

244
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,580
So?

245
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,580
Hua Yuxin, don't you remember what you did?

246
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,580
No, mom, listen to me.

247
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,580
I really drank too much last night.

248
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,580
I don't know if I have any...

249
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,580
What is that?

250
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,580
Really?

251
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,580
I don't need you to be responsible.

252
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,580
I'll take care of you from now on.

253
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,580
I'll take care of everything.

254
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,580
Take a dress when you go out.

255
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,580
So you won't catch a cold.

256
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,580
Put your hands here.

257
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,580
Okay?

258
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,580
You have to rub it and hold it.

259
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,580
Okay.

260
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,580
That's a man.

261
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,580
It's the first time you've held my hand so seriously.

262
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,580
It's great to have you.

263
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,580
What did you say?

264
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,580
My boyfriend didn't say anything.

265
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,580
I can't talk.

266
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,580
My friend Hua Yuxin is very unhappy today.

267
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,580
So let's go to the bar and have a good bath.

268
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,580
We'll have a good bath tomorrow morning.

269
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,580
It's a good man, right?

270
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,580
Hua Yuxin, play games.

271
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,580
Play games until you're tired.

272
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,580
Yuxin, come on!

273
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,580
Play games until you're tired.

274
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,580
Play games until you're tired.

275
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,580
I'm tired.

276
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,580
I've been playing with you from the beginning.

277
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,580
I'm playing with you, Hua Yuxin!

278
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,580
Hua Yuxin.

279
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,580
I've never thought I'd remember this feeling in my life.

280
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:45,580
I've never thought I'd remember this feeling in my life.

281
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:06,580
There are still many things I haven't told you.

282
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:11,580
Do you think Hua Yuxin will come?

283
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,580
What a good excuse, right?

284
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,580
She doesn't have to break up with me.

285
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,580
We can break up.

286
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,580
I'm sorry.

287
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,580
Daddy.

288
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,580
Why are you so angry?

289
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,580
Daddy, let's go to the movies together.

290
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,580
I haven't seen the movie with you for a long time.

291
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,580
Let's cultivate our artistic talent.

292
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,580
You want me to change my attitude towards movies?

293
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,580
I don't like your skills.

294
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,580
I won't agree to be a producer.

295
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,580
I won't agree to be a producer.

296
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,580
I won't agree to be a producer.

297
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,580
I won't agree to be a producer.

298
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,580
I won't agree to be a producer.

299
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,580
I'll make you breakfast.

300
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,580
Chenyin.

301
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,580
I'm coming.

302
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,580
You're always so cold-hearted.

303
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,580
Do you think the whole world is for your money?

304
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,580
Don't worry.

305
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,580
I'm not that kind of person.

306
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:56,580
When people fall in love, they become fools.

307
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,580
You have to believe your father.

308
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,580
You haven't been in love for a long time, right?

309
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,580
Do you remember me now?

310
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,580
Daddy.

311
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,580
The CEO of Chinese and American companies, Nisa.

312
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,580
The CEO of Chinese and American companies, Zheng Jing.

313
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,580
And the one I loved when I was ten years old.

314
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,580
Ma Yueming.

315
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,580
He's still texting you.

316
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,580
Why don't you talk to him?

317
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,580
Daddy.

318
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,580
I'll ask you to fall in love.

319
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,580
If you don't like mature women.

320
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,580
I can accept someone my age.

321
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,580
I'll be your matchmaker.

322
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,580
Don't be so dramatic.

323
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,580
Are you done?

324
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,580
For a Kang Zirui.

325
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,580
My daughter's quality and level.

326
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,580
Has already fallen to the bottom.

327
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,580
Victor.

328
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,580
Is Victor here?

329
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,580
Mr. Wu.

330
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,580
Didn't you tell me before.

331
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,580
That the lady was a producer.

332
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,580
It's too late.

333
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,580
What's the situation now?

334
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,580
You can't destroy my first love.

335
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,580
Daddy doesn't want you to fall in love.

336
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,580
But you can change your partner.

337
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,580
Break up with Kang Zirui.

338
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,580
Change another person.

339
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,580
Come back from the beginning.

340
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,580
With who?

341
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,580
Yingdong.

342
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,580
Didn't you like him before?

343
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,580
I've forgotten him.

344
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,580
You can forget Yingdong.

345
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,580
Then you can forget Kang Zirui.

346
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,580
Daddy.

347
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,580
Please respect my first love.

348
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,580
No one's first love can be broken.

349
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,580
No one's first love can be broken.

350
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,580
You.

351
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,580
You have the right to correct your first love.

352
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,580
Start over.

353
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,580
Even if I start over.

354
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,580
I will choose Kang Zirui.

355
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,580
And I believe.

356
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,580
Kang Zirui is reluctant to leave me.

357
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,580
I tell you.

358
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,580
Don't force me to work with outsiders.

359
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,580
To deal with you.

360
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,580
Once I block your economy.

361
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,580
You are nothing.

362
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,580
Who is better?

363
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,580
Your breakfast is so bad.

364
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,580
I can swallow it.

365
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,580
Why can't you hear what daddy says?

366
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,580
Get out of the way.

367
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,580
This kid.

368
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,580
Hello.

369
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,580
Hello.

370
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,580
Haven't you got up yet?

371
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,580
It's almost nine o'clock.

372
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,580
I came back at six o'clock in the morning.

373
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,580
What's wrong?

374
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,580
If you fall in love again.

375
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,580
Will you choose me?

376
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,580
What?

377
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,580
Who is the first person you fell in love with?

378
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,580
Why do you ask this?

379
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,580
I just want to know.

380
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,580
I know it's not me.

381
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,580
I know it's not me.

382
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,580
I don't remember.

383
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,580
But you are always my first choice.

384
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,580
Can you hear me, Kang Zirui?

385
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,580
We can't lose to daddy.

386
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,580
I'm sorry, something came up, I think.

387
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,580
I'm so sorry.

388
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,580
I wasn't mean before.

389
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,580
But what can you do in my current situation?

390
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,580
But my man brother i can listen to you.

391
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,580
And he is always my first choice.

392
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,580
But I do not understand that.

393
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,580
But I'm always your first choice.

394
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,580
Now i understand you.

395
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,580
I usually like this kind of compromise,

396
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,580
that they just want to met you.

397
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,580
But at the moment you are loving each other.

398
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,580
They usually love each other.

399
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,580
I'm not a friend of yours.

400
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,580
I don't want to be your enemy.

401
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,580
Why?

402
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,580
I'm not a friend of yours.

403
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:04,580
I know that you want to find a Ouyang Qiao.

404
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,580
But for me,

405
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:10,580
it's not easy to find another Amber.

406
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,580
I like smart and straightforward people.

407
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,580
Take this for me.

408
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,580
Don't worry.

409
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,580
I didn't put this on my mind.

410
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,580
Really?

411
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:22,580
You and Victor have proved your worth.

412
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:25,580
From now on, you can tell my father's opinion from his mouth.

413
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,580
And how he sees my emotional problems.

414
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,580
Amber, you're so generous.

415
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,580
You don't have to be so smart with me.

416
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,580
I will definitely make it up to you in the future.

417
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,580
Did anything happen today that has to do with me?

418
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,580
Yes.

419
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:42,580
Han Ding Yi has given the first love letter to the express delivery company.

420
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,580
He said he wanted to see me.

421
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,580
Is it possible?

422
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,580
Next.

423
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,580
I didn't get anything in return.

424
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,580
But Hua You Xi didn't get anything back.

425
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,580
So, Hua You Xi is smarter than Big Brother.

426
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,580
Who would want to get back the money?

427
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,580
Next.

428
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,580
And about the V-Log restaurant.

429
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,580
Han Ding Yi and Ying Dong are both stubborn.

430
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,580
They didn't find the way.

431
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,580
Han Ding Yi can't communicate with you.

432
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,580
Ying Dong can't communicate with me either.

433
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,580
I'm not a friend of yours.

434
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,580
Because you can communicate with me, Ying Dong can't communicate with me.

435
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,580
So, this game will be over sooner or later.

436
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,580
Next.

437
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,580
Eddie agreed to have a concert.

438
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,580
Hua You Xi is responsible for the publicity of this concert.

439
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,580
Hua You Xi is really lucky.

440
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,580
Yes.

441
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,580
I don't know what he has remembered in his last life.

442
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,580
Come on, let me help you.

443
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,580
Sit down.

444
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,580
I'll help you.

445
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,580
Come on.

446
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,580
It's too fast.

447
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,580
Come on, let me help you.

448
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,580
Okay.

449
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,580
Your father has a great idea today.

450
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,580
It's delicious.

451
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,580
Wei Wei, I've always loved to eat my food.

452
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,580
I made it with my heart.

453
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,580
That's right.

454
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:54,580
You can apply for a non-futuristic cultural heritage for every dish.

455
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,580
Then I'll eat first.

456
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,580
Jia Jia didn't come back today.

457
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,580
You should eat more for her.

458
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,580
Wei Wei.

459
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,580
Jia Jia and Ying Dong are fine, right?

460
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,580
Yes, they are.

461
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,580
Ying Dong even pushed her to the European Exhibition.

462
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,580
Really?

463
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,580
That's great.

464
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,580
You all have grown up.

465
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,580
You are flying further and further.

466
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,580
That's a good thing.

467
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,580
The younger people walk more.

468
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,580
The more you meet, the more you know.

469
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,580
The more friends you make, the more you know.

470
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,580
Don't worry.

471
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,580
Even if they all leave, I will stay here.

472
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,580
Because I have to eat the dishes that Wan Ba makes.

473
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,580
I'm afraid we don't have much of this opportunity.

474
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,580
The landlord here has to increase the rent.

475
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,580
And it's three times higher than before.

476
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,580
I called Jia Jia back this time.

477
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,580
I want to discuss with her about our future problems.

478
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,580
Now the restaurants are all on the path of the young people.

479
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,580
We don't know how to invest in this old book.

480
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,580
Thank you.

481
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,580
Xiao Ai, hello.

482
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,580
This is the first time I wrote to a girl in my life.

483
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,580
I grew up in front of the computer.

484
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,580
I'm too unwell.

485
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,580
Can we start dating?

486
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:47,580
I'm trying to find the impression of you in middle school.

487
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,580
I saw you eat soy milk and pancakes several times.

488
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:55,580
Can we start our date from breakfast?

489
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,580
I'm not sure.

490
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,580
I don't know.

491
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,580
I don't know.

492
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,580
Can we start our date from breakfast?

493
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,580
I'm not good at speaking.

494
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,580
I can't think of a blank paper between the paper and the brain.

495
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,580
I don't know what to write.

496
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,580
Let's meet and talk.

497
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,580
Waiting for your reply.

498
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,580
Monitor Han Dingyi.

499
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,580
Dear monitor Dingyi.

500
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:37,580
I imagined the feeling of receiving your letters in my dreams.

501
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,580
It's great.

502
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,580
As happy as I imagined.

503
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:47,580
I imagined how many times I had breakfast with you before going to school.

504
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:51,580
Or I went to the library with you after class.

505
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,580
You may say I'm stupid.

506
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,580
But can you take me as I loved you?

507
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,580
We went out together in school uniforms.

508
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:06,580
I want to find the feeling of being in the school.

509
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,580
That's the time I miss the most.

510
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,580
Love is invincible.

511
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,580
I want to buy a ticket.

512
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,580
Hello, 160 yuan.

513
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,580
Here you are.

514
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,580
Thank you.

515
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,580
Welcome again.

516
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,580
Dingyi.

517
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,580
This is the order of the big deal we discussed last month.

518
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,580
The harvest time is next quarter.

519
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,580
I want to confirm with you.

520
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,580
Should we cancel it with the other party?

521
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,580
Now I want to sell the fund.

522
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,580
Don't worry.

523
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,580
I won't give up until I'm satisfied.

524
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,580
I can't be like you.

525
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,580
I have everything here.

526
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,580
Dingyi, Xiaojian.

527
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,580
Mr. Sun.

528
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,580
What's the matter?

529
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,580
I have a good news and a bad news to tell you.

530
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,580
Which one do you want to hear?

531
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,580
Good news.

532
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,580
There are enough bad news.

533
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:09,580
The good news is that our vlog is saved.

534
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,580
Really?

535
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,580
What do you mean?

536
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,580
Mom and dad's rent is too high.

537
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,580
Mom and dad's rent is too high.

538
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,580
So they plan to rent out their restaurant.

539
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,580
The money will be used to invest in our vlog restaurant.

540
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,580
Really?

541
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,580
Really.

542
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,580
Weiwei, you're here.

543
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,580
I'm here to help.

544
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,580
Meng Zeyu is a good person.

545
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,580
He came in the afternoon.

546
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,580
Thank you.

547
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,580
You're welcome.

548
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:41,580
Love really makes people do a lot of incredible things.

549
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,580
We're not in love.

550
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,580
Who told you to come?

551
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,580
Well, Weiwei.

552
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,580
I think you're busy today.

553
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,580
I'm afraid you can't get a job.

554
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,580
So I came to help.

555
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,580
I'm standing in front of you.

556
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,580
I'm holding the tools you usually use.

557
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,580
I'm sitting on the dishes you usually cook.

558
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:05,580
I can feel what happiness is.

559
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,580
Jia Yin, are you copying me?

560
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,580
No, but...

561
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:14,580
When I see you, I feel the energy.

562
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,580
There are so many flowers in the shop.

563
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,580
There are many peach blossoms.

564
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:38,720
Even the

565
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,580
Thank you.

566
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,580
You're welcome.

567
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:08,580
Hello, I'm Weiwei, the agent of V-Luv.

568
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,580
We will continue to follow the order of the European import flowering.

569
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,580
But the payment is not the British Group.

570
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:33,480
I will complete the

571
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:47,580
This afternoon, Yin Dong and his friends at the painting workshop

572
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,580
went to the museum to talk about selling oil paintings.

573
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:53,580
To meet all the success.

574
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,580
In addition to talent,

575
00:35:55,580 --> 00:36:00,580
they have to depend on human relations.

576
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,580
Of course.

577
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,580
Now this business society,

578
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,580
if you have no value,

579
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,860
I don't want to talk to you.

580
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,820
Yin Zhou is so tired.

581
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,580
You seem to be in a good mood today.

582
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,260
I'm fine.

583
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,740
Your parents said they couldn't reach you today.

584
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,140
They'll come back tomorrow.

585
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,580
I was with Yin Dong at the club this afternoon.

586
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,900
My phone was out of battery.

587
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,420
What's wrong? Did they want to talk to you?

588
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:39,020
They came to see how Viola is doing.

589
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,740
They want to invest the money in Viola.

590
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,660
If that's the case,

591
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,180
we can continue to dream about Ding Yin.

592
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,740
What do you think?

593
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,420
I thought Viola would close down.

594
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:11,260
I didn't expect to convince my parents to invest today.

595
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,100
I think it's because of the opportunity

596
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,340
that God gave to Ding Yin.

597
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,300
I'm really happy that I can help him

598
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,420
keep his dreams.

599
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,500
I'm sorry.

600
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,580
I'm sorry.

601
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,660
I'm sorry.

602
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,740
I'm sorry.

603
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:39,700
I hope everything goes well.

604
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,620
Take care.

605
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,700
Take care.

606
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,960
Why are you not talking so soon?

607
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,860
I'm here to return the car keys.

608
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,540
No more toilet fees.

609
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,260
I don't have to keep the car.

610
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,600
Oh?

611
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,620
In the wall?

612
00:38:37,700 --> 00:39:02,560
That Loy, that guy from the

613
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,000
crime police brigade killed onerovchikov,

614
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
You are my friend in my heart.

615
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I didn't expect you to care so much about your girlfriend.

616
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
You beat me for her.

617
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And you gave up your flower shop.

618
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I didn't expect you to care so much about Wan Jia.

619
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Wan Jia is my girlfriend.

620
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
It's a man's duty to protect his woman.

621
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I don't care what you think.

622
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
You invested in my flower shop.

623
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
And I managed it.

624
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
You are my trust.

625
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I appreciate you.

626
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Don't think too much.

627
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I'm too busy.

628
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I didn't have time to care about the flower shop.

629
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
The flower shop is too small for me.

630
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I must find someone to take care of it.

631
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Even without you, I will find someone else.

632
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I know.

633
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I'll tell you.

634
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
You don't have to come here in person.

635
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Just ask someone to send you here.

636
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
It's okay.

637
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I'm willing to come here.

638
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I'm not as busy as you.

639
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
The most important thing is

640
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
no matter how much you miss me

641
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I treat you as my best friend.

642
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I don't want our relationship to be changed.

643
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Dong Qing.

644
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I didn't put the past in the past.

645
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I'm too busy at home.

646
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I didn't have time to care about the flower shop.

647
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I'll take care of it sooner or later.

648
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I understand.

649
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I can't keep your dream.

650
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It's my biggest regret.

651
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Maybe I can ask the bank

652
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
to pay you.

653
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
No need.

654
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I found my self-esteem.

655
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
The parents of the player decided to give up the restaurant

656
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
and put the money in my account.

657
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I'm sorry.

658
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I'm sorry.

659
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Boss.

660
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I'm sorry I'm late.

661
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I want to find my dream.

662
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I must get back to the way I was.

663
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Will you go on a date with me?

664
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Of course.

665
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Because you are really extraordinary.

666
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I'll treat you to breakfast.

667
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I'm sorry.

668
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I'm sorry.

669
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I'm sorry.

670
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I'm sorry.

671
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I'm sorry.

672
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I'm sorry.

673
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I'm sorry.

674
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I'm sorry.

675
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I'm sorry.

676
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I'm sorry.

677
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I'm sorry.

678
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I'm sorry.

679
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I'm sorry.

680
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I'm sorry.

681
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I'm sorry.

682
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I'm sorry.

683
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I'm sorry.

684
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I'm sorry.

685
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I'm sorry.

686
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I'm sorry.

687
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I'm sorry.

688
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I'm sorry.

689
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I'm sorry.

690
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I'm sorry.

691
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I'm sorry.

692
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I'm sorry.

693
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I'm sorry.

694
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I'm sorry.

695
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I'm sorry.

696
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I'm sorry.

697
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I'm sorry.

698
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I'm sorry.

699
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I'm sorry.

700
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I'm sorry.

701
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I'm sorry.

702
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I'm sorry.

703
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I'm sorry.

704
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I'm sorry.

705
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I'm sorry.

706
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I'm sorry.

707
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I'm sorry.

708
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I'm sorry.

709
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I'm sorry.

710
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I'm sorry.

711
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I'm sorry.

712
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I'm sorry.

713
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I'm sorry.

714
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I'm sorry.

715
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I'm sorry.

716
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I'm sorry.

717
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I'm sorry.

718
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I'm sorry.

719
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I'm sorry.

720
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I'm sorry.

721
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I'm sorry.

722
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I'm sorry.

723
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I'm sorry.

724
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I'm sorry.
