1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

5
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,320
Ah

6
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,360
Ha

7
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You're an old man now.

8
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Do you want to see your brother or me?

9
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,000
If you want to see your brother,

10
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,500
I'll be fine.

11
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,000
Because your brother is with me every day.

12
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,000
If you want to see me,

13
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,500
I'll be fine.

14
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Why do I feel that

15
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,500
your life has changed so much

16
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,500
since Gao Qi appeared?

17
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,500
It's okay.

18
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I have a hundred questions to answer him.

19
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,000
There is only one question

20
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
that can accept him.

21
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,500
Because

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
he has accepted me to be with Kang Zeyu.

23
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,500
Amber,

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
you think too simply.

25
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,000
How difficult is it?

26
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,000
Do you want your dad and your mom to be together?

27
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I don't want to think about this question at all.

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,500
I have a headache when I think about it.

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,500
Let them solve it themselves.

30
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
Look,

31
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,000
this one is so beautiful.

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Amber.

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Amber.

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,500
Don't always avoid the questions.

35
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,500
Okay.

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,500
I'll tell you my sincere words.

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
If I and Kang Zeyu

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,500
are still together,

39
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,500
I hope that daddy and mommy can get back together.

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So that

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
my daddy has someone to accompany him.

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
If

43
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,500
I break up with Kang Zeyu,

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I don't want anyone

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
to share my daddy's love with me evenly.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The two of them

47
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,500
may be really in love with me.

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It means that they love me wholeheartedly.

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's very realistic.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Reality is cruel.

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I just said the answer straightly.

52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Honey, are you still watching the house?

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'll be fine in a few minutes.

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay, honey.

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
When you're done,

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
remember to call me.

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Love you.

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Amber.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You and my brother

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
are going to continue like this?

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What about you?

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Are you going to continue

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
with brother Ding Yi like this?

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,500
There's nothing between us.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Why are you talking about me?

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Amber.

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Are you thirsty?

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll get you some water.

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I have water.

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'll get you some food.

71
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay.

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'll go right away.

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I can tell what's going on between you two.

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
When are you going to tell everyone?

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You two shouldn't hide.

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But I haven't decided

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
what to tell Jia Jia yet.

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Does she not know?

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I guess she doesn't know.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Impossible.

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I can tell.

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Don't forget that

83
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Wan Jia is a good friend

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
who grew up with you.

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Coming.

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay.

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I won't bother you two anymore.

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I have to go on a date with you.

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This is food.

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You can eat it yourself.

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Bye.

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Bye.

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Bye.

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Do you think Gao Qi will be Amber's mother

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
or the mother of the sports?

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I don't know.

97
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But I think

98
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
this is not as simple as Amber thought.

99
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
People become rich

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and even their relationships become conditional.

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's too much.

102
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I don't think so.

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I think

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
it's not as simple as Amber thought.

105
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
People become rich

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and even their relationships become conditional.

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's too much.

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Your brother

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
moved out with Amber?

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Amber has been in so many situations recently.

111
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's actually good

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
to have my brother with her.

113
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yes.

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
People always leave school

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and leave home.

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
This is a good thing.

117
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I think

118
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Amber is a good person.

119
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I think

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
she is a good person.

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I think

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
she is a good person.

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I think

124
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
leaving home

125
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
is inevitable.

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Will you

127
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
leave home too?

128
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Me?

129
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I have my mother

130
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and my brother to take care of.

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I won't leave home

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
for a short time.

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What about you?

134
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Will you live with a foreigner?

135
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
If possible,

136
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I hope I can live with him forever.

137
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He has sports.

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Okay.

139
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You have your family

140
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
and your family.

141
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I have Amber.

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'll just be alone

143
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and live alone.

144
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm here.

145
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll live alone with you.

146
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Are you kidding me?

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Do I look like I'm kidding?

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Do I look like I'm kidding?

149
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Have I ever made a joke?

150
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Then

151
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
what is the relationship between us?

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
There are many words

153
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
that I haven't said to you.

154
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
There are many love letters

155
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
that I haven't sent to you

156
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
in the drawer.

157
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I actually want to

158
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
walk with you

159
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
for a while more

160
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
so that our youth

161
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
won't fade away.

162
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
As long as there are memories,

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
there will be no regrets.

164
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Darling,

165
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I just want to tell you

166
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
that I will love you.

167
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I only take care of you.

168
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I only love you.

169
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And I think

170
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
if my second half

171
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
can have you,

172
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
then it's a legend to me.

173
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The legend in my legend

174
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
is that I met you.

175
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You have to believe me.

176
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I am very loyal.

177
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I will repay you with my life.

178
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
By the way,

179
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I hope you can take this cheque.

180
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
If you need anything,

181
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
you can buy some.

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What's wrong with you?

183
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You always give me cheques

184
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
worth millions.

185
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I don't ask for these from you.

186
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I don't have money.

187
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
If I really don't have money,

188
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
someone will pay for it.

189
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I don't give these people

190
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
these opportunities.

191
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And every time

192
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I give you cheques,

193
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
you don't even give me a glance.

194
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What does this mean?

195
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It means your character,

196
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
your high-quality.

197
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I beg you.

198
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Give me some face.

199
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Take it.

200
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
By the way,

201
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
can I send you to the hotel

202
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
at the door of the hotel later tonight?

203
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
When did I learn to be so bad?

204
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Didn't I tell you

205
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
that you and I

206
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
are meant to be together

207
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
and not to be together forever?

208
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And

209
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I really don't want to affect

210
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
your relationship with your son.

211
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I understand.

212
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Today,

213
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Ding Yi Ge finally accepted my heart.

214
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I never thought

215
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
we would be together.

216
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But

217
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
that moment

218
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
was so happy.

219
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yan Yan,

220
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
give me some time.

221
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I will tell everyone that

222
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I won't let you be lonely.

223
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I will tell everyone that

224
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I won't let you be lonely.

225
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I will tell everyone that

226
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I won't let you be lonely.

227
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I will tell everyone that

228
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I won't let you be lonely.

229
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I will tell everyone that

230
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I won't let you be lonely.

231
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I will tell everyone that

232
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I won't let you be lonely.

233
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I will tell everyone that

234
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I won't let you be lonely.

235
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I will tell everyone that

236
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I won't let you be lonely.

237
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I will tell everyone that

238
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I won't let you be lonely.

239
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I will tell everyone that

240
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I won't let you be lonely.

241
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I will tell everyone that

242
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I won't let you be lonely.

243
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I will tell everyone that

244
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I won't let you be lonely.

245
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I will tell everyone that

246
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I won't let you be lonely.

247
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I will tell everyone that

248
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I won't let you be lonely.

249
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
My dear, didn't I interrupt you?

250
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
My voice sounds like that...

251
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Do you feel like...

252
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I will tell you, I live in this house.

253
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I will tell you, I live in this house.

254
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I will tell you, I live in this house.

255
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I will tell you, I live in this house.

256
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What do you want?

257
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I can't.

258
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I live next door to you.

259
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Listen, I'll go to the other side.

260
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'll take a room.

261
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So I can feel more secure.

262
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You didn't go home?

263
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm worried about you.

264
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
If I feel secure,

265
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I can call you anytime.

266
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
How do you say it in Chinese?

267
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm willing to protect you for the rest of my life.

268
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I understand.

269
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I understand.

270
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Okay,

271
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
you should sleep early.

272
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Good night.

273
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Okay.

274
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Good night. Bye.

275
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What's going on?

276
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's so mysterious.

277
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Don't open your eyes.

278
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I said open your eyes.

279
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I see.

280
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Don't move.

281
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Don't open your eyes.

282
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Okay.

283
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Welcome to the show.

284
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
This is our house?

285
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yes.

286
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
When did you shoot the movie?

287
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
This time.

288
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Are you kidding me?

289
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Okay, I won't.

290
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Are you wrong?

291
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yes.

292
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
How do I punish you?

293
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You say how to punish me.

294
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I want you to say it yourself.

295
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'll lock myself up here.

296
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I won't be kept in here forever.

297
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
What if your parents come to keep you?

298
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'll buy them a house

299
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
that looks exactly the same.

300
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'll never be separated from you.

301
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Is that okay?

302
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I think they

303
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
are in love

304
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
and broke up for money.

305
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Two people who love each other

306
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
will be together forever.

307
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's not enough.

308
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Okay,

309
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
let's talk about now.

310
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Say it.

311
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
How do I punish you?

312
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'll be a good wife.

313
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'll wait for my husband to come home for dinner.

314
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Who will brush the dishes?

315
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'll do it.

316
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Who will hang the clothes?

317
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Who will take them off?

318
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'll do it.

319
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Jin,

320
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Mr. Gao just

321
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
said his thoughts in detail.

322
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
If you invest

323
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
your products in the bank,

324
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
what do you think?

325
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Miss Gao,

326
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
this woman's products

327
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
are very attractive

328
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
to the interest.

329
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
But they are not 100% secure.

330
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
So,

331
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I have to study them more.

332
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You are very careful.

333
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I understand.

334
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's not easy to enter the Chinese market.

335
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
In addition to the conditions,

336
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
there are also overseas funds.

337
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The most important thing

338
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
is the relationship between people.

339
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Miss Gao, you are welcome.

340
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You are recommended by Mr. Ying.

341
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
The bank will evaluate you

342
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
and will be impressed.

343
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Because I am about to retire,

344
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I have to be careful.

345
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Really?

346
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Mr. Ying,

347
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I must find a time

348
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
to study with Mr. Jin.

349
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The focus is not on my project,

350
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
but on how Mr. Ying and the English Group

351
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
will market overseas.

352
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Jin,

353
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I am 100% confident in you.

354
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Don't worry.

355
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
My handsome brother is here.

356
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It seems that I came at the wrong time today.

357
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'll come again some other day.

358
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I hope I don't have to wait for another week.

359
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Stop.

360
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Stop.

361
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Look at this kid.

362
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
He doesn't even have a headmaster.

363
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Why are you so serious?

364
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
There is no outsider.

365
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Sit down.

366
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Come and sit down.

367
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
This little girl is so big.

368
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The investments in the market have been

369
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
based on the support of Gao Fei.

370
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Of course, Mr. Jin is one of us.

371
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I know very well.

372
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But some people come in too soon.

373
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You have something to say.

374
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
In addition to the relationship,

375
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
the relationship is also called fate.

376
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Mr. Gao is my precious person.

377
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
He is our family's precious person.

378
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Do you know that?

379
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You see,

380
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
it's good for young people to grow up.

381
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Let's talk about love.

382
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You can talk about it in a big way.

383
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
He must be the kind of person

384
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
who has seen the person in secret.

385
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Okay.

386
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Let's talk about it together.

387
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Okay.

388
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Didn't you just say that

389
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
there are three banks

390
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
that want to cooperate with us?

391
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Which one do you think is the safest?

392
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Of course, it's Mr. Jin's.

393
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
He just returned to the bank.

394
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Are they all your good friends?

395
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What are the rules?

396
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
How much do you want to be paid?

397
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You help me make up my mind.

398
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
No need.

399
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Mr. Jin and I never talk about this.

400
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Mr. Jin, don't be polite.

401
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You must do things according to the rules.

402
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I, Gao Qi,

403
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
will never let others suffer.

404
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Xiaodong, what do you think?

405
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I don't care.

406
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You won't want to hear my words.

407
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I also want to hear

408
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
the opinions of young people.

409
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Sometimes they think

410
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
that we can't think of anything.

411
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Okay.

412
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I've seen this project.

413
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I think the risk is high.

414
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
We should re-evaluate the risk.

415
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You shouldn't be too emotional when you do business.

416
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Don't you always say that?

417
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You're obviously saying

418
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
that I'm not rational enough.

419
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm impulsive, right?

420
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Aren't you?

421
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You don't even go home now.

422
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You moved to the hotel

423
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
to be a guard guard.

424
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm afraid someone will hurt her.

425
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
She needs protection.

426
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Why can't she?

427
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
She?

428
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
She is the skin of the 2014 version.

429
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Who can hurt her?

430
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You're a bastard.

431
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I want you to apologize to Gao Cong

432
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
right now.

433
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Right now.

434
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's okay.

435
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Sometimes young people

436
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
can't control themselves.

437
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Don't talk nonsense.

438
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Youjin,

439
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
if you have any doubts,

440
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I completely agree with Xiaodong.

441
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Let's make another assessment.

442
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Don't make you two unhappy

443
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
for a small investment project.

444
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I have something to do.

445
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'll leave first.

446
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
No, no.

447
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Mr. Jin, we...

448
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Wait.

449
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Let's make it clear.

450
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
As the saying goes,

451
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
a family never changes.

452
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm going to keep it.

453
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And it's not a family business.

454
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Sit down, Mr. Fang.

455
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Don't be so polite.

456
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Let's make it clear today.

457
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Do you really want me to stay?

458
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm sincerely leaving you.

459
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Xiaodong,

460
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
you can say

461
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
what you think about this project.

462
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I believe

463
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
that as long as it's a good opinion,

464
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
your father will accept it.

465
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Okay.

466
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Although I'm not old,

467
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I've been with my father since I was a kid.

468
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I've seen a lot of businessmen

469
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
who are very smart.

470
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But I'm really the first one

471
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
who has such wisdom as you.

472
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I admire you.

473
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I admire you.

474
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Your wisdom is

475
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
to transfer the risk to our English company

476
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
and let our English company make the guarantee for you.

477
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Then the risk of the bank will be reduced.

478
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
They are of course willing to cooperate with us.

479
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
So the risk assessment report from the bank

480
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
has no meaning at all.

481
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
There must be a risk in doing business.

482
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
High risk, high return.

483
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I believe your father

484
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
has been in the business for decades.

485
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You make him love you so much.

486
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
What's the point of his decades of experience?

487
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Have you said enough?

488
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Okay.

489
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I won't say it anymore.

490
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
But I at least know that

491
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
when this woman was kissing you,

492
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
she didn't forget to pull out An Bo and Kang Zirui

493
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
just to make you lose your hand.

494
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You can get Wu Yuting's sympathy when you go back.

495
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
An Bo is Mr. Gao's daughter.

496
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Does she have anything wrong with her daughter?

497
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Do you have any humanity?

498
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
What's your relationship with that half-wit girl?

499
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Tell me.

500
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Don't be like this.

501
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Is this how young people fall in love?

502
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Youjin,

503
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
if you really think there is a risk,

504
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
we can do nothing about it.

505
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I'll just think of a way.

506
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
No, Mr. Gao.

507
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'm sincere with you.

508
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm 100% confident.

509
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm telling you,

510
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm going to do this project.

511
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Dad!

512
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I'll persuade you in the end.

513
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
If you don't listen to me now,

514
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
there will be a disaster in Eagle Division.

515
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You bastard!

516
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Do you know what you just said?

517
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You're cursing yourself, cursing me,

518
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
cursing our family, do you know?

519
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'm a useless son.

520
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Either you listen to me,

521
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
or you don't let me

522
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
go through anything in Eagle Division.

523
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I'm warning you.

524
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Be careful when you make a move.

525
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You have a chance.

526
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Who gave you all this?

527
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I can give you all this.

528
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You can only give me

529
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
all this.

530
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I can take all this away from you.

531
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You're going to piss me off.

532
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'll give you a month's leave

533
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
and you can go home and tell me the reason.

534
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Now, come with me!

535
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Don't be angry.

536
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What are you doing?

537
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Don't be angry.

538
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Remember to prepare the documents

539
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
for the meeting tomorrow.

540
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Mr Ying, the chairman told me

541
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
that you...

542
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
What did he tell me?

543
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Just say it. It's okay.

544
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
He told you not to go to the office anymore.

545
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
He's going to give you a month's leave

546
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and you can go home and rest

547
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
and think about what you should do.

548
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm going.

549
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm going.

550
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
You're going to sleep?

551
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Didn't you notice anything different

552
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
in your room today?

553
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Check carefully.

554
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
There will be a surprise.

555
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I'm going.

556
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Weiwei,

557
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I've been pursuing happiness.

558
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I've only found out today

559
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
that happiness is not anywhere else,

560
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
but by my side.

561
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I like to see the food

562
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
and the attitude of people.

563
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
When you're angry,

564
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
you look stupid.

565
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
When you look at me,

566
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
you'll always have care in your eyes.

567
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
The best person for me is not someone else,

568
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
but you.

569
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Can you give me a chance

570
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
to be by your side?

571
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Hold on to this happiness.

572
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Hello?

573
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Hello.

574
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I hope that in your phone,

575
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I'm the one who sent the first text message.

576
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I also called the first call.

577
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Why are you so domineering?

578
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Are you playing the game like a puppy?

579
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Be serious.

580
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Are you discussing a relationship?

581
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Yes, sir.

582
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
You have a new phone now.

583
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
The boss ordered you

584
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
to do everything you can

585
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
without any hesitation.

586
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I'm going.

587
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I'm going.

588
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I must report to the boss.

589
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
The boss is so domineering.

590
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
But I like it.

591
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Your voice

592
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
is so gentle.

593
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I like it too.

594
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
You don't have to spend money anymore.

595
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Do you know that

596
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
it's hard to make money?

597
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
You're not a fool.

598
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I'm just a small boss.

599
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It's not worth it to buy a phone for your girlfriend.

600
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Then,

601
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
boyfriend,

602
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
if there's nothing else,

603
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I'll go to bed.

604
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Good night.

605
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
In your dream,

606
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
you are the best.

607
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Brother.

608
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Mr. Kang.

609
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Mr. Kang.

610
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Why are you up so early?

611
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Are you working?

612
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Or taking a shower?

613
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I'm starving.

614
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I have a lot of things to do.

615
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You don't have food?

616
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Don't mention it.

617
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
After the delivery,

618
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
my fridge is empty.

619
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
My mom has been working

620
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
so hard lately.

621
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
No one cares about me.

622
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Then, you can look for food in the fridge.

623
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I don't know if there's anything to eat.

624
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Okay.

625
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
You'll starve if you eat less.

626
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Hey.

627
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Handsome men like me

628
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
don't have much to offer.

629
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Okay?

630
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
You should value what you have.

631
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Cherish it.

632
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Sorry.

633
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I'm a rude person.

634
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Jiajia.

635
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Recently,

636
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Mr. Kang has been busy.

637
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Is he in a relationship?

638
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
He doesn't think so.

639
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I think so.

640
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
He thinks you're weird.

641
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I think so too.

642
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I think he's weird.

643
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
He'll ask you later.

644
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Okay. Let's go.

645
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I don't think

646
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
it's a big deal.

647
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
You can do it yourself.

648
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
It's a marriage.

649
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
It's not good.

650
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
It's rude to look at someone else's phone.

651
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I don't have anything to say.

652
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
If you have something to say,

653
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
don't ask me later.

654
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I'm sorry.

655
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
What do you think?

656
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I saw it.

657
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
You're a moral person.

658
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Don't try to get along with me.

659
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
You're not moral.

660
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Tell me.

661
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Who are you looking for?

662
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
It's...

663
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I know.

664
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
The man with the glasses in the school.

665
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Wang Dongyu.

666
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Right?

667
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It's him.

668
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
He sent me a message.

669
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I was so shocked.

670
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I really can't see it.

671
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
He's so polite.

672
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
He's so generous.

673
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
He's really a man of his own.

674
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It's strange.

675
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
He's usually with Weiwei.

676
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
He has too much time.

677
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
He's always in love.

678
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Weiwei is such a good girl.

679
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Now he's in her hands.

680
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
If he feels bad about Weiwei,

681
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I can't forgive him.

682
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
What?

683
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
There's nothing good in your fridge.

684
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I'll go get some ice cream.

685
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
How about an apple?

686
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Eat it yourself.

687
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I'm leaving.

688
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Who's so rude?

689
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I'm leaving.

690
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Can I come in?

691
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Sure.

692
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Who told you to come in?

693
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Because of you?

694
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
That's better than someone hiding it from you.

695
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I'm leaving.

696
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
When did you start dating?

697
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Darling.

698
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I don't know who you're talking about.

699
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Don't use your innocent eyes to pretend to be innocent.

700
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
There's no such thing as a good man.

701
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Who am I?

702
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I'm the handsome, handsome, and smart

703
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Gasp Boy, Hua Youxi.

704
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
And you're my brother.

705
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I've seen you like this for two days.

706
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
You're usually a bitter face.

707
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
You've been walking like a dog these two days.

708
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
What's wrong with you?

709
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
You want to cheat me?

710
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
You're too cute.

711
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I suddenly realized that you're too scary.

712
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
You're so fast at catching up.

713
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
It's good that you know.

714
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
If there's any secret that's leaked out of the house,

715
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
it must be you.

716
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Tell me.

717
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
How did you kill her?

718
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It's your eyes that betrayed you.

719
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Don't talk nonsense.

720
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Tell me.

721
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
When did you start dating?

722
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Who was the first one you chased?

723
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
No one took the initiative.

724
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Anyway...

725
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Anyway, it happened naturally.

726
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Brother, tell me the truth.

727
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
What's your relationship with her?

728
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Can I not tell you?

729
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
You didn't tell me.

730
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
No.

731
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
You didn't even tell me.

732
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I kissed her hand.

733
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Are you kidding me?

734
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
You just held hands and gave her a call.

735
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Are you out of your mind?

736
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Love is not measured by this kind of thing.

737
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
You're so useless.

738
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Brother, hold my hand.

739
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
What?

740
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Your father.

741
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
You can kiss me. I'll pay you a lot of money.

742
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Kiss me.

743
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Get out of here.

744
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
You're crazy.

745
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I saw you sent a text to the man who was watching you.

746
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
You're so talented.

747
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I'm even more talented than him when I sent you that text.

748
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
You're awesome.

749
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Brother.

750
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Are you playing a game?

751
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Are you peeking at her phone?

752
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Brother, don't.

753
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Let's talk about this.

754
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Tell me.

755
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
When are you going to tell us?

756
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
You can't keep hiding it from us.

757
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Actually, I haven't thought about it yet.

758
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Anyway, I don't think it's the right time.

759
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
You're not going to be attracted to the player again, are you?

760
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Of course not.

761
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Weiwei and I are serious.

762
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
It's not the best.

763
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
The player knows this except you.

764
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I know.

765
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Of course I know.

766
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
He's with Weiwei every day.

767
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
How can I not know?

768
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Then what did he say?

769
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:18,000
He said he was very happy to see his two best friends together.

770
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
He wishes you all the best.

771
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
He wishes you all the best.

772
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Miss Wan, the paintings in Denmark were very successful.

773
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
They were rated as the best paintings of the year.

774
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
That's great.

775
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
When do we start the second round of exhibitions?

776
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Jiajia has a new work recently.

777
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I've asked experts to evaluate it.

778
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
The artistic value is very good.

779
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I think you can continue to promote it.

780
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I think you can continue to promote it.

781
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I think you can continue to promote it.

782
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I think you can continue to promote it.

783
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I think you can continue to promote it.

784
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I think you can continue to promote it.

785
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
You can continue to promote it.

786
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Yingdong, I'm sorry.

787
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I think...

788
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
You know, I have a lot of projects in my hands recently.

789
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Let's put the painting aside for now.

790
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I don't understand what you mean.

791
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Yingdong, let's talk.

792
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
If you have something to say, just say it as an expert.

793
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I have no secrets between him and me.

794
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
You know,

795
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I didn't mean to put the painting aside for now.

796
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
It's my father's idea.

797
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
You know, my father and your father have a business relationship.

798
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
My father has seen Gao Qi before.

799
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
It's not easy.

800
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Actually, my father and Gao Qi are just friends.

801
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Yingdong, we grew up together.

802
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I'll just say it.

803
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I think,

804
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
whether it's your father or you,

805
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
you can't make a relationship like this because of a woman.

806
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I think you should talk to your father first and get the relationship done.

807
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I think you must have misunderstood.

808
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
My relationship with my father has always been very good.

809
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I have something to do. I'll go first.

810
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Call me.

811
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
My father.

812
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Hands. Hands. Hands.

813
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Take your hands off.

814
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Dad, why are you here?

815
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Why am I here?

816
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I'm here to see the house for you.

817
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
But you, for this girl, you just...

818
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I'm thinking,

819
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
can I live in this world as long as I have money?

820
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Of course not.

821
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
But in my world,

822
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I have to control you.

823
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
It's time for me to choose some friends who are valuable to me.

824
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Since you chose me,

825
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
you should know right from wrong.

826
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
If you understand what kind of person you are with,

827
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
you will know what kind of person you are.

828
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I'm in love with you.

829
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Hello.

830
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
What happened?

831
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
You haven't come to me for several days.

832
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Are you angry?

833
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I don't want to be in public

834
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,800
and your pursuers.

835
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,400
That's easy.

836
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,600
Just don't meet me in public.

837
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,200
Can you meet me at my place?

838
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,520
What a coincidence. I'm not at home.

839
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,960
I'm at the office.

840
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,080
Really?

841
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,920
What a pity.

842
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,040
I brought Amber back.

843
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,720
I'll take her away first.

844
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,560
Wait.

845
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Amber.

846
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,160
I should have sent you back earlier.

847
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,960
Daddy.

848
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,240
Amber.

849
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,640
Where have you been?

850
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,160
I was so worried.

851
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,120
Amber left because of me.

852
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,920
So I brought her back.

853
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,120
I'll make you a nice meal.

854
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,640
Don't be mad.

855
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,040
Oh, right.

856
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,080
I'm here to help.

857
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,840
Let's have dinner together tonight.

858
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,240
Your daughter is standing beside you.

859
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,040
Do I have a reason to refuse?

860
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,280
Are you jealous?

861
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,680
I raised my daughter.

862
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,360
Why should I be jealous?

863
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,520
I'm not talking about your daughter.

864
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,160
Amber, stop it.

865
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,760
Can you really cook?

866
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,360
I think we're going to starve tonight.

867
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,040
I heard you.

868
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,360
Don't make a conclusion.

869
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,520
I learned a few things from Kaven.

870
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,680
I'll teach you two a lesson tonight.

871
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,160
I'm afraid she'll make the kitchen a crime scene.

872
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,400
I'll go check it out.

873
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,280
I'll go.

874
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,800
The kitchen is for women.

875
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,960
Miss Gao.

876
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,560
This is not your job.

877
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,120
Let me do it.

878
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,840
It's okay. I'll do it.

879
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,640
Mom, you're so good.

880
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,600
It's not that hard.

881
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,080
Just clean the abalone with a brush.

882
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,440
I forgot to buy lemon slices for seafood.

883
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,400
It's okay.

884
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,400
It's the same effect as soaking it in rice water.

885
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,400
What's wrong?

886
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,960
Why are you staring at me?

887
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,000
Do you think I don't know how to cook?

888
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,800
I really didn't expect that, Mommy.

889
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,320
You're a good cook.

890
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,320
You can cook for the women in the kitchen.

891
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,320
I think that's how you scared Daddy back then.

892
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,320
Ask him.

893
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,120
This is the soup my daughter made for us.

894
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,200
The last two dishes.

895
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,800
Put it here.

896
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,000
It's really good.

897
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
You can't waste such a good dish.

898
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Sister Ting, help me take a family photo.

899
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Okay.

900
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Come on, Baby, get up.

901
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Mommy, get up.

902
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,800
Miss, it's done.

903
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,200
Thank you.

904
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,800
Let me see.

905
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,000
You two are a perfect match.

906
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,600
Okay, okay.

907
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,600
Let's sit down and eat.

908
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,200
Come on.

909
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,000
All three of us are here today.

910
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I can feel the warmth of the family.

911
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,800
Daddy, Mommy, I've made up my mind.

912
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,000
Let the past be the past.

913
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,400
The most important thing is now and the future.

914
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,200
Now, the three of us are together.

915
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,600
I hope that the three of us will be together forever.

916
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,800
Of course.

917
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,000
Hurry up and eat. The food is getting cold.

918
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Come on, Baby, eat the abalone.

919
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,600
Yuting, I told you last time to make me a guarantee.

920
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,800
I'll put my financial products on the bank.

921
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,800
I've talked to several banks.

922
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,800
They're interested.

923
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,800
But in terms of contracts,

924
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,000
there are always many good things.

925
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,800
You mean Jinchang's high-paying bank?

926
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,200
How did you guess?

927
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:03,200
The whole bank knows that the financial situation of the British Group is dependent on high-paying.

928
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,800
And you have a relationship with Ying Youqing.

929
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,000
It's not just about the high-paying.

930
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
So what do you think?

931
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,600
Don't mention the contract on the table.

932
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,200
Don't waste the good food.

933
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,000
Baby, don't worry. Hurry up and eat.

934
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,600
Okay.

935
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,800
The food is getting cold.

936
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,800
Come on.

937
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,000
Here, have some soup.

938
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Thank you, Mommy.

939
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,000
Hello.

940
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Hi.

941
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
You haven't got off work yet?

942
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I'm almost done.

943
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,600
How's business today?

944
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,600
Not bad.

945
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,600
Where's Meng?

946
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,600
Here.

947
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Meng.

948
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,800
What brings you here?

949
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,800
I miss you.

950
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,800
I came to see you.

951
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,000
Miss me?

952
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,800
Are you here to see me

953
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,800
or to see me?

954
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,800
I'm here to see you.

955
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,800
I'm here to see you.

956
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,800
I'm here to see you.

957
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,800
I'm here to see you.

958
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,000
Or to see my son?

959
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Why would I see your son?

960
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,800
Ms. Zheng,

961
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,800
we have half an hour to close.

962
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,800
You have to do business when you're open.

963
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,800
Bring out your most expensive wine.

964
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Most expensive wine?

965
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,800
You think I won't pay?

966
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,800
We have no reason to leave

967
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,800
We don't need any reason

968
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,800
Too many things in life

969
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,800
Can't be replaced

970
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,800
We have no reason to leave

971
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,800
We don't need any reason

972
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,800
When you need it most

973
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,800
When you need it most

974
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,800
There's a saying

975
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,800
Don't say it out

976
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,800
You'll be fine

977
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:00,800
Don't hesitate

978
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,800
Be the wind for me

979
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,800
Be the rain for me

980
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,800
Teach me to stop

981
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,800
And walk forward

982
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,800
I've been hurt

983
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,800
And hurt before

984
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,800
I'm sure you'll be with me

985
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,800
Tears and wine

986
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,800
We'll drink together

987
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,800
We'll keep our mouth shut

988
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:39,800
We'll stay on the street

989
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,800
We don't need any reason

990
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,800
When you need it most

991
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,800
Too many things in life

992
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,800
That's what I love most

993
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,800
We'll drink together

994
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,800
We'll keep our mouth shut

995
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,800
When you need it most

996
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,800
We'll keep our mouth shut

997
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:13,800
In our time

998
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,800
Together

999
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:25,800
Together

1000
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,800
Together
