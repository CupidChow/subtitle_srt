Episode 9

2
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hello.

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So many people.

4
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Brother, why are you here?

5
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Amber sent me a message.

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I didn't send you a message.

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You didn't send a message?

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Who sent this?

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But I didn't send you a message.

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Okay, brother.

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I want to introduce a new friend to you.

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This is Ye Feifei, a new student of our school.

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
This is my brother, Kang Zirui, a film and advertising director.

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Hello, Kang Zirui.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Have we met somewhere before?

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
No, I don't think so.

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
How could it be possible?

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I haven't seen you before.

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Brother, he just came here a few days ago.

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
How could you have seen him?

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Kang, have a drink.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay, a glass of coke.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You talk first, I'll help you.

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
He is really a new student of your school.

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yes.

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Let's go, sit down.

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What's wrong?

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
One day you will remember my ex-girlfriend.

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What do you mean?

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I didn't send this.

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You are all here.

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Why are you here?

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Wan Jia sent a message to me.

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I didn't send you a message.

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Wan Jia, what do you mean?

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I didn't send her a message.

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Give me your phone.

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
This is your number, right?

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This is my number.

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But I didn't send this message.

41
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Since you didn't send a message to Ying Zirui,

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'll give you a chance to talk to him.

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I don't know if Amber sent a message to my brother.

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Who sent the messages they received on their phones?

45
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Why did you ask to meet with Fatty Rui?

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I didn't.

47
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
No wonder you didn't ask to meet with me.

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Your boyfriend came, right?

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What do you mean?

50
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What do you think?

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I didn't send this message to you.

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I didn't send him a message.

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You didn't send a message?

54
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Since I didn't send your message,

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and Wan Jia didn't send Ying Zirui's message,

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
then someone must have been in the middle.

57
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The drinks are here.

58
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Who touched our phones just now?

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Ye Fei Fei,

60
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
didn't you help us to look at the bags and phones?

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
After you took a shower,

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I met Hua Youxi.

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I went to the bathroom with a stomachache.

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Then she cut my hair.

65
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What are you doing?

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What are you doing? Why are you looking at me like that?

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Am I handsome today?

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So it was you.

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Here, Coke for you.

70
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Wu Wanpo, what are you doing?

71
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Are you crazy?

72
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Hua Youxi, are you free?

73
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What's wrong with me?

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You want money, right?

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Okay, I'll give it to you.

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

77
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You have money, you can't get it.

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Amber, are you okay?

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Are you okay?

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'll hurt you.

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Let her go.

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I've been fighting with you for a long time.

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Are you feeling better?

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll go to the hospital with you.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Look at your face.

86
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's okay.

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's not a small injury.

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I've been fighting since I was a kid.

89
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You sound like a bastard.

90
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm not.

91
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I think fighting is a kind of communication.

92
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
When you can't say anything in your heart,

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
fighting is a good practice.

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But today I see you guys.

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You seem to have a good relationship.

96
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Actually, the face is not good.

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's a little weak.

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I think it's good.

99
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
If you fight, you'll be better in the future.

100
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Anyway, I think Amber and Wan Jia are fake.

101
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Amber took Wan Jia's boyfriend.

102
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
They are friends.

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But they are still friends.

104
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Wan Jia is even more fake.

105
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
She said she was good friends with Kang Weiwei.

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
But she took her boyfriend's boyfriend.

107
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
She's pretty good.

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
She's been here for a long time.

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
She knows our relationship very well.

110
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I hate women who take other's boyfriend.

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What?

112
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Did you take my boyfriend?

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Am I right?

114
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yes, you're right.

115
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
My ex-boyfriend betrayed me.

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And he followed my best friend.

117
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You guys are not good.

118
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You can't deny all men because you don't love men.

119
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Losing you is his loss.

120
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But you lost a fake heart.

121
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And he lost a sincere heart.

122
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Okay, I think he's really losing.

123
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But I won't forgive him.

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You don't know men.

125
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The more you hate him, the more he thinks you love him.

126
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Men are very selfish.

127
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
They are very big.

128
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
According to you, your ex-girlfriend must hate you.

129
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's not like that.

130
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
She doesn't hate me.

131
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And we are good friends now.

132
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm very disappointed.

133
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You can't forget him?

134
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Men are all scumbags.

135
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yes, men are scumbags.

136
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
They don't see the youth.

137
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I think you're very sincere.

138
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Very simple.

139
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Maybe.

140
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Maybe one day you'll be cheated by me.

141
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What?

142
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Don't move.

143
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I think if you're more sincere, you'll be pretty.

144
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You're crazy.

145
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You're crazy.

146
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You're a pervert.

147
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You're a pervert.

148
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Pervert.

149
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You sent the message, right?

150
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You're a pervert.

151
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You're a pervert.

152
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.

153
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Actually I...

154
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You don't have to answer the question.

155
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
If you lie and say you don't have a girlfriend, I won't have a boyfriend.

156
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Let's go play.

157
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm sorry.

158
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Let's go.

159
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
How do you know I'm here?

160
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Didn't you tell me before?

161
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
When you're in a bad mood, you'll come here to visit Shanghai.

162
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What?

163
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I beat Yingdong, you come to take revenge?

164
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm here to thank you.

165
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I thank you for making me realize that the most important person for me now is Yingdong.

166
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Maybe I still can't let go of Zirui, but he's already in the past.

167
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Can I ask you a question?

168
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Go ahead.

169
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Why do you want to send all the messages to all of us?

170
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I want to figure out the relationship between you and Anru.

171
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Amber is here too.

172
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Fortunately, I bought more wine.

173
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Is there something going on between you two?

174
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Why do you have so much wine?

175
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Do you think he's my only friend?

176
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Stop it.

177
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Okay, let's drink.

178
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Cheers.

179
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
This drink is a little boring.

180
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Okay, let's play a game.

181
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Okay.

182
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Everyone says different things.

183
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'll go first.

184
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
For our friendship in the past and our friendship in the future.

185
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Cheers.

186
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
For our ex-boyfriend and current boyfriend.

187
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Cheers.

188
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
For me, I broke into your world.

189
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Cheers.

190
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
For you, for me and my mom's friendship.

191
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I take you as my brother.

192
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Cheers.

193
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Cheers.

194
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
For you two, a gentleman's love.

195
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Cheers.

196
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
For your friendship, cheers.

197
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Cheers.

198
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
This drink is not enough.

199
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
We can't have a friendship.

200
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
We are brothers.

201
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Not enough.

202
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
For you, a beautiful girl and my handsome brother.

203
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
For the first time, you have a friendship.

204
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Cheers.

205
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
For you, I fought hard and fought for my brother.

206
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Cheers.

207
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Cheers.

208
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm not playing.

209
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm regulate the discipline, because I always expect every holder to get some money.

210
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Thank you for your businessman side help.

211
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Congratulations.

212
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'll make a promise to my brother.

213
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'd like toSAI.

214
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Thanks.

215
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
In Chinese,

216
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You want me to ask you something?

217
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You want to SAI?

218
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yeah.

219
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Did it go well with your broadcast?

220
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And you will wait for me

221
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,920
Michael.

222
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,720
Amber.

223
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,240
Amber!

224
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,280
Amber...

225
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yo hollow

226
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,680
You are such a knockoff

227
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,320
How do you wake up?

228
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,600
I am sooo thirsty

229
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:43,980
Anbo

230
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,440
What have you done at my house?

231
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:52,940
I watched Yo

232
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,940
Tell me!

233
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,940
Why do I sleep?

234
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,940
Mengjie, you misunderstood.

235
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,940
I've been sleeping upstairs, but I didn't come down.

236
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,940
Then why are you wearing Youxi's clothes?

237
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,940
My clothes are dirty.

238
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,940
Feifei helped me change them.

239
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,940
Feifei?

240
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,940
Mengjie, you're back.

241
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,940
Feifei, tell me, did you help her change her clothes?

242
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,940
Yes, I changed her clothes.

243
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,940
Did they do nothing?

244
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,940
No, Youxi is sleeping here.

245
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,940
I've been staying upstairs with Amber.

246
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,940
I told you it's okay.

247
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,940
You're so mean.

248
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,940
Amber!

249
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,940
Daddy!

250
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,940
Hello!

251
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,940
You bastard!

252
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,940
Don't touch my son!

253
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,940
They didn't do anything!

254
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,940
Bector, send the message back.

255
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,940
Yes.

256
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,940
Come out for a while.

257
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,940
I have something to tell you.

258
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,940
Youxi!

259
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,940
Didn't you swear that your son wouldn't bother Amber again?

260
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,940
How do you explain today's situation?

261
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,940
Today was an accident.

262
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,940
Don't worry, this kind of thing will never happen again.

263
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,940
Let me ask you.

264
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,940
Is Youxi my son?

265
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,940
No.

266
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,940
You can cheat others, but you can't cheat me.

267
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,940
You have the ring in your hand.

268
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,940
Sell it.

269
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,940
I can give you some money to get your whole family to go abroad.

270
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,940
I don't need your money.

271
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,940
Then what do you need?

272
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,940
Love?

273
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,940
You still believe in love?

274
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,940
I don't believe in love.

275
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,940
It's a young man's power.

276
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,940
I have to remind you that we're not young anymore.

277
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,940
We can't be willful anymore.

278
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,940
That's right.

279
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,940
I used to wear that diamond ring.

280
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,940
Because I have a dream.

281
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,940
I always loved the gentleman who gave me the diamond.

282
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,940
But not you, who's cold and heartless.

283
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,940
Who comes to me every time I go on a business trip?

284
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,940
Who doesn't dislike that I have a son?

285
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,940
Who said that they would divorce me and marry me?

286
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,940
But you just do what you want.

287
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,940
You!

288
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,940
What do you want to do for the past?

289
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,940
I want to do something for you.

290
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,940
No need.

291
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,940
As long as you don't recognize Yuxi,

292
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,940
I can bear the man leaving me.

293
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,940
But I can't accept my son leaving me.

294
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,940
Because that's all I have.

295
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,940
I'll give you some money.

296
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,940
You can bargain.

297
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,940
I'm not Gao Qi.

298
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,940
Money is not all I have in my life.

299
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,940
Do you know that?

300
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,940
Don't worry. My dream has long been awake.

301
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,940
I've sold that ring.

302
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,940
I can send my son abroad to study.

303
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,940
But you!

304
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,940
You have no right to blame my son.

305
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,940
Because you didn't raise him.

306
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,940
You didn't love him.

307
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,940
Ring is mine!

308
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,940
volverте promoting

309
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:02,180
с делом

310
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:11,180
This Milan!)?

311
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,940
It's from a friend.

312
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,940
This is his ecos account.

313
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,940
He wants to sell with me.

314
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,940
You know I like to collect treasure.

315
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,940
How much does he want?

316
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,940
He wants 600,000.

317
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,940
I said at most 400,000, there is still a chance.

318
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,940
No, don't ask for his price. I want it.

319
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:40,940
But you must not tell anyone that I am a buyer.

320
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,940
Ohhh.

321
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,940
Mom, this dress looks good?

322
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,940
It's pretty good, is it?

323
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,940
Yes, it's pretty good.

324
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,940
Youxi.

325
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,940
What?

326
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,940
You come and see how much it is.

327
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,940
Okay.

328
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,940
10,689.

329
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,940
Wow.

330
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,940
Over 10,000.

331
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,940
Ah.

332
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,940
One cent for each.

333
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,940
Son, do you like it?

334
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,940
Yes, sir.

335
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,940
Our suits are hand-designed by famous designers.

336
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,940
They came back from Milan.

337
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,940
Each one has only a few pieces.

338
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,940
Thank you.

339
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,940
You're welcome.

340
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,940
Do you like it?

341
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,940
It's okay.

342
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,940
Mom, I think we should stop.

343
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,940
I think we're more suitable for this kind of suit.

344
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:09,940
Yes, yes.

345
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,940
It's better to have some money.

346
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,940
Let's go.

347
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,940
If you like it, I'll buy it.

348
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,940
At worst, the card will be broken this month.

349
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,940
We can make up for it next month.

350
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,940
Here, take it.

351
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,940
Mom, I don't allow you to do something unrealistic for us.

352
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,940
Money is not spent like this.

353
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:29,940
If we really have money, we'll buy you the L'Anne-Belle ring.

354
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,940
Yes, yes.

355
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,940
I don't want to go to study abroad.

356
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,940
I just want to be with you.

357
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,940
When I get married, I'll also give my wife a good marriage certificate.

358
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,940
Let's go.

359
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,940
Good boy, good boy.

360
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,940
I'm going home.

361
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,940
I'm sorry.

362
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,940
It's okay.

363
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,940
Thank you.

364
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,940
Let's go upstairs to change our clothes.

365
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,940
Yes.

366
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,940
Okay.

367
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,940
Be careful.

368
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:06,940
Mr. Ye, can I get my L'Anne-Belle ring back at the original price?

369
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,940
Why?

370
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:11,940
Didn't you make money for your father's abroad?

371
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,940
My son doesn't want to leave me.

372
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,940
He won't go abroad.

373
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,940
Can you tell me who bought it?

374
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,940
I'll buy it at a high price.

375
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,940
Mengjie, you know the rules of the order, right?

376
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,940
We can't disclose the information to the outside world.

377
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:36,940
Besides, even if you know, I'm afraid you can't buy that ring back.

378
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,940
Why?

379
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,940
It's a foreign passenger.

380
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,940
I think your ring is already abroad.

381
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,940
Mr. Ye, you want to work here.

382
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:55,940
But do you know that the employees of our high-end fashion store have to have a college-level job?

383
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,940
I'm going to graduate from college soon.

384
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:04,940
Although I haven't got my graduation certificate yet, but I believe that the rules are dead.

385
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,940
People are alive.

386
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:12,940
Besides, the high-end fashion store doesn't want to hire a person who doesn't have the ability to communicate with the staff.

387
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,940
So I'm confident about this.

388
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,940
You're confident.

389
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,940
Confidence is a good thing.

390
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,940
But overconfidence is not a self-knowledge.

391
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,940
Then I'm a pretender or a real confident?

392
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,940
I'll know when I'm hired.

393
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,940
You just graduated this summer.

394
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,940
Why do you think I'll hire you?

395
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:36,940
If your mall is targeting customers aged 40 or 50, then I don't think I can get this job.

396
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:42,940
But if you're targeting customers aged 20 or 30, then I think I know the likes of young people.

397
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,940
Why do you think so much about our mall?

398
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,940
I think your style is fashionable and attractive.

399
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,940
If I can work here every day, my mood will be different.

400
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,940
You have a good taste.

401
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:02,940
We young people don't have much experience, but we'll work harder.

402
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,940
Then try it at work.

403
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,940
Okay, thank you.

404
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,940
Bye.

405
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,940
You're welcome. Bye.

406
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,940
Congratulations!

407
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,940
You're great.

408
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,940
You got the job you wanted.

409
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,940
Of course.

410
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,940
How can I get a job without this suit?

411
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,940
Although I'm only in the sixth grade, I'm satisfied.

412
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,940
Let's go, I'll treat you to dinner.

413
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,940
No, I'll treat you.

414
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,940
I'll have money anyway.

415
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,940
Son, don't be busy.

416
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,940
Here, have some tea.

417
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,940
Thank you, mom.

418
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,940
Why are you so good today?

419
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,940
Staying at home with mom, don't you have to go to the flower shop?

420
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,940
Mom, I'm going out with Wanjia.

421
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,940
So I have to get back to work.

422
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,940
I want to spend more time with mom.

423
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,940
I told you, it's all planned.

424
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,940
I can't keep this son when he grows up.

425
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,940
Look at you, I'm going out for a while.

426
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,940
Why are you so hard to deal with?

427
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,940
Don't be too jealous of me.

428
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,940
Go away.

429
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,940
When did you learn to talk to your brother?

430
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,940
He's a foster child, I'm a foster child, I'm running away from him.

431
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,940
Where can I go?

432
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,940
I can't run away from your nonsense.

433
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,940
Son, I want to ask you.

434
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,940
Do you like Wanjia very much?

435
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,940
Mom, don't you like Wanjia?

436
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,940
Of course I don't like him.

437
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,940
He didn't choose you before, Weiwei likes you.

438
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,940
You don't usually talk.

439
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,940
Mom doesn't know what you're thinking.

440
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,940
Who do you like?

441
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,940
Can you tell me?

442
00:27:54,940 --> 00:28:01,940
No matter who I choose, I will treat the other as my sister.

443
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,940
Are you stupid?

444
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,940
Then mom will tell you.

445
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,940
If you keep doing this, you won't get both feelings.

446
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:15,940
Women, if they don't treat you as their first choice, then it's not true love.

447
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,940
But Weiwei only loves you.

448
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,940
She loves you very purely.

449
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,940
And you don't care about mom's feelings.

450
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,940
Look, how many families have bad relationship?

451
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,940
If the daughter-in-law is bad, your mom will be so angry.

452
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,940
This can't happen to me.

453
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,940
If it really happens to me, then it's great.

454
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,940
Give me a great reason to break up.

455
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,940
Don't bother me again.

456
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,940
Son, when did you learn to coax your mom?

457
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:51,940
Mom, actually, I've been with Feifei and Youxi recently.

458
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,940
I was jealous.

459
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,940
I won't talk anymore. I'll go to the bathroom.

460
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,940
I'll go to the bathroom.

461
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,940
Mengjie.

462
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,940
Look, what is this?

463
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,940
Computer.

464
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,940
Why is there no display?

465
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,940
This is a scanning machine.

466
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,940
You can scan the old photos into the computer.

467
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,940
So you won't be afraid of the old photos.

468
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,940
I've heard from Youxi and others.

469
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,940
Actually, this is a gift from the mall.

470
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,940
Because I think you will have many beautiful photos.

471
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,940
So this is a gift for you.

472
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,940
Feifei, you're so sweet. I like you.

473
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,940
Then I'll scan the photos for Mengjie.

474
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,940
Okay.

475
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,940
Mengjie, why is only half of this photo?

476
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,940
That half is lost.

477
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,940
But there seems to be another person next to it.

478
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,940
That person is not important.

479
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,940
Not important?

480
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,940
Then where is he now?

481
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,940
He is dead.

482
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,940
He died a long time ago.

483
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,940
It's okay.

484
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,940
Then I'll scan this half.

485
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,940
Scan it.

486
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,940
What's wrong?

487
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,940
What are you not allowed to say at home?

488
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,940
Why did you leave me here?

489
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,940
Hello?

490
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,940
Why don't you talk?

491
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,940
Did someone bully you?

492
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,940
Let's be honest.

493
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,940
Why are you so sad?

494
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,940
I'm sorry.

495
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,940
I'm sorry.

496
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,940
I'm sorry.

497
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,940
Why are you so sad?

498
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,940
Are you in love?

499
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,940
I'm serious.

500
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,940
Say it.

501
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:00,940
Actually, I called you here today because I have something to tell you.

502
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,940
I hope you won't tell anyone after you hear it.

503
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,940
This is our secret.

504
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,940
So serious.

505
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,940
So serious.

506
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,940
Okay, tell me.

507
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,940
I will never tell anyone.

508
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,940
Actually, it's about my background.

509
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,940
Your background?

510
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,940
My mother raised me up.

511
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:34,940
My father left me before I was born.

512
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,940
When I was a kid, I didn't know what my father's name was and what he wanted.

513
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,940
I really wanted a father.

514
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,940
So that's what your background is.

515
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,940
You left your family too.

516
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,940
Why didn't you tell me?

517
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,940
I don't know how to tell anyone.

518
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,940
But recently, my father suddenly came back to me.

519
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,940
What?

520
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,940
You bastard!

521
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,940
I'm sorry.

522
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,940
I shouldn't have called your father a bastard.

523
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,940
You're right.

524
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,940
He's a bastard.

525
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,940
My mother raised me up with great difficulty.

526
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,940
Now I'm grown up, sensible, and don't need to be taken care of.

527
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,940
He came back to me.

528
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,940
What do you think he's not a bastard?

529
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,940
You're right.

530
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,940
I'm telling you, you shouldn't have accepted such irresponsible men.

531
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,940
But I have to face him now.

532
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,940
What should I do?

533
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,940
You should scold him.

534
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,940
He's sick.

535
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,940
But I don't know how to scold him.

536
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,940
Why don't you teach me?

537
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,940
I'll record it and practice it.

538
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,940
Come on, do it.

539
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,940
I'll do it.

540
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,940
Okay.

541
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,940
Listen, you abandoned my mother.

542
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,940
Now you're back to me.

543
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,940
I'm lucky to have you as my father.

544
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,940
Do you want to be a little more tough?

545
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,940
I'm not tough.

546
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,940
You're a bastard.

547
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:40,940
You're a beast.

548
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,940
You're a bastard.

549
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,940
I'm telling you, you're just an old weapon.

550
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:46,940
I don't want to borrow it for the rest of my life.

551
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,940
And you left me with a painful blow.

552
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,940
Why are you back now?

553
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:52,940
You're a married woman.

554
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,940
How is it?

555
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,940
Is it good enough?

556
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,940
Did you miss something?

557
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,940
Just a little.

558
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,940
What's the difference?

559
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,940
It's like this.

560
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,940
My father became a rich man after leaving my mother.

561
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,940
It's not easy for my mother to raise me.

562
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:20,940
So I want to ask her for some money to support my mother.

563
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,940
I'm so touched.

564
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,940
Don't worry.

565
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,940
I'll take care of it.

566
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,940
It's all in my hands.

567
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,940
Come on.

568
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,940
Listen to me.

569
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,940
Don't think my mother is over.

570
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,940
You should take responsibility.

571
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,940
I tell you, you need to compensate your family's health.

572
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,940
You have to compensate for my mother's mental damage.

573
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,940
And the cost of living in the future.

574
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,940
Now the price is so high.

575
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,940
It's not easy for my mother to raise me.

576
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,940
Do you know?

577
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,940
So, you have to take responsibility.

578
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,940
Can you do it?

579
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,940
I'll give you the time and place.

580
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,940
And then you can come to me with your money.

581
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,940
Uncle Wu, thank you for visiting my father.

582
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,940
Don't forget, he's not only your father, but also my good friend.

583
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,940
I should care about him.

584
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,940
By the way, what did the doctor say?

585
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,940
The doctor said he's much better now.

586
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,940
He's conscious now.

587
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,940
I'm a little lonely without your father.

588
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,940
There's a reporter.

589
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,940
Let's go.

590
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,940
Go.

591
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,940
These reporters have been waiting in the hospital for so many days.

592
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,940
They sent you to see my father.

593
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,940
I don't know what they will do.

594
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,940
Ou Yuting has been in the mall for so many years.

595
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,940
If she can't even stand this little rumor,

596
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,940
I'm afraid she's already fallen.

597
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,940
They can write whatever they want.

598
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:19,940
They just want to write that I sent my daughter to the hospital to cure your business.

599
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,940
I'm afraid she's already fallen.

600
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,940
They can write whatever they want.

601
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,940
I sent your daughter to the hospital to cure your business.

602
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:27,940
I sent my daughter to the hospital to cure your business.

603
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:35,940
They've already turned me into a monster who doesn't spit on people.

604
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:40,940
Do you want me to find someone to deal with?

605
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:42,940
No, you mustn't.

606
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,940
It's going to get worse.

607
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:49,940
I don't care about someone who's famous and in control of the world.

608
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,940
I'm sorry.

609
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,940
Uncle Wu is really a good man.

610
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,940
If I had been a mess,

611
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,940
I hope you can teach me more.

612
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:05,940
Yingdong, do you know why I came to help your company?

613
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,940
Because I'm Amber's boyfriend.

614
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,940
Don't you want to hurt her?

615
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,940
Wrong.

616
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,940
I'm because you're a talented man.

617
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,940
You're a good man.

618
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,940
You know how to retreat and know how to divide.

619
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:27,940
I'm missing a young talent like you.

620
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,940
Let me give you a word.

621
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,940
I want you to be as clear as me.

622
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,940
Business is business.

623
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,940
Love is love.

624
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,940
Don't drag Amber into this.

625
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:43,940
I won't look at you because of your relationship with Amber.

626
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,940
But if you're a loser,

627
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:50,940
I won't use you even if Amber likes you.

628
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:56,940
I will never do anything to lose my wife.

629
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,940
My life is a good thing.

630
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,940
I don't do anything to lose.

631
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,940
I'm a lazy man.

632
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,940
I'm not good enough.

633
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,940
I need to learn from you.

634
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,940
But after a while, you'll learn that

635
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,940
you and I are the same kind of people.

636
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:16,940
I hope our family's good will

637
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:20,940
won't make the reporters more evil.

638
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,940
The so-called light is the light.

639
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,940
When your father wakes up,

640
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:28,940
everything will be clear.

641
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,940
How long will it take?

642
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,940
Why are you so lazy?

643
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,940
You don't understand.

644
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,940
The more delicious things are,

645
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,940
the more lazy you are.

646
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,940
Sorry.

647
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,940
Someone is taking pictures of you.

648
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,940
It's okay.

649
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,940
It must be the secret agents.

650
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,940
They can only see me through the photos.

651
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,940
Don't mind them.

652
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,940
It's a price to pay for being a bad person.

653
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,940
I'm going to the bathroom.

654
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,940
I'll be back soon.

655
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,940
Wait for me.

656
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,940
Who are you?

657
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,940
Who sent you here?

658
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,940
What nonsense are you talking about?

659
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,940
You don't know me, do you?

660
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,940
So you're from the potato business.

661
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,940
Do you know me?

662
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,940
I'm a potato farmer.

663
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,940
You know my boss?

664
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,940
I only know him.

665
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,940
Do you know who I am?

666
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,940
I don't know.

667
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,940
You don't even know me.

668
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,940
And you're still a dog?

669
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,940
My boss used to be my friend.

670
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,940
Who are you?

671
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:34,940
I just want to tell you

672
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,940
that I hate it when people

673
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,940
disturb my private life.

674
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,940
My principle is

675
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,940
that I'm the only one who shoots others.

676
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,940
No one else shoots me.

677
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,940
Do you understand?

678
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,940
You're not afraid of my salary.

679
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,940
Why should I understand?

680
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,940
Your salaryman is here.

681
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,940
How are you doing with that old woman?

682
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:03,940
Funny.

683
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,940
You're so beautiful.

684
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,940
You call me old woman?

685
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:08,940
Don't forget

686
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,940
who helped you to be like this.

687
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,940
Why do you have the phone?

688
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,940
You want to steal my stuff?

689
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,940
You're far from it.

690
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,940
My job is to investigate

691
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,940
things that others can't.

692
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,940
How could you do this?

693
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:29,940
You're too much.

694
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,940
My phone.

695
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,940
The End

696
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,940
The End

697
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,940
The End

698
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,940
The End

699
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,940
The End

700
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,940
The End
