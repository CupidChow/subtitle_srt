1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You

7
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You

8
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You

9
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You

10
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm a graduate, but I want to be the president of the school.

11
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't know if I can help with the reconstruction of the library.

12
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The school wants to have a fundraising party for the reconstruction of the library.

13
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Besides fundraising, I want to give a chance to alumni like you, who have a successful career, to reconnect with each other.

14
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I don't know if you're interested in participating.

15
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Of course, of course. Since the principal thinks so, the alumni will do their best with me.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I have some relationships that can invite some brands to sponsor.

17
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Like clothes, red wine and watches are all things that young people like.

18
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Can you not want red wine?

19
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Of course, of course. I only provide options. The decision is all in the school.

20
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Okay, that's good.

21
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Look.

22
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yingdong.

23
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Fortunately, Brother Wu Yang is here. He is destined to be a man.

24
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So handsome.

25
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Come.

26
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yingdong is not at school. He is in the hall.

27
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Why is he at school? Is he going to follow me?

28
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
No. He is with Teacher Lan.

29
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Can you hear what he says?

30
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The princess is here.

31
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You are here again. You know how to please the princess.

32
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yingdong is here.

33
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Where is he?

34
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
He is in the hall. He is going to the parking lot.

35
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Don't panic.

36
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Be careful.

37
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes, sir.

38
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
This is Yingdong, the only son of King of the Snake.

39
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The only heir to the family is the top student of the University of Wuhan.

40
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
No one can replace him after three years of graduation.

41
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
All the girls want to be the golden bachelor.

42
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But it is said that he has a love that can't be broken.

43
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Amber.

44
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
No, no.

45
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The only daughter of the current little flower in Wuhan.

46
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The pretty and willful little princess.

47
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The life's rule is that everything should be the best.

48
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
He is the only one in his eyes.

49
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
He is the only one in his eyes.

50
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
He opened a second-hand store called Love Flying.

51
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
He sells his famous items.

52
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I didn't expect to see you at school.

53
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I heard you are a flying man now.

54
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I didn't expect to see you at school.

55
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I heard you don't go to class often.

56
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
A flying man who flies all over the world.

57
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
A legendary space man.

58
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
We can meet each other like this.

59
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
My dad is opening a new hotel in Thailand next week.

61
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Do you want to go to the festival with me?

62
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I don't think I have time.

63
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You have to take a vacation.

64
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Can you just play for a while?

65
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I went to Thailand last month.

66
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm tired of waiting.

67
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Then, Switzerland.

68
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
My dad is going to have a third-year celebration in Switzerland next week.

69
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I go to Switzerland to study every year from the age of five.

70
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That's great. Let's go together.

71
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But I don't like skiing anymore.

72
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
By the way, I heard you have a party on Saturday.

73
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Maybe I will have time that day.

74
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Is the party in Shanghai?

75
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Where are you?

76
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Our party is in Shanghai.

77
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You must come.

78
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yes.

79
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I will go.

80
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Go to the one in the middle.

81
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Buy the white one.

82
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Buy the one with water.

83
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I gave it to you.

84
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Really?

85
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You are so generous.

86
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So many new clothes.

87
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
These are all expired clothes.

88
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Expiry?

89
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Take as many as you like.

90
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You have never worn this dress.

91
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You just got the iPhone.

92
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's a waste.

93
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Expiry clothes are expired.

94
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
When will you see me wear the expired clothes?

95
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Xiao Qiao.

96
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
These clothes are all from Afea, right?

97
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And I have been doing my homework for you.

98
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You helped me sign the bag.

99
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
These clothes are for you.

100
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
All these are for me?

101
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Oh my god.

102
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Which one do you like?

103
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I like this pink bag.

104
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's for you.

105
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You should find out why you came to the school.

106
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Don't worry. I will complete the task.

107
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You are so mean.

108
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You came to me for my private life.

109
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Take off your dirty hands.

110
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You are so mean.

111
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What are you pretending?

112
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I am not a good person.

113
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I am telling you.

114
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Don't fall in love with me again.

115
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
One time is enough.

116
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I am afraid you can't bear the temptation to love me again.

117
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I can consider it.

118
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I have to make you sad before I get married.

119
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Otherwise, I will be so mad.

120
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Okay. When?

121
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The next day.

122
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I am serious.

123
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I came here today to...

124
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Stop asking.

125
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I know what you want to ask.

126
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I didn't even get the news that three buyers bought this for me at a high price.

127
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I will leave the vacation bag for you.

128
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I don't have any useful value.

129
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What you see now is the most popular super handsome guy, Hua Youxi.

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
He is handsome, handsome, talented, smart, and has no problem with the news.

131
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
He is the leader of the old school, Wu Yinghe, who has a difficult school.

132
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
He just wants to scare me.

133
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Don't hit me.

134
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I am sorry.

135
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I am sorry.

136
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I am sorry.

137
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I am sorry.

138
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You dress so well.

139
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You should wear it for me.

140
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
He is a beauty, although he is not a little painter.

141
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But he is the bright and cheerful Yuan Tianxin of BoHan University.

142
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
He is the leader of the Lala team, who is good at studying and studying.

143
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
He works at the bar called Baobao Bar at night to earn money.

144
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Open your little bean sprout and look carefully.

145
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
When am I not beautiful?

146
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I haven't seen you for so many days.

147
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You miss me?

148
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Come on.

149
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Say it.

150
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Who are you?

151
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I don't remember you.

152
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You are so sexy.

153
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Hello.

154
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's me.

155
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Are you off work?

156
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Not yet.

157
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What's up?

158
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I just finished class.

159
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Today is Friday.

160
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I want to ask you if you have time.

161
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Can you pick me up?

162
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Because it's hard to call today.

163
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I can't get through the V.A. phone.

164
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
No problem.

165
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Can you wait for me for 30 minutes?

166
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Okay. See you later.

167
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Look at the girl over there.

168
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
She is so beautiful.

169
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You don't know her?

170
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Wan Jia?

171
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
She is Wan Jia.

172
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Wan Jia, the art student.

173
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
No wonder you are so close to Amber.

174
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Who do you think is prettier in Amber?

175
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I think they are different.

176
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Amber is like the sky.

177
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Wan Jia is like the sky.

178
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
As you just heard, Wan Jia is a BoHan girl named Amber.

179
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Although she is from a normal family,

180
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
she is a talented student in the art department.

181
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
She is pure and natural.

182
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
If Amber is a high-class princess,

183
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Wan Jia is the one who can make the boys want to protect her.

184
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's Hui.

185
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What about you?

186
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I want both.

187
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I don't want to. I don't have a daughter.

188
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm here. Why don't you take a leave?

189
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Cheng Weiwei is known as Mr. Kang.

190
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
She is a famous girl in BoHan University.

191
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Although she looks good, she is a bit fake.

192
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But she is too good-natured.

193
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Everyone ignores her.

194
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The only place you can see her is her kitchen.

195
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
She is the chef of the five-star hotel.

196
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
This has given her friends a lot of blessings.

197
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Why are you here?

198
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Didn't you go to the airport to pick up your brother?

199
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I went to the airport to pick up my brother.

200
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But I came to pick you up after I picked up my brother.

201
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Are you hungry?

202
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'll cook for you.

203
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Okay. But...

204
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
But what?

205
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You called someone else when I was not here.

206
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Mr. Kang, you came to pick Wan Jia up too?

207
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Jiajia, choose one.

208
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Which one do you want?

209
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Mr. Kang or Brother Ding Yi?

210
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Which one do you want?

211
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
This is my brother, Han Ding Yi.

212
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
He looks like a good-natured man.

213
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
But he is a typical teacher.

214
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
He used to study in the same school as me for two years.

215
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Now he is studying and running a flower shop in the east.

216
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What? Why don't we believe each other?

217
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
This is a secret.

218
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Of course I'll choose you, Mr. Kang.

219
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
We grew up together.

220
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Can I choose anyone else?

221
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
See? This is a secret.

222
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Get in the car.

223
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You really want to get in the car?

224
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Brother Ding Yi, I'm sorry. I let you run around for nothing.

225
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Don't run around for nothing.

226
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Follow the escort behind us.

227
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
No problem. Be careful on the road.

228
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Let's go.

229
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Let's go.

230
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Weiwei, what are you doing?

231
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm browsing Luo Yi's Weibo.

232
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Here you are.

233
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Thank you.

234
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Your brother came to Shanghai to shoot an advertisement for Luo Yi, right?

235
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
How did you know?

236
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
The phone was on the light.

237
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
He said your brother had a rumor about Luo Yi.

238
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Does Luo Yi look good?

239
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Of course.

240
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Otherwise, how could he shoot an international advertisement?

241
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
My brother is a famous director.

242
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's normal for him to spread rumors about a project.

243
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Look at this photo.

244
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It was taken when your brother took me to the park when I was a kid.

245
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's been so many years.

246
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Has your brother changed?

247
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
He has.

248
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
He's gotten more handsome.

249
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Really?

250
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Let me ask you a question.

251
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Do you like my brother?

252
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Do you want me to like him?

253
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Of course I do.

254
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
If you're with my brother,

255
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
you're my future sister-in-law.

256
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Then we can be together forever.

257
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
By the way,

258
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
what kind of guy do you like?

259
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Me?

260
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I don't know.

261
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
How could you not know?

262
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You don't want to tell me?

263
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Really?

264
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I may not have met him yet.

265
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You took a picture secretly at the school today?

266
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Housekeeper?

267
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Let me see.

268
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Give it to me.

269
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What?

270
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Give me the money.

271
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
One hundred yuan.

272
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm your brother.

273
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You even took my money.

274
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
This picture is good from a sentimental perspective.

275
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's better than the one in the national team.

276
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You're worth a hundred yuan.

277
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
What about you?

278
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
What kind of guy do you like?

279
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I like...

280
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
handsome guys.

281
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
He's even more handsome.

282
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Let me show you a picture.

283
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Look.

284
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Him? Ying Dou?

285
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yes.

286
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
He's a third-rate.

287
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
All girls like him.

288
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Let me show you my brother.

289
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What?

290
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
He's very confident, right?

291
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I think he's handsome.

292
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Look.

293
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Look at his eyes.

294
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
He's very handsome, right?

295
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
He looks like you.

296
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Of course. We're brothers.

297
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
How about this?

298
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'll give you 20 yuan.

299
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You're fashionable.

300
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Give it to me.

301
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
No.

302
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
20 yuan is enough to buy you a meal.

303
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
How about this?

304
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You choose.

305
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You choose.

306
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Either you buy it back and collect it,

307
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
or I sell it on the internet.

308
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Everyone can share it.

309
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's all 100 yuan anyway.

310
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm not making money from anyone.

311
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
This is 100 yuan.

312
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Give me your phone.

313
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
100 yuan.

314
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Here you go.

315
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Your phone.

316
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Here you go.

317
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You must come to the A-Birds party.

318
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Wan Jia will come too.

319
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
New friends are here.

320
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Let's play a new game.

321
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Okay.

322
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Okay.

323
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
This game is called...

324
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Kiss game.

325
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Everyone on the court will be a number.

326
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
The two people who get the same number must kiss in public.

327
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And it's one minute.

328
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's exciting.

329
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Do you want to play so big?

330
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
No matter who it is,

331
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
as long as you get the same number,

332
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
you have to kiss.

333
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
One minute is too long.

334
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Twenty seconds is enough.

335
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
If you don't like it, five seconds is fine.

336
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
If you like it, five minutes is fine.

337
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Everyone, make your own judgment, okay?

338
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I don't believe you.

339
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I suggest you change your way of drawing.

340
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Why are you so busy?

341
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Why are you in such a hurry?

342
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Did I get it right?

343
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
We write the names of the boys on all the blue cards

344
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
and then the girls draw.

345
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
This will ensure that everything is right.

346
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What do you think?

347
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
No problem.

348
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Let's start.

349
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm nervous.

350
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Who will go first?

351
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You go first.

352
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Come on.

353
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'll go first.

354
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You go first.

355
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Come on.

356
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Look.

357
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Tell me who it is.

358
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
What's going on?

359
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Wait. Who is it?

360
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Where are you going?

361
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Zeng Yichao.

362
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Zeng Yichao.

363
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Huang Youxi.

364
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Huang Youxi.

365
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Huang Youxi.

366
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
What a coincidence.

367
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What a coincidence.

368
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What a coincidence.

369
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Huang Youxi.

370
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I said I wanted to draw a number.

371
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I had to draw a name.

372
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What do you think?

373
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It's my destiny.

374
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Come on.

375
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Come on.

376
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Seven.

377
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Seven.

378
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Seven.

379
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Seven.

380
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Seven.

381
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Seven.

382
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Seven.

383
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Who is it?

384
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Seven.

385
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's so good.

386
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Who is next?

387
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Don't just look at me.

388
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Meibao.

389
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's okay.

390
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Jiajia.

391
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Why?

392
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's not my turn.

393
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
He's going to jump.

394
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Meibao is coming.

395
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Meibao.

396
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Me?

397
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Who do you want to be with?

398
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Who do you want to be with?

399
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The answer is out.

400
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Victor.

401
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Come on, Mr. Xia.

402
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Come on.

403
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Meibao, are you going to join?

404
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Are you going to join?

405
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Yes.

406
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Okay.

407
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Ouyang Chao.

408
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I don't have a choice.

409
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Han Dingyi.

410
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Come on.

411
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Don't be so rude.

412
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Who is the answer?

413
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Answer.

414
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You're out.

415
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's so comfortable.

416
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Amber.

417
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Hi.

418
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Who is it?

419
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Kang Zirui.

420
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Kang Zirui from the TV series.

421
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's you.

422
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Come on.

423
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Let's play a game.

424
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
As long as you're happy.

425
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Hurry up.

426
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
That's right.

427
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Hurry up.

428
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Hurry up.

429
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Be careful.

430
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It's so difficult.

431
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Who is the next pair?

432
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Meibao.

433
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Who?

434
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Jiajia.

435
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Jiajia.

436
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It's your turn.

437
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Hurry up.

438
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You have no choice.

439
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Wang Zirui.

440
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Jiajia, you're so lucky.

441
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Hurry up.

442
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Hurry up.

443
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Jiajia, you're so lucky.

444
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Love is like this kiss game.

445
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
What you want is not what you have.

446
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Look, this evening,

447
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I made a joke with everyone.

448
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You woke up so early.

449
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I just came back from the West Bank.

450
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I can't help but run with you.

451
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You're as relaxed as a leader.

452
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I don't have to love you.

453
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You're the only family I have in this world.

454
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
One day you will grow up.

455
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You will have your own family when you grow up.

456
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
What do you want to say, dad?

457
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
How's that thing?

458
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Let you be responsible for that ad.

459
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It didn't go very well.

460
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I met some small problems.

461
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Wu Yuting's hotel refused to lend us the car.

462
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Said she was afraid of customers complaining.

463
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Son, remember.

464
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Business is in the hands of the people.

465
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
What makes you honest is the people.

466
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
What makes you bad is the people.

467
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Behind the rules is what people do.

468
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
So listen to my advice.

469
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Change the wheelchair.

470
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
This might be of great use.

471
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
What?

472
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I haven't returned to China yet.

473
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I already know your rumors.

474
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Think about it.

475
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Can Wu Yuting not see her daughter falling for you?

476
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
If she wants to help her,

477
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
how can she help her with the transfer?

478
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
How can you stand there?

479
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
How can a person who does big things

480
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
not be separated from the company?

481
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Who is not separated from the company?

482
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
The original plan of the ad was shot in Shanghai.

483
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
But now?

484
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You suddenly changed your shooting point.

485
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Do you have a selfish motive?

486
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Dad, I knew Luo Yi when I was in college.

487
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
He is now a single star.

488
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
What I value is the value he brings to the brand.

489
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Not what you think.

490
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
He is not the only star.

491
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You believe me.

492
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I have changed my mind.

493
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
After he is replaced,

494
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Wu Yuting's hotel and the venue

495
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
will be solved.

496
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Really.

497
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I will think about it.

498
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
There will be a solution.

499
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
What is the situation between you and Anbao?

500
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Is it developing?

501
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
The person I like is not him.

502
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Do you think I have a relationship problem with you?

503
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I am like Anbao's sister.

504
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I know.

505
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
But remember.

506
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
In the business world,

507
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
what is important is not the strategy,

508
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
but the balance of interests.

509
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Let's go.

510
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Go.

511
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Shanghai is beautiful.

512
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Miss Luo Yi.

513
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
There are some new clothes for you.

514
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I will send them to you later.

515
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I will leave you alone.

516
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Miss Luo Yi has arrived in Shanghai.

517
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I read the news.

518
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
She is in love with the advertising director Kang Zirui.

519
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Do you think Luo Yi is easy to catch?

520
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Hua Youxi.

521
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Do you have any news?

522
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I have no news.

523
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
My news is never free.

524
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
If you want to know, pay me.

525
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Why don't you have any business?

526
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
You only know gossip.

527
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Especially Hua Youxi.

528
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
How dare you sell gossip?

529
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
The teacher is in a bad mood.

530
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
The blind date failed.

531
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
She hasn't been to a blind date recently.

532
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Don't think about teacher Yang.

533
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
She is married.

534
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
In this year,

535
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
there is no end to love.

536
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
You can't understand the relationship now.

537
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Not all relationships can be let go.

538
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
You should focus on your study.

539
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
You are so ungrateful.

540
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Teacher Lang,

541
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
your love is not recovered yet.

542
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Don't do anything.

543
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
My son.

544
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Do you look like me?

545
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Let's go.

546
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
My son.

547
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
What's wrong with you?

548
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Kang Zirui.

549
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I sent you a message last night.

550
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
You have been downgrading.

551
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
You have been working for a long time.

552
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
You are not good at work.

553
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
You are not good at work.

554
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
You are not good at work.

555
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
You are not good at work.

556
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
What are you doing?

557
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
You are married.

558
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
You have a baby.

559
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You sent me this message.

560
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I just want to know

561
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
what she is thinking about.

562
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I will tell you.

563
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
You.

564
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Who?

565
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
You.

566
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Come on.

567
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Let's drink.

568
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I don't drink.

569
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Because Xiaoqin's husband

570
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
sells red wine.

571
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
You don't drink red wine?

572
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I don't drink.

573
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I tell you.

574
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
This wine is expensive.

575
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
You don't drink.

576
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I think Xiaoqin

577
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
still has me in her heart.

578
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Really.

579
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
But she may regret it now.

580
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
She is married.

581
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
She is not too embarrassed to say it.

582
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I saw the iron tree

583
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
we planted

584
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
on the balcony this morning.

585
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
It bloomed.

586
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
It's a sign of honor.

587
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Iron tree blooms?

588
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
She has a baby.

589
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
She is married.

590
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
You are so mean.

591
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Mr. Han.

592
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
As the saying goes,

593
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
the water is clear,

594
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
but the fish is not.

595
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
The sword is not.

596
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
You are just a step

597
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
after you see the point.

598
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Right?

599
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
My students work here

600
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
and they are taught like this.

601
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Eat.

602
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It's none of your business.

603
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yiding is here.

604
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Yiding.

605
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Mom, teacher.

606
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Son.

607
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Mom, I have something to tell you.

608
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I have something to tell you.

609
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Mom, look at this message.

610
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Help me see how to reply to her.

611
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Mom.

612
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Xiaoqin is going to Shanghai next month.

613
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Enough.

614
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Enough. I know.

615
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Do you want me to write

616
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
more tender, sweet,

617
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
or more cruel?

618
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Or more kind?

619
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Do you want me to write

620
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
more kind

621
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
that can make her want

622
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
to come back to me?

623
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Kind of.

624
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I...

625
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Write more.

626
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
You are in Shanghai.

627
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Did you see the Dragon King?

628
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Yes.

629
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
He arrived this afternoon.

630
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Are you free?

631
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I haven't seen you for a long time.

632
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Come out and sit down.

633
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I have to meet

634
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
the boss of the advertising

635
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
tomorrow.

636
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I don't want to be distracted.

637
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Then go to bed early.

638
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
It's hard for the boss

639
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
in Shanghai to handle.

640
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Good night.

641
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Good night.

642
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Do you like it?

643
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I didn't expect the boss to be me.

644
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Do you think

645
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I am a fat,

646
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
and bald old man?

647
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I finally know

648
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
that I am not the boss.

649
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I am the boss.

650
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Why did I go back to Shanghai

651
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
for this ad?

652
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Do you understand?

653
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
If I tell you,

654
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I have a feeling.

655
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Do you believe it?

656
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Amber,

657
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I called Hua Youxi.

658
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Hi.

659
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Your message is only

660
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
in the school, right?

661
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Wrong.

662
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
It's all over Shanghai.

663
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Can you find

664
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
any of my messages?

665
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Of course.

666
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Especially

667
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
the one for you.

668
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Sorry.

669
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
You'd better go to the store.

670
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I have never been interested

671
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
in people of different classes.

672
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Since you are so capable,

673
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
it should be easy to find out about Kang Zirui.

674
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Kang Zirui?

675
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
You can't change it?

676
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
A man who has been in love with the princess,

677
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
we can't do nothing about him.

678
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
You care about that Wen so much.

679
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
It's none of your business.

680
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I just want you to help me

681
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
check his work, his body,

682
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
his ability, his personality,

683
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
who he likes, who he likes,

684
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
even who he looks at.

685
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I want to know everything.

686
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
As long as it's about Kang Zirui,

687
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I'm willing to buy

688
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
whatever you want.

689
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
This is too much information.

690
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
There are many classmates in the school

691
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
who are waiting for me

692
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
to help them.

693
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
You can stop all these jobs.

694
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I'll make up for your loss.

695
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
How much do you want?

696
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Tell me.

697
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
50,000.

698
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
50,000?

699
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Okay.

700
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I'll ask Xiao Qiao to transfer the money to you.

701
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I...

702
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Okay, transfer the money.

703
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Let's start.

704
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I don't think I'll ever

705
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
meet anyone better than you

706
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
in my life.

707
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Then work hard.

708
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
If you have any problems,

709
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
just let me know.

710
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Just give me 10,000.

711
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Even if it's the critical moment

712
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
when you have to sell your body,

713
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I will not hesitate to stop

714
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
and think about you

715
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
until I die.

716
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
That's the least I can do.

717
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Do you want to sell your body

718
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
every day?

719
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I want to kill your sister.

720
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Shut up!

721
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Be clean!

722
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Why are you so narcissistic?

723
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Oh my god.

724
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
This kid is cute.

725
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
He doesn't hate people.

726
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
No wonder your first love

727
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
died in his hands.

728
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I...

729
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I decided to change

730
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
the location of the shooting.

731
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
With the passion and beauty

732
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
of jewelry,

733
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
we will change the location

734
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
to Bali Island.

735
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
We're in Bali again?

736
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I didn't expect

737
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
it to be this place.

738
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
What's the special reason

739
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
for Mr Ying Ying's decision

740
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
to go to Bali Island?

741
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
This is because

742
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I promised a goddess

743
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
in my college days.

744
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Is it Bali Island?

745
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Do you want to go there?

746
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I have a postcard

747
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
of Bali Island since I was a kid.

748
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I want to see the beautiful scenery there

749
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
and understand the story there.

750
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I'll find a chance

751
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
to take you there as a group.

752
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Why?

753
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I want to see you smile.

754
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
But the shooting is about to start.

755
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
You said you were changing the location so hastily.

756
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
The director has already

757
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
done a lot of work.

758
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Including the view and the shot.

759
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
You can change it as you like.

760
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Is that okay?

761
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Why not?

762
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I believe in your ability.

763
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Director,

764
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
this small change

765
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
won't be hard on you, right?

766
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Mr Ying Ying, don't worry.

767
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
This time I can go to Bali Island

768
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
to shoot,

769
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
it will also improve my career.

770
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
It won't be hard on me.

771
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
But I really should thank you

772
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
for your commitment

773
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
to the memories of college days.

774
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Thank you.

775
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Take him away!

776
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Take him away!

777
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
He's drunk!

778
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Go!

779
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
You can't be my girlfriend!

780
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
You can't be my girlfriend!

781
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You can't be my girlfriend!

00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000

You can't be my girlfriend!

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
You can't be my girlfriend!

787
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
You can't be my girlfriend!

788
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
You can't be my girlfriend!

789
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
You can't be my girlfriend!

790
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
You can't be my girlfriend!

791
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
You can't be my girlfriend!

792
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
You can't be my girlfriend!

793
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
You can't be my girlfriend!

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
You can't be my girlfriend!

795
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
You can't be my girlfriend!

796
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
You can't be my girlfriend!

797
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
You can't be my girlfriend!

798
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
You can't be my girlfriend!

799
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
You can't be my girlfriend!

800
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
You can't be my girlfriend!

801
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
He's drunk!

802
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Go!

803
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
You can't be my girlfriend!

804
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
You can't be my girlfriend!

805
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
He's drunk!

806
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Go!

807
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Go!

808
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Go!

809
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Let's go!

810
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Let's go!

811
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Let's go!

812
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Let's go shopping!

00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Let's go shopping!

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Let's go shopping!

00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Let's go shopping!

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Let's go shopping!

835
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Let's go shopping!

836
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Let's go shopping!

00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Let's go shopping!

838
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Let's go shopping!

839
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Let's go shopping!

840
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Let's go shopping!

841
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Let's go shopping!

842
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,200
Let's go shopping!

843
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:18,980
Let's go shopping!

844
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,980
Let's go shopping!

845
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,980
Let's go shopping!

846
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,980
Let's go shopping!

847
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,980
Let's go shopping!

848
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,980
Let's go shopping!

849
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,980
Let's go shopping!

850
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,980
Let's go shopping!

851
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,980
Let's go shopping!

852
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,980
I'm used to it since I saw your performance on screen.

853
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,180
It doesn't feel different.

854
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:37,680
I'm used to it since I saw your performance on screen.

855
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,180
Much better.

856
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,980
I can't believe you still remember.

857
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,480
I can't believe you still remember.

858
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,780
Inside of this room,

859
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,620
I will remember the simple and beautiful moments of happiness.

860
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,380
It will be much easier.

861
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,300
But some things have already passed.

862
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,020
Let them pass.

863
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,700
So,

864
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,620
you have a choice.

865
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,820
I'm still here.

866
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,420
Can you promise me one thing?

867
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,500
Sure.

868
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,100
Forget me.

869
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,340
Hello?

870
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,940
Come to Bali with me.

871
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,060
Go...

872
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,500
Go to Bali?

873
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,300
Why?

874
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,380
I want you to enjoy the sunshine.

875
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,740
You won't refuse the beach, right?

876
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,700
Yes.

877
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,020
You've been here for so many days.

878
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,420
I don't have time to spend with you.

879
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,020
How about we go to the local shopping mall tonight?

880
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,180
At 6.30,

881
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,220
I'm at the entrance of the wedding hall.

882
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,740
You're leaving so soon?

883
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,580
I slept well last night.

884
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,620
Come on, let's go.

885
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,100
Weiwei, where's your bag?

886
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,220
Can I get five? I have some coffee.

887
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,460
Oh no!

888
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,100
Oh no!

889
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,340
Where are you going?

890
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,300
Have you seen Blue Bag over there?

891
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,580
No. Sorry, sorry.

892
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,300
Bag. Blue Bag.

893
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,340
No, no, no.

894
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,740
Is it there?

895
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,620
Where did you put it?

896
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,340
I put it right here.

897
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,780
What's going on?

898
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,380
I can't find it.

899
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,460
Yuxi is back.

900
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,540
What about you?

901
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:24,020
Oh no! I can't find it.

902
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,620
Kang Weiwei, who the hell are you?

903
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,820
Wang Youxi,

904
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,340
I heard you and Luo Yi went to Bali to shoot an advertisement for India.

905
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,860
I heard you and Luo Yi went to Bali to shoot an advertisement for India.

906
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,860
Oh no, really?

907
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,580
What the hell are you talking about?

908
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,420
Why can you go?

909
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,980
My brother Amber and Weiwei went to Bali.

910
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,300
Why can't I go?

911
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,660
I can't go there on vacation.

912
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,420
Only you? Who believes that?

913
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,460
Why don't you bring me along?

914
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,260
You should have some good news.

915
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,380
Is Luo Yi really in love with India?

916
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,500
It doesn't matter.

917
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,900
I have a chance anyway.

918
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,620
What's going on?

919
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,260
Amber has taken over the throne?

920
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,580
With your IQ,

921
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,580
is my intelligence even worth the price?

922
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,100
Doors will always open!!

923
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:21,260
When they open, just pay attention!

924
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:50,800
lack of

925
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,400
You're really a fool.

926
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,960
What else do you have in mind?

927
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,440
What's wrong with you?

928
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,120
I don't need to teach you.

929
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,200
You've been living in the same village for so many years.

930
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,760
You haven't changed.

931
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,480
Even if you don't know me,

932
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,200
I might not know you.

933
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,200
What are you talking about?

934
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,360
According to the rules,

935
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,840
I'm already six or eight years older than you.

936
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,160
Really?

937
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,560
But it doesn't matter.

938
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,000
I'm more handsome than you.

939
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,160
I'm a professional.

940
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,960
You're the most vicious person in the family.

941
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,160
Vicious?

942
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,240
Xiao Jiu!

943
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,760
Hello, Xiao Jiu!

944
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,840
Tian Yi!

945
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,600
It's been a long time.

946
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,600
Where's your sister?

947
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,560
She's at the jewelry store.

948
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,840
She's doing a business in the morning.

949
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,800
She's busy.

950
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,600
Thank you.

951
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,560
Okay.

952
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:53,760
I'll get the luggage.

953
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,160
Okay.

954
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,160
You must be hungry.

955
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,240
Let's go eat something delicious.

956
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:56,720
I'll buy you food.

957
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,120
Okay.

958
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,960
What's the name of the food you want?

959
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,960
Whatever.

960
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,920
Xiao Jiu,

961
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,920
let's go eat.

962
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:04,480
Okay.

963
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,120
Let's go.

964
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,120
I'm still a virgin.

965
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,520
I wonder if he'll come to me

966
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,720
when he sees my ad.

967
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,000
No reason is needed.

968
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,600
Too many worries and worries

969
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,920
are irreplaceable.

970
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,360
I'll wait for you to be the best.

971
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,800
There won't be any excuses.

972
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,120
Whenever you're in need,

973
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,600
you can always be proud.

974
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,720
There won't be any excuses.

975
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,720
Whenever you're in need,

976
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,720
you can always be proud.

977
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,720
There won't be any excuses.

978
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,720
Whenever you're in need,

979
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,720
you can always be proud.

980
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,720
There won't be any excuses.

981
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,440
I'll stop laughing and walking forward.

982
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,520
I've been hurt before,

983
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,520
and I'm hurt again.

984
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:06,640
I'm sure you'll cry with me.

985
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,160
Let's shout together,

986
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,440
let's keep our mouth shut.

987
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,160
Let's stay on the streets of Suzhou.

988
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,560
We'll be the best.

989
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,640
There won't be any excuses.

990
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,840
Too many worries and worries

991
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,200
are irreplaceable.

992
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,720
We'll be the best.

993
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,080
There won't be any excuses.

994
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,280
Whenever you're in need,

995
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,880
you can always be proud.

996
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:53,280
There won't be any excuses.

997
00:44:53,440 --> 00:45:00,400
Let's be together forever.
