1
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,400
When will we learn any new knowledge?

2
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,840
hhhhhh

3
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:44,480
及

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Now the medical technology is so advanced.

5
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I believe that Sister Juan will be fine.

6
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You did everything for her.

7
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And you've been so worried about her health.

8
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
She sees all of this.

9
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I believe that even for you,

10
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Sister Juan will not give up easily.

11
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Do you know how much the success rate of this operation?

12
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What do you mean?

13
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Although I asked my sister for the best doctor,

14
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I still lied to her.

15
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The success rate of this operation is only 30%.

16
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I believe that God will not be so cruel.

17
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He will not let Sister Juan leave like this.

18
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I hope that what you said, he can get through this.

19
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
President Ou, the operation is over.

20
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Did it work?

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The operation was very successful.

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Although we still need to observe,

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
the doctor said that the tumor in Miss's brain was removed.

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's great. The operation was successful.

25
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Thank you.

26
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Today is the last day of your class.

27
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Congratulations on your graduation.

28
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I have a message for you.

29
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You were young.

30
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You are still young.

31
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But you will not be young.

32
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Hold on to your youth.

33
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Work hard.

34
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Enjoy your life.

35
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
As a teacher, I thank you for your cooperation.

36
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Let's go to the cinema later.

37
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Let's celebrate in the big city.

38
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
How about it?

39
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Okay.

40
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's up to you.

41
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Let's go.

42
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Congratulations on your graduation.

43
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Today is the last day of your class.

44
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Are you sure you can get your graduation certificate?

45
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Do you hate me?

46
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You two, let's go.

47
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Bye.

48
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Where is your car?

49
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I didn't drive today.

50
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Ou Hui asked me to take her to school.

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So I took her car.

52
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It seems that Ou Hui is really into Wei Wei.

53
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I didn't expect Wei Wei to be so manly.

54
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
She is so attractive.

55
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Do you want to see me?

56
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Don't worry.

57
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Let's decide what to say to each other.

58
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Hello.

59
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Why don't they tell each other they love each other?

60
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What are they doing?

61
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You don't know.

62
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
They are so shy.

63
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
They will not tell each other directly.

64
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
They are telling each other with their eyes.

65
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Do you see?

66
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What?

67
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
They are shy.

68
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Let's go.

69
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Ou Hui seems to be serious about Wei Wei.

70
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And she came to school to pick her up.

71
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Don't you think they are very loving?

72
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Let's go.

73
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Let's go.

74
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Bye.

75
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I miss you.

76
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Have you ever missed me?

77
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I have been thinking.

78
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The college is about to graduate.

79
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I will miss the college life.

80
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I don't want to leave everyone.

81
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
This big family includes Han Dingyi.

82
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Including everyone.

83
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Aren't you afraid of me being jealous?

84
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
How is Zhen's recovery?

85
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's good.

86
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
She will be discharged soon.

87
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Great.

88
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Don't worry.

89
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I will take you to the hospital to see my sister.

90
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But not today.

91
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Where are you going?

92
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You will know soon.

93
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Look, you waited so long.

94
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And the food is so expensive.

95
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
How much waste you wasted?

96
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Do you know that many people can't eat enough?

97
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Your sister told me that you were hungry.

98
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Do you know how shameful it is to waste food?

99
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You should cook.

100
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I know.

101
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
My sister and I didn't eat much when we were kids.

102
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Sometimes we were too hungry to walk.

103
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You ordered so many dishes.

104
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You are trying to make me feel guilty.

105
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Actually, my brother and I

106
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
had also been hungry.

107
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You are not as good as us.

108
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I remember once

109
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
we were so hungry that we had no money.

110
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So we ate a lot.

111
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Really?

112
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I also ate a lot.

113
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Are you full?

114
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I am so full.

115
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I will pay the bill.

116
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
We have so many dishes.

117
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Let's call the waitress.

118
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Waitress!

119
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Waitress!

120
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I didn't bring money.

121
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What?

122
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I forgot my wallet.

123
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I think it's in another suit.

124
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Did you bring money?

125
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You should have told me earlier.

126
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I didn't bring much money.

127
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I wouldn't have asked you to order such expensive dishes.

128
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I think there is only one way.

129
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What way?

130
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
We run away.

131
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What do you mean?

132
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I count to three, we run away.

133
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Whoever gets caught

134
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
will have to wash the dishes here.

135
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You want to eat eight-leaf-tree?

136
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
No, no, no.

137
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
One, two, three.

138
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
One, two, three.

139
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
One, two, three.

140
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Run! They are coming.

141
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
They won't come after us again, right?

142
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
They won't.

143
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
They won't.

144
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You were so fast.

145
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I almost stayed in the restaurant.

146
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Have you paid the bill?

147
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Did you pay the bill?

148
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I see.

149
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What bill?

150
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The bill of the restaurant.

151
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You are so annoying.

152
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
How can I get your money if you don't lie to me?

153
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I can't forget the lunch.

154
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I can't forget the lunch.

155
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You are in a good mood today.

156
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yes.

157
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Because you allowed me to hold your hand.

158
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I've always been curious about your story.

159
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Can you tell me?

160
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Which part?

161
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Everything you want to say.

162
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Go buy a book,

163
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
a weekly magazine.

164
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I want to hear

165
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
the part that is not in the magazine.

166
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You are the first one

167
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
to ask me this question.

168
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Then you don't have to tell me.

169
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Of course.

170
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I will tell you

171
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
everything you want to know.

172
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Tell me what you want to know the most.

173
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Let me ask you.

174
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
How many girlfriends have you had?

175
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You are so slow. What is your definition?

176
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What is your definition?

177
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Loving someone without any concern.

178
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Creating a future with someone.

179
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
If you define it like this,

180
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
there is no future.

181
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
How is that possible?

182
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
When I was very poor,

183
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
there was a girl who moved me.

184
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But because I couldn't give her a peaceful life,

185
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
she left.

186
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Later I made money.

187
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Many girls liked me.

188
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But I didn't know

189
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
if they liked me

190
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
or money.

191
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Have you walked out of this weird circle?

192
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Now I

193
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
have everything I want.

194
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I can get everything I want.

195
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But I can't get

196
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
the heart I want.

197
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Do you know

198
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
how many people want to be my girlfriend?

199
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But I have never been opened to anyone.

200
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Only one person.

201
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That is you.

202
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Only you can make me

203
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
change myself for you.

204
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Actually, I want it very simple.

205
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I only have two wishes.

206
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
The first wish is

207
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
never let me and my sister

208
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
starve.

209
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Your first wish has come true.

210
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What about your second wish?

211
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The second wish is

212
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
to be with you

213
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
in the future.

214
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Your past is not me,

215
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
but I hope

216
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
that you will be with me in the future.

217
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I have too little thoughts.

218
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I struggle.

219
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm afraid

220
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
that my feelings will be broken.

221
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
How about you?

222
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Woman,

223
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
just you and me.

224
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Why don't we go anywhere

225
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
and maybe

226
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
happiness is there.

227
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,680
In your eyes,

228
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,680
I have been caught by someone,

229
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,680
who loves me so much,

230
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,400
but not you.

231
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,040
All of this,

232
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
i have supported one another.

233
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,040
But just nothing.

234
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,040
True and false.

235
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,040
I came in with a lot of thoughts,

236
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,040
but without you.

237
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,740
Why can't we be the best?

238
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,740
I can't understand

239
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,740
why you can be like this.

240
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,740
Mr. Han?

241
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
When did he come?

242
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You mean the person who bought the flower shop?

243
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
He has something to do today, so he decided not to come.

244
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I can take you to sign the contract.

245
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Chen Jiao Jing'e will transfer the money in 48 hours after signing.

246
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Then let's sign another day.

247
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
No, no, no.

248
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
He means to ask me to sign the contract today.

249
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Tell Ou Hui

250
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
that he won't sign in front of me.

251
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Mr. Han, you have guessed it.

252
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Who else would buy this restaurant except him?

253
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Call him.

254
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
If he is nearby, let him see me.

255
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Okay.

256
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Sorry.

257
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I didn't do what I promised.

258
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You are not allowed to sign the contract until you see me.

259
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I was right.

260
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You are really nearby.

261
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I wanted to see this restaurant after you sign the contract.

262
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
To feel its charm.

263
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Is Weiwei with you?

264
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Where is she?

265
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
She doesn't know I'm here.

266
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Sit down.

267
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm here.

268
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Sit down.

269
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
We can talk face to face.

270
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
The contract is here.

271
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You can sign it.

272
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I haven't said I would sell the restaurant to you.

273
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Tell me why you bought this restaurant.

274
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Do you really want to know the reason why I bought it?

275
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yes.

276
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Because of Kang Weiwei.

277
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
She has always liked this place.

278
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So I have to keep this restaurant for her.

279
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I know it.

280
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Kang Weiwei promised to work for me.

281
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Just for this restaurant.

282
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I know the meaning of this restaurant.

283
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Are you satisfied with this answer?

284
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I don't like this restaurant.

285
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So you know it's because of you.

286
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
That's why you put all your energy into this restaurant.

287
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I don't want to be like this because of you.

288
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
But I want to make her efforts go to waste.

289
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Are you serious about this?

290
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Never.

291
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I've never been serious.

292
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Now you can sign the contract.

293
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I want to think about it.

294
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Why?

295
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Because you said this restaurant is very important to her.

296
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I can't sell this restaurant to someone who wants to buy love.

297
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Do you think Kang Weiwei will be with me because of Qian?

298
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It's useless to be in front of love.

299
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
At least now you are very important to Weiwei.

300
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What do you want to say?

301
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
To be fair, can I send a message with your phone?

302
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I want to tell Weiwei that I'm very happy.

303
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm very happy.

304
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I love you, Weiwei.

305
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I love you too.

306
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I love you too.

307
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'll always love you.

308
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I will.

309
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm very happy.

310
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm very happy.

311
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I love you.

312
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I love you.

313
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I love you.

314
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I love you.

315
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,980
I must deal with him whatever his choice is

316
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,800
I've already taken care of the transfer of We Love.

317
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,800
I'm now preparing for the transfer.

318
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,000
I don't know if you'd like to be our last guest.

319
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,300
If you would like,

320
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,200
I'd like to invite you to dinner tonight.

321
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,100
I'll prepare a delicious dinner.

322
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,800
Thank you for your help and contribution.

323
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,120
Hooray!

324
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,040
G 결 nellOT

F

327
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,260
hi

328
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,840
You're here alone

329
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,680
Why don't you answer my call?

330
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,000
Youampa

331
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,280
I'm so worried

332
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,280
Imagine what happened

333
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,860
D

334
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,460
let's go

335
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,460
Let's go home.

336
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,860
You really came.

337
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,060
I couldn't find the vase.

338
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,540
This is for you.

339
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,420
Why?

340
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,020
I haven't cooked for years.

341
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,100
You like to cook.

342
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,900
Do you like it?

343
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,220
Okay?

344
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,820
Sit.

345
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,660
Eat first. I'm hungry.

346
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,260
Why are you here?

347
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,620
Because I bought this restaurant.

348
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,940
How could it be?

349
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,020
Then why did Ding Yi ask me to come here?

350
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,180
I'm really hungry.

351
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,500
Can you finish this meal and talk about other things?

352
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,700
I'm sorry.

353
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,620
I'm not in a good mood.

354
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,980
Let's eat first.

355
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,460
I'm sorry.

356
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,540
Did you say something to Han Ding Yi?

357
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,820
Do you know that you'll hurt him if you buy Villa?

358
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,980
Why did you buy this restaurant?

359
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,900
Why did I buy it?

360
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,180
This restaurant is useless to me.

361
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,180
It can't bring me real benefits.

362
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,900
But I know you like this restaurant.

363
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,900
You'll be sad if someone else buys it.

364
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,900
I just want you to be happy.

365
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,500
I'm sorry.

366
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,300
I don't know why you care about me so much.

367
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,100
I really envy you.

368
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,700
No matter what happens,

369
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,100
you always think about how he feels.

370
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,020
You and his father came here for him.

371
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,420
He should be waiting for you on the street opposite.

372
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,620
But I really don't understand.

373
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,340
If I were him,

374
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,940
I would stop you from coming to see me.

375
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,620
I'm sorry.

376
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,140
I thought I would handle it well.

377
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,140
But I didn't expect I would handle it so badly.

378
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,140
All right.

379
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,140
I don't want you to be sad because of me.

380
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,140
I've always been grateful to you for my sister.

381
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,660
I won't force you to accept me.

382
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,660
I will accept your choice.

383
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,660
If you still love her,

384
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,660
I will help you.

385
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,660
Please help yourself.

386
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,660
Thank you.

387
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,660
Wanjia lives next to you.

388
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,660
She often takes care of you.

389
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,660
Today I have the opportunity to see you.

390
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,660
Thank you.

391
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,660
You're welcome.

392
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,660
Wanjia and I are good friends.

393
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,660
She is a good girl.

394
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,660
Dingyi and his brothers are very filial.

395
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,660
My sons have been doing things I didn't allow them to do since childhood.

396
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,660
They will never do it.

397
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,660
Really?

398
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,660
Yes.

399
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,660
I really appreciate you.

400
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,660
You allow Dingyi to study with Wanjia in America.

401
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,660
You're welcome.

402
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,660
We want to talk about their trip abroad.

403
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:54,660
So we invited Mengjie to come out and plan for them.

404
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,180
You came prepared.

405
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,180
You can say it directly.

406
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:03,180
Look, we have only one daughter.

407
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,180
She and Dingyi have always been close.

408
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,180
But they are young people.

409
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:13,180
They will live in the same house in America.

410
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:17,180
It's not good to live together.

411
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:23,180
We want to get them married before they go abroad.

412
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,700
Dad, what do you mean?

413
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,700
Dingyi and I are good friends.

414
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,700
I know it.

415
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,700
Jiajia, we want to get you married legally.

416
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:43,700
Actually, we want to get married before they go abroad.

417
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,700
Auntie, it's a big deal.

418
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,220
I just graduated.

419
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,220
Yes, she is still in the business.

420
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,220
Now it's too early to get married.

421
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:05,220
Wanjia's father and I got married without any problems.

422
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:11,220
As long as we get married, the relationship will be stronger.

423
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,220
Yes, we have nothing to ask for.

424
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:18,220
We just want to make a promise to Jiajia.

425
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,740
Dad.

426
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,740
Brother, did Wanjia have a baby?

427
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,740
Don't talk nonsense.

428
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,740
Of course not.

429
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,740
Then it's okay.

430
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,740
Who knows what will happen in this age?

431
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,740
Don't worry about your elders.

432
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,740
Let's eat.

433
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,740
I'm hungry.

434
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,740
Are you angry?

435
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,740
Dingyi should say it, but he doesn't.

436
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,740
Youxi shouldn't say it, but he's talking nonsense.

437
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,740
Your two sons are already stars.

438
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,740
Don't you ask what's going on at the table?

439
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,740
They should be separated without a fight.

440
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,740
They didn't even eat the dessert.

441
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,740
Getting married is a good thing.

442
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,740
If a man has already set the relationship, he can work hard.

443
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,260
Dingyi is a responsible man.

444
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,260
Besides, he has liked Wanjia for so long.

445
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,260
If he can do it, it's a good thing.

446
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:32,260
He went abroad, ended up in a flower shop, and got married.

447
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,260
But Dingyi still can't let Weiwei go.

448
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,260
Is it Dingyi or you who can't let Weiwei go?

449
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,260
I'm just not sure.

450
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:46,780
You're not sure because you're afraid that Dingyi and Wanjia will get married.

451
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,780
Weiwei and Ou Hui will be fine, right?

452
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,780
I have nothing to say on the terms of Ou Hui.

453
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,780
But I'm afraid my son will regret it.

454
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,780
Have you ever heard of this saying?

455
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,780
Every man has two women like this.

456
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,780
At least two.

457
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,300
The red rose is a long time ago.

458
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:15,300
The red rose has become a pair of shoes with a pattern on the wall.

459
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,300
The white rose is still bright in front of the bed.

460
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:27,300
The white rose is a white color on the clothes.

461
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:33,300
The red rose is a red color on the heart.

462
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,300
Who said that?

463
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,820
Who said that?

464
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,820
Zhang Hailin.

465
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,820
These books are yours.

466
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,820
Keep them.

467
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,820
Okay.

468
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,820
I don't know if I keep them or not.

469
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,580
There are so many things that we put in the

470
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,580
little things.

471
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,580
More than the whole house.

472
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,580
How much do you want to keep?

473
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,580
I don't know.

474
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,580
I don't know.

475
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,580
I don't know.

476
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,580
I don't know.

477
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,580
I don't know.

478
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,580
I don't know.

479
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,580
Today is the last day.

480
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,580
Tomorrow the agent will come to collect the house.

481
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,580
Weiwei, actually,

482
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,580
you can keep all these things here.

483
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,580
Anyway, Ou Hui bought this restaurant for you.

484
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,580
Of course not.

485
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,580
He doesn't know the meaning of these things to us.

486
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,580
And he has no feelings for this place.

487
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,580
It's different.

488
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,860
Yes.

489
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,860
No one can replace our memories here.

490
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:11,860
Actually, no one wants to say goodbye to Wei.

491
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,860
So we have to take care of the packing.

492
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,860
We can't take it off until the last day.

493
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,860
Now we have to take it off.

494
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,860
But it's good.

495
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,860
Ding Yi can put the glass down completely.

496
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,860
Have you decided about your trip to America?

497
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,860
Weiwei, actually,

498
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,860
there is one thing

499
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,860
I want to tell you personally.

500
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,860
What?

501
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,860
Ding Yi and I are considering to get married.

502
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,860
That's great.

503
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,140
But...

504
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,140
Why are you hesitating?

505
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,140
Hurry up.

506
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,140
Have you decided on the date?

507
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,140
Didn't I say

508
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,140
I want to wait until you get married

509
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,140
and find the one who can be with you for the rest of your life.

510
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,140
Then I will get married.

511
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,140
So...

512
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,140
I will wait for you.

513
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,140
Silly girl.

514
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,140
I have found the one.

515
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,140
So you can be with Ding Yi.

516
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,140
If you keep hesitating,

517
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,140
I will be in front of you.

518
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,140
Is that person you are talking about?

519
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,140
So you two are really together now?

520
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,140
You told me before that

521
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,140
Ou Hui has a strange temper.

522
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,140
So that person

523
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,420
can't be your real son.

524
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,420
Ou Hui is really nice to me.

525
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,420
You really like him?

526
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,420
What else?

527
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,420
Answer me honestly.

528
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,420
Tell me, do you really like him?

529
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,700
Yes.

530
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,700
Really.

531
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,700
That's good.

532
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,700
He is a little strange.

533
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,700
But I think he will change for you.

534
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,700
Ou Hui and I have no parents since childhood.

535
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,700
We have only one sister.

536
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,700
I have only one brother.

537
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,700
So we can understand each other.

538
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,700
So don't think too much.

539
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,700
Then you will marry a rich man.

540
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,700
I will clean up over there.

541
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,700
I will clean up over there.

542
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,700
I will clean up over there.

543
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,700
Good.

544
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,700
Good.

545
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,700
Good.

546
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,700
Mom.

547
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,700
Wan's mom called me.

548
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,980
She said that this month, 8th and 12th,

549
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,980
is the good day to get married.

550
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,980
She asked me to go to the hospital with my mom.

551
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,980
Let them worry about these things.

552
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,980
Your mom and I are old.

553
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,980
We are confused.

554
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,980
Can we only help you?

555
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,980
Son, you look like this.

556
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,980
You didn't think about getting married.

557
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,980
Or didn't think about marrying someone else?

558
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,980
Mom, you asked very carefully.

559
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,980
I have made a decision.

560
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,980
Ou Hui appeared.

561
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,980
That's why you decided to do this.

562
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,980
What else can I do?

563
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,980
Ou Hui appeared.

564
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,980
And did so much for Weiwei.

565
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,980
I don't know how happy Weiwei is now.

566
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,980
How happy.

567
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,980
Brother, is Weiwei really happy and happy?

568
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:39,980
Or do you think she is happy and happy?

569
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,980
Or do you think she is not being blamed?

570
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,980
Have you ever thought about this?

571
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,260
No matter what,

572
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,260
I think it's harder than before after making a decision.

573
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,260
Mom,

574
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,260
what will happen to marriage?

575
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,260
Who said that there will be no problem after marriage?

576
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,260
I have never married your mom.

577
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,260
I have to ask you about the feeling of marriage.

578
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:12,260
Yes, I didn't expect my son and mom to get married first.

579
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,540
Brother, are you really going to America?

580
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:39,600
Why are you going to the

581
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,600
foreign country?

582
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,600
The reporter was called Ye-

583
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,600
Ye Feifei?

584
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,600
Yes. Ye Feifei.

585
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,600
She showed me this video.

586
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,600
I didn't expect that you would invite me out.

587
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,600
At least it wasn't so fast.

588
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,600
Uncle.

589
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
Are you always this way with others?

590
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,600
Did I say anything wrong?

591
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,600
I'm here to ask you for a favor.

592
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,600
What do you want me to do for you?

593
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,600
I know that you have already worked with Ou Hui.

594
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,600
I'm here to help you.

595
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,600
I'm here to help you.

596
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,600
I'm here to help you.

597
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,600
You have already worked with Ou Hui.

598
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,600
His restaurant will open in nearly a hundred restaurants.

599
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,600
You have very good information.

600
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,600
I always have good information.

601
00:37:53,600 --> 00:38:00,600
Actually, I want you to give up the stock and business rights of two restaurants in Shanghai.

602
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,600
You have a big mouth.

603
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,600
Why?

604
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,600
You want to eat like a big fat man?

605
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,600
Not for me.

606
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,600
Give me a Han Dingyi.

607
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,600
Han Dingyi?

608
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,600
Why should I help someone who has nothing to do with me?

609
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,600
Did you help someone who has something to do with you?

610
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:47,600
If it wasn't for my brother Han Dingyi, my mother wouldn't have been able to survive.

611
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:54,600
Although my brother is two years older than me, he is the pillar of the family.

612
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,600
He helped my mother to raise me.

613
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,600
He took care of us.

614
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,600
He even went to work for a year.

615
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,600
This family has no husband and no father.

616
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,600
He takes care of us like a husband and a father.

617
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,600
He has taken the responsibility that you should take.

618
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,600
He will face the time you escape.

619
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,600
He is taking care of the people you abandoned.

620
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,600
Do you think he has nothing to do with you?

621
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,600
I have no father since I was a child.

622
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,600
So I can't understand the people.

623
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,600
But my brother has always taken care of me as his responsibility.

624
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,600
I hope he can be happy.

625
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,600
Give me some time to think about it.

626
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:10,600
Uncle Wu, this is my first and last time to beg you.

627
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,600
I really hope my brother can have this job and stay in Shanghai.

628
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,600
My brother is a very capable person.

629
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:26,600
If someone helps him, he will do well.

630
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,600
I'll wait for your news.

631
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,600
Wait a minute.

632
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,600
What about yourself?

633
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,600
What are you going to do after graduation?

634
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,600
I'm smarter than my brother.

635
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,600
With my brain, I can do anything.

636
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,600
I'm sorry.

637
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,600
I'm ready.

638
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,600
I have the same disease as my sister.

639
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,600
You have the same disease as your sister.

640
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,600
Family genetic brain tumor.

641
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,600
But you are a little later than her.

642
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,600
She has just been examined.

643
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,600
Doctor, please help me.

644
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,600
I don't want anyone to know about this.

645
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,600
Don't cry.

646
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:21,600
Actually, the treatment I gave you is the same as your sister.

647
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,600
There is no other better way.

648
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,600
We are going to the end.

649
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,600
No need for any reason.

650
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,600
Too many differences.

651
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,600
That's what I can't wait for.

652
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,600
We are going to the end.

653
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,600
There will be no excuses.

654
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,600
Every time you want to,

655
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,600
you can stay in heaven.

656
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,600
There is no need to say a word.

657
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:26,600
You will not hesitate to reach out.

658
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:33,600
You will not hesitate to reach out.

659
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:40,600
You will not hesitate to reach out.

660
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:46,600
You will not hesitate to reach out.

661
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:52,600
You will not hesitate to reach out.

662
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:59,600
You will not hesitate to reach out.

663
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:06,600
You will not hesitate to reach out.

664
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,600
We are going to the end.

665
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,600
No need for any reason.

666
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,600
Too many differences.

667
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,600
That's what I can't wait for.

668
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,600
We are going to the end.

669
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,600
There will be no excuses.

670
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,600
Every time you want to,

671
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,600
you can stay in heaven.

672
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,600
There will be no excuses.

673
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,600
We are going to the end.

674
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,600
There will be no excuses.

675
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,600
Every time you want to,

676
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,600
you can stay in heaven.

677
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,600
There will be no excuses.

678
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,600
In our era,

679
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,600
we will be together.

680
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,600
The End
