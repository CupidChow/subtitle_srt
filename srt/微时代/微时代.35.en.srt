00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,280
RE unconditional love

2
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,480
Drive.

3
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,840
cracks you.

4
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,600
you all sit.

5
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,240
sit.

6
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,080
Great.

7
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,880
Really good.

8
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,160
Exactly.

9
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,360
I didn't think you and him

10
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,360
so good development.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Uncle, aunt, uncle, uncle Fu, we are family, don't be polite.

12
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Because I've been sick and can't drink, I'll drink with water today.

13
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Juan, seeing you so healthy, we feel at ease.

14
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I didn't expect you to take care of us like this after so many years.

15
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Uncle, I've been sick for a long time.

16
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Sometimes I'm happier than being with my family.

17
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We saw Xiaohui in many magazines and news.

18
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Xiaohui is getting more and more handsome.

19
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Have you found a girlfriend?

20
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Miss Kang is his girlfriend.

21
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So beautiful, very good.

22
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Uncle, aunt, we are not in a good mood because of work today.

23
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Don't mind.

24
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It doesn't matter, we don't know the temperament of Huai.

25
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
He has been like this since childhood.

26
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It seems that Xiaohui still remembers the past.

27
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Everyone was poor before, and couldn't care less about themselves.

28
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I was so poor that I couldn't help others.

29
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I had no choice.

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Juan, you are so tolerant.

31
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I helped your mother for a year or two, but I couldn't help it.

32
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Actually, I always had a dream that our whole family could get together and have a reunion dinner.

33
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Today I want to thank you for making me have such a dream.

34
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Your mother is very kind, she will comfort you.

35
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Today we are so happy, let's take care of our family.

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Okay, okay.

37
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I haven't seen you for a long time.

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I haven't seen you for a long time.

39
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Sister, don't be angry.

40
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let's go over there.

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Okay, okay.

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Don't move, let's get up.

43
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Let's all come over here.

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Okay.

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Come on, give me the paper, I'll give you the paper.

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Huihui, come on, let's take a picture together.

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You let Auntie Zhou take a picture, you come over and take a picture with me.

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Auntie Zhou.

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Thank you.

50
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Let's take a picture together.

51
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay, okay.

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Come on, everyone, look at the building.

53
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
One, two, three, eggplant.

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The house is ruined.

55
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
My house is ruined.

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
My house is ruined.

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What are you doing?

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Why are you in such a hurry to clean up?

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I don't know.

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I don't know what to do.

61
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You're done, I'll clean it up.

62
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'll clean it up.

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You're done, I'll clean it up.

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'll clean it up.

65
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'll clean it up.

66
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'll clean it up.

67
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The things bought with money will never last long.

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The things rented with money will never last long.

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Because that's not what people want.

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Did Kang Wei Wei tell you everything?

72
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
How could she do that?

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
No. She didn't tell me anything.

74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
How did you know?

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I can tell, okay?

76
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
No matter how Wei Wei treats you, or how she looks at you,

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
you can tell that she doesn't love you.

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I didn't expose you because I know that you're sick and want to make her happy.

79
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So how could I let you down?

80
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I've been acting for so long like a fool.

81
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Do you think it's fun?

82
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
There's a reason why she would do that.

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Although she's your girlfriend,

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I think she's very suitable for you.

85
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So I want to give you more chances to get to know each other.

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Maybe you'll fall in love.

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Do you really want us to be together?

88
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
How is that possible? Stop joking.

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You're a big sister.

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I know what you're thinking.

91
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You love her, but you pretend not to care.

92
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Crazy! How could I love her?

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Although you invited Wei Wei here because she's sick,

94
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
you should know that when she leaves,

95
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
it's also when Wei Wei leaves.

96
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Sister?

97
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Although I can't see your eyes,

98
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I know that you're not in love.

99
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
O'Hay, I have a suggestion.

100
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Since you love her, you should confess to her.

101
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Otherwise, Wei Wei will regret leaving you.

102
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
There's only one medicine in the world that you can't buy.

103
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's regret medicine.

104
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Sister...

105
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You're really not that pretty to be honest.

106
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Wei Wei.

107
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Insdogina.

108
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Be ready to get in on the third floor.

109
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Wait.

110
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But what if she's the same person as the man in the universe?

111
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm not a star.

112
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm cheaper than my friends.

113
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
If my auntie were a rent-a-dress girlfriend,

114
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
she would have to pay 50,000.

115
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What? 50,000?

116
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yes.

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Come on, let's go.

118
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Rent-a-dress boyfriend.

119
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Mr. Zeng,

120
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
why don't you be a rent-a-dress girlfriend?

121
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Tell me what you want.

122
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
All kinds of characters are available.

123
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Of course,

124
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
you don't have to worry about the money.

125
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We'll help you.

126
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
This is good.

127
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's a good image.

128
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Lu Xi, look.

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What's wrong with you?

130
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

131
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Why am I on it?

132
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
A Xi, 500, 88, a day.

133
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Why are you so low-key for a rent-a-dress boyfriend?

134
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Hello.

135
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What are you doing?

136
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I should ask you this question.

137
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What do you mean?

138
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Why did you put my photo on the Internet?

139
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
How can you get it?

140
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Is it interesting?

141
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You mean the photo of 500, 88, a day?

142
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Ouyang Qiao sent it.

143
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You're the only one who has this photo.

144
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You gave it to me in person.

145
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I sent it to Ouyang Qiao before.

146
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Okay?

147
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm sorry.

148
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Why do I think

150
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
there's a photo of us in the box?

151
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What a stupid photo!

152
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I threw it away long ago.

153
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Ouyang, did you eat medicine today?

154
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And you came here to mess with me.

155
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
My mom told me

156
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
that you went to Wu Ting's office with her.

157
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You didn't tell anyone

158
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
about what you heard.

159
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You didn't hear anything.

160
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You must tell her.

161
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I told you I didn't hear anything.

162
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What should I tell her?

163
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Are you crazy?

164
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Let go.

165
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Don't go abroad.

166
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You only have Gao Fushuai in your eyes.

167
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'll give you anything you want.

168
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'll give you anything you want.

169
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Ouyang Xi,

170
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
don't you think it's funny?

171
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You didn't choose me

172
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
when you were an ordinary person.

173
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Now you've changed your identity.

174
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You'll have more chances to spend your money in the future.

175
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Okay.

176
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Let's make it clear today.

177
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm going abroad

178
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
to meet my new life.

179
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I don't want to bring

180
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
the bad things you gave me.

181
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The past,

182
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
including this photo,

183
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
are all the farewell gifts I gave you.

184
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
From now on,

185
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
you and I

186
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
have nothing to do with each other.

187
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm going abroad

188
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
to meet my new life.

189
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm going abroad

190
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
to meet my new life.

191
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm going abroad

192
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
to meet my new life.

193
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm going abroad

194
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
to meet my new life.

195
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm going abroad

196
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
to meet my new life.

197
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm going abroad

198
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
to meet my new life.

199
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm going abroad

200
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
to meet my new life.

201
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm going abroad

202
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
to meet my new life.

203
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm going abroad

204
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
to meet my new life.

205
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm going abroad

206
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
to meet my new life.

207
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm going abroad

208
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
to meet my new life.

209
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
From now on,

210
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'll drive my car

211
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
to my new life.

212
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm going abroad

213
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
to meet my new life.

214
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm going abroad

215
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,560
It's strange.

216
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,520
You thought I would drown myself in a bubble?

217
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,520
I just thought that the bubble couldn't last so long,

218
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,840
so I just totally got scared and went until I fell.

219
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,560
It's really glad I cues the words out of my mouth,

220
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,560
I'm not happy with Huayouxi today.

221
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,560
So, let's go to the bar and have a bath.

222
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,560
We'll have a bath tomorrow morning.

223
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,560
We'll be a good man, right?

224
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,560
Is there something wrong with you?

225
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,560
What if I get hit?

226
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,560
What will you do?

227
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,560
Me?

228
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,560
It's okay.

229
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,560
As long as you're happy.

230
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,560
Huayouxi!

231
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,560
Huayouxi!

232
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,560
Huayouxi!

233
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,560
Huayou, you're the best!

234
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,560
Huayouxi!

235
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,560
Huayouxi!

236
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,560
I don't know what Miss Adi told you.

237
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,560
It'll be okay.

238
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,560
Trust me.

239
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,560
Huayouxi!

240
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,560
I'm sorry.

241
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,560
It's the first time you've been so kind.

242
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,560
I really want to remember this feeling for the rest of my life.

243
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:57,560
If I hadn't met you, I wouldn't be who I am.

244
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:06,560
We agreed to be friends, even if we can't hold hands.

245
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:14,560
Actually, I still have a lot to say to you.

246
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,560
There are still a lot of love letters on the drawer.

247
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,560
I didn't send them to you.

248
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:31,560
Actually, I still want to walk with you.

249
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,560
So that our youth won't fade away.

250
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,560
As long as there are memories, there will be no regrets.

251
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,560
If there is no one to hold hands with...

252
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,560
I was thinking about whether you were here or not.

253
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,560
I didn't expect you to leave so soon.

254
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,560
That's the money for you.

255
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:09,560
Actually, I still have a lot to say to you.

256
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,560
There are still a lot of love letters on the drawer.

257
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,560
I didn't send them to you.

258
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,560
Actually, I still want to walk with you.

259
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,560
So that our youth won't fade away.

260
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,560
As long as there are memories, there will be no regrets.

261
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,560
As long as there are memories, there will be no regrets.

262
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,560
As long as there are memories, there will be no regrets.

263
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:44,560
Do you think we're spitting in the same direction?

264
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,560
I think so.

265
00:17:51,560 --> 00:18:01,560
Actually, I still have a lot of love letters on my drawer.

266
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:06,560
I don't think I should tell it to you.

267
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,560
I didn't send you a letter

268
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:18,060
Actually, I still want to walk with you on a long road

269
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:23,560
So that our youth will not fade

270
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:30,560
As long as there are memories, there will be no regrets

271
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,560
The End

272
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,560
Brother! Brother!

273
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,560
I need to use the toilet

274
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,560
Where is it?

275
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,560
Toilet!

276
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,560
Brother, you have to cherish your ex-girlfriend

277
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,560
Don't be like me, regretting the past, you know?

278
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,560
Brother, I'm going to the toilet now

279
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,560
You have something to say after I finish the toilet?

280
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,560
You can't go to the toilet

281
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,560
But I have something to say now

282
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,560
Brother, if you fall in love, you will hurt someone

283
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,560
You are afraid of hurting the player, and you will hurt everyone

284
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,560
You'd better be brave and pursue the one you love the most

285
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:32,560
You know? You made one person sad, but there are two people who can be happy

286
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,560
Think about it!

287
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,560
Idiot!

288
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,560
Uncle Wu, Sister Hui Hui is not feeling well recently

289
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,560
So I haven't had a chance to meet her and talk about cooperation

290
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,560
Let's not talk about business when we eat

291
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:58,560
Okay, A Mo is doing hair near here, do you want me to call her?

292
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:03,560
I want to talk to you alone

293
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,560
We should have some men's topics

294
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,560
Amber is always involved, it's not appropriate

295
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,560
You are right

296
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,560
How are you getting along with Amber?

297
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,560
Very well

298
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,560
Amber understands me and knows how to take care of people

299
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:28,560
Do you have confidence to grow old with Amber?

300
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,560
Yes

301
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,560
I always appreciate your carefulness

302
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,560
But love is not something to be said

303
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,560
The younger you are, the easier it is to be impulsive

304
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,560
I believe that love is impulsive

305
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,560
But I know that you are the most suitable for me

306
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,560
I know that Amber is the most suitable for me

307
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,560
Love is not everything in life

308
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,560
It's a waste of time to be two-minded

309
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,560
I will only put my feelings on her

310
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,560
I don't want to waste my time and not want to disappoint others

311
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:12,560
It seems that you are no longer the same as before

312
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:19,560
If your father wakes up, he will be very happy

313
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,560
Can you promise me one thing?

314
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:31,560
No matter how willful Amber is, you must tolerate her

315
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,560
Can you?

316
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:44,560
I think that Amber's boyfriend can't answer this question

317
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,560
But your son-in-law can

318
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:54,560
You are really smart

319
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:00,560
Are you afraid that I will not accept the offer after I have made a deal?

320
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,560
Businessmen are the ones who make the most of the benefits

321
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,560
The promise is not as good as the actual action

322
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:12,560
My youth is the most difficult time in China

323
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:17,560
There is no material pursuit in our life

324
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:22,560
But the feelings of the people at that time were pure

325
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:27,560
Although the result is not the same as we hoped

326
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:32,560
But at least the moment of the promise is not the same as the last

327
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,560
But at least the moment of the promise is sincere

328
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,560
And you?

329
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:44,560
You live in a rich life of three generations

330
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,560
The material life is very rich

331
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,560
But your generation is more concerned about the gains and losses

332
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,560
They dare not to be angry

333
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:00,560
Maybe everyone has his own attitude in life

334
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,560
Everyone is right

335
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,560
If you want me to be sincere

336
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:17,560
I think the right person will appear at the right time

337
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,560
I am 26 years old and I hope to get married before I turn 30

338
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:25,560
If the person around me is still Amber

339
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,560
Then she must be my wife

340
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,560
I appreciate your honesty

341
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,560
I was very straightforward

342
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,560
Because I don't see you as an outsider

343
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:44,560
If you have any offense, don't mind

344
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:57,560
Uncle, I have something to tell you

345
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,560
I am listening

346
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,560
You are not very good at business

347
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:08,560
But you are still single

348
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:15,560
I think you are not as brave as us

349
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,560
Are you really in love?

350
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,560
I want to ask you

351
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:29,560
Will you reject me as your son or woman?

352
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,560
This is an unresistable condition

353
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,560
Unless he is a father of a husband

354
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,560
He is not

355
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,560
He is a god of freedom

356
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,560
I was rejected

357
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,560
I feel bad

358
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,560
I don't want to ask again

359
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:02,560
If everything in this world has conditions

360
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,560
Then my wealth and glory

361
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:10,560
I will exchange with my loneliness

362
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,560
You are welcome

363
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,560
Here is a glass window

364
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,560
The light is very good

365
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,560
If you take it, you will be very happy

366
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,560
Because the structure is very reasonable

367
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,560
The environment here is more in line with my heart

368
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,560
I like the style

369
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,560
What do you think?

370
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,560
Pretty good

371
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,560
Do you like it?

372
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,560
Pretty good

373
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,560
Ding Yi, I have something to tell you

374
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,560
Sorry, I am not a seller

375
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,560
You can look around

376
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,560
Why do you sell?

377
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,560
If I don't sell, how can I live?

378
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,560
Really for me?

379
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,560
You are thinking again

380
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:16,560
You don't want Weiwei to be a rent girlfriend of Ou Hui

381
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,560
And sell?

382
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:25,560
You don't want to see her with another man?

383
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,560
I have decided to go to America with you

384
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,560
Don't think about it

385
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,560
I didn't think about it

386
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,560
I'm afraid some people don't believe me

387
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:53,560
回

388
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,560
At this moment I have decided

389
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,560
To spend 1 month deeply preciously

390
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,560
I don't know if I told you how big the cost of this operation is.

391
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:15,560
If I'm not careful, I'll become an idiot, a plant person, and maybe I'll never wake up.

392
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,560
Sister, any surgery is dangerous.

393
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,560
I'm telling you, I don't accept the surgery.

394
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,560
Life and death are up to fate.

395
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:33,560
Sister, you are my only family.

396
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,560
Do you have the heart to leave me alone in this world?

397
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,560
You are not alone. You have Weiwei.

398
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,560
She just works for me. She will leave sooner or later.

399
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,560
Okay. I can accept the surgery.

400
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,560
Really?

401
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,560
I have a small request.

402
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,560
No need to talk. I know what you want to say.

403
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,560
It doesn't matter what I want.

404
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,560
Sister, I can't be with Weiwei.

405
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,560
You didn't even try to chase her. How do you know it's impossible?

406
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,560
Let me chase her? Are you crazy?

407
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,560
Weiwei is different from others.

408
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,560
Even if you chase her, she won't agree.

409
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,560
Okay, that's good.

410
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,560
Okay, keep teaching.

411
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,560
You have fallen in love with her. But she doesn't like you.

412
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,560
Wait for me.

413
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,560
Hello?

414
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,560
I want to resign.

415
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,560
What are you doing?

416
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,560
I want to resign.

417
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,560
What else do you want?

418
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,560
Do you want to get promoted? Or do you want me to meet someone else?

419
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,560
I really want to resign.

420
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,560
Why do you want to resign?

421
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,560
Why do you want to resign?

422
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,560
Brother Ding wants to sell the flower shop.

423
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,560
I don't need to worry about the rent anymore.

424
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:41,560
So, no matter how much the salary is, it doesn't mean anything to me.

425
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,560
So, this is why you want to resign.

426
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,560
Yes.

427
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,560
Okay, I think you are stupid.

428
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,560
You just didn't say it.

429
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,560
I will call you back.

430
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,560
And thank you for being so nice to me.

431
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,560
Although we have been together for a long time, I really appreciate it.

432
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,560
Hello?

433
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,560
Hello?

434
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,560
Ding Yi.

435
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,560
Brother Ding Yi, I don't know why you want to sell the villa.

436
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:26,560
But if you want to make me a rent-abandoning girlfriend, I want to sell it to you.

437
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,560
But I can't.

438
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,560
I don't want to sell the villa.

439
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,560
I want you to sell the villa to me.

440
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

441
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

442
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,560
I don't know why you want to sell the villa.

443
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,560
But if you want to make me a rent-abandoning girlfriend, I want to tell you that I have resigned.

444
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,560
I hope you can reconsider the future of the flower shop.

445
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,560
Xiao Jing, open the door. I'm going out.

446
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,560
Okay.

447
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:07,560
President Ou, the sales of our three shops this month are 8%, 9% and 2%.

448
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,560
The same amount has increased by 0.3%.

449
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,560
Please have a look.

450
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,560
Thank you for being so nice to me.

451
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,560
Thank you.

452
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

453
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

454
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

455
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

456
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

457
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

458
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

459
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

460
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

461
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

462
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

463
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

464
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

465
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

466
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

467
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

468
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

469
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

470
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

471
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

472
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

473
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

474
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

475
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

476
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

477
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

478
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

479
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

480
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

481
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,560
I want to sell the villa to you.

482
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,560
All right.

483
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,560
Remember to believe me when youDR!

484
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,560
12th district.

485
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:26,060
I did. But I didn't approve of it.

486
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:30,780
You are talking nonsense again. I am not in the mood to mess with you, boss Ou.

487
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,360
What are you doing?

488
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,840
What are you doing? Don't you see that I am going to be a publicity horse?

489
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,940
You are not allowed to go.

490
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:44,360
Why? When I am unhappy, I like to play with her.

491
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,900
Even if I am not successful, I am your employee.

492
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:51,180
But now is off work time. I have the right to take care of it.

493
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,700
What is so funny about this?

494
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,700
A kid is a woman.

495
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,580
Who says it is not funny? Why don't you go with me?

496
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,140
Okay, let's go.

497
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:51,180
I said, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman,

498
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:55,460
woman, woman, woman, woman , woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman.

499
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,140
One, two, three.

500
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,380
Two, three.

501
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,900
One, two, three.

502
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,660
Don't you think that you can forget all your worries here?

503
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,940
This place reminds me of my childhood.

504
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,100
I can see everyone's happy faces.

505
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,740
All my worries can be washed away.

506
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,620
It's really surprising.

507
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,940
A fool like you has worries.

508
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,820
I thought worries were the patent of smart people.

509
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,700
You're the fool.

510
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,780
You know what?

511
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,980
My sister and I have never been to the amusement park.

512
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,060
It feels so good.

513
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,340
I want to bring my sister here.

514
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,220
Sure.

515
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,300
Will you come with her?

516
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,780
Only you can persuade her to do the surgery.

517
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,980
Am I that important?

518
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,380
Your problem is no longer related to me.

519
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,180
I can play with you.

520
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,580
As long as you agree to take care of my sister.

521
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,580
I can do anything.

522
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,580
I don't want her to rely on me.

523
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:09,860
Really.

524
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,500
It's too late.

525
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,060
She knows that after you quit,

526
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,060
she won't eat or take medicine.

527
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,540
How could it be?

528
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,700
My sister really likes you.

529
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,700
She listens to you more than I do.

530
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,700
I didn't expect that I'm so important to her.

531
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,620
Am I so important to her?

532
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:40,180
Are Han Dingyi and Wan Jia going abroad together?

533
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,500
How do you know?

534
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,100
I'm so grateful to you.

535
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,100
Of course I know everything about you.

536
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,100
They're going abroad to start a new life.

537
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,300
Why are you so blind?

538
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,300
Does it have anything to do with you?

539
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,100
Love is the only thing that can bother you.

540
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,700
When you work,

541
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,100
you'll understand how happy you are.

542
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,100
You're just bored, you know?

543
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,100
It's boring.

544
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,100
You're boring.

545
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,100
How can a cold-blooded animal like you understand love?

546
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,100
Of course I do.

547
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,500
You're a very serious person.

548
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,500
But some feelings can only be given up.

549
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,100
Only then can you be happy again.

550
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,500
Give yourself a chance.

551
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,300
Start a new relationship.

552
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,300
Thank you.

553
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,700
Every time I'm unhappy,

554
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,300
you're always by my side to comfort me.

555
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,500
I'm always happy.

556
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,700
I'm always happy.

557
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,100
You're always by my side.

558
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,500
Weiwei, I want to eat some meat tea.

559
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,700
Can you make it for me?

560
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,300
Sister, don't joke.

561
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,700
You're about to have an operation.

562
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,500
You can't eat before the operation.

563
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,700
I'm too serious.

564
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,500
I'm just making friends with Weiwei.

565
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,500
Sister,

566
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,900
after the operation,

567
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,700
I'll make you some meat tea.

568
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,900
You can eat it.

569
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,300
I'm not going to eat it.

570
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,500
I'm going to eat it.

571
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,500
You see, they all comfort me.

572
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,300
If the operation fails,

573
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,500
I'll leave without eating meat tea.

574
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,700
I'll be very sorry.

575
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,900
I won't allow you to talk nonsense.

576
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,100
What sorry?

577
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,100
You'll be fine.

578
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,900
The operation will be successful.

579
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,900
Sister, don't worry.

580
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,700
After the operation,

581
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,300
I'll make it for you every day.

582
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,300
Every day?

583
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,100
You're not lying to me.

584
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,100
Then you mean

585
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,300
if the operation is successful,

586
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,900
you'll be with me forever?

587
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,500
Okay.

588
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,700
Then I'll make sure the operation is successful.

589
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,700
I'll live on.

590
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,700
Sister, don't worry.

591
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,100
It will be successful.

592
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,500
Silly.

593
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,100
I'm going to watch you get married and have a child.

594
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,500
Okay.

595
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,500
I'll get married when the operation is successful.

596
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,100
Weiwei,

597
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,700
can I promise you something?

598
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,900
Since you said it,

599
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,500
since I knew your background,

600
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,700
I've always thought

601
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,100
you and my sister are fated to be together.

602
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,500
You and brother

603
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,900
grew up together in the restaurant.

604
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,300
Xiaohui and I

605
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,700
grew up together

606
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,900
in the kitchen,

607
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,900
in the kitchen,

608
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,900
in the restaurant,

609
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,700
in the restaurant,

610
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,500
and we were so happy.

611
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,900
So happy.

612
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,700
Do you feel the same way?

613
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,500
I know

614
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,100
you and we are fated to be together.

615
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,100
That's why God made us meet.

616
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,900
Sometimes I think

617
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,700
Xiaohui is a little bit stubborn.

618
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,900
But I know

619
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,900
you understand her.

620
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,700
You can get into her heart.

621
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,300
Promise me one thing.

622
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,300
Give her a chance.

623
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,500
Let her find you.

624
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,300
Okay, sister.

625
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,500
You have to concentrate on the operation.

626
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,500
We'll talk after the operation, okay?

627
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,900
Xiaohui,

628
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,500
I don't know if the operation will be successful.

629
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,900
I'm worried about you.

630
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,700
Promise me.

631
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,900
If the operation doesn't work,

632
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,500
take Weiwei as your family.

633
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,700
Take care of her.

634
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,700
You two

635
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,500
care for each other.

636
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,900
Take care of each other.

637
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,100
That's why I'm worried.

638
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,700
Okay.

639
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,300
Are you ready?

640
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,700
I need to change my clothes.

641
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,700
And prepare for the operation.

642
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,700
Can you give me an emergency room?

643
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,700
Okay.

644
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,700
I promise. Don't worry.

645
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,700
Don't go there.

646
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,700
I'll take a picture for you.

647
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,700
Smile.

648
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,700
I hope this is not the end.

649
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,700
It's a new beginning.

650
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,700
This is your first picture.

651
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,700
The End

652
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,700
The End

653
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,700
The End

654
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,700
The End

655
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,700
The End

656
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,700
The End
