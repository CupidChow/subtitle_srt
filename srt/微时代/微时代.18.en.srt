Episode 15

2
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Why are you so late?

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Sorry, sorry.

4
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I was a little late.

5
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This is your house.

6
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'll call a new friend to show you.

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Dao Qi.

8
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll introduce you to some friends.

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
These are my good friends.

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I want to introduce some new friends.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
First of all, Mr. Liu, the king of red wine.

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Hello, Mr. Liu.

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Hello, Ms. Gao.

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Mr. Ye, the king of jewelry.

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Hello, Mr. Ye.

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Nice to meet you.

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This is Wu Yuting, the one that no one knows.

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
He is also my best friend.

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
He owns the hotel.

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Really?

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Hello, Mr. Wu.

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Hello, Ms. Gao.

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I heard from Mr. Ying that you are all his best friends in Shanghai.

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I just came back from the United States.

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I will go to Beijing with you in the future.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You are welcome, Ms. Gao.

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So you are working for Mr. Ying now?

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I can't say no.

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Ms. Gao has a lot of background in the United States.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
For example, how to develop the foreign market.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I have to follow her instructions.

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Mr. Ying, you gave me a chance to learn.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I hope you will teach me more in the future.

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This is my business card.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Please teach me.

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Thank you.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Thank you.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Mr. Wu, I'm really sorry.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't have enough business cards in my bag.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
How about this?

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Let's make a phone call.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Mr. Ying, don't you mind?

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
To be honest, Mr. Wu is my best friend.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I really hope you can be good friends.

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I can't wait.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
In the future, Ms. Gao will need me in Shanghai.

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You are welcome.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You can contact me through Mr. Ying.

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Mr. Wu is really good at his job.

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I haven't tried it for many years.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Mr. Xiang asked for a phone call and was rejected.

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Let's sit down and talk.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Come on.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Sit down.

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Where is the new guy?

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He is not here.

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You will go to work tomorrow.

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Why should I go to work?

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Why do you need to pay rent if you don't come back?

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Did I bother you?

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
No.

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
No?

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I was in a bad mood and went to drink with someone.

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What are you doing here?

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I want you to help me check

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
if my dad is dating a woman.

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What?

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I want to make a movie.

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
A movie?

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What's wrong with you?

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You are...

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay.

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I will send you the files.

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Are you too fat?

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You have been cutson for all these years.

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You couldn't be more strong.

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It is not a reject, Mr.Wang.

79
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The new boss is위 a strong one.

80
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It will be there for a long time.

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You're not a beautiful woman.

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I don't know if my business is good.

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But I can see that your business is good.

84
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Ying likes you very much.

85
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
He worked hard in the luxury industry.

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
He became the boss.

87
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But do you know what he lacks?

88
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He lacks a woman who has never seen a high-class woman.

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Are you jealous?

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Don't be too confident.

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Don't you want to know how I met Ying Youjin?

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm sorry. I'm not interested in your business.

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But I'm interested in your business.

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
My business has nothing to do with you.

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Please don't bother me.

96
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Do you know that you have a habit?

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
When you speak in reverse, your fingers will move like this.

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I didn't expect that after so many years, you haven't changed a little.

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Gao Qi, what the hell do you want to do?

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What's wrong? Are you angry with me?

101
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
What do you want to do when you come back to Shanghai?

102
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I want to see my daughter, Hu Anpo.

103
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Dream?

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Why? She is also my daughter.

105
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You are too shy to say that she is also your daughter.

106
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You gave up her custody rights for a cheque.

107
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You left with another man.

108
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Today you have the courage to come back and say that she is your daughter.

109
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Do you have the responsibility to be Yutian's mother?

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yutian, Yutian, you are too selfish.

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Life is limited.

112
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm used to only remembering what I want to remember in my head.

113
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Selfish.

114
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Isn't selfishness the specialty of men?

115
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I should be proud.

116
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Only I, Gao Qi, make men feel selfish.

117
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
If you don't cooperate, I will meet you through legal means.

118
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Xiao Qi.

119
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I like it.

120
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You will call me Xiao Qi.

121
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Love is a feeling.

122
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Hate is also a feeling.

123
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You have both.

124
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Why did you let go so easily?

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Go back and arrange a good meeting between me and my daughter.

126
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm waiting for your call.

127
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I told you, Wu Yutian.

128
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
In my words, I'm the only one who makes people unhappy.

129
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
No one can make me unhappy.

130
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Okay, I'll be the first one.

131
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I can't be with a woman.

132
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
She tells me money every minute and every second.

133
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You want to control all my assets, right?

134
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Because I love you.

135
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I have the money.

136
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I have the man.

137
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I have beauty and wisdom.

138
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I have the right to negotiate with men.

139
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
No man will like a woman with thorns.

140
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You are talking to me like this because you are the prostitute in Guangzhou.

141
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That woman is Hua Mengjun.

142
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
She hasn't married yet and has a son.

143
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I didn't expect you to like such a woman.

144
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Gao Qi, you are investigating me.

145
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So what?

146
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You are my husband.

147
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Is it wrong to investigate you?

148
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You didn't go out.

149
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Why are you afraid of me?

150
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Gao Qi, I warn you.

151
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
If you continue to investigate me, I will make you beautiful.

152
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
How can I make you beautiful?

153
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Do you want to divorce me?

154
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Just because Hua Mengjun told you that he has your child?

155
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
How do you know if you want to know?

156
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'll take you, okay?

157
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'll tell you now.

158
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I will not let you go.

159
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I also have your child.

160
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What?

161
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So this marriage can't be ended.

162
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Think about it.

163
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Your career is at the crossroads.

164
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
If I go out, you and this woman will have a relationship when I am pregnant.

165
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What will your leaders think of you?

166
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Gao Qi, what do you want?

167
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Tell him to get out.

168
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Otherwise, I will leave a letter to you.

169
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Gao Qi, why are you so cruel?

170
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Think about it.

171
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Do you really want to marry me?

172
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You have another purpose.

173
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Do you think that you have no ability to take me down here except money?

174
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You are too confident.

175
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Then I have to believe what you say.

176
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
How do I know if the child in your belly is mine?

177
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
How can you be sure that the child in Hua Mengjun's belly is yours?

178
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
He won't lie to me.

179
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
He has only been with you for a few months.

180
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I have been married to you for more than a year.

181
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You believe him but he doesn't believe me.

182
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
He never told me about money.

183
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
He is not as thoughtful as you.

184
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Okay. If I find out that the child is not yours, I will take him to the building.

185
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
If he is yours, I will throw him out of the window because you are not worth it.

186
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You hate me so much now.

187
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Then you should get rid of the child and divorce me.

188
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I won't divorce you.

189
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I am sure that the child is yours.

190
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I will give birth to him.

191
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I will kill him if he is yours.

192
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Where are you going?

193
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Let me think about it.

194
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I will find a place to recuperate.

195
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I will give birth to him and be a murderer.

196
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I will use your future to compensate for it.

197
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Gao Qi, what do you want?

198
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You should get rid of him.

199
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You are not allowed to be with him.

200
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I am telling you.

201
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
If you don't listen to me, I will do something.

202
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Hello, Mr. Bai.

203
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Did Amber come home?

204
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Okay.

205
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
From now on, except for the EMPA course,

206
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
she must report to me every day,

207
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
whenever she sees someone or goes to a place.

208
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Do you understand?

209
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Okay.

210
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Mr. Bai, I am so happy tonight.

211
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Smell it. It smells like blood.

212
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It smells so good.

213
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You are so beautiful today.

214
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You are like a goddess.

215
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You gave me a lot of respect.

216
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Really?

217
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I am in Shanghai and you are so helpful.

218
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Of course I should take care of you.

219
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
By the way, I told you that

220
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
there are several banks in Shanghai.

221
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I will go to them.

222
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I have made an appointment.

223
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I am so happy today.

224
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You are so beautiful.

225
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
We are so happy.

226
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Can you come to my villa?

227
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
We can have a drink in the small table.

228
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Mr. Ying, I think you are drunk.

229
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You are so sincere to women.

230
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You are so kind.

231
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I am sorry.

232
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I am sorry.

233
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You are so sincere to women.

234
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You gave me a lot of jewelry.

235
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I was so scared.

236
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I just want you to know that

237
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I am not a woman who can just go to other people's villas.

238
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Yes, yes.

239
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I am sorry.

240
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I am a little drunk today.

241
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I have been lonely since Ying Tong's mother passed away.

242
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Then I met you.

243
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I have never seen such an excellent woman.

244
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So when I saw you,

245
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
you were in my heart.

246
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I am really grateful to you.

247
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You are really.

248
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Do you want to hear my sincere words?

249
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Actually, I am very serious.

250
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Before your son Ying Dong accepted me,

251
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I really dare not to be too honest with you.

252
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Ying Dong does not accept you?

253
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Can't you see that he has prejudice against me?

254
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Maybe he thinks I will take you away.

255
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I am not capable of that.

256
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I will beat him when he comes home.

257
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Don't blame him.

258
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I don't like people to say that I am a bad woman behind my back.

259
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It will destroy your relationship.

260
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Let us be good friends at work.

261
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I am really tired.

262
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Can you send me back to the hotel?

263
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Okay, no problem.

264
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Boss, here is your information.

265
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Do you want to continue to investigate the case?

266
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Yes.

267
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Boss, here is your information.

268
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Do you want to continue to investigate Gao Qi's disciple?

269
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
This woman has a bad background.

270
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
She is in the position of many men with different rights and responsibilities.

271
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Isn't there a man who teaches dancing by her side?

272
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
His name is Ma Zhen?

273
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
In the financial storm, Gao Qi lost a lot of money.

274
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
He is dead.

275
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
He is just a mere appearance.

276
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
If we find out the purpose of Gao Qi's return to the country,

277
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
should we tell Boss Ying?

278
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
No need.

279
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
We eat together and practice together.

280
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's none of our business.

281
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Don't get involved.

282
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Okay.

283
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Boss, do you have any other instructions?

284
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Bring all the female employees who are still in their twenties

285
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
to see me.

286
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Well...

287
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Go ahead.

288
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Go.

289
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Victor.

290
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Okay.

291
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Have you memorized all the information I gave you?

292
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I have memorized it, Boss.

293
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What did you call me?

294
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Daddy.

295
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You have to be calm and natural.

296
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You must not spread the word.

297
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Do you understand?

298
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yes.

299
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I understand.

300
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I understand.

301
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I understand.

302
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I understand.

303
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I understand.

304
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I understand.

305
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You can spread the word.

306
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Do you understand?

307
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Yes, I understand, Daddy.

308
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Amber.

309
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I finally see you.

310
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Let me see you.

311
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I brought you a small gift.

312
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
See if you like it.

313
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Thank you.

314
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Amber, where is the person?

315
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Hello, Auntie.

316
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Little fool.

317
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Why do you call me Auntie?

318
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You should call me Mommy.

319
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Didn't your daddy tell you who I am?

320
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Daddy told me everything.

321
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
He told me not to have prejudice against you.

322
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You are the one who gave birth to me.

323
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But you didn't do what a mother should do.

324
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I don't need such a mother.

325
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Daughter.

326
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I left you because I was in pain.

327
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You can't just forgive me.

328
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Give me a chance.

329
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Let me make it up to you, okay?

330
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Make up what?

331
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You go to the US with me.

332
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
We live together.

333
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Then we have a lot of time to understand each other.

334
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
We just met.

335
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
There is no other way.

336
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I will never allow you to take Amber to the US.

337
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You go back first.

338
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Okay.

339
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Daughter, you have seen it.

340
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Now you should be satisfied.

341
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Mother and daughter are the same.

342
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
One day she will accept me.

343
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
By the way.

344
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I still owe you a business card that day.

345
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
What do you want?

346
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I want everything I gave up here all these years.

347
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Since my daughter is here.

348
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I will use this card to get the first board of directors in the Asia-Pacific region.

349
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And I will make a fortune in Shanghai.

350
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
So many foreign companies want to enter the Chinese market.

351
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
And they all go back.

352
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
What do you want?

353
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I am a woman.

354
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I am a woman.

355
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I am a woman.

356
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
My charm always makes me meet a man who will help me at an important time.

357
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Don't you remember?

358
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I am a woman who will not leave empty-handed.

359
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
In the famous好了оr cooked hadかった.

360
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
EL HOLE

361
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
�

362
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
This is a flower shop.

363
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It was originally invested by Yingdong to help Han Dingyi.

364
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
This is Han Dingyi's brother-in-law.

365
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
His name is Hua Youxi.

366
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
This woman is the mother of these two brothers.

367
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
During the day she works as a manager at Mingzhu Goubao.

368
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
At night she helps her friends to manage a small bar.

369
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Who is this man?

370
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
This is Kang Zirui.

371
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
He is the ex-boyfriend of Wu Anpo.

372
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
He is also a half-red-red director.

373
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I don't need to look.

374
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
They are all pawns of life.

375
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Gao Qi will exercise at the same time every week.

376
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Later, he will go to the nearby cafe to sit for a while.

377
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Miss, give me a cup of coffee.

378
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Give me a cup of coffee.

379
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Thank you.

380
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Hello, Mr Ying. How is it?

381
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Is there any news about the bank?

382
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Okay.

383
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Then let's have lunch tomorrow.

384
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Will your son Yingdong come too?

385
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Nothing.

386
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I just think that if he comes too.

387
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Then my chances of success will be greatly reduced.

388
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Okay, you arrange.

389
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
That's it. Bye.

390
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Excuse me.

391
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Let me do it.

392
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Excuse me. Thank you.

393
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You are Amber's friend.

394
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Amber?

395
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You mean Amber?

396
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You are her classmate.

397
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You play basketball, right?

398
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
How do you know?

399
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
She mentioned you. I have a special impression of you.

400
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Why?

401
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Because you are very handsome.

402
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It's a great honor to be praised by you.

403
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Do you have time tonight?

404
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Can I buy you a drink?

405
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Okay.

406
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
You can invite Amber and your classmates.

407
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
There is a bar in your house, right?

408
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
You know me so well.

409
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Okay.

410
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Let's go together tonight.

411
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Where?

412
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
To hug.

413
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I mean, hug bar.

414
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Welcome to hug bar.

415
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
This is our long-term plan.

416
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
They are here.

417
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Hi.

418
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Amber.

419
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Hi.

420
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
You know them?

421
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
This is Wan Jia.

422
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
She is my classmate.

423
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Hi.

424
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Sit down.

425
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Sit down.

426
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Men don't have the courage to deal with the rest.

427
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I tell you.

428
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
If you give birth to her,

429
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I will not let her live in peace.

430
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Here is some money.

431
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Here is some money.

432
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Here is 2000.

433
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
This is my compensation for you.

434
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
This is not the first time in your life.

435
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Remember.

436
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I give you a word.

437
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Get out!

438
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It's beautiful here.

439
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Right?

440
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Let me show you around.

441
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Okay.

442
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
You sit down first.

443
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I'll go and have a look.

444
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Come on.

445
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
This is the best one.

446
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It's beautiful.

447
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
She is your father's girlfriend, Gao Qi.

448
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
My father's girlfriend is more than one.

449
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
It's really beautiful here.

450
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
This game is not a big deal.

451
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It's not like her brother.

452
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
What did you do wrong?

453
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I think you don't like Gao Qi.

454
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I think she is dangerous.

455
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
She is dangerous.

456
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
What are you talking about?

457
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Wan Jia.

458
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Look.

459
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
This is what Gao Qi gave me at the festival.

460
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Is it beautiful?

461
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Yes.

462
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Gao Qi is really nice.

463
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I think she will come to my bar.

464
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I think she is here for a reason.

465
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Wan Jia.

466
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Why didn't Ding Yi and Wei Wei come?

467
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
They are still in the restaurant.

468
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
They haven't finished work.

469
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Okay, I'll get you a glass of wine.

470
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Come here.

471
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
What?

472
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Who is she?

473
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
She is Gao Qi.

474
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
She is Amber's friend.

475
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Friend?

476
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Yes.

477
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
She just came back from the US to Shanghai.

478
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
She is a CEO of a big investment company.

479
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
She is also a senior officer of our Yiyan BA class.

480
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Mom.

481
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
She is the first time I see

482
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
such a beautiful woman at this age.

483
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
But you don't want to come up.

484
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
You are stressed.

485
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Mengjie.

486
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Do you know her?

487
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
No.

488
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Mom, what's wrong with you?

489
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Listen.

490
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Stay away from her.

491
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I know.

492
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Go away.

493
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Come.

494
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I didn't expect you to come to this kind of place.

495
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
You have been studying me for a long time.

496
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Mr Ying.

497
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Do you have anything to teach me?

498
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Mr Gao is really high.

499
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
First my dad.

500
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And Amber.

501
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
You have taken over my life.

502
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I am really impressed.

503
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
No.

504
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
You are the one

505
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I want to take over.

506
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
But you don't appreciate it.

507
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I am so sad.

508
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Why are you so hypocritical?

509
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
My dad is now

510
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
fascinated by you.

511
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
He doesn't listen to anyone.

512
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
He will understand.

513
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Your purpose is not so simple.

514
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Really?

515
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Can you tell me

516
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
what my purpose is?

517
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I believe no one knows better than you.

518
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
My dad lost his mother at the age of eight.

519
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
My dad never went there again.

520
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Do you think you can enter the world now?

521
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Sometimes I really don't know

522
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
whether you are smart or stupid.

523
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Yingdong.

524
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
You think too much.

525
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
It's not that complicated.

526
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I just want to bring some new life

527
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
to your dad.

528
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Nothing wrong with that.

529
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Don't you want your dad

530
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
to be happy?

531
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I am afraid that

532
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
you bring not only new life.

533
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
You think

534
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I will bring something?

535
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
You want me to investigate

536
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
and you want to follow me.

537
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I understand

538
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
that this is a time

539
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
when we investigate each other.

540
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
There is no secret.

541
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I understand.

542
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
In the past,

543
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
there was no secret.

544
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
But I found

545
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
a little secret.

546
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Really?

547
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
You are hiding your dad

548
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
from the girl

549
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
called Wanjia.

550
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
You are very smart.

551
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
So you should

552
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
find out that I am a woman

553
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
who is very close to Qin.

554
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I am very good at

555
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
overseas marketing.

556
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Your dad is also very good at it.

557
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
You can ask me

558
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
anything in the future.

559
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Your dad is looking for me.

560
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Give me an answer.

561
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
If you really don't like me,

562
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
you can persuade him not to come to you.

563
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Anyway,

564
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
he is not a big deal to me.

565
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Hello?

566
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Youjin,

567
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
you didn't call me all night.

568
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I am worried.

569
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Do you know

570
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
that someone has been following me recently?

571
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Guess

572
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
who doesn't like me

573
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
to be with you?

574
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I really don't know.

575
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I really don't know.

576
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Mr. Tong,

577
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
you are here.

578
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Your ball is much better.

579
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Of course.

580
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I have a girlfriend now.

581
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
She is a coach.

582
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
What girlfriend?

583
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
You are a normal friend.

584
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
You will never know.

585
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I will go.

586
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
If Ying Dong doesn't come first,

587
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I will go to the ranking right away.

588
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I tell you,

589
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I understand.

590
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
You are so happy

591
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
to put Gao Qi's products

592
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
into the bank.

593
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
You have to think about

594
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
whether you can push it successfully

595
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
and take care of it.

596
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
If you say so,

597
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I will put my other products

598
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
into the bank.

599
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
You will earn a lot

600
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
from these two transactions.

601
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Before I retire,

602
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I can take over this business.

603
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Then you will give me face.

604
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
You are married to Gao Qi.

605
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
What?

606
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Why are you so romantic?

607
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Ying,

608
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I have to remind you

609
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
that this is not a small project.

610
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
You don't know how deep the water is.

611
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
You have to be careful.

612
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Don't lose the chain at the critical moment.

613
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Wu, you said so today.

614
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Let's talk about it.

615
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Wait a minute.

616
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Come here.

617
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I have already hit you.

618
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Gao Qi was your wife.

619
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
You have divorced.

620
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Why can't I

621
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
pursue her?

622
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Are you really going to marry her?

623
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Yes, I am.

624
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Ying, you are very simple.

625
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
But Gao Qi is not as simple as you think.

626
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Wu,

627
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
you are so good.

628
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
You are a fake friend.

629
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
You are a fake friend.

630
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Okay, I will stop talking to you.

631
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
You are unreasonable.

632
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Who is unreasonable?

633
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Hello, honey.

634
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I have something to tell you.

635
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
What is it?

636
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I told you.

637
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I will scold you the next day.

638
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Really?

639
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
But you have to cooperate with him.

640
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I will punish you

641
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
if you make a single mistake.

642
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Honey,

643
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
you are great.

644
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
But you must not

645
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
offend anyone for me.

646
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I don't want to see you hurt.

647
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Hurt me?

648
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Who dares to hurt me here?

649
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Really, honey.

650
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Since I met you,

651
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I have been thinking about you.

652
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
But you have to be careful.

653
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I know you have me in your heart.

654
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Then it's okay.

655
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
How about I pick you up tonight?

656
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Let's have dinner together.

657
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
No, honey.

658
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
How can you be so unreasonable?

659
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
You are wasting your work.

660
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Don't you make your son hate me more?

661
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And

662
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I have an appointment tonight

663
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
with the young people of EMBA.

664
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I want to hear

665
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
your opinion about your future.

666
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
It will be helpful

667
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
for your future luxury.

668
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Honey, you are so kind to me.

669
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I will listen to everything you say.

670
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Bye-bye.

671
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Who is unreasonable?

672
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
What a stupid person!

673
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Hi, Miss Gao.

674
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Welcome to my home.

675
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Your home is so beautiful.

676
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
No wonder

677
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
you are so beautiful.

678
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Miss Gao,

679
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
was my dad handsome

680
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
in the photo

681
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
of my birthday last year?

682
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Yes, was my dad handsome?

683
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
When you grow up in such a family,

684
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
you will be very happy.

685
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Actually,

686
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I am not that happy.

687
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
When I was less than one,

688
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
my mom abandoned me and my dad

689
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
and left with half of my dad's money.

690
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Amber, do you hate your mom?

691
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I know one day

692
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
she will regret it.

693
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
With such a cute daughter like you,

694
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
who would not love her?

695
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Amber,

696
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
let's not talk about these petty things.

697
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Let me take you out for a walk.

698
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
And that one.

699
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
You took a photo of your birthday.

700
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
You are here.

701
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Yingdong, I thought

702
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
you went to the party with your dad.

703
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
When my dad was alone,

704
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I never worried about him.

705
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Now I want to

706
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
take care of you for him.

707
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
What a filial son.

708
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Are you reading

709
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
the magazine of the financial elite?

710
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Your dad

711
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
is a successful person.

712
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Miss Gao,

713
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
have you read this magazine?

714
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
He has been sleeping with me in my bed.

715
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Sister,

716
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
have some juice.

717
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Thank you.

718
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
This handsome guy is...

719
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Hello, I'm Han Dingyi,

720
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
the brother of Hua Youxi.

721
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Sister, I told you

722
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
that he is my classmate

723
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
and the leader of V-LOG.

724
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
He is the only one who has never pursued me.

725
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Really?

726
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Amber, stop it.

727
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Look at me.

728
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Sister, I'm Weiwei.

729
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Amber, I heard that you are doing well.

730
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I saw all your love today.

731
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
That's great.

732
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
But you haven't seen one.

733
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Who? My dad.

734
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Guess,

735
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
if he sees me,

736
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
what will he do?

737
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
He will like you very much.

738
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
And he will pursue you.

739
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
My dad is going to break up with me.

740
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Miss Gao is so charming.

741
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Everyone loves her.

742
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
But your interrogation is the most difficult.

743
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Okay, we are here.

744
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Let's eat. The meal is ready.

745
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

746
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
What did you cook for me?

747
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Come on, get up.

748
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I think I'm going to lose weight after this meal.

749
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Dear,

750
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I think we still need something.

751
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
What?

752
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Wine.

753
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I'll get it.

754
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Dad,

755
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
you are back at the right time.

756
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
We are waiting for a guest.

757
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
This is the senior consultant of EMBA, Gao Qi.

758
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Hello, Mr. Wu.

759
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I'm Daming.

760
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Hello, Miss Gao Qi.

761
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Amber,

762
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
how long have you known this Miss Gao Qi?

763
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
More than a month.

764
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Mr. Wu,

765
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I'm sorry.

766
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Your daughter is so beautiful.

767
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I like her very much.

768
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Can I ask you to have a drink

769
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
and celebrate with us?

770
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
How about this?

771
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I invite you

772
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
to see my wine collection.

773
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Amber,

774
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
say hello to your friends.

775
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Miss Gao Qi, please.

776
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Amber,

777
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Gao Qi is so beautiful.

778
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Your father is rich and single.

779
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
They are a good match.

780
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Don't say that.

781
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Say it.

782
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Miss,

783
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Miss.

784
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
What?

785
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
This is my house.

786
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
You are not allowed to come here.

787
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I'm not going to come here.

788
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

789
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

790
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
What?

791
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
This is my house. You are not allowed to come here.

792
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Hua Xiao Xi, watch her.

793
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Okay.

794
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Miss.

795
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
You don't eat.

796
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I'm going to check.

797
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Gao Qi,

798
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
what do you want?

799
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I told you

800
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
that I wanted to take back

801
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
everything I gave up 20 years ago.

802
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
My daughter is here.

803
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I'm going to stay here.

804
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
You have known Amber

805
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
in the course of the ENB.

806
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Yes.

807
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Because I miss her so much.

808
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
When you find a woman

809
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
and pretend to see me,

810
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I really think it's funny.

811
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
When you follow me

812
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I think it's even more funny.

813
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Are you jealous

814
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
of those men who pursue me?

815
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Especially Ying You Jing?

816
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Gao Qi, don't go too far.

817
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Who abandoned this house

818
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
and Amber

819
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
for a cheque

820
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
and a man named Ma Zhen?

821
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Didn't you promise

822
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
that you would never

823
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
appear in front of our daughter?

824
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Why are you so upset?

825
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
This is motherly love.

826
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I just want to do

827
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
my duty as a mother.

828
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I owe her motherly love

829
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
for the past 20 years.

830
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Motherly love?

831
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Are you qualified

832
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
to say that?

833
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
In this world, no one

834
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
knows you better than me.

835
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Who threatened me

836
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
to take my daughter?

837
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
If I hadn't given you

838
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
10 million cheques,

839
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
would Amber still exist?

840
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I don't know what to do.

841
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I don't know what to do.

842
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
