1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,540
So you are savory

2
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,700
Only

3
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,620
You will shiver

4
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,020
Literally

5
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:47,880
Less that

6
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,160
Me

7
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,660
Am I

8
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,660
You're the one who said that.

9
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,660
You were the one who had another woman.

10
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,660
That's why I said that.

11
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,660
You broke my heart.

12
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,660
That's why I left this house.

13
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,660
You think I'm a whore?

14
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,660
I believe everything you say.

15
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,660
You left China because of the economic independence.

16
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,660
Now you came back because of the financial crisis.

17
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,660
Don't pretend to understand me.

18
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,660
I'm a woman.

19
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,660
Is it easy to know?

20
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,660
People are selfish.

21
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,660
They only see other people's wealth.

22
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,660
They don't see other people's tears.

23
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,660
If I don't have this position today,

24
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,660
will you come back to recognize this woman?

25
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,660
Please just give me a price.

26
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,660
What do you want?

27
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,660
You're not good enough.

28
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,660
You're not good enough.

29
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,660
If you don't hate me,

30
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,660
you won't go anywhere.

31
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,660
I don't want any woman

32
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,660
to share my love for my daughter.

33
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,660
I don't want anyone

34
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,660
to hurt my daughter.

35
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,660
Including her biological mother.

36
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,660
I'll ask you one more time.

37
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,660
How much do you want

38
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,660
to let me go?

39
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,660
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,660
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,660
I just found out

42
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,660
that I hurt you so much.

43
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,660
I know that we have no way back.

44
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,660
I can't go anywhere.

45
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,660
But

46
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,660
can you do me a favor?

47
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,660
I want to tell him who I am.

48
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,660
Why do you come back?

49
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,660
Amber.

50
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,660
Amber.

51
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,660
Yingdong.

52
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,660
Bring this bottle of wine.

53
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,660
Let the young people drink first.

54
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,660
I have something to do. I'll go first.

55
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,660
Wait.

56
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,660
Daddy.

57
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,660
Who did you say

58
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,660
left me for 10 million?

59
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,660
And then you don't want me?

60
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,660
Amber, you must have heard wrong.

61
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,660
I won't go up.

62
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,660
Daddy, tell me.

63
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,660
Who is Gao Qi?

64
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,660
What you said is not true, right?

65
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,660
Daddy.

66
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,660
Yingdong, let Vector

67
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,660
send Miss Gao back.

68
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,660
Amber, let's go up and eat.

69
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,660
Let's go eat.

70
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,660
Vector,

71
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,660
send Miss Gao back to the hotel.

72
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,660
What?

73
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,660
It's okay.

74
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,660
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

75
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,660
I'm very happy

76
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,660
to have dinner with you young people.

77
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,660
Thank you for taking care of Amber.

78
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,660
Amber,

79
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,660
come and say hello to everyone.

80
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,660
Don't be shy.

81
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,660
Gao Qi is my mother.

82
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,660
Didn't I tell you

83
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,660
that I don't have a mother since I was a child?

84
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,660
I didn't ask doesn't mean I don't want to.

85
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,660
There are so many classmates here today.

86
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,660
Let's not talk about family matters.

87
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,660
They are all my friends.

88
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,660
Everyone will know what to know.

89
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,660
You haven't answered my question yet.

90
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,660
Gao Qi is my mother.

91
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,660
Amber,

92
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,660
there are so many incomplete families in this world.

93
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,660
But how did they survive?

94
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,660
You have food,

95
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,660
you have a house, you have clothes.

96
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,660
From head to toe, you are a famous brand.

97
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,660
Don't let people not know your fortune.

98
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,660
Your birthday is coming.

99
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,660
I plan to

100
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,660
buy you a birthday gift

101
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,660
from Maldives.

102
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,660
You can take your classmates

103
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,660
to have fun.

104
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,660
Are you trying to make up for me?

105
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,660
I want to make your classmates envy you.

106
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,660
Do you envy me?

107
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,660
You can't give me what I want.

108
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,660
You know, every time I celebrate my birthday,

109
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,660
I want to say to you,

110
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,660
when I face the cold and meaningless gifts,

111
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,660
I want you to make me a bowl of noodles.

112
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,660
I want you to say to me,

113
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,660
baby, happy birthday.

114
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,660
I want you to be by my side

115
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,660
when I am sick.

116
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,660
I want you to say to me,

117
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,660
why are you so careless?

118
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,660
I want you to be by my side

119
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,660
when I am sad.

120
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,660
I want you to be

121
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,660
by my side

122
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,660
when I am sad.

123
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,660
Not by myself.

124
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,660
I want you to take care of yourself.

125
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,660
I want to be like Wan family,

126
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,660
to have my mom to take care of her,

127
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,660
to care for her,

128
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,660
to grow up with her.

129
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,660
Amber.

130
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,660
I hate your father!

131
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,660
You control my life!

132
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,660
You don't allow me to call you mom,

133
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,660
don't allow me to call you boyfriend!

134
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,660
I don't want this kind of love!

135
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,660
Amber!

136
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,660
Don't go too far!

137
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,660
I'm telling you,

138
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,660
don't think that all the mistakes are others'

139
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,660
You young people don't understand the pain of your parents!

140
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,660
You don't know who is the real lover!

141
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,660
Amber,

142
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,660
let me tell you again,

143
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,660
you don't have a mother.

144
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,660
You've never had a mother since you were a child.

145
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,660
You don't need a mother!

146
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,660
Amber!

147
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,660
Amber!

148
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,660
Amber!

149
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,660
Amber!

150
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,660
My...

151
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,660
Don't be excited.

152
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,660
Leave a little bit of space for us to remember.

153
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,660
Why are you still here?

154
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,660
I'm worried about you,

155
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,660
so I stayed to accompany you.

156
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,660
Actually, after Gao Qi appeared,

157
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,660
the person who worries about you is not only you,

158
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,660
but also Yidong.

159
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,660
Recently, I've been helping him to investigate Gao Qi's background.

160
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,660
Look,

161
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,660
Amber is also too immature.

162
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,660
I'll tell her now,

163
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,660
I'll come back and apologize to you.

164
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,660
I'll go now.

165
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,660
Honey,

166
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,660
where are you?

167
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,660
What's your relationship with my daughter?

168
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,660
Of course,

169
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,660
the relationship you imagined.

170
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,660
Ridiculous!

171
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,660
Who do you think I am?

172
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,660
I'm telling you,

173
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,660
you can't be together with Amber.

174
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,660
Even if Amber doesn't marry you,

175
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,660
even if Amber doesn't want you,

176
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,660
she can't be with you.

177
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,660
Don't dream about it anymore!

178
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,660
Uncle Wu,

179
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,660
you're wrong.

180
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,660
What age is it now?

181
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,660
You're in love,

182
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,660
you don't need to ask for anything.

183
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,660
You should be responsible for your own sins.

184
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,660
Why do I need you,

185
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,660
a crazy guy who does nothing all day long?

186
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,660
Teach me!

187
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,660
Brother, Amber is missing.

188
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,660
Did she contact you?

189
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,660
What?

190
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,660
Missing?

191
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,660
Yes.

192
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,660
I'll go find her now.

193
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,660
Call me if you have any news.

194
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,660
Okay, I'll inform you as soon as I get the news.

195
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,660
Bye.

196
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,660
Still can't find her.

197
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,660
How is it going?

198
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,660
We've searched everywhere.

199
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,660
It's so late,

200
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,660
where will she go alone?

201
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,660
My brother doesn't have news about Amber.

202
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,660
This is too big a blow to Amber.

203
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,660
I don't know what will happen to her.

204
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,660
It's not a good idea to keep searching for her.

205
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,660
Amber's personality won't do anything stupid.

206
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,660
Let's go home first,

207
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,660
see if she can find her own way back.

208
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,660
And,

209
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,660
see if there's any news about Wu Yuting.

210
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,660
What about Jia Jia?

211
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,660
I'll let her wait for a while.

212
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,660
How about this?

213
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,660
Call Mei Bao and Ou Xiao Xiao.

214
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,660
Maybe Amber will find them.

215
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,660
How about we go find Wu Yuting?

216
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,660
Let's ask Wu Yuting to go to Gao Qi

217
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,660
and see if there's any news about Amber.

218
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,660
Where is she?

219
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,660
Do you have Gao Qi's contact information?

220
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,660
I know.

221
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,660
Let us handle this.

222
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,660
Your father has a relationship with Gao Qi.

223
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,660
It's not good for you to rush me.

224
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,660
I'm not going to let you go.

225
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,660
It's not good for you to rush me.

226
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,660
It's because of the relationship with my father

227
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,660
that I have to face him.

228
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,660
You didn't bring alcohol with you.

229
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,660
You don't know how powerful that woman is.

230
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,660
Okay.

231
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,660
Take care.

232
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,660
Okay.

233
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,660
Be careful on the road.

234
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,660
Don't worry, I'll be with her.

235
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,660
Call me if you need anything.

236
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,660
Okay.

237
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,660
Forget it.

238
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,660
Let's go back.

239
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,660
You go back first.

240
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,660
I'll go to another place and look for Amber.

241
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,660
How can I be at ease when you're out in the middle of the night?

242
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,660
Besides, you can't find her without any purpose.

243
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,660
Even if there's no clue, we have to look for her.

244
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,660
Now is the most helpless and most needy Amber.

245
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,660
We can't give up so easily because there's no clue.

246
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,660
Now the most important thing is not Amber to find anyone.

247
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,660
But who will be mad at this time and not willing to look for her.

248
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,660
I can understand Amber's feelings now.

249
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,660
That kind of loneliness, that kind of helplessness.

250
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,660
It's like the sense of despair that the whole world is going to abandon itself.

251
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,660
After giving birth to her mother, she left without a word.

252
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,660
After 20 years, she came back to be a daughter.

253
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,660
If she really cared about her mother, she wouldn't leave so heartlessly.

254
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,660
If she can't bring Amber happiness, why would she come back?

255
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,660
Why?

256
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:13,160
My mother is not going to forgive him.

257
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,660
I'm too sad.

258
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
I remind you to forget about Amber.

259
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,220
If you really want to help me,

260
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,100
let me go to Amber.

261
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,740
2882, President's Office.

262
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,780
Gao Qi.

263
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,180
No need.

264
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,260
How is it?

265
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,820
No one answered.

266
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,540
I think Gao Qi will go to your dad.

267
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,620
My dad went on a business trip to Beijing.

268
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,500
It's late. I'll send you back.

269
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,780
No.

270
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,420
I want to be with you.

271
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,220
I can't help you even if you're with me.

272
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,820
Did I say something wrong?

273
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,460
I'm sorry. I'm in a bad mood.

274
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,420
You're afraid of Gao Qi, right?

275
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,180
She's just a woman.

276
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,540
I'm afraid of her feelings.

277
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,980
You're afraid of facing your dad

278
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,100
and your choice between Gao Qi and you.

279
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,700
Ever since my mom left,

280
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,980
my dad and I have been the only family.

281
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,260
No one can destroy the relationship between my dad and me.

282
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,220
No one can.

283
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,500
Including me?

284
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,980
Don't talk nonsense.

285
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,740
I've lost a good friend.

286
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,820
I can't lose anything precious in my life.

287
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,140
Especially you.

288
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,580
I know.

289
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,620
Ever since you left the restaurant,

290
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,300
although you said you were fine,

291
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:10,100
I know you're very upset.

292
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,860
Maybe this is the price of growth.

293
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,100
Luckily, you're here.

294
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,580
Do you understand?

295
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,980
Do you know?

296
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,300
I've been very busy lately.

297
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,660
Busy?

298
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,940
I feel like I'm not at home anymore.

299
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,220
I'm no longer in school.

300
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,900
I'm no longer in society.

301
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,900
I don't know who I belong to.

302
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,820
My parents don't understand me.

303
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,780
We're like brothers and sisters.

304
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,660
We're about to break up.

305
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,500
We'll find new friends

306
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,660
in our own circle

307
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,980
and replace each other.

308
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,380
I think Amber thinks so too.

309
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,260
Silly girl.

310
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,380
You're wrong.

311
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,580
You belong to me.

312
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,980
You'll always belong to me.

313
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,300
Forever?

314
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,700
How long can it be?

315
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,940
I'm sorry.

316
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,660
I'm sorry.

317
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,020
I'm sorry.

318
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,220
I'm sorry.

319
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,420
I'm sorry.

320
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,620
I'm sorry.

321
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,820
I'm sorry.

322
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,020
I'm sorry.

323
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,220
I'm sorry.

324
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,420
I'm sorry.

325
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,620
I'm sorry.

326
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,820
I'm sorry.

327
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,020
I'm sorry.

328
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,220
I'm sorry.

329
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,420
I'm sorry.

330
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,620
I'm sorry.

331
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,820
I'm sorry.

332
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,020
I'm sorry.

333
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,220
I'm sorry.

334
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,420
I'm sorry.

335
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,620
I'm sorry.

336
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,820
I'm sorry.

337
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,020
I'm sorry.

338
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,220
I'm sorry.

339
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,220
I'm sorry.

340
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,460
I'm sorry.

341
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,860
I'm sorry.

342
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,380
This is for you?

343
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,340
Oh, don't forget.

344
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,300
Thank you, Amber.

345
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,900
Do you know my name?

346
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,900
I just paid attention when you offered to introduce .

347
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,900
I'll give it to you.

348
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,900
It's such an expensive gift. We just met.

349
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,900
I don't think it's a good idea to accept it.

350
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,900
Amber helped me find Hu Po.

351
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,900
It's also my fate with you.

352
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,900
Do you know?

353
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,900
Actually, I have a daughter who is as old as you.

354
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,900
I haven't seen her for 20 years.

355
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,900
I see you always think of her.

356
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,900
If she wants, I really want to make up for it.

357
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,900
I don't know if she's willing to accept me.

358
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,900
She must be willing to have such a good mother as you.

359
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,900
I've never seen my mother since I was a child.

360
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,900
The gifts you gave me these days are enough to make up for my childhood.

361
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,900
This is motherly love.

362
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,900
I just want to take the responsibility of a mother.

363
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,900
I owe her motherly love for the past 20 years.

364
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,900
I want to make up for it.

365
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,900
No one in this world knows you better than me.

366
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,900
I'm leaving.

367
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,900
Wait.

368
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,900
Amber.

369
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,900
Who did you say you gave birth to for 10 million?

370
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,900
I don't want mine.

371
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,900
I don't want it.

372
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,900
I have the FAA key.

373
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,900
How did you know I was here?

374
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,900
I looked for you all night and in many places.

375
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,900
Then my intuition told me you were here.

376
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,900
Everyone was looking for you.

377
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,900
But only I found you.

378
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,900
Because you are mine.

379
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,900
Okay, okay.

380
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,900
Let's stop crying.

381
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,900
What about you?

382
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,900
Don't tell me anything.

383
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,900
I know everything.

384
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,900
I'm like the clothes you took off.

385
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,900
No one wants me now.

386
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,900
How could it be?

387
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,900
You still have me.

388
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,900
I heard you disappeared.

389
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,900
Do you know how much I was worried about you?

390
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,900
Really?

391
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,900
I really have such a big influence on you.

392
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,900
Of course it's true.

393
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,900
Do you know?

394
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,900
You have shocked everyone.

395
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,900
Let's stop crying.

396
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,900
Do you know?

397
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,900
The plane just landed.

398
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,900
I was so worried.

399
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,900
I couldn't fly anymore.

400
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,900
I wanted to see you.

401
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,900
I was so happy.

402
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,900
You must be laughing at me.

403
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,900
You are so nice to me.

404
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,900
I should be.

405
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,900
I should be nice to you forever.

406
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,900
Aren't you in Beijing?

407
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,900
You scared me.

408
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,900
I can't let go of your aunt.

409
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,900
Great.

410
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,900
Let's sit down and eat together.

411
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,900
I'll make a call.

412
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,900
It's official.

413
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,900
Sit down.

414
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,900
Add some milk.

415
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,900
Thank you.

416
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,900
You tried so hard to get close to my dad.

417
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,900
What is it for?

418
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,900
If I tell you it's because of love,

419
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,900
will you believe it?

420
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,900
Who will believe it?

421
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,900
It doesn't matter.

422
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,900
It doesn't matter if the whole world doesn't believe it.

423
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,900
As long as your dad believes it,

424
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,900
it's enough.

425
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,900
Do you know that Amulet ran away from home last night?

426
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,900
It's expected.

427
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,900
It's a normal reaction.

428
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,900
Don't you worry about him?

429
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,900
As long as there is a bank card,

430
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,900
the biggest accident will be solved.

431
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,900
What do you want from my dad?

432
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,900
Guess.

433
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,900
I think your dad needs my help

434
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,900
to get the English market listed overseas.

435
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,900
We will get together soon.

436
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,900
But in terms of personal feelings,

437
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,900
it's still in the prime.

438
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,900
I won't let you hurt my dad.

439
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,900
I will tell him about you and Wu Yuting.

440
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,900
Whatever.

441
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,900
Anyway, I told him everything I knew.

442
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,900
He knows more than you do.

443
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,900
Maybe he can help you to learn something.

444
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,900
Change your opinion of me.

445
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,900
Do you think my dad will believe you?

446
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,900
Do you know how deep our relationship is?

447
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,900
I really don't know.

448
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,900
But I believe that his love for me

449
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,900
can tolerate any mistake.

450
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,900
I think this antique vase

451
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,900
is the most expensive one in this shelf.

452
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,900
Is it?

453
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,900
Good.

454
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,900
Put everything back.

455
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,900
Oh my God.

456
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,900
It's hard to move.

457
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,900
I'm really angry.

458
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,900
It's not me.

459
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,900
Who?

460
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,900
I'm sorry.

461
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,900
I'm just curious.

462
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,900
I want to take it back and have a look.

463
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,900
I didn't expect it to fall on the ground.

464
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,900
What should I do?

465
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,900
Life is bitter.

466
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,900
Don't care about the outside.

467
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,900
Are your hands okay?

468
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,900
It's okay.

469
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,900
Thank you.

470
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,900
I'm sorry.

471
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,900
I'm sorry.

472
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,900
I'm sorry.

473
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,900
It's okay.

474
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,900
Fortunately, it's okay.

475
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,900
But what if it breaks your love?

476
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,900
You are my love.

477
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,900
Did I scare you?

478
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,900
No.

479
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,900
Really?

480
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,900
It's okay.

481
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,900
Don't move.

482
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,900
I'll ask the maid to clean it.

483
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,900
I'll go to the maid.

484
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,900
You're not good at English.

485
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,900
Did you see it?

486
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,900
Guess.

487
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,900
I dare not break your family's fortune.

488
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,900
Do you want to try?

489
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,900
I'm sorry.

490
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:54,900
Daxiao, I know I don't have much time left.

491
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,900
I'm sorry.

492
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:00,900
I'm leaving you before you graduate from school.

493
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,900
Mom.

494
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,900
I want you to love your father.

495
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,900
And take him as your master.

496
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,900
I know.

497
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,900
Because in this world, you are his only family.

498
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,900
Do you understand?

499
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,900
I know.

500
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,900
This ring is the most precious thing for me.

501
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,900
Now, I will give it to you.

502
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,900
When you grow up,

503
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:41,900
you must give it to the woman who wants to spend the rest of her life with you.

504
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:48,900
You must take me to thank the owner of the ring.

505
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:53,900
Thank him for taking care of you until the end.

506
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:59,900
Thank him for making my little Dongdong happy.

507
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,900
Mom.

508
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,900
Let's go.

509
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,900
What's wrong?

510
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,900
Why are you looking at me?

511
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,900
Is there something on my face?

512
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,900
What is it?

513
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,900
What's wrong with you?

514
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,900
I don't know.

515
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,900
I just want to see you.

516
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,900
I don't know.

517
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,900
I don't know.

518
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,900
I just want to see you.

519
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,900
I don't know.

520
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,900
I don't know.

521
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,900
I don't know.

522
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,900
I don't know.

523
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,900
I don't know.

524
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,900
I don't know.

525
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,900
Mom.

526
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,900
I want to see you.

527
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,900
Let's go.

528
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,900
WhatHappens When You are Too Lonely

529
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,900
Hello!

530
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,900
Hello, I wish you Well Written Like a Dream

531
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,900
by me

532
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,900
This...

533
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,980
This is the only thing my mother left behind.

534
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,860
She asked me to give it to someone who can spend the rest of my life with me.

535
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,300
Gao Qi made my father and I get even worse.

536
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,700
I feel so lonely now.

537
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,780
My friends left me, my father left me.

538
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,260
If one day...

539
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,940
I lose you,

540
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,660
I really don't know how to live on.

541
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,220
Silly girl.

542
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,980
I won't leave you.

543
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,700
You won't lose me either.

544
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,380
No matter what happens,

545
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,580
I'll always be by your side.

546
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,220
How is it? Any further news?

547
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,900
Did you go to Gao Qi?

548
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,100
No.

549
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,820
Xia Yi spent the whole night in the FBI.

550
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:55,540
Then Kang Zirui found her and took her back to her apartment.

551
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:00,140
Mr. Wu, should we send someone to bring Xia back?

552
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,020
Let her be.

553
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,860
I don't want to get any worse with her.

554
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,340
Is there anything about Gao Qi?

555
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:17,780
Yin Youjing flew back to Shanghai after she knew about Gao Qi's accident.

556
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,260
Yin Youjing took Gao Qi and the head of the high-end bank,

557
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,060
Jin Chang, to have dinner at the restaurant.

558
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,140
It was probably a business cooperation.

559
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:29,700
It seems that she really doesn't care about Amber's safety.

560
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,140
She won't give up.

561
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,380
It's not over yet.

562
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,380
By the way,

563
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:43,620
are you dating Amber's classmate?

564
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,940
You mean Ouyang Qiao?

565
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,060
Give this to that girl.

566
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:56,460
Tell her to keep an eye on Amber's classmates.

567
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,260
Especially Han Dingyi.

568
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,180
Okay, I know.

569
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,900
Go.

570
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,380
Amber.

571
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,540
Amber.

572
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,860
You little bastard, you scared me.

573
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:22,980
I hit you, didn't I?

574
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,340
You scared me.

575
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,460
I'm sorry.

576
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,580
I'm sorry.

577
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,700
I'm sorry.

578
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,820
I'm sorry.

579
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,940
I'm sorry.

580
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,060
I'm sorry.

581
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,180
I'm sorry.

582
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,180
Where are you going?

583
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,500
Why don't you go to the restaurant?

584
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,620
I...

585
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,780
I'm going to buy you dinner.

586
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,860
I don't want my little princess to eat instant noodles at my house.

587
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,980
It's a shame.

588
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,980
What?

589
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,940
I heard your heartbeat.

590
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,820
She told me she was sincere.

591
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,300
You're kidding.

592
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,420
It seems that you're okay.

593
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,740
Oh, right.

594
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,180
Weiwei told me you were fine and wanted to see you.

595
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,180
I don't want anyone now.

596
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,780
I only want you.

597
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,980
Promise me.

598
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,180
Don't ever leave me, okay?

599
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,980
I promise you.

600
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,100
I'll always be with you.

601
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,580
I'll call the crew.

602
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,580
Tell them to rest for a few days.

603
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,940
I'll be with you.

604
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,300
I'll turn off the phone too.

605
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,620
I won't answer anyone's phone.

606
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,740
I'll stay with you quietly for the next two days.

607
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,900
You should call your father.

608
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,540
He'll be the one who worries the most when you come out.

609
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,620
Will he worry about me?

610
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,620
Their marriage is just a business bargaining chip.

611
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,660
Marriage and children are just tools for making money.

612
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,020
He's like that.

613
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,820
Gaoqi is like that too.

614
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,820
I've figured it out.

615
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:13,340
From now on, I won't tell Daddy everything.

616
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,740
I don't want him to control my life.

617
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,060
I don't want the one who loves me to suffer.

618
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,260
Okay.

619
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,860
From now on, I'll listen to you.

620
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,740
You're my man.

621
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,140
I won't talk to you.

622
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,660
It's your decision.

623
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,020
I'll listen to you.

624
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,500
We'll talk more later.

625
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,300
I'll wait for you at my hotel.

626
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,020
I need money.

627
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,660
It's a good service.

628
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,660
Really?

629
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,340
Of course.

630
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,340
Have fun.

631
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,420
Let's go.

632
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:09,020
I've been wandering around without a care.

633
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,020
But now I have you.

634
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,020
I want to stop for you.

635
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,020
I want to find a real home for us.

636
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,020
A home for our own world.

637
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,020
Really?

638
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,020
Really.

639
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,020
So I have to choose every little thing in the house?

640
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,020
Including me, it's all your fault.

641
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,020
That's great.

642
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,020
As long as you're happy.

643
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,020
How are you and An Mo?

644
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,020
I'm fine.

645
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:59,020
She just doesn't want to go home.

646
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,020
But I want to stop for her.

647
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,020
Give her a home.

648
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,020
What about you?

649
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,020
How are your father and Gao Qi?

650
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:10,020
You don't have a stepmother, do you?

651
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,020
My mother has been gone for so many years.

652
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,020
My father has never had a girlfriend.

653
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,020
It's this Gao Qi.

654
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,020
He made my father do something wrong.

655
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,020
He even discussed our company's affairs with him.

656
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:27,020
Lin Dong, feelings can't be stopped.

657
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,020
Besides,

658
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,020
do you think too much?

659
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,020
Does Gao Qi have that ability?

660
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,020
You're an artist.

661
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,020
You always think about your feelings so well.

662
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,020
Gao Qi is a businessman.

663
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,020
Mr. Snake,

664
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,020
my father married him,

665
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,020
so he has no benefits to our company.

666
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,020
By the way,

667
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,020
Gao Qi has a very good family.

668
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,020
Did he ask you and An Mo out today?

669
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,020
Yes.

670
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,020
If he doesn't get my father,

671
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,020
he will definitely seduce An Mo.

672
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,020
Because it's like he has the blood of Wu Yuting.

673
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:15,020
Are you worried that Gao Qi will use your father

674
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,020
to provoke Wu Yuting?

675
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,020
He wants to use them to provoke each other.

676
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,020
He will follow whoever gives him the best interests.

677
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,020
I hope Wu Yuting will win this time.

678
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,020
They are family after all.

679
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,020
Then my father will be safe.

680
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:38,020
Your father and An Bo's father are both businessmen.

681
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,020
It's not that easy to be fooled.

682
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:43,020
If a person moves on his feelings,

683
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,020
no matter how smart he is, he will become a brain.

684
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,020
Don't worry.

685
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,020
I met An Bo this afternoon.

686
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,020
I'll help you ask him.

687
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,020
Wu Yuting.

688
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,020
Hello, Mr. Wu.

689
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,020
Hello, Zirui.

690
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,020
Are you free recently?

691
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,020
I want to buy you a meal.

692
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,020
Do you want to inform An Bo?

693
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,020
Does he want to see me?

694
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,020
He has been away from home for three days.

695
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,020
Mr. Wu, don't worry.

696
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,020
I've been with him these days.

697
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,020
An Bo really misses you.

698
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,020
I want to ask you something.

699
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,020
Did An Bo meet his mother these days?

700
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,020
No.

701
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,020
Then I'm relieved.

702
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,020
Let's talk later.

703
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,020
I'll call you when I have time and place.

704
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,020
Bye.

705
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,020
Okay, bye.

706
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,020
Did you see that?

707
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,020
Even you were involved.

708
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,020
Do you know how powerful this woman is?

709
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,020
Don't you worry at all?

710
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,020
If I see my mother, I'll be unhappy.

711
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,020
You are now very curious about her.

712
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,020
How could something happen?

713
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,020
Look at the amber ring on your hand.

714
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,020
You know how much you care about her.

715
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,020
You really know me better.

716
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:26,020
But the most important thing is that she can accept us being together.

717
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,020
Because she wants to see us, not me.

718
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,020
I don't think so.

719
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:37,020
Maybe she wants to see you to find out about Wu Yuting.

720
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:43,020
Do you think she has feelings for my father?

721
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:46,020
She asked us to come here.

722
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:50,020
What does she want to say?

723
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,020
She is a passionate woman.

724
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,020
I don't think so.

725
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:58,020
Maybe she wants to tell you that Yingdong is going to be like you.

726
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,020
She is going to call you mommy.

727
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,020
Everyone has a time of their life.

728
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:07,020
I don't care about their love.

729
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,020
She is here.

730
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,020
I miss you so much.

731
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,020
How are you these days?

732
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,020
I'm fine.

733
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,020
I miss you so much.

734
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,020
I miss you so much.

735
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,020
I miss you so much.

736
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,020
I miss you so much.

737
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,020
I miss you so much.

738
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,020
I miss you so much.

739
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,020
I miss you so much.

740
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,020
I miss you so much.

741
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,020
I miss you so much.

742
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,020
I miss you so much.

743
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,020
I miss you so much.

744
