1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You

6
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
If I tell everyone in public that I have fallen in love with you

7
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Will you face it with me?

8
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
How about this?

9
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Give me a goodbye at last

10
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You

11
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's really beautiful

12
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's just

13
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
There is no feeling of love

14
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Feeling of love?

15
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
When you fall in love with someone

16
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The other person can feel it

17
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
When you are in love, the temperature will be different

18
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
There is a legend

19
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That if you kiss a boy

20
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The temperature of his lips is 38.4 degrees

21
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It means that he has fallen in love with you

22
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I can't tell you the exact temperature you just gave

23
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But he is cold

24
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
No temperature

25
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It means no feeling of love

26
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm sorry

27
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I let you down

28
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You can't accept my reason because you have another girl in your heart

29
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You don't understand who I'm talking about, do you?

30
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I really treat you all as my friends

31
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The most annoying thing for a woman is to be a good friend to a man who doesn't love her

32
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
If you don't like it, don't choose to be with her

33
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It turns out that the feeling of love with the first class leader is like this

34
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I have imagined the scene of us being together countless times

35
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
These days are the end of this dream

36
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But now

37
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The dream should wake up

38
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm sorry

39
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm not ready yet

40
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You are really cold

41
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You refuse to be so gentle

42
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
But what should I do?

43
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
This is exactly where you are most cruel

44
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
If you don't love her

45
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Don't choose to be good to her

46
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Because the heartless is more terrible than the heartless

47
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You will bring endless hope to others

48
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Actually you are very good

49
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Really

50
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What's the use of saying this now?

51
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Love a person doesn't need a reason

52
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And not loving a person needs a lot of reasons

53
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Just like two lovers who want to break up

54
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
In fact, it's just to make yourself not so guilty

55
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You are right

56
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I am really guilty now

57
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I won't give you a chance to reduce your guilt

58
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I want you to always be guilty

59
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Because you can always remember me like this

60
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You can see it after I leave

61
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Thank you for your company these days

62
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Thank you for forgiving my dream

63
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Thank you for leaving me this beautiful memory

64
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Goodbye

65
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
My first love

66
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The first love

67
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The first

68
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
When you see this letter

69
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's time for us to break up

70
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
These days are really happy

71
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Your reappearance

72
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Unleashed my heart

73
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
At the same time, it also made me understand

74
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Love is not something you can have by working hard

75
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Writing this letter to you is hoping you understand

76
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Who are you waiting for in your heart?

77
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The person you love doesn't love you

78
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And the person who has been loving you silently

79
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You pretend to be invisible

80
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Everyone in the life of another person has his own meaning

81
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Thank you

82
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Forgive me for my first love dream

83
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Come on

84
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Han Dingyi

85
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yesterday, the restaurant in the flower room received a second god's order

86
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm really a little busy

87
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Fortunately, Dingyi ended the date early and came back to help me

88
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Seeing him, I am happy and sad

89
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What makes me happy is that he cares about me

90
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What makes me sad is that the person by his side will never be me

91
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Coming

92
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Dingyi

93
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Didn't you go on a date with Eli?

94
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
He went back

95
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You came to find Jiajia, right?

96
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
He hasn't come back from the date with Yindong

97
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I came to find you

98
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
There are some things I want to tell you clearly

99
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Come in

100
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Come in

101
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Did something happen between you and Eli?

102
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Nothing

103
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
He said that I had a difference in my imagination

104
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Eli said that I have someone I can't trust

105
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
He wanted me to have the courage to reject the person who doesn't love me

106
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
To accept the person who loves me

107
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Weiwei

108
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Actually in my heart

109
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
There is something I can't say

110
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Do you want some fruit? I'll wash it for you

111
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Listen to me

112
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Actually I know that you are very good to me

113
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I put all the good things you did to me in my heart

114
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I can't say it

115
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm afraid that after I say it

116
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Our relationship is not like before

117
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm afraid of losing you as a friend

118
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You are very important to me

119
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You are also a very important friend to me

120
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I have no parents since I was a child

121
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
The small kitchen of Jiajia gave me a sense of home

122
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Every time I see a family of three coming to eat

123
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I feel like I'm cooking for my own family

124
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Including the feeling of love for me

125
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I feel like I'm a family

126
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Including the feeling of love for me

127
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I can feel the happiness of every customer coming to the store

128
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I don't know why

129
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I am very happy to see others happy

130
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I don't think you need to feel too much pressure on yourself

131
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The reason why I gave so much for love

132
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Is because I want to keep this happiness

133
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The reason why I treat you so well

134
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Is because I'm afraid of losing you as a friend like a brother

135
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You feel the same way, right?

136
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Yes, we are best friends

137
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But Feifei

138
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm back

139
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Jiajia

140
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Dingyi, you are here too

141
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What is that?

142
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Chicken soup

143
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You are so busy and tired recently

144
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'll make some chicken soup for you

145
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Great, I can drink chicken soup now

146
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Then you talk to Dingyi first

147
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'll go heat up the chicken soup

148
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Ok

149
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Did I interrupt something?

150
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
No, you came just in time

151
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Didn't you go on a date with Eddy?

152
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yes, I did

153
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
How was it? Was it romantic?

154
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
He said that I was not what he thought

155
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But I think this kind of romance

156
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Is not something that ordinary people can experience

157
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I really envy you

158
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I really envy you

159
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I really envy you

160
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I think Eddy is so romantic

161
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
For a word you said back then

162
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
He can become a famous singer from a girl with a big mouth

163
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
If he can have half of the Indian people

164
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I will be satisfied

165
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
But I don't want this kind of happiness

166
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Did you not have any feelings for him in the past few days?

167
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
No

168
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Because I have someone else in my heart

169
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
How are you?

170
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
How have you been recently?

171
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
How was it?

172
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It was good

173
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
How about you?

174
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I was pretty good

175
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Pretty good

176
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I got new hair

177
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I want to start from the bottom

178
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It suits you

179
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Thank you

180
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You came to play football?

181
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I came to do the concert

182
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Eddy is going to be the producer

183
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I know

184
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I will go too

185
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Then I

186
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Lend me 50 yuan

187
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I forgot to bring my wallet

188
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Is Eddy hungry?

189
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Okay

190
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I want to give it to Hua Yunxi

191
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But I'm afraid she doesn't want it

192
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
She is your younger boyfriend

193
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm sorry

194
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm sorry

195
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm sorry

196
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm sorry

197
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm sorry

198
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm sorry

199
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm sorry

200
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm sorry

201
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm sorry

202
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm sorry

203
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm sorry

204
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
My first boyfriend is so handsome

205
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
He is so good

206
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So cute

207
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
What should I do next?

208
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Eddy gave you your wallet

209
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Is it beautiful?

210
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So expensive

211
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You threw away your dirty clothes

212
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
and your wallet

213
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Can't you hear me?

214
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Give it to me

215
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
No

216
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
No

217
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
This is from a stupid girl named Hua Yunxi

218
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Bye

219
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You think you are a treasure?

220
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Thank you

221
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Thank you

222
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Hua Yunxi

223
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Hua Yunxi

224
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Wait

225
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Why are you here?

226
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Aren't you going to a meeting?

227
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I wanted to see you so much

228
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So I lied to them

229
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You have been so busy these days

230
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I hope our relationship won't be affected

231
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I miss you

232
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You are not good at doing things

233
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You are passionate and serious

234
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
But you are too reckless

235
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I will meet Eddy and Kang Zirui later

236
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
to talk about the movie

237
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You should come with me

238
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Okay

239
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Then I will have to go to class

240
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Take care

241
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Okay

242
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
This is the first time they have to go on a movie

243
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You should come with me

244
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Dad

245
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Hands

246
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Hands

247
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Hands off

248
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I told you not to go to the meeting

249
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
But you didn't listen

250
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
What happened?

251
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You are in love

252
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You are going on a long trip

253
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
But dad

254
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What happened?

255
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What happened?

256
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Dad

257
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Why are you here?

258
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Be serious

259
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Why am I here?

260
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I am here to see the house

261
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
For you

262
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
But you

263
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
For this girl

264
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You

265
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Hello

266
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
What?

267
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Come with me

268
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I will go with you

269
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I won't waste your time

270
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Just a ride

271
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Dad, actually I

272
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Okay, don't admit your mistake

273
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It doesn't matter if you are in love

274
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
But you can't have love

275
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You don't care about anything

276
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Okay, let's talk about the company first

277
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
We had a meeting this morning

278
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
We had a problem with our company

279
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
The stock price has been dropping for the past two days

280
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Why?

281
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Wu Yuting is behind it

282
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I checked it

283
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Her company is going to be listed

284
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
She has a plan to do this

285
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
This

286
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
This is impossible

287
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Uncle Wu has always been in good terms with our family

288
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Usually it looks good

289
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
But you remember

290
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
In this world

291
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
There is no eternal friend

292
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Some are just forever

293
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
If you are in love with Wu Anbo

294
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Then I am in love with my uncle

295
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I won't be so hard on you

296
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I used to close my eyes

297
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Now I can't

298
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I want to remind you

299
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Don't be too deep

300
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
That girl doesn't deserve you

301
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You have no future

302
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Dad

303
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I think you need to give the player a chance

304
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
He has a lot of artistic talent

305
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
His paintings are very popular in Europe

306
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I believe he will become a famous painter

307
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Give him some time

308
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I have seen too many girls like this

309
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Who wants to marry a rich girl?

310
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Xu Rongxin, Xin Ji

311
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Which one doesn't?

312
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Dad is not a feudal lord

313
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I don't want to suppress you

314
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
If you two really love each other

315
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It's okay

316
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It can be a relationship

317
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You can live together

318
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's okay

319
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
But I remind you

320
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
My daughter-in-law

321
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Must be the family

322
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Bring benefits and honor

323
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Son, you are my only family

324
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I don't want to make a scene

325
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And make her unhappy

326
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Okay, now you tell me

327
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
How is it going?

328
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Or I'll go to I.D. and Kang Zirui first

329
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Can you still come?

330
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Back to the company

331
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Dad loves your son so much

332
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
What's wrong?

333
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You don't eat or drink?

334
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Waiting for the sports?

335
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I can't eat

336
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Why don't you call him?

337
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
His phone is off

338
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm sorry

339
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm sorry

340
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm sorry

341
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm sorry

342
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm sorry

343
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm sorry

344
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm sorry

345
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
He sent me a message

346
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
He said he couldn't come to the meeting

347
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And the investment movie

348
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It's cut

349
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
We can only see how Amber is doing

350
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Then will you tell Amber?

351
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
If I can tell Amber

352
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Yingdong won't appear

353
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's okay

354
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Let's put this aside

355
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Yingdong said

356
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You don't have to return the deposit

357
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Tell him I'll return it to him

358
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I won't take it if it's not mine

359
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
What's wrong?

360
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I'm sorry

361
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I didn't pay attention to what you were saying

362
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm sorry

363
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I wasted your time

364
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You have to adjust your emotions first

365
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Actually

366
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
After what happened to Han Dingyi

367
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I know that the more you do, the more you are part of life

368
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm fine

369
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'm fine

370
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I at least taught you guys

371
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
At least I have a school concert

372
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Eddy

373
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
You are really different

374
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
You can become a beauty

375
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And a beauty

376
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
You have the tenderness of a woman

377
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
And the good spirit of a man

378
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I admire you

379
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I sound like a monster

380
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
In fact, it's all life's work

381
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
People really have to handle their feelings well

382
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
If this is not handled well

383
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Then nothing can be done well

384
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
What are you taking, Brother Kang?

385
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I'm taking something

386
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Han Dingyi

387
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Eddy, it's so lively here

388
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Why are you here?

389
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
What?

390
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Do you have a current girlfriend?

391
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I can't come to see you as a ex-girlfriend

392
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
You don't welcome me?

393
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Of course I welcome you

394
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I haven't seen you for a few days

395
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
You miss me?

396
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Stop it

397
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I miss you

398
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I miss you

399
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I'm not like someone

400
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Who doesn't say anything in his heart

401
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I'm a straightforward person

402
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I'm straightforward

403
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Oh, right

404
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I'm here to see our Mr. Kang

405
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Really?

406
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Did you see that?

407
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Someone misses me

408
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Look

409
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I'm getting jealous

410
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Oh, right

411
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
What were you guys busy with?

412
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I'm here to help

413
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Sure

414
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Here

415
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Give me the coffee beans

416
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I'll go get them

417
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Okay

418
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I just remembered

419
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
There's a cafe waiting for me to talk business

420
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I'll go first

421
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Kang Weiwei is the chef

422
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Shouldn't the boss go first when it comes to business?

423
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I'll go then

424
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
You go first

425
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Okay, bye bye

426
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Bye bye

427
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It's so beautiful here

428
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Let me show you

429
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I've never really seen this place

430
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
It must have taken a lot of effort to find you and the first class monitor

431
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It's so beautiful

432
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It's so beautiful

433
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I really like flowers that grow in the mud

434
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Why?

435
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Because they're alive

436
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
They're green

437
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
They grow under the sun

438
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
The flowers in the flower shop

439
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,680
are like white

440
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
They're the brightest life in the end

441
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
But how many people

442
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
will go to the fields to see flowers?

443
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
If you don't cut them off

444
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
they'll only rot in the mud

445
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
So

446
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
send her to the flower shop

447
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Wait for the person who appreciates her

448
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
to take them back

449
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Yes

450
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Just like Aiqi

451
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
When she's in a hurry

452
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
don't stop her

453
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
She must find someone who appreciates her

454
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
and cherishes her

455
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Even if it's a short-term war

456
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
it's a happy one

457
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Here

458
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
This flower

459
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
represents the man you love

460
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Thank you

461
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
This one

462
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
represents the man you love

463
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
It's for you

464
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
You're so lucky

465
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
You love Li Jie and give her flowers

466
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Be brave

467
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Go chase your dream of love

468
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Not a big problem

469
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
But lower the accompaniment later

470
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I want to hear my voice more

471
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Let me introduce you

472
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
You've worked hard, have some water

473
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You gave up the chance to be taken away

474
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
You're still a rich man

475
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Don't talk nonsense

476
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I'm over there

477
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Let me introduce you

478
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Here he comes

479
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
You're here together

480
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Yes

481
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Let me introduce you

482
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
This is Sun Yong, the boss of our record company

483
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
This is Han Dingyi

484
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
This is Hua Youxi

485
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Hello

486
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
You're Dingyi?

487
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Ai often reminds me of you

488
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Thank you for encouraging her to develop in the record business

489
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
It's all her talent

490
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
She's very young

491
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
She's old

492
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Now the record business is facing young people

493
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I should communicate with you more

494
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
My business card is in the car

495
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I'll go get it

496
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Do you need anything?

497
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
No, I have so many classmates here to help me

498
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
You can sing for me later

499
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Excuse me

500
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Brother, you really lost your love this time

501
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I have to try it

502
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
The feeling of losing love

503
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Don't pretend to be in pain here

504
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
The pain that men get in love

505
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Is always less than women

506
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You haven't loved

507
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
How did you come to lose your love?

508
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I'm a little bit disappointed

509
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Good

510
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
It's good to give me a place to be disappointed

511
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
It seems that you are a very cheerful person

512
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Of course

513
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Women's youth is very precious

514
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I don't want to keep holding on to those things

515
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I can't hold on to

516
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I love him

517
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
He doesn't love me

518
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I don't want it

519
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
What about the man he loves me and I don't love him?

520
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I don't want to be with him

521
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
The man who loves me and I don't love him

522
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I can't let him wait, right?

523
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I said it's not you

524
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Actually, I'm talking about Sun Yong

525
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
He's been chasing me

526
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I'm running away from him

527
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
After finding you

528
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
It's the end of my first love in my heart

529
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I need to continue with love

530
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
So now I'm in business and love

531
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I signed him as my agent

532
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
First love always makes a lot of girls see love

533
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Always in sacrifice

534
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Waiting for those missed happiness

535
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Okay, okay, okay, don't come out

536
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Before you talk about it

537
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I'll go in and get you something to eat and drink

538
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
In fact, Mei Bao is really a very good girl

539
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Especially she missed me

540
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Is it your brother who missed you alone?

541
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
You don't have to play with Mei anymore

542
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I'll go try it

543
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
President Gao

544
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
President Gao

545
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
It's been hard on you to fly from New York to Shanghai

546
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I'm the kind of person who feels tired even when I'm having a headache

547
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I'm sorry

548
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I hate it when people do things without careful consideration

549
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
You have to remember

550
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Don't make such a low-level mistake again

551
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Yes

552
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
My bag is more precious than anyone else

553
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Yes

554
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
President Gao

555
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I remember all the obstacles I used to be helpless

556
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Let those times wait again

557
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Meet again today after many years

558
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I ran to pretend to meet strangers

559
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
But seeing your strange and familiar face

560
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Still has the courage to smile with you

561
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Are you okay now?

562
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Am I okay now?

563
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
You

564
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I knew you and I would never meet again

565
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:20,000
But I still hope you can live a good life

566
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,000
This feeling is not related to love

567
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:34,000
It's just a proof that we were once happy together

568
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Thank you for being the warmest companion to me

569
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Thank you

570
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
There is a 30-person party in our flower shop today

571
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I went to prepare in the morning

572
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I don't know how he is preparing now

573
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Go and have a look

574
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Weiwei

575
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Is the flower shop called the return class?

576
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Besides, you are the supervisor of this concert

577
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Can't walk away

578
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Then I, Mr. Kang, will take care of you

579
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
When I go back, I will see you live the same way

580
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Can you do it alone?

581
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
You forgot

582
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
And that four-point little chicken Wang Dongyu

583
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
He will come back to me later

584
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
OK, I'll see you here

585
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
You have not decided

586
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I won't leave

587
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
You are still here

588
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Of course

589
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Didn't we agree that we would never meet again?

590
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
What if I forgot?

591
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Then I'll wait until the morning of the second day

592
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
You have to open the door

593
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Wait for me

594
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
You will wait for me

595
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I will wait for you

596
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I will wait for you

597
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I will wait for you

598
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I will wait for you

599
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Open the door

600
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
By then, I will look at you like this

601
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Make you feel guilty, make you do nothing wrong

602
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
No way

603
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
You take it seriously

604
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I say you are like this

605
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Can't tell which is true and which is false

606
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
If you really don't come

607
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And the song of Sister Eli is with me

608
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And the flower she gave me

609
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I will wait for you

610
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Sister Eli is gone

611
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
The concert is over

612
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Only this flower is left

613
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And her photo

614
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Yes, it's over

615
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
But how unreal it is all

616
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
You are the first person

617
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
How do you feel unreal?

618
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I didn't expect I could appear in someone else's dream

619
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
And it's my first love

620
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
In fact, you appear in many people's dreams

621
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
But you don't even know yourself

622
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Weiwei, you remember me

623
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Don't wait for me in the future

624
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Okay?

625
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
What do you mean?

626
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I don't understand

627
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
In the future, you can tell me if you want to find me

628
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
You wait for me, you also tell me

629
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I don't want you to wait alone

630
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I know it's hard to wait alone

631
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Because I have been through it

632
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Come on, son

633
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Let's talk

634
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Okay

635
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I feel uncomfortable today

636
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Because Eli is gone

637
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I like him very much

638
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
He has the shadow of his mother when he was young

639
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
He can do anything

640
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
But he is not good at it

641
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I don't know

642
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I don't know

643
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I don't know

644
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I have the shadow of my mother when she was young

645
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
She can do anything without turning back

646
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
But Eli doesn't like him

647
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And he doesn't like you

648
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
That's the feeling

649
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
One person runs, one person chases

650
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
One day the person who chases is tired and doesn't chase

651
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
The fate is broken

652
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
This is the first love

653
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
One person is persistent and one person is retarded

654
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
So first love is often bitter

655
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
It's all random

656
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Mom, who is your first love?

657
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
My first love is your father

658
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Then what kind of person is my father?

659
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Your father is a man who has no responsibility at all

660
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
A man who has no responsibility at all

661
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
So your first love is bitter?

662
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
No

663
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
My first love is also beautiful

664
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
It's true when he loves me

665
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
But every love has a preservation period

666
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
When time passes, it feels gone

667
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Mom, do you regret it?

668
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
No

669
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I have to thank him

670
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Because he made me have a son who is completely different from him

671
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
You are responsible and responsible

672
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
You are dedicated and dedicated

673
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
You are my pride

674
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I am very lucky to have you

675
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Mom, I am actually very lucky too

676
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Can have a mother who dares to love and hate

677
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Mom, then what kind of person is my father?

678
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Your father

679
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
It's unfair

680
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
You should like this

681
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
If you don't like it, I'll put it back

682
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Are you giving me flowers?

683
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Yes

684
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Weiwei, remember me

685
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Don't wait for me too stupidly

686
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
You wait for me, you also tell me

687
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I don't want you to wait for me too stupidly

688
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I'm leaving for so long

689
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I didn't expect it to become so charming

690
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
President Gao

691
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I'm sorry

692
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I'm sorry

693
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I'm sorry

694
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I'm sorry

695
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I'm sorry

696
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I'm sorry

697
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
The business card you asked for has been printed

698
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Good

699
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I have been away for 20 years

700
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I am now back with international honor and success

701
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
If I see you again

702
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Maybe I will reduce my hatred a little bit

703
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Maybe

704
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I don't need any reason to wait until the end

705
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:03,000
If you have experienced too much, it is all unexpected

706
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I don't need any excuse to wait until the end

707
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:17,000
When you need it most, you can be proud of yourself in heaven

708
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Da da da da da da da da da da

709
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,000
There is a saying, don't say it out loud

710
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,000
You will not hesitate to reach out

711
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:50,000
You are the wind for me, you are the rain for me

712
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Teach me to stop, and move forward

713
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I have been hurt, and hurt, and hurt

714
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I must have you to cry with me

715
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Let's shout together, let's keep our mouth shut together

716
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Let's stay on the street where we are drunk

717
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,000
We have been the best, we don't need any reason

718
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:37,000
If you have experienced too much, it is all unexpected

719
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I don't need any excuse to wait until the end

720
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:50,000
When you need it most, you can be proud of yourself in heaven

721
00:44:51,000 --> 00:45:00,000
In our era, let's be together

722
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Let's stay together
