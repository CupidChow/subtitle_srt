00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 9

2
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Feifei, put down your bag.

3
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Mengjie will show you around.

4
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Come on, let's go.

5
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This used to be a flower shop.

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But my son turned it into a restaurant.

7
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
All of these are designed by Dingyi.

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Look, is it beautiful?

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's beautiful.

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Mengjie, can I take a picture?

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Of course.

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This painting was painted by Wanjia.

13
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If you're not feeling well,

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
you can take a rest.

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
No need.

17
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'll use the knife.

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What?

19
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'll make you a Coke.

20
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No need.

21
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I can make it myself.

22
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'll make it myself.

23
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This is fruit.

24
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Mom, you brought your friend here?

25
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yes.

26
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Why did you come to my restaurant?

27
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What's your name?

28
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You don't know your classmate's name?

29
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay, let me introduce you.

30
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
His name is Ye Feifei.

31
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
He's as cute as a human.

32
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You're getting along with my mom so fast?

33
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes, I'm getting along with her.

34
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And I'll help her in her restaurant.

35
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yes.

36
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So fast?

37
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You're in the family now?

38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You're here for my son, right?

39
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You don't know me.

40
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Although I have a special taste,

41
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
but you...

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You're not a good boy.

44
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
How can you talk like that?

45
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You're rude.

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Feifei, ignore him.

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'll go and see if I need help.

49
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You got a cold?

50
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
How do you know?

51
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You'll know when you're in love.

52
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Love is like a cold.

53
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Everyone will experience it.

54
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
When a relationship ends,

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
you may feel pain,

56
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
but you'll get over it.

57
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
When you get a cold,

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
you'll have another one.

59
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And you'll have a new one.

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You'll get more and more immune.

61
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

62
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
When a relationship ends,

63
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
the one who left first will not feel so much pain.

64
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The rest will remember you forever.

65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You'll remember the loneliness that was left behind.

66
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You must be born soon.

67
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
This is a kind of liberation.

68
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

69
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You shouldn't touch anyone

70
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
who can affect your happiness.

71
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Do you understand?

72
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Let me help you.

73
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

74
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm looking for someone,

75
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
but I don't know if he lives in America.

76
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'll just go to the next door.

77
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That's right.

78
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Young people like to hide things.

79
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Is it so fun to love?

80
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's so simple to love someone

81
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
in our generation.

82
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Look how tired you are.

83
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
That's right.

84
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Just put on a mask.

85
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What are you doing?

86
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The guardian god.

87
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Weiwei is sick.

88
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Aren't you going to see her?

89
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Do you want me to make you some meat?

90
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm not going to make you some meat.

91
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Only me.

92
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You're sick, right?

94
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Have some fruit.

95
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I want to make it clear.

96
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Great.

97
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I have something to tell you.

98
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You go first.

99
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You go first.

100
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That Ye Fei Fei is weird.

101
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
She always wants to get close to you.

102
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Stay away from her.

103
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You're too generous.

104
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Ye Fei Fei treats me very well.

105
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I think she's a nice person.

106
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Wei Fei.

107
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I know.

108
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I didn't refuse to hurt you.

109
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Don't worry.

110
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You're not that important.

111
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And...

112
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I've learned today

113
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
how good it is to be taken care of.

114
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I finally understand

115
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
why Jia Jia always wants to be with me.

116
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Because it's great to be taken care of,

117
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
to be valued,

118
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
to be put in the top position.

119
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Wan Jia said she was fine

120
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and wanted to leave the hospital.

121
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
She'll be back tomorrow.

122
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Your brother and I are going to pick her up.

123
00:09:47,000 --> 00:10:02,180
My brother Zhang Hai is already a

124
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,180
I want to see if my paper can be finished.

125
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,180
And...

126
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,180
I've already decided to completely erase

127
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,180
the memories between you and me.

128
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,180
We just didn't start.

129
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,180
Nothing happened.

130
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,180
It's late.

131
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,180
Go back.

132
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,180
Go back.

133
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:16,180
Pablo, don't lie about you or意

134
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,180
Look, Grandpa,

135
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,180
who took Ivy in from江Creator,

136
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,180
Église cach Speak.

137
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:33,740
Before you leave, I want to send you a magazine.

138
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,620
Wu Yuting has a illegitimate child.

139
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,700
It's exciting enough, isn't it?

140
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,540
I can give you all the information,

141
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,540
but you have to promise me one thing.

142
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,020
You have to make the whole world think

143
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,220
that it's the mother of the illegitimate child

144
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,700
who wants to divide Wu Yuting's assets.

145
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,180
The End

146
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,780
Do you like it?

147
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,740
I won't accept the flowers you gave me.

148
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,060
Take it away.

149
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,020
These flowers are not for you.

150
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,700
I'm asking you to take them to the family.

151
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
You haven't seen Jia Jia and you.

152
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,100
Why did you give her flowers?

153
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,340
It's a kind of romance to give flowers to strangers.

154
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,460
Besides, the family can influence your happiness and sadness.

155
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,180
You'll be happy when she's happy.

156
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,500
Why?

157
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,300
There's no such reason.

158
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,420
You still蛋.

159
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,460
Hey, come here.

160
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,740
I finally caught you.

161
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,140
Tell me, why did you frame me?

162
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,700
Frame you for what?

163
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,900
That night at the Internet cafe, I saw you were asleep,

164
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,940
and I was afraid you would catch a cold, so I put a piece of clothing on you.

165
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,540
Why did I harass you?

166
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,220
You're a soldier, aren't you?

167
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,780
No wonder there are fewer and fewer people who do good deeds.

168
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,940
I just said it casually.

169
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,380
Everyone believed it.

170
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,740
What does that prove?

171
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,220
It proves that you are of a poor character.

172
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,860
And you can do that kind of thing,

173
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,420
so everyone will frame you.

174
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,940
If you were a decent person,

175
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,540
who would believe me?

176
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,100
Do you know that you hurt me so casually?

177
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,500
Your father thinks I'm a thorn in his side

178
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,380
because of you.

179
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,100
I almost got my graduation certificate.

180
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:16,940
Besides,

181
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,900
now everyone in school thinks I'm a wolf.

182
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,620
I'm so naive and so young,

183
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,820
and I'm ruined by you.

184
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,820
I'm sorry.

185
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,660
I didn't know it would turn out like this.

186
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,980
You're so boring.

187
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,200
If nothing else,

188
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,660
there is no reason to hide your embarrassing face.

189
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,940
I know.

190
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,460
This is R voilà.

191
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,940
As if no one else would look at you.

192
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,540
You're the best.

193
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,820
I'm sorry.

194
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,860
Nobody ever sees that scene.

195
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,060
Well,

196
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,700
that's one way to say goodbye.

197
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,340
Be a good girl and do something.

198
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,620
Oh, yes.

199
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,620
It's not like that.

200
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,620
Why is Yiding so ungrateful?

201
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,620
He treats everyone well.

202
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,620
He's not even as good as Hua Youxi.

203
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,620
Look, how decisive Hua Youxi is.

204
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,620
Meiba, do you think

205
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,620
we're still the same?

206
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,620
Will there be no friendship

207
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,620
because of love?

208
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,620
I don't know.

209
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,620
I don't know.

210
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,620
Yiding.

211
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,620
Zi Rui.

212
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,620
Congratulations.

213
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,620
You're finally here.

214
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,620
This is for you.

215
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,620
Thank you.

216
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,620
As long as you're not angry,

217
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,620
Weiwei won't be angry with me.

218
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,620
Where's Weiwei?

219
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,620
She's in the press conference.

220
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,620
She can't come.

221
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,620
She's the one everyone wants to see.

222
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,620
Okay, let's go home.

223
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,620
Let's go.

224
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,620
Let's go.

225
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,620
Wait a little longer.

226
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,620
Why are they here?

227
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,620
Wanjia sent me a message.

228
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,620
Mr. Wanjia.

229
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,620
Are you okay?

230
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,620
Is your father okay?

231
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,620
Did the company's crisis pass?

232
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,620
My father is still in good health.

233
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,620
The company's business

234
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,620
is being handled by his father.

235
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,620
Are you feeling better?

236
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,620
Much better.

237
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,620
My mother has been coming to the hospital

238
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,620
to make me a lot of delicious food.

239
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,620
My stomach is growing.

240
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,620
I'll drive you home later.

241
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,620
I'll ask Yindong to take their car back.

242
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,620
It's okay.

243
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,620
You two are a perfect match.

244
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,620
You'll always be good friends.

245
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,620
Where's Weiwei?

246
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,620
She's in the press conference.

247
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,620
She can't come.

248
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,620
Let's go home.

249
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,620
Whose business do you want to do?

250
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,620
Mr. Kang is here.

251
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,620
My sister is here.

252
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,620
I remember the first time I rode a bike.

253
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,620
You waited for me here.

254
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,620
Of course I did.

255
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,620
I asked you,

256
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,620
how dangerous it was to ride this little car.

257
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,620
You told me,

258
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,620
as long as you're here,

259
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,620
you'll always protect me.

260
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,620
This flower is for you.

261
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,620
Who are you going with?

262
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,620
I don't need to tell you.

263
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,620
You're always in my life.

264
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,620
I have the right to be with you.

265
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,620
Zi Rui,

266
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,620
I'll leave these things to you.

267
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,620
Don't worry about them.

268
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,620
I'm leaving.

269
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,620
Bye.

270
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,620
Let's go.

271
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,620
Bye.

272
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,620
Bye.

273
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,620
By the way,

274
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,620
why didn't Hua Xiaoxi come?

275
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,620
She's been picking up the rotten peach blossoms.

276
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,620
Let's go.

277
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,620
We're leaving.

278
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,620
Ride slowly.

279
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,620
Be careful.

280
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,620
Bye.

281
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,620
Bye.

282
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,620
Bye.

283
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,620
Damn it.

284
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,620
What's wrong?

285
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,620
Who dumped you?

286
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,620
Think about it.

287
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,620
My life in the 21st and 22nd

288
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,620
is really strange.

289
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,620
On the surface,

290
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,620
it's full of glory,

291
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,620
but it's also lively and cool.

292
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,620
But in fact,

293
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,620
it's famous.

294
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,620
Mom doesn't love me,

295
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,620
but I don't love you.

296
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,620
I'm not a good person.

297
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,620
I'm not a good person.

298
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,620
Mom doesn't love me,

299
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,620
but I don't love you.

300
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,620
All the women who have been with me hate me.

301
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,620
I guess my dad won't recognize me

302
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,620
if he sees me like this.

303
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,620
I'm so confused.

304
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,620
What kind of dad

305
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,620
can give birth to a talented person like me?

306
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,620
So

307
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,620
you haven't seen your dad, have you?

308
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,620
But

309
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,620
yesterday

310
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,620
when I was helping Mengjie

311
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,620
to move things home,

312
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,620
I saw a photo in your room.

313
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,620
There is a photo

314
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,620
taken by Mengjie

315
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,620
when she was pregnant.

316
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,620
It was taken by a man.

317
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,620
But my mom was afraid

318
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,620
that I would have a shadow in my childhood.

319
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,620
So she took it

320
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,620
from a stranger on the way.

321
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,620
She wanted to

322
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,620
comfort my childhood.

323
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,620
But how did you know?

324
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,620
My mom told me once when she was drunk.

325
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,620
And the photo in my brother's room

326
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,620
is the same.

327
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,620
But

328
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,620
your brother's surname is Han.

329
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,620
But your mother's surname is Yu.

330
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,620
It seems

331
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,620
your mother doesn't want to listen to you.

332
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,620
I don't know why.

333
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,620
It must be a painful memory.

334
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,620
But I don't think

335
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,620
my life is that ordinary.

336
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,620
I think so.

337
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,620
Sorry, I have to answer the phone.

338
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,620
Don't worry.

339
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,620
You are in my hands now.

340
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,620
I will find out

341
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,620
the real relationship between

342
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,620
Hua Youxi and Wu Yuting.

343
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,620
When necessary,

344
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,620
I will use my special means

345
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,620
to make Wu Yuting admit

346
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,620
the fact that she doesn't want to admit.

347
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,620
These gossip magazines are really good.

348
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,620
They can dig up

349
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,620
any kind of material.

350
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,620
They can write any kind of title.

351
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,620
Boss,

352
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,620
do you want me to send them a lawyer letter?

353
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,620
No.

354
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,620
This is to help them

355
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,620
make things more public.

356
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,620
These gossip reporters

357
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,620
will continue to chase things

358
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,620
like a serial drama.

359
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,620
They won't respond.

360
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,620
They will just keep on

361
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,620
doing it.

362
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,620
They will just keep on

363
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,620
chasing things like a serial drama.

364
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,620
It's best if they don't respond.

365
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,620
Any news from overseas?

366
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,620
The high-end funds have evaporated.

367
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,620
They are missing in the US.

368
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,620
They have disappeared completely.

369
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,620
I think they have changed their

370
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,620
new identity and moved abroad.

371
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,620
They haven't changed at all.

372
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,620
They can cut off all ties

373
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,620
with the past

374
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,620
for a big business.

375
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,620
But once they have new benefits,

376
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,620
they can come back

377
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,620
in a way that they can't.

378
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,620
Boss,

379
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,620
if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

380
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,620
I wouldn't have thought

381
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,620
that such a powerful woman would be here.

382
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,620
You haven't even been born

383
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,620
when she was getting the crystal.

384
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,620
Thank God for helping me this time.

385
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,620
I was able to clear my mind

386
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,620
and get out of bed in time

387
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,620
at the most critical moment.

388
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,620
Otherwise,

389
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,620
the person who was lying on the hospital bed

390
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,620
would be me

391
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,620
instead of Ying Youjin.

392
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,620
So, young people

393
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,620
should take it as a warning.

394
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,620
If you lose your sense of reason,

395
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,620
you will be in trouble.

396
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,620
I understand.

397
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,620
How is Ying's condition?

398
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,620
The expert has been diagnosed with a few rounds of the disease.

399
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,620
He has been paralyzed after the stroke.

400
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,620
And he hasn't even

401
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,620
fully regained consciousness.

402
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,620
He will be able to recover in a short time.

403
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,620
I'm afraid it's impossible.

404
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,620
I'm afraid that money is in the bank

405
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,620
and people are in heaven.

406
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,620
It's not easy for Ying Dong.

407
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,620
How is it?

408
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,620
Can he handle it?

409
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,620
Boss, as you expected,

410
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,620
a group of bankers are playing tricks on him.

411
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,620
But since yesterday,

412
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,620
Miss has used her assets as collateral

413
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,620
to lend to several big banks.

414
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,620
I know that.

415
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,620
Several bank bank leaders have called me.

416
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,620
Amber just wants to force me

417
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,620
to face this matter.

418
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,620
Is she really dating Ying Dong?

419
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,620
I've sent you their phone records.

420
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,620
I think Miss just wants to borrow Ying Dong

421
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,620
to forget about Kang Zirui.

422
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,620
She used to want to borrow Kang Zirui

423
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,620
to forget about Ying Dong.

424
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,620
Mr. Wu, Mr. Ying is here.

425
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,620
I'm going out.

426
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,620
Morning, Uncle.

427
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,620
Ying Dong, you're early.

428
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,620
Amber wants to have breakfast with me.

429
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,620
Sit.

430
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,620
The messages are all lies.

431
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,620
Did Miss He say that love has a double betrayal?

432
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,620
I don't know.

433
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,620
Miss He said that love has a double betrayal.

434
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,620
And she's going to kill herself.

435
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,620
The press is so scary.

436
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,620
The outside world is talking about

437
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,620
Gao Qi and I are playing tricks on Chen Cang

438
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,620
and destroying your English group.

439
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,620
How dare you come to my house for breakfast

440
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,620
in this stormy weather?

441
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,620
You're so brave.

442
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,620
Just like you said,

443
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,620
there are rumors out there.

444
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,620
The closer I get to you, the more the rumors will be broken.

445
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,620
It doesn't matter what others say.

446
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,620
I just want to know.

447
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,620
What do you want to know?

448
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,620
I want to know that you're the one

449
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,620
who doesn't want to hurt the English group.

450
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,620
I want to know that I'm sincere to Amber.

451
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:19,620
Ying is so lucky to have a son like you.

452
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,620
Okay, tell me.

453
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,620
How do you want me to help you?

454
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,620
I want you to let the other banks

455
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,620
and the big companies know

456
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,620
that you've been providing them with funds to help me.

457
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,620
They'll think that it's profitable.

458
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,620
They'll fight together to get the English group.

459
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,620
They won't give you a chance to fight alone.

460
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,620
That way I'll have the capital to negotiate.

461
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,620
As long as they sit down and negotiate with me,

462
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:50,620
I'll make them willing to provide enough funds

463
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,620
to help the English group get through the difficulties.

464
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,620
And in the end, you'll be the one

465
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,620
who has the greatest power in the English group.

466
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,620
Let's have breakfast first.

467
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:28,840
Amber, have you been going to the

468
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,840
summer camp recently?

469
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,840
No.

470
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,840
No?

471
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,840
Then why is your face so dark?

472
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,840
I thought you went to the summer camp to sunbathe.

473
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,840
Daddy!

474
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,840
I'm here with Ying Dong to have breakfast with you.

475
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,840
Why are you so dark after being unhappy for so long?

476
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,060
I'll eat it before it gets dark.

477
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,060
I didn't mean that.

478
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,060
You didn't mean that because of your mother?

479
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,060
No.

480
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,060
Did Amber hear something?

481
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:03,060
They've always been into super foreign movies.

482
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,060
But they haven't seen such a good creative work.

483
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,060
They've spent their hearts on nonsense.

484
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,060
When did I steal anyone else's boyfriend?

485
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,280
My daughter doesn't seem to be angry with such a irrelevant person.

486
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,280
I'm not angry with someone irrelevant.

487
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,280
I'm just trying to make the Wan family feel better.

488
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,280
What did they say about the Wan family?

489
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,280
They're still my good friends.

490
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:26,280
Even if we break up, we can still be good friends.

491
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,280
One's love must be through a lot.

492
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,280
You're quite generous.

493
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,280
You're really Wu Yuting's daughter.

494
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,280
And you, Daddy, are so kind.

495
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,500
I'm different from you.

496
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,500
I've met people who are just small things.

497
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,500
They don't say anything.

498
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,500
But you, look.

499
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:46,500
They say that the Wu family used some unknown means to swallow the English company.

500
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,500
I'm afraid that this will affect our business image.

501
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,500
You heard it right.

502
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,500
My little princess has grown up.

503
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:00,500
Yingdong, it seems that Amber has really improved a lot with you.

504
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,500
Amber has always been a good girl.

505
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,720
Amber is always very smart.

506
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,720
Daddy, I'm not joking.

507
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,720
I'm serious.

508
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,720
Have you ever thought of using the crisis to publicize?

509
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,720
The clear is the clear.

510
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
Time can prove everything.

511
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,720
I don't need to do the editing for something I haven't done.

512
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,720
Uncle is right.

513
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,720
There are things that don't need to be edited.

514
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,720
But now you are the focus of the media.

515
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,940
You should be careful.

516
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,940
I don't care.

517
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,940
I don't have any secrets.

518
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,940
I'm a straightforward person.

519
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,940
I'm not afraid of them harassing me.

520
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,940
You, Daddy, don't have any secrets, right?

521
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,940
If you have, let us know.

522
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,940
It's better than being dug by the dogs outside.

523
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,940
Do I need the puzzling?

524
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,960
I know that you want to be free of their

525
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,960
combined Cheese Episode 8 between the goodett gotta go.

526
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,960
Return me my Chris asked a different boards.

527
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:22,120
I've given you what tornado Their

528
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:27,120
before 3 o'clock

529
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,120
They're still in the morning.

530
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,120
I

531
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,260
don't understand.

532
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,260
I'll take the high-level list of the store.

533
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,260
Okay, Mr. Wu.

534
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,260
Oh, right.

535
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:40,260
Let's arrange a dinner with Mr. Zhou of the Chinese bank.

536
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,260
Let's arrange it at the foreign exchange office.

537
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:46,260
Mr. Wu, the rumors of the magazine will be more accurate.

538
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,260
There are many ways to avoid rumors.

539
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,260
I choose to push Yingdong.

540
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:54,260
When everyone is trying to get the benefits,

541
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:58,260
we can see clearly that the black and white is right and wrong.

542
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:03,260
Anyway, I've been living in misunderstanding all my life.

543
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:12,260
I've been living in misunderstanding all my life.

544
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,260
Forget it. Who cares about the rules?

545
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,260
I won't explain it anyway.

546
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,260
I'll explain it to you as a brother.

547
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,260
It's better than not explaining it.

548
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,260
You know a lot about feelings.

549
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,260
You should help them first.

550
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,260
You should help them first.

551
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,260
Ding Yi.

552
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,260
Yes, mom.

553
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,260
Go and buy a better cake.

554
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,260
Explain it to your brother.

555
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,260
Okay.

556
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,260
Explain what?

557
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,260
I haven't done anything.

558
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,260
I don't understand.

559
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,260
These women...

560
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,260
I haven't had any relationship with them.

561
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,260
They want to admit that they have had a relationship with me.

562
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,260
Just because I'm handsome?

563
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,260
Just because I'm a schoolboy?

564
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,260
You're too modest.

565
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:57,260
You're just like me.

566
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,260
Your mom has a relationship with someone,

567
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,260
but she doesn't admit that she has a relationship with anyone.

568
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,260
She's just a friend.

569
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,260
Why do you care so much about a man

570
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,260
who has never been responsible for you?

571
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,260
I'm a man of my word.

572
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,260
You care about a man who has never met you.

573
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,260
You don't care about me, a poor mother.

574
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,260
You men are all conscience.

575
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,260
I'm going to work.

576
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,260
Bye.

577
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,260
Mom, didn't you resign?

578
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:26,260
Ye calls your mom more than ten times every day.

579
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:29,260
He also says that he will pay 30% of your mom's salary.

580
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,260
Do you think I can refuse?

581
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,260
How else can I feed you?

582
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,260
He's chasing you.

583
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,260
You're too modest.

584
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,260
I can see his attitude.

585
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,260
Someone cares about me.

586
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,260
Look.

587
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,260
Tell me how much is the temperature today?

588
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,260
Let me wear more clothes.

589
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,260
You haven't had breakfast yet.

590
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,260
You have to be careful when you're in the traffic.

591
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,260
It's so warm.

592
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,260
Mom,

593
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,260
you can stand

594
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,260
such sweet words?

595
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,260
Of course I can.

596
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,260
I'm better than your two unfilial sons.

597
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,260
Bye, mom.

598
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,260
Who is it?

599
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,260
Who is so close to us?

600
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,260
Ye Fei Fei.

601
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:41,260
Drink, drink, drink.

602
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,260
Oh, my God!

603
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,260
You have white hair.

604
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,260
No way.

605
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,260
You're wrong.

606
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,260
How old are you?

607
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,260
Drinking is boring.

608
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,260
Let's do something else.

609
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,260
Come on, sit down.

610
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,260
Okay.

611
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,260
Okay.

612
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,260
Wang, bring me the cards.

613
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,260
Career, wealth, love, health.

614
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,260
I can tell you everything.

615
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,260
Write it down.

616
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,260
Well...

617
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,260
I'll do it.

618
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,260
Justice, secret.

619
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,260
What do you want to ask?

620
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,260
Just say it.

621
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,260
You're in a love that's not wrong.

622
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,260
Because you will receive unfair treatment,

623
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,260
you will leave the factory.

624
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:08,260
And your lover will hide or deceive you.

625
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,260
You have to consider if it's the life you want.

626
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,260
Mei Bao, aren't you in a love with Hua Qiao?

627
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,260
Is there a problem?

628
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,260
It's not accurate.

629
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,260
No, I think it's accurate.

630
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,260
What else does Boss Tao want to say?

631
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:34,260
The other thing is to cherish the person who loves you.

632
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:38,260
And this person may appear with a very annoying face.

633
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,260
See?

634
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,260
Boss Tao said you cherish me.

635
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,260
Okay, it's your turn.

636
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,260
Let me do it.

637
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,260
Let me do it.

638
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,260
Love career.

639
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,260
What career do you have?

640
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,260
You have to check it if you don't have a career.

641
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,260
Yes.

642
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,260
Yes.

643
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,260
Do you have a career?

644
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,260
Career?

645
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,260
It's not fun.

646
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,260
Why don't you draw again?

647
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,260
What?

648
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,260
Career.

649
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,260
Okay, okay.

650
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,260
You think of something else.

651
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,260
Career.

652
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,260
The result is the same.

653
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,260
What?

654
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,260
This card is very unique.

655
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,260
You are born rich.

656
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:46,260
You are destined to inherit a property worth hundreds of millions.

657
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,260
Is it stupid?

658
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,260
But your feelings are very complicated.

659
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,260
Although every part of you is true love,

660
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,260
you are entangled in it.

661
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,260
If you want to resolve it,

662
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,260
unless...

663
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,260
Unless what?

664
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,260
Unless you find a real goddess.

665
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,260
What kind of person is she?

666
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:17,260
She is very beautiful and very rich.

667
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:21,260
In addition to her work and love,

668
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,260
she is also very helpful to you.

669
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,260
Sounds good.

670
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:31,260
But you are not a couple.

671
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,260
Then what do I want?

672
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:37,260
Not a couple.

673
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,260
Then what?

674
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,260
That's it.

675
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:48,260
Mom, if I find my rich dad,

676
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,260
the first person I will repay is Lu Fei Fei.

677
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,260
How do you think of this?

678
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:54,260
Which rich dad will have a perverted son like you?

679
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:58,260
Which rich dad does not want to have a perverted son like me?

680
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,260
Meng, you should come and play.

681
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,260
This is for you young people.

682
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,260
I will not play.

683
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,260
Meng, come and play.

684
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,260
Take a picture.

685
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,260
Yes, don't be upset.

686
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,260
I will help you.

687
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,260
Who wants a pack?

688
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,260
I will take it myself.

689
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,260
Congratulations, Meng.

690
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:22,260
This card proves that you are not a couple.

691
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,260
I am not a couple.

692
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,260
Look, my two sons are already old.

693
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,260
It's useless to play.

694
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,260
This is not a normal couple.

695
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:35,260
This is called a dream.

696
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:39,260
That is, you have a chance to get back together with your old love.

697
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,260
Old love?

698
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,260
I can't be a rich dad.

699
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,260
I have met my dad.

700
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:47,260
And then you get back together with him.

701
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,260
It's a good ending.

702
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,260
Wake up.

703
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,260
What rich dad?

704
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,260
What get back together?

705
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,260
You really think you are a green onion?

706
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,260
Go away.

707
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,260
Forget it, I'm not smart.

708
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,260
Why don't you count the cards today?

709
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,260
I have a lot of cards.

710
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,260
I have a lot of cards.

711
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,260
Why don't you count the cards today?

712
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,260
You didn't count either.

713
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,260
There is nothing to count.

714
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,260
I didn't either.

715
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,260
I think it's a good feeling now.

716
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,260
You don't have to worry about love anymore.

717
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,260
It's good to think so.

718
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:34,260
I thought you would be upset because of what happened with Amber and Yingdong.

719
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,260
I didn't find myself unhappy.

720
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,260
Why are you unhappy?

721
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:41,260
Because the happiness of being together covers everything.

722
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,260
That's good.

723
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:47,260
Amber asked me if you fell in love with Han Dingyi.

724
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,260
Why did she ask you this?

725
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,260
I think she cares about you too.

726
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,260
Hope you don't be sad anymore.

727
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,260
How do you answer?

728
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,260
I said there was too much business in the art room recently.

729
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,260
I can't take care of you two.

730
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,260
Smart.

731
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,260
Let's go home.

732
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,260
Let's go.

733
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:21,260
It seems that I asked you to come to your house yesterday.

734
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,260
It's nothing.

735
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,260
Is this your dad's painting?

736
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,260
Yes.

737
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,260
It's really like a palace.

738
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,260
Can I take a picture of it?

739
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,260
My dad doesn't allow people to take pictures.

740
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,260
But you are very kind to me.

741
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,260
Take a picture.

742
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,260
Thank you.

743
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,260
Look.

744
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,260
This is another Amber.

745
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,260
My dad often puts her at her workplace.

746
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,260
She said she wanted to work with her.

747
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:56,260
She also said she wanted to exchange a hidden name tag with me.

748
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,260
I haven't thought about it yet.

749
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:01,260
This bear is really unusual.

750
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,260
Miss, your clothes are ready.

751
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,260
Okay.

752
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,260
Feifei, whatever you want.

753
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,260
Feifei.

754
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:42,260
How are you following the case of the three-daughter increase in property I told you last time?

755
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,260
It's in the tower.

756
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,260
Come on.

757
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:49,260
Hundreds of media are following this case.

758
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,260
Can you get more lost?

759
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,260
I know.

760
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:57,260
By the way, I have two haircuts here.

761
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:00,260
Take it to do DNA test.

762
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,260
Okay.

763
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,260
Can I ask who their owner is?

764
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,260
No.

765
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:09,260
Feifei, I'm just curious.

766
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,260
You shouldn't ask.

767
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,260
Don't ask.

768
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:16,260
Your job is just a task I gave you.

769
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,260
Just finish it.

770
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:24,260
Do you know how much I spent on this case?

771
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:28,260
If you make a mistake here for half a year,

772
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,260
don't blame me.

773
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:33,260
You know what will happen to me if you betray me.

774
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,260
Don't worry, Feifei.

775
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,260
I was brought up by you.

776
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,260
I won't betray you.

777
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,260
Since that incident,

778
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,260
do you think I still believe in anyone?

779
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,260
Feifei, I think

780
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:49,260
some things are not as absolute as you think.

781
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,260
Some people do wrong things

782
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,260
and they don't mean to change.

783
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,260
Don't say good words for that bitch.

784
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:00,260
Don't forget how she hurt me.

785
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,260
I will never forgive her.

786
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,260
But Feifei,

787
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,260
Brother Potato doesn't dare to say anything.

788
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,260
He really wants to apologize to you.

789
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,260
He left a message in my WeChat.

790
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,260
Do you want to listen to it?

791
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,260
You still have the nerve to ask for help from Xiaomin.

792
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,260
I won't do that.

793
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,260
Why don't you ask for help from Xiaoli?

794
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,260
She is a good match for you.

795
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,260
You two are shameless.

796
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,260
Do you think I don't know why you came out?

797
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,260
I just want to get the information.

798
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,260
You are a hypocrite.

799
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:41,260
Don't mention this bitch in front of me again.

800
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:46,260
And if I know that you gave her the information...

801
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,260
I won't. I promise.

802
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,260
I want her to see

803
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:56,260
how I can get to the top of this industry.

804
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:25,260
I will never forgive her.

805
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,260
But Feifei,

806
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,260
Brother Potato doesn't dare to say anything.

807
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,260
He really wants to apologize to you.

808
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,260
He left a message in my WeChat.

809
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,260
Do you want to listen to it?

810
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,260
I won't do that.

811
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,260
Why don't you ask for help from Xiaomin?

812
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,260
And if I know that you gave her the information...

813
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:43,260
I won't. I promise.
