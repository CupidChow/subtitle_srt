1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You

7
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Daddy hopes you can develop with Jason.

8
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Isn't it good to have more choices?

9
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Daddy, you asked me to try dating Yingdong before.

10
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Now you want me to try dating Jason.

11
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm just a bargaining chip for you, right?

12
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What do you know?

13
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yingdong's father Ying Youjing always wanted to use me to enter the international market.

14
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
He's the only one who can do that.

15
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
He doesn't even understand the international and domestic system.

16
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
He wants to be accepted by others.

17
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's not like he can just do it one by one.

18
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He always thinks I'm stopping him from getting a share.

19
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
If you date Jason,

20
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
you can also make him understand that not only his son can match my daughter.

21
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You guys are so scheming.

22
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Jason's grandmother is old.

23
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
She wants to be a grandson.

24
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
In the future, her jewelry business and diamond business will be handed over to him.

25
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
His family will never be inferior to Yingdong.

26
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Daddy, you married me after I graduated from college.

27
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm too young.

28
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Marriage is the life of a woman.

29
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
If you can get a marriage that my father is satisfied with,

30
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'll agree to anything.

31
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Will you really agree to anything?

32
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I can fulfill any wish of yours.

33
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
If I get married, will my mother come back?

34
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I've never seen my mother since I was a child.

35
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I've never learned how to be a good wife and a good parent from you.

36
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So if I get married,

37
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I won't be someone else's wife and mother.

38
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
She abandoned you when you were less than a year old.

39
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Why are you so curious about her?

40
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
She's my mother.

41
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I have the right to know what kind of person she is.

42
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Okay, I'll tell you what kind of person she is.

43
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
She's a cold-blooded woman who has no feelings.

44
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
She's a woman who only cares about money and business.

45
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Even if you get married, she won't come to your wedding.

46
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Why should I listen to your one-sided words?

47
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Because I love you more than anyone.

48
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Daddy, I like it when you say that kind of thing.

49
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Say it again.

50
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Daddy, you're old.

51
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You don't remember what you said just now?

52
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You said that because no one loves you more than me.

53
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Say it again.

54
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
No one loves you more than me.

55
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
No one loves you more than me.

56
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
No one loves you...

57
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Wait!

58
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I want to record it.

59
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'll read it when I miss you.

60
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Wait!

61
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
No one loves you more than me!

62
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
No one loves you more than me!

63
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You're more lovable than me.

64
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Hello?

65
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What time is it? You're still sleeping?

66
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What time is it?

67
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm taking a break today. I don't have a high school.

68
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Why are you waking up so early?

69
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Isn't it Friday today?

70
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm going to class with Yindong.

71
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Didn't I tell you?

72
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
My daddy asked me to learn business management,

73
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
EMBA, dialogue, economic and trade courses.

74
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Good morning, handsome.

75
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
This kind of course is for many successful people

76
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
to share their professional experience.

77
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I hope you don't become a marriage agency

78
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
for handsome men like Bai Fengmei and Gao Fushuai.

79
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What?

80
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Marriage agency?

81
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Are you going on a blind date?

82
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm not going on a blind date.

83
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm going to class.

84
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Don't worry.

85
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I will keep an eye on Yindong for the players.

86
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yindong will also keep an eye on me for you.

87
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Don't worry about sleeping.

88
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You think I can still sleep?

89
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Call me right after class.

90
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'll just treat you as my friend.

91
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Bye.

92
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Good morning.

93
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm going to a blind date with An He.

94
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What?

95
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Don't worry, Wan Jia.

96
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I will keep an eye on Yindong for you.

97
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Okay.

98
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm counting on you.

99
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Bye.

100
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Welcome to the business class of EMBA.

101
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Maybe you are not familiar with each other.

102
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It doesn't matter.

103
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
In the next month,

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
you will know more about the students of Shenzhen.

105
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Our guest lecturers

106
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
are all from around the world

107
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
for different economic programs and subjects.

108
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
In the next month,

109
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
we will have a class

110
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
on the topic of the world's most important economic development.

111
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Before the lecture begins,

112
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
let's have a self-introduction.

113
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Let's discuss it more clearly.

114
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Who wants to go first?

115
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'll go first.

116
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Can I say hello?

117
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Hi, everybody. My name is Jason.

118
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
My name is Hao Pan Yao.

119
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'll introduce my family back a little bit.

120
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
My great grandfather was a minister for the Qing dynasty.

121
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
About 90 years ago, he immigrated to the United States

122
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
to start a diamond business.

123
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Our business now is one of the largest diamond suppliers in the world.

124
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
With over 100 brands that we supply diamonds to,

125
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
such brands as Bvlgari, Ivanka Trump, Cartier, and Tiffany's.

126
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
With that, I'll leave you with a note from our industry.

127
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
A diamond is a girl's best friend.

128
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
A diamond is a girl's best friend.

129
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Thank you.

130
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Thank you, Jason.

131
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Next, please come to the stage.

132
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Amber, come on.

133
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Hi, everybody. My name is Amber.

134
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm the daughter of the hotel's great-grandson, Wu Yuting.

135
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yuting Group has over 200 five-star hotels around the world,

136
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
including the mountains and the buildings.

137
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Since the Beijing Olympic Games,

138
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
our hotel has been listed as the 10th largest hotel in Southeast Asia.

139
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Because customers are from all over the world,

140
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
my father taught me to make friends with people with good qualities.

141
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So I chose this course.

142
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I hope to be a good friend to everyone.

143
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Thank you.

144
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Next, please come to the stage.

145
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'd like to wait for you to introduce yourselves before you stand up.

146
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But I really can't refuse this beautiful lady.

147
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm Gao Qi.

148
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm the guest teacher of this class.

149
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm the student of the class.

150
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm the student of the class.

151
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm the student of the class.

152
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm the student of the class.

153
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm the student of the class.

154
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Our topic today is

155
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
business investment and business overseas listing.

156
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'll introduce myself here.

157
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You look so beautiful.

158
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm not beautiful.

159
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm strong.

160
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Teacher.

161
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
This is yours.

162
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You forgot something.

163
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Thank you, An Neng.

164
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You know my name?

165
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You introduced me just now, so I noticed it.

166
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Because I like Hu Po.

167
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm not a good person.

168
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm not a good person.

169
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm not a good person.

170
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm not a good person.

171
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm not a good person.

172
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Your hands look so beautiful.

173
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's perfect to wear this.

174
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
This is for you.

175
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Such an expensive gift.

176
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
We just met.

177
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm not very good at accepting gifts.

178
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
An Bo helped me find Hu Po.

179
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I've worn this ring for 20 years.

180
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I've never lost it.

181
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Today I saw you.

182
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I forgot it.

183
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It also shows that she likes you more.

184
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's also fate.

185
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What's wrong?

186
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You don't want to be my friend?

187
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You think I'm old

188
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
and can't play with young people like you?

189
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
No.

190
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You're so young.

191
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You're like my sister.

192
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm just so happy that I didn't recognize you.

193
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
This is my phone number.

194
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm happy to be able to recognize you.

195
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You just came back from America.

196
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Are you alone in Shanghai?

197
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Do you have friends?

198
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I've been away from Shanghai for 20 years.

199
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I've found that the changes have been huge.

200
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I can't contact my old friends now.

201
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Don't be sad.

202
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
We're friends now.

203
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
If you need anything,

204
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
you can call me.

205
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I don't know what to do.

206
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

207
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'll be right back.

208
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I don't know if you have time these days.

209
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Can I ask you out for a walk?

210
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I want to give you a gift.

211
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Don't be so formal.

212
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Call me if you have time.

213
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

214
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Okay.

215
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
This is our new flower shop.

216
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
How is it?

217
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I heard from Jiajia that your makeup is good.

218
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Looking at it now,

219
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
the colors are really beautiful.

220
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
The style is also very special.

221
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yes.

222
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Auntie, sit down for a while.

223
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'll get you some water.

224
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Okay.

225
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
This is a lot bigger than the restaurant we used to go to.

226
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Come over and eat if you're free.

227
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Thank you.

228
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's not a problem.

229
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I open the shop every day.

230
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The president's suite from 999 to Wanfu Hotel.

231
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'll take it.

232
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Okay.

233
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Okay.

234
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Your dad is here.

235
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
He's in there.

236
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Mom.

237
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Why are you here?

238
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Jiajia.

239
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I came to see the restaurant's performance.

240
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Brother Ding.

241
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Brother Yingdong's assistant Minghui called.

242
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
She said that she would send 999 roses to the president's suite

243
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
from Wanfu Hotel every day.

244
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And the client list and data are all sent to our mailbox.

245
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Okay.

246
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'll go over first.

247
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Xiao Jin.

248
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Does Yingdong send flowers to girls?

249
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's okay.

250
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Go back to your work.

251
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
We need to keep the client's information secret.

252
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Keep it secret?

253
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You want to keep it secret from me too?

254
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
This is a matter of professional ethics.

255
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
The client is God.

256
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
God's information should be kept secret from anyone.

257
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Mom.

258
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You saw it, right?

259
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
There's such an honest person who's watching your business.

260
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
What are you going to supervise?

261
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You can enjoy yourself.

262
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I just want to take a look.

263
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yingdong called me.

264
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Thank you.

265
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Hello.

266
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Did you tell Jiajia to contact me?

267
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I asked the secretary to arrange another time for me this morning.

268
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I want to give you a surprise.

269
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Surprise?

270
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Don't be scared.

271
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Are you free tonight?

272
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Let's watch a movie together.

273
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Okay.

274
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'll ask Concery to pick you up tonight.

275
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'll see you at the cinema.

276
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Tell him I'll wait for him at the flower shop.

277
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
See you later.

278
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Jiajia.

279
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Are you going out with Yingdong?

280
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Are you going out with Yingdong?

281
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Look.

282
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
These magazines say that Yingdong and the heir of the Wushi Hotel are in a couple.

283
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
What's going on?

284
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Did you break up?

285
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You came for this, right?

286
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Can I rest assured when I see these?

287
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You also believe what's written in the gossip magazine?

288
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I believe it's because of these rumors.

289
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm going to be low-key with Yingdong.

290
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I can't let the outside world know that we are in a relationship.

291
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Why do you want to have a relationship?

292
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
This is just temporary.

293
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's an over-the-top.

294
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's okay.

295
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Don't worry.

296
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Then Yingdong and Wu Anpu...

297
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's also fake.

298
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Amber and Zirui haven't broken up yet.

299
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
They are also in a relationship.

300
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You young people.

301
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
How can you handle things so simply?

302
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's like changing partners in a dance party.

303
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
What if it's fake?

304
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It won't be.

305
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
We are not ordinary people.

306
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
How is that possible?

307
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Don't worry. It's okay.

308
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You really don't let me rest assured.

309
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
These two seats.

310
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Thank you.

311
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
No water, right?

312
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Let's go.

313
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
One popcorn.

314
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Two more cups of coke.

315
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Okay.

316
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
This is your coke.

317
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Thank you.

318
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And popcorn.

319
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Thank you.

320
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I want a big popcorn.

321
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Here you go.

322
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It hurts.

323
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So many people.

324
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Give me a small one.

325
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Are you happy?

326
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
This morning,

327
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
my mom saw you and Amber together.

328
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
She asked me why we were so close.

329
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Why did we fall in love?

330
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
This is a way out.

331
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Let's run.

332
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
We spent so much time together.

333
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Let's go to the movies.

334
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Do you want to go to the movies?

335
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You are a waste.

336
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You have three houses.

337
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You are all returned to the company.

338
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
What do you do?

339
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So you want to see it yourself.

340
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Yes, go to the hotel and see it.

341
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
What if someone else is allergic to pollen?

342
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Right? Is that okay?

343
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I don't care.

344
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You have to do this well.

345
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Or you can leave.

346
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Why is this person so stupid?

347
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
He can't do this.

348
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Dad,

349
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
what kind of client is this?

350
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So many flowers.

351
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And he has to send flowers for three days in a row.

352
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Do you want me to help you?

353
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
No, son.

354
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
This is not a client.

355
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
This should be a person

356
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
who has a taste in life.

357
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
This kind of person,

358
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
he can understand if he wants to make it simple.

359
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Dad,

360
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
let me ask you something.

361
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Say it.

362
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Are you in love?

363
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm in love?

364
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
No.

365
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Really no.

366
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
What kind of eyes do you have on me?

367
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I tell you, maybe this person is pursuing Dad.

368
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
But Dad is considering whether to give this person a chance.

369
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Don't believe it.

370
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Really.

371
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Let's eat.

372
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Let's eat.

373
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Dad,

374
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Amber and my teacher are here.

375
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Should we...

376
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
What do you mean?

377
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Either eat with me or with her.

378
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Of course I'll eat with you.

379
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Amber,

380
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
your friend is over there.

381
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Yingdong?

382
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
The one sitting opposite him

383
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
is his father Ying Yongjin.

384
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Yes,

385
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
the king of the food chain.

386
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Sister Baoqi,

387
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Yingdong's father is the most stingy man in China.

388
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I've never seen a woman

389
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
who can take a penny from him.

390
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Really?

391
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Then should we go and say hello?

392
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I think his father

393
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
won't even greet us.

394
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Okay.

395
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Let's go.

396
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You're so handsome.

397
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
What's wrong?

398
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Your father is so handsome.

399
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Look at me.

400
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You don't have to say anything.

401
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yingdong,

402
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Uncle Ying.

403
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Miss Baoqi.

404
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I don't think Mr Ying welcomes us.

405
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's the opposite.

406
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm very welcome.

407
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm very happy.

408
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm very happy.

409
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm very happy.

410
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm very happy.

411
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm very happy.

412
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm very happy.

413
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm very happy.

414
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Why are you here?

415
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I don't know if we have the honor

416
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
to have lunch with you here.

417
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It's my honor to have lunch with you.

418
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Thank you.

419
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You're welcome.

420
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I want to ask

421
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
how you met each other.

422
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
That's because EMBA invited me to be a guest tutor.

423
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So Yingdong and Amber

424
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
are my students.

425
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Yes.

426
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I have a similar view with Sister Gaoqi.

427
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
We've known each other for a long time.

428
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Really?

429
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
You're so lucky.

430
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Here, I'll pour you some.

431
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Thank you.

432
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Mr Ying,

433
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I want to say sorry to you.

434
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I didn't accept the flowers you sent me.

435
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
That's because I'm very sensitive to pollen.

436
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'll use this glass of wine

437
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
as my apology to you.

438
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
You should say that.

439
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
It's all my fault.

440
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I don't know you well enough.

441
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Next time, I want to give you something that suits you.

442
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Something you like.

443
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Is that okay?

444
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Mr Ying, you're too kind.

445
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Thank you very much.

446
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm in a foreign country.

447
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It's my fortune to meet you.

448
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's my fortune to take care of you.

449
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Ms Gao,

450
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
is there any program you want to do?

451
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I don't have many friends in Shanghai.

452
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I can talk to Amber.

453
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
We'll go shopping later.

454
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Oh, shopping.

455
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It takes time.

456
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
But that's a woman's specialty.

457
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm sorry.

458
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
You can't participate in such a time-consuming activity.

459
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I think I can.

460
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I think I can.

461
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I want you to know

462
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
how excellent you are in my heart.

463
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I think you'll be pointed out in many places in the future.

464
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I'm sorry. I'll call you later.

465
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Hello.

466
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I'm at the French restaurant on the third floor of the restaurant.

467
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
It's an old place.

468
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It's worth a million dollars.

469
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
It's for the VIP.

470
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Write Gao Qi's name.

471
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Hurry up.

472
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Okay.

473
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It's actually that simple.

474
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Thank you.

475
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I wish you happiness.

476
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Let's do it together.

477
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Gao Qi,

478
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I really admire you.

479
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
You let Yingyao borrow that iron machine

480
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
and willingly give us a million dollar shopping card.

481
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I really admire you.

482
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
What else do you want to buy?

483
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Let's use the card given by the iron machine

484
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
to buy a lot of things.

485
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Go and see what you like.

486
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Amber,

487
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
do you know

488
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
that I have a daughter like you?

489
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I haven't seen her for more than 20 years.

490
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I always think of her.

491
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
If she wants,

492
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I really want to make up for it.

493
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I just don't know if she will accept it.

494
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
She must be willing to have such a good mother.

495
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I have never seen my mother since I was a child.

496
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
The gifts you gave me these days

497
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
are enough to make up for my childhood.

498
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
This was given to me when I was born.

499
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
This was given to me when I was a kindergartener.

500
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
This was given to me when I was in elementary school.

501
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
This was given to me when I was in middle school.

502
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And that one,

503
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
that was given to me when I was in college.

504
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Then when should I give you a gift next time?

505
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
When we get married.

506
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Get married?

507
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Is it with Ying Dong?

508
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Ying Dong and I are not really together.

509
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
We both lie to each other's parents

510
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
and play the piano with our true love.

511
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Ying Dong's girlfriend is a painter.

512
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
My boyfriend is a director.

513
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
You tell me such a secret thing.

514
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I believe you will never tell anyone.

515
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Yes, I will not tell anyone.

516
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
But why doesn't your father like you being with that director?

517
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Because my father treats any relationship as business.

518
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
He never does anything that is a loss.

519
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I understand.

520
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
That's because your father has suffered a lot in love.

521
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
That's why he became like this.

522
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
That one is pretty.

523
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
What are you looking at?

524
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
It's fake.

525
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Really? My friend gave it to me.

526
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Did Ying Dong give it to you?

527
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Daddy, I don't have any other friends except Ying Dong.

528
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I'm sorry.

529
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I'm sorry.

530
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I'm sorry.

531
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I'm sorry.

532
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I'm sorry.

533
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I'm sorry.

534
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Do you have any other friends?

535
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I gave you a sports car and it was parked in the garage.

536
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Why didn't you drive it?

537
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
When will these things be able to satisfy our little princess?

538
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
At least my friend chose these things for me.

539
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Unlike you, those sports cars were bought by a waiter.

540
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Those sports cars are very expensive.

541
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
How about this?

542
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Give her a chance to go to the garage and take a look at it.

543
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I don't want to go.

544
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I don't want you to see me happy.

545
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I want to be alone.

546
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Why are you so stingy?

547
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
You don't want to let daddy share your happy mood?

548
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Daddy, I'm angry.

549
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
What did daddy do wrong?

550
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Daddy, which gift did you choose and give me in the past 20 years?

551
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Some gifts are even given to me without knowing what they are.

552
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And, I don't know what you're doing.

553
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Some gifts are even given to me without knowing what they are.

554
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And, can you tell me what you've been giving me since I was one year old?

555
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Are you giving me history class?

556
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Forget it.

557
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
There are people out there who love me.

558
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I don't want you to love me.

559
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I'm tired. I won't talk to you today.

560
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I have to prepare for the class tomorrow.

561
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Get out.

562
00:28:46,000 --> 00:29:03,000
100,000, 200,000, 300,000, 400,000, 500,000, 600,000, 700,000, 800,000, 900,000, 1 million.

563
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
That's ridiculous.

564
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It's meaningless to give flowers.

565
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
You gave 5.5 million jewels to a saintess in one day.

566
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
You're so sincere.

567
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
You know nothing.

568
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I want to complete this difficult task for Meng.

569
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Xiao Fu, you'll be the security guard.

570
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
You'll drive the car and bring the jewels.

571
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
You'll wait outside the hotel.

572
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Okay.

573
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Any questions?

574
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
No.

575
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Okay.

576
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I want to see what kind of woman makes Ying Liu Jin so drunk.

577
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
This woman...

578
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
She's been a famous woman who left Shanghai for many years.

579
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Now she's the director of an American investment company in Asia.

580
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Her name is Gao Jie.

581
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Hello.

582
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Hello.

583
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
This is my business card.

584
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Mr. Ying ordered a gift from our jewelry store.

585
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
He asked me to give it to Mr. Gao.

586
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Mr. Gao hasn't gotten up yet.

587
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Give it to me first.

588
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Okay.

589
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
We'll come back in an hour.

590
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Okay.

591
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Thank you.

592
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
We'll come back in an hour.

593
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Okay.

594
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Thank you.

595
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Mr. Gao, you're awake.

596
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
The jewelry store will start at 10 o'clock and will deliver the jewelry.

597
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
This is a jewelry worth 500,000 yuan.

598
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Whose business card is this?

599
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Hua Meng Jun.

600
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
He's the manager of this jewelry store.

601
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
He's outside the door.

602
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
He's been waiting for you for hours.

603
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Why don't you ask them to go back first?

604
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Tell them to come back in a few hours and take the things back.

605
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Why should you help me?

606
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Tell them to take all these things back.

607
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And also,

608
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
call the service room, massage room,

609
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
and hair salon.

610
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I have a date tonight.

611
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Okay.

612
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Okay.

613
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
This is the last gift Mr. Ying gave to Mr. Gao today.

614
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Wait a minute.

615
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Mr. Gao,

616
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
this is the tenth gift Mr. Ying sent today.

617
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Please have a look.

618
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Don't show up in front of me again if you don't have enough things.

619
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And also,

620
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
don't send the things to the people who are in the jewelry store.

621
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
It's a waste of time.

622
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Okay.

623
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Mr. Ying, I've already found out that

624
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
the president's order has been withdrawn.

625
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
But he has a new jewelry order.

626
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Is it for Gao Qi?

627
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Yes.

628
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
What jewelry did he send?

629
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
From yesterday,

630
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
he sent one piece in an hour.

631
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
He sent 100,000 pieces in the first hour.

632
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
He sent 200,000 pieces in the second hour.

633
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
He kept sending 1 million pieces.

634
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
The total value of the jewelry he sent the whole day was 5.5 million.

635
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
But the jewelry he sent has been withdrawn.

636
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
But the president said

637
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
he would continue to send the next ten days.

638
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Okay.

639
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Keep checking

640
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
what progress Gao Qi and I have made.

641
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And also,

642
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
find some people abroad

643
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
to check Gao Qi's location.

644
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
If the president finds out about this,

645
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
it won't be good.

646
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I want to see.

647
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I want to see

648
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
what kind of woman

649
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
my mother is.

650
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Can she keep my father and I secret?

651
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Go and check

652
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
what happened to her.

653
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Yes.

654
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I'm back.

655
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
What's wrong?

656
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Who made our little princess unhappy?

657
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Who else?

658
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You know.

659
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Come on.

660
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Tell me about this knight.

661
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
He's making trouble for you.

662
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I'll teach him a lesson.

663
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
He'll be embarrassed.

664
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Look.

665
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Look.

666
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
How happy she is.

667
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Don't keep smiling.

668
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Don't keep smiling.

669
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
You know Pingzui is happy for me.

670
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Happy?

671
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Tell me.

672
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
What's the matter?

673
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Yidong told me

674
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
to pay attention to Amber

675
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
and Gao Qi,

676
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
the teacher in EMBA.

677
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Pay attention to them?

678
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Why?

679
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I don't know.

680
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
He suddenly told me to pay attention to them.

681
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I don't know if it will help him

682
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
in his business in the future.

683
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Or

684
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
he loves Amber.

685
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
What can I do for you?

686
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
That's what you said.

687
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
If you meet Gao Qi,

688
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
let's go on a date.

689
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Sure.

690
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I'm starving now.

691
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Cook something delicious for me.

692
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Okay.

693
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Wait for me.

694
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
By the way,

695
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
are you in love with Ding Yi recently?

696
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Are you crazy?

697
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I hope the one I love

698
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
is in love.

699
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Hello?

700
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I'm home.

701
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Weiwei?

702
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Daddy.

703
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Amber.

704
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Good evening.

705
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I've been thinking for an evening.

706
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I think what you said yesterday

707
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
was very reasonable.

708
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I've been not

709
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
very concerned about you these years.

710
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
So I came to pick you up

711
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
from class today.

712
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Daddy is the best in the world.

713
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
He loves me the most.

714
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
The best.

715
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Yidong,

716
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
listen to me.

717
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
You took my daughter

718
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
from a strong man like me.

719
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
You have to be nice to her in the future.

720
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Do you understand?

721
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I understand, Uncle.

722
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Daddy,

723
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
let me introduce you

724
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
to the senior teacher I know here.

725
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Okay.

726
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Hello?

727
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Mr. Li?

728
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Are you in my office?

729
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Sorry, I'm not.

730
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Who said I usually

731
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
stay at the office?

732
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I'm taking my daughter

733
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
from class today.

734
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
We'll be back in half an hour.

735
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Wait for me.

736
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Daddy has an old friend

737
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
waiting for me in the office.

738
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
You go home with me first.

739
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Let's have dinner together tonight.

740
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Okay.

741
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I'm leaving.

742
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Call me later.

743
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Bye-bye.

744
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Bye-bye.

745
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Bye-bye.

746
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I've found out that

747
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Gao Qi went to the US from Shanghai

748
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
twenty years ago.

749
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
In these twenty years,

750
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
this woman acquired

751
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
the top fifty listed companies

752
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
in the US in five years.

753
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
When she went to the US,

754
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
there was always

755
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
a Chinese man

756
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
who taught dancing.

757
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Gao Qi has been single

758
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
for the past few years.

759
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Everyone who pursues him

760
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
will push his career

761
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
to the limit.

762
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
These people are not simple.

763
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
They are all powerful and rich.

764
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Looking at him,

765
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I can tell he's crazy,

766
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
unscrupulous and weak.

767
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
How is the man who danced with him?

768
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
It seems that they broke up

769
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
in the year of the financial crisis.

770
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Then Gao Qi went to the US

771
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
and acquired this project

772
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
when the economy was in decline.

773
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
He was very accurate

774
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
and he became the first Chinese

775
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
to be the chief executive

776
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
of this company in Asia.

777
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I can see all of this

778
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
in the magazines.

779
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I want to investigate his private life.

780
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I also found out that

781
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
he got married before he went to the US

782
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
and had a daughter.

783
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
As for why he is back in Shanghai now,

784
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I haven't figured it out yet.

785
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Have you found out

786
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
who his ex-husband is?

787
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I haven't found out yet.

788
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
In short, this woman is not simple.

789
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Mr. Ying, you still have to be more careful.

790
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Okay, I got it.

791
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
You continue to investigate this matter.

792
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I understand.

793
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
But don't let Gao Qi and my father find out.

794
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Come in.

795
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Mr. Wu, good morning.

796
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Is the young lady in school?

797
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
When I just came back,

798
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I saw the young lady

799
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
driving the new sports car you bought for her.

800
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
She went out.

801
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Although my daughter is very unique,

802
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
she is actually quite simple.

803
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Right.

804
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Have you got the phone records

805
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
of the phone company?

806
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I got it.

807
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
This is the phone and WeChat records

808
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
of the young lady this month.

809
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Do you want to take a look?

810
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I don't have time to read them one by one.

811
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
You can help me summarize.

812
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I want to know the relationship between

813
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Yingdong, Kang Zirui and Jason

814
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
between the young lady and the young man.

815
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
The young lady and Kang Zirui have never broken up.

816
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
The first and last call every morning

817
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
are from her.

818
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
On average, I check WeChat every day.

819
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And Yingdong's phone call

820
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
is no more than two minutes.

821
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
As for the phone and WeChat,

822
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
it is no more than five.

823
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
As for Jason,

824
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
he sent five WeChat messages to the young lady.

825
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
The young lady only sent one.

826
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Most of the time, when Jason comes to the store,

827
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
the young lady doesn't answer.

828
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I really didn't expect that.

829
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Let him do it.

830
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Don't wake up the spirit.

831
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
You think of a way to get me

832
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
the phone records of Kang Zirui.

833
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Okay.

834
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
What's the news on the Internet today?

835
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
The king of luxury goods, Ying Youjing,

836
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
and the middle-aged man, Fu Re Lian

837
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
have a 999 strategy

838
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
to fight against Wu Wuling.

839
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
What does it mean?

840
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
999 represents 999 roses.

841
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
999 is still a call to the police in Hong Kong.

842
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
What about Wu Wuling?

843
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Wu Wuling is Ying Youjing's

844
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
gift from 100,000 yuan jewelry.

845
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
He sends 10 hours in a row.

846
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Every hour, he adds 100,000

847
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
to 1 million.

848
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
The total value is 5.5 million yuan.

849
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
But he was rejected by the middle-aged man.

850
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
It seems that we really have to

851
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
call the police for Ying.

852
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Did you forget?

853
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
What kind of woman

854
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
can make him so crazy?

855
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
He said it was an American

856
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
investor who invested in overseas trade

857
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
and asked him to be the chairman.

858
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
He sent his back photo.

859
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Although this woman can't see the appearance,

860
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
she can see that

861
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
she is a very capable woman.

862
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
She can open Ying's national treasury

863
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
and give him 5.5 million yuan of jewelry a day.

864
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
It seems that Ying is really playing.

865
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I said, Mr. Wu and Mr. Ye,

866
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
we are about to see the mysterious

867
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
woman on the Internet.

868
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
This is Ying.

869
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
She spent 5.5 million yuan a day

870
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
and she can't take it.

871
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Really?

872
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
We really have to see her.

873
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Why are you here so late?

874
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I'm sorry.

875
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I was busy.

876
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Brother, this is your girlfriend,

877
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Brother Wu.

878
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I'll call a new friend

879
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
to show you.

880
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I'm sorry.

881
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I was busy.

882
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Brother, this is your girlfriend,

883
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Brother Wu.

884
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I'll call a new friend

885
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
to show you.

886
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Daoqi.

887
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I'm looking forward to

888
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
the best of you.

889
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I will have a good combination

890
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
when you are in need.

891
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I can protect you in heaven.

892
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

We will have to

894
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,680
I don't even want to

895
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:10,700
It's nice to hear the價格也有

896
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,160
You have to

897
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:22,040
You have to

898
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,980
You want to

899
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,140
Let's stay together on the street of the drunk

900
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:34,180
We'll go to the end

901
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:38,180
No need for any reason

902
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:41,560
Let's go through it together

903
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,920
Even if it's the most difficult

904
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,400
We'll go to the end

905
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,760
No need for any excuse

906
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,960
When we need each other the most

907
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,560
We can stand firmly

908
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:05,200
In our times

909
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,960
Let's stay together
