Episode 18

2
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,400
I'll call you later. I'm busy now.

3
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,960
I have something to tell you.

4
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,080
I'm in your office now.

5
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,040
Take a look first.

6
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,160
Okay.

7
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,400
Tell me.

8
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,360
Wanjia wants to give you something.

9
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,360
Do you want to come down?

10
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,960
What is it?

11
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,600
There are bags, watches, jewelry.

12
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,280
It seems that you gave him everything.

13
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,360
Hey, your boyfriend is here.

14
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,360
I saw what you gave me.

15
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,360
You don't have to do this.

16
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,360
I won't take it.

17
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,360
I'll ask Han Ting Yi to send it back tomorrow.

18
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,360
I'll send it back.

19
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,360
If this is your usual principle,

20
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,360
and you think that the things you gave me are not worth taking back,

21
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
I understand.

22
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,360
But it doesn't mean anything.

23
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,360
It's meaningless.

24
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,360
Of course it's meaningless.

25
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,360
It means that I don't want to break up with you.

26
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,360
I'm sorry, I've already decided.

27
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,360
A relationship can be decided in one way or another.

28
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
Breaking up is.

29
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,360
I don't understand why you do this.

30
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,360
What are you dissatisfied with me?

31
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,360
You can say it.

32
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
Let's sit down and talk.

33
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,360
Why don't you have a chance to communicate?

34
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,360
Because I know that even if you say it,

35
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
there will be no change.

36
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,360
You have always been like this as a person.

37
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,360
The problems between us

38
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,360
are not formed in one day or two.

39
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,360
It's impossible to change in one day or two.

40
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,360
Since the last time we met,

41
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,360
you said that you didn't want to break up with me.

42
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,360
I didn't want to break up with you.

43
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,360
Since the last time we met,

44
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,360
I can't understand what you said.

45
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,360
What are you going to say?

46
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,360
Tell me.

47
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,360
I don't feel that you care about me.

48
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,360
Yes, you are very rich.

49
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,360
You can meet all my requirements.

50
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,360
Even if I don't have any requirements,

51
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,360
you have already given me.

52
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,360
Many people envy me.

53
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,360
Because they work for half a year.

54
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,360
They can't afford to buy a bag that you can give me.

55
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,360
But I don't care about that.

56
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,360
You are busy.

57
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,360
You don't have time to accompany me.

58
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,360
I don't care about that.

59
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,360
But you never have the interest in listening to my stories.

60
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,360
You never thought of going into my life,

61
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,360
understanding me, my parents, my friends.

62
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,360
We are boyfriends.

63
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,360
But do you really care about my feelings?

64
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,360
I can't feel you.

65
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,360
Whenever I need you, you are not there.

66
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,360
Even if you are standing in front of me now,

67
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,360
you are not there.

68
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,360
I really like you.

69
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,360
Let's be together forever.

70
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
Okay.

71
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,360
Cut.

72
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,360
Pack up.

73
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,360
Make up for the actors.

74
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,360
Director, the new assistant that the team has arranged for you has arrived.

75
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,360
Take a look.

76
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,360
Hello, director. I am your new assistant.

77
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,360
As a director's assistant, you must be more clever.

78
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,360
As long as I receive the director's complaint,

79
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,360
I will be able to help you.

80
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,360
I will be your assistant.

81
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,360
I will be your assistant.

82
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,360
I will be your assistant.

83
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,360
Don't ask for your salary.

84
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,360
Okay, I understand.

85
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,360
As long as you do not do well, I will fire you at any time.

86
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,360
Okay.

87
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
Do your best.

88
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,360
Put this box in my car first.

89
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,360
Okay.

90
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,360
One more time.

91
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,360
Come on, one more time.

92
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,360
Okay, it's on.

93
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,360
Put it on the floor.

94
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
Make it long.

95
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,360
Okay.

96
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
Okay.

97
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,360
Okay.

98
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,360
One more time.

99
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360
Ready.

100
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,360
Action.

101
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,360
Cut.

102
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,360
Sorry.

103
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,360
That was good.

104
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,360
You can do better.

105
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
One more time.

106
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,360
Ready.

107
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,360
Action.

108
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,360
Okay, one more time.

109
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
Okay, good job.

110
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,360
You did a great job today.

111
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
Thank you, director.

112
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
Thank you.

113
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
Director Kang.

114
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,360
It's not easy filming your film.

115
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,360
Can I take your bus?

116
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,360
Sure.

117
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,360
Thanks.

118
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,360
I want to go home.

119
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360
I have a bad mood.

120
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,360
You can go.

121
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
I'm going.

122
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
Okay, bye bye.

123
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,360
Bye.

124
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,360
Thank you.

125
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,360
Bye.

126
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
Bye.

127
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
Bye, bye.

128
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
Bye.

129
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
Let's go.

130
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Okay.

131
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,760
Let's go.

132
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,240
Why are you still standing?

133
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,320
Call a cab.

134
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,280
Where are we going?

135
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,160
Back to the hotel.

136
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,360
To whom?

137
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,680
You have too many questions.

138
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,160
Go back to my hotel.

139
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,800
Okay, I'm here.

140
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,920
You can take a cab and go home.

141
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,040
What?

142
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,360
Miss, three years ago was three years ago, now is now.

143
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,200
Please get off.

144
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,600
Do you still like that Wu Anpo?

145
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,160
You two broke up, is that necessary?

146
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,600
Whether I like Wu Anpo or not, it's my business.

147
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,600
But I don't like you, it's your business.

148
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,120
Please get off.

149
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,040
Okay, he's gone.

150
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,000
Go upstairs and have a drink.

151
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,680
No, director.

152
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,680
You have an announcement tomorrow morning.

153
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,240
You should go back and rest.

154
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,160
You don't need to be so professional as an assistant, do you?

155
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,320
You know everything?

156
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,640
I knew it.

157
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,320
When did you know?

158
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,760
You forgot, this is a pair of glasses I gave you.

159
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,360
You asked me to do something today.

160
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,160
But I'm embarrassed in front of the crew.

161
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,600
You did it on purpose.

162
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,640
I say, since you want to be an assistant,

163
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,400
you should be sincere.

164
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,440
Besides, the things I told you to do,

165
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,320
are what an assistant should do.

166
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,960
I'm still a little bit shy.

167
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,240
You don't think about the good luck at all.

168
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,720
I didn't want to torture you,

169
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,600
but you did it with a lot of care.

170
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,080
I'll just use it for a few days.

171
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,960
You...

172
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,760
Anyway, the crew's money has been spent.

173
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,720
I can't waste it.

174
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,680
You...

175
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,720
What's wrong with me?

176
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,320
Okay, let's call it a day.

177
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,800
Let's go up and have a drink.

178
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,560
It's been a long day.

179
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,720
But don't worry.

180
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,280
This is a benefit for an ordinary assistant.

181
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,760
No need, director.

182
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,520
You have an announcement tomorrow at 8 o'clock.

183
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,160
I have to get up at 6 o'clock.

184
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,680
I'd better go back and sleep.

185
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
Okay.

186
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,200
Then go back and rest.

187
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
I'm leaving.

188
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
Go to bed early.

189
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,960
Mom, Jiajia is back.

190
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Let me.

191
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
What's wrong?

192
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,560
Have you eaten?

193
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,720
I'll let your dad cook.

194
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,160
No, I've eaten.

195
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,320
Go inside.

196
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Are you tired?

197
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,760
Jiajia.

198
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
Why are you here?

199
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,640
You know each other?

200
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,080
Uncle and aunt.

201
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,240
I'm here to see Jiajia.

202
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,880
Uncle and aunt.

203
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
Hello.

204
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,720
I'm Yingdong.

205
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,360
My boyfriend.

206
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,760
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

207
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,800
I didn't treat you well.

208
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,880
I'm sorry.

209
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,040
I just want to be like an ordinary guest.

210
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,880
I don't want to disturb your work.

211
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,160
Uncle and aunt.

212
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,840
I'll come to see you often.

213
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,240
Okay.

214
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,240
What's wrong with you?

215
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
Why are you so surprised?

216
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,280
Do you like it?

217
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,240
I want to surprise you.

218
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,840
You scared my parents.

219
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
No.

220
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,120
I think they like me.

221
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
Really?

222
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,680
Why didn't I see it?

223
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,840
You...

224
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,200
They were so happy when they saw me.

225
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,560
No.

226
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,840
They were so happy when they saw me with you.

227
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,640
Self-love.

228
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,640
Self-love.

229
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,280
Why would I fall in love with myself?

230
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
I'm just like this. Why do you like me?

231
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,200
If I don't fall in love with myself,

232
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,760
you'll be crazy.

233
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,880
When did I like you?

234
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,200
You're so poor.

235
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,040
I care about your feelings.

236
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,320
I know you just want me to get into your life.

237
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,760
I've thought about it too.

238
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,120
But I've been thinking too much.

239
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,160
But now I have to prove it with my actions.

240
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,760
I can do it.

241
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,040
Because you're different from other girls.

242
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,160
What you want is not the material,

243
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,040
but my feelings.

244
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,880
What you like is not my identity,

245
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,040
but me.

246
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,360
Now I really want you to feel

247
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,720
that I really, really care about you.

248
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,680
So handsome!

249
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,840
So handsome!

250
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So handsome!

251
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,040
So handsome!

252
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
So handsome!

253
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,360
Can you take a picture with me?

254
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,520
So cool!

255
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,680
Take a picture for us.

256
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,000
Look this way, Shanshan.

257
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,400
Let's go.

258
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,760
So handsome!

259
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,760
So handsome!

260
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,680
So handsome!

261
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So handsome!

262
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,360
So handsome!

263
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,440
So handsome!

264
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,680
So handsome!

265
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,240
So handsome!

266
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,400
So handsome!

267
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,680
So handsome!

268
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,920
So handsome!

269
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,920
I've thought about it for you.

270
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,920
This is an irreplaceable opportunity.

271
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,920
If you know how to handle it, you can also be a good person.

272
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,920
I have another suggestion.

273
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,920
I want to find you a woman

274
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,920
who can be Ding Xiaorou.

275
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,920
This will become a hot topic for everyone.

276
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,920
By then, the store will be full of customers who have heard your story.

277
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,920
You can also become a chef.

278
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,920
If you are willing to accept this plan,

279
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,920
I can give you a bonus.

280
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,920
Boss, can I say something?

281
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,920
Say it.

282
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,920
I know you have spent a lot of time on me.

283
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,920
But I really didn't want to make money as a chef.

284
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,920
I am the least in need of help in this life.

285
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,920
I think I may not be worthy of your plan.

286
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,920
Don't worry.

287
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,920
You can listen to this plan first.

288
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,920
Maybe after listening, you will understand.

289
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,920
No need.

290
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,920
I have a few words.

291
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,920
A few words?

292
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,920
I have to go home.

293
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,920
Like this.

294
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,920
Slowly shake the floor from this building.

295
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,920
Shake the floor to the surface.

296
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,920
Then take the light bulb back.

297
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,920
That's it.

298
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,920
Hurry up.

299
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,920
This will be the transfer point soon.

300
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,920
Don't waste time here.

301
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,920
Hurry up and move the director's stuff to the car.

302
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,920
Go.

303
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,920
Okay.

304
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,920
Okay.

305
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,920
Just this position.

306
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,920
Okay.

307
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,920
Yes, yes, yes.

308
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,920
Okay, thank you.

309
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,920
Let me do it.

310
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,920
This box is too heavy.

311
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,920
No need.

312
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,920
I can do it myself.

313
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,920
It's okay.

314
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,920
If the crew sees you like this, they will gossip.

315
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,920
I am the director.

316
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,920
I am the biggest here.

317
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,920
Who dares to gossip?

318
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,920
It's almost a week.

319
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,920
I have to go.

320
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,920
I have to go.

321
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,920
I have to go.

322
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,920
It's almost a week.

323
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,920
Your willfulness should end here.

324
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,920
Don't make a fuss with me.

325
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,920
Isn't it good to go home and be your daughter?

326
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,920
No.

327
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,920
I just want to follow you every day.

328
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,920
I can work with you with dignity.

329
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,920
Such an opportunity is rare.

330
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,920
I don't know how to do it.

331
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,920
The assistant's job is very tiring.

332
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,920
Your body will not be able to eat.

333
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,920
Look at you.

334
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,920
You have dark circles.

335
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,920
Your face is not very good.

336
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,920
You have to eat and drink in the crew every day.

337
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,920
You have to share a room with others.

338
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,920
How can you stand it?

339
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,920
Who says I can't stand it?

340
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,920
Look, I am in good health.

341
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,920
I just want to follow you every day.

342
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,920
Yuan, I am ready.

343
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,920
You can shoot now.

344
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,920
Why are you so wronged?

345
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,920
I am not obedient.

346
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,920
You have no choice.

347
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,920
Do you like it yourself?

348
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,920
Yuan, you can shoot now.

349
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,920
Okay, I will come right away.

350
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,920
You go quickly.

351
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,920
I can move myself.

352
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,920
Okay.

353
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,920
If you are tired, go to my car and sleep.

354
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,920
Take care of yourself.

355
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,920
Understand?

356
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,920
Someone is hit.

357
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,920
What happened?

358
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,920
Didn't you want to keep quiet?

359
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,920
Director, it seems that your assistant is here.

360
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,920
What?

361
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,920
Amber, Amber.

362
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,920
Are you okay?

363
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,920
Why are you still standing here? Call the ambulance.

364
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,920
Okay.

365
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,920
Hurry up, hurry up.

366
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,920
What happened?

367
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,920
What happened?

368
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,920
I don't know.

369
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,920
I don't know.

370
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,920
I don't know.

371
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,920
Okay, okay, okay.

372
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,920
Ding Yi.

373
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
Guess.

374
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,920
I think this structure is similar to our flower shop.

375
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,920
Yes.

376
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,920
This is an upgraded version of the flower shop called V-Love restaurant.

377
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,920
I want to renovate the flower shop.

378
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,920
Behind the flower shop, there is a big dining table.

379
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,920
It makes our flower shop more diverse and attracts more customers.

380
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,920
Think about it.

381
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,920
When many customers come to buy flowers,

382
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,920
they can live in the sea of flowers.

383
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,920
Smell the fragrance of flowers, eat desserts.

384
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,920
It's such a beautiful thing.

385
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,920
What do you think?

386
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,920
Great!

387
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,920
Your idea is so novel.

388
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,920
I think many people will like it.

389
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,920
I saw you were unhappy in the flower shop the other day.

390
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,920
I thought you were unhappy because of the reconciliation between Yingdong and Wanjia.

391
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,920
I can't control the relationship.

392
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,920
But as long as I don't give up on my dream,

393
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,920
I can pursue it.

394
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,920
You are really fine.

395
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,920
They are all my good friends.

396
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,920
I'm happy to call them happy.

397
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,920
I don't understand what you are saying.

398
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,920
Who says I don't understand?

399
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,920
I think your idea is very good.

400
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,920
But if the flower shop is a restaurant,

401
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,920
there must be a good chef.

402
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,920
Do you have a good idea?

403
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,920
Of course.

404
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,920
Who?

405
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,920
This person is far away from the sky.

406
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,920
He is right in front of you.

407
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,920
Me?

408
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,920
Don't make jokes.

409
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,920
I'm just a hobby.

410
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,920
If you want me to be a professional chef,

411
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,920
I'm far from it.

412
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,920
What are you afraid of?

413
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,920
I dare not say that the dishes you cook are much better than those chefs.

414
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,920
Really?

415
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,920
Really.

416
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,920
Besides, there is my uncle.

417
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,920
I have to eat.

418
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,920
Uncle.

419
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,920
Uncle, you are back.

420
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,920
I came to say goodbye to you.

421
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,920
Goodbye?

422
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,920
What goodbye?

423
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,920
I'm going to leave Shanghai and go back to Guangzhou.

424
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
No way.

425
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,920
You don't plan to wait for Ding Xiaorou here?

426
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,920
Waiting for someone who is not necessarily in Shanghai.

427
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,920
I don't want to give her pressure here.

428
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,920
Uncle, does mom know?

429
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,920
If she knew, she would be very sad.

430
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,920
Don't worry, I'll tell her.

431
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,920
Master, if you leave,

432
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,920
no one will teach me to make desserts.

433
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,920
How can it be?

434
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,920
I will teach you before I leave.

435
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,920
Hello, brother.

436
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,920
Amber fainted and went to the hospital.

437
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,920
What?

438
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,920
Come here right now.

439
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,920
Okay, okay, I'll be there right away.

440
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
Where are you going?

441
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,920
Amber fainted.

442
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,920
She is in the hospital.

443
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,920
I have to go there right now.

444
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,920
Let's go together.

445
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,920
Let's go, let's go.

446
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,920
You are awake.

447
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,920
Where am I?

448
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
This is the hospital.

449
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
Why am I not in the hospital?

450
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,920
You are too shy to ask.

451
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,920
Do you know you scared me to death?

452
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,920
You fainted on the set.

453
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
You have no sense at all.

454
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,920
Fortunately, I took you to the hospital in time.

455
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,920
The doctor said you were fine.

456
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,920
You fainted because you were too tired.

457
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,920
Amber, I really doubt if you have eaten recently.

458
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,920
When I carried you here, you were too light.

459
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,920
Let me do it.

460
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,920
Let me do it.

461
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,920
If you carry me to the hospital,

462
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,920
the crew will know our relationship.

463
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,920
How can I go back to work?

464
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,920
You still want to go back to work?

465
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,920
Miss, please forgive me.

466
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,920
I told you that the crew is very tired.

467
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,920
It's not suitable for you.

468
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,920
But you don't listen.

469
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,920
Now, the crew will stop working for you for a day.

470
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,920
Do you know how much you lost?

471
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,920
Are you helping me or hurting me?

472
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,920
I'm so cold.

473
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,920
I'm so useless and miserable.

474
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,920
You don't comfort me.

475
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,920
You don't love me.

476
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,920
I'm angry because I love you.

477
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,920
Do you think I don't know about your little heart?

478
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,920
You've been in the crew for a long time.

479
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,920
You just want to keep an eye on me.

480
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,920
You want to keep an eye on me.

481
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,920
You want to keep an eye on me.

482
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,920
You just want to keep an eye on me.

483
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,920
To see if there are other women around me, right?

484
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,920
That's right.

485
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,920
I'm the little heart, the love of the crew, the strong one.

486
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,920
I just want to be by your side, watching you, controlling you.

487
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,920
I don't want to be close to you like a butterfly.

488
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,920
Because you're the man I love.

489
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,920
What? No?

490
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,920
No.

491
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,920
Wang Jue, you...

492
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,920
I'm a man.

493
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,920
I have my job and space.

494
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,920
I can't change my lifestyle because of love.

495
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,920
But your lifestyle makes me feel insecure.

496
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,920
Can't you change it for me?

497
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,920
Wu Anpo, I think you understand.

498
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,920
I, Kang Zirui, will not change for anyone.

499
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,920
You're so annoying!

500
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,920
You're so annoying!

501
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,920
You're so annoying!

502
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,920
But I can promise you.

503
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,920
Before you fall in love with me, I will not leave you.

504
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,920
It's so hot.

505
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,920
I'll cool it down and then drink it.

506
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,920
You're here.

507
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,920
Anbo, are you okay?

508
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,920
Are you okay?

509
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,920
I'm fine.

510
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,920
I'm just too tired.

511
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,920
I'm not good at math.

512
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,920
How can you be too tired?

513
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,920
It's because of someone.

514
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,920
It seems that the power of love is really powerful.

515
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,920
It turns a person who is capable of living into a person.

516
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,920
When I came in, I saw my brother drinking soup for someone.

517
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,920
You have a job.

518
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,920
I've never seen my brother drink soup for a girl.

519
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,920
Really?

520
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,920
Then I'll have to take off my ice cream.

521
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,920
Okay, stop it.

522
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,920
Drink the soup.

523
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,920
Weiwei, take care of her.

524
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,920
No, you didn't do that just now.

525
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,920
You're very active now.

526
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,920
Drink it yourself.

527
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,920
No, I don't want it.

528
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,920
Otherwise I'll drink it.

529
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,920
Okay, stop it.

530
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,920
Drink it.

531
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,920
I love you.

532
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,920
Hello, who are you calling?

533
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,920
I want to see Ding Shaorou.

534
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,920
Is he here?

535
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,920
He is not here now.

536
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,920
What's up?

537
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,920
I am his friend.

538
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,920
My name is Huaishan Mao.

539
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,920
I haven't seen him for a long time.

540
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,920
I want to know if he is my friend.

541
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,920
I will tell you.

542
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,920
Just tell him.

543
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,920
Okay.

544
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,920
Okay, thank you.

545
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,920
What's wrong?

546
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,920
What's wrong?

547
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,920
I can't.

548
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,920
It's too hot.

549
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,920
I am hot.

550
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,920
Do you know?

551
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,920
I am a very good player.

552
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,920
I can play like this.

553
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,920
I can play like this.

554
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,920
I can play like this.

555
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,920
I can play like this.

556
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,920
I can play like this.

557
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,920
You know what?

558
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,040
I'm a master of the school.

559
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,760
I'm the best in the school.

560
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,600
I just let you go.

561
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,280
You're always talking nonsense.

562
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,520
I'm not as good as you.

563
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,480
I want to be in love with you.

564
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,560
But women are always pestering me.

565
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,080
It's good to be in love.

566
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,280
But it's the beginning of love.

567
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,240
By the way, Xiao Jing.

568
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,800
I saw you in the movie.

569
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,040
When a handsome chef like you is not working,

570
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,800
you're always talking nonsense.

571
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,480
You're the best in the family.

572
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,920
You're so shy.

573
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,560
You should be more careful.

574
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,760
I'm not as bad as you.

575
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,840
I only have one person in my heart.

576
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,920
He doesn't want to see you anymore.

577
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,200
Why do you want him to see you?

578
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,800
Have you ever thought about it?

579
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,120
The reason he doesn't want to see you

580
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,840
is because he doesn't dare to see you.

581
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,600
Maybe now he's not as good as he used to be.

582
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,320
You're so handsome.

583
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,160
He doesn't dare to show up.

584
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,560
Instead of being hated by you,

585
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,800
you should hide in your deep mind.

586
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,880
Don't think too much.

587
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,160
You're playing games with me.

588
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,440
You're not interested in me.

589
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,520
You're so beautiful.

590
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,240
You're the best.

591
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,800
Do it.

592
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,400
He still calls me.

593
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,600
He doesn't talk.

594
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,800
That means he still feels for me.

595
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,840
You don't want to see him anymore, right?

596
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,040
I'll tell you the truth.

597
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,320
I called you to answer the phone.

598
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,800
Don't be so self-willed.

599
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,240
Ding Xiaorou has completely forgotten you.

600
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,960
Just give up.

601
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,560
You're so bad at acting.

602
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,080
You're so busy at night.

603
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,720
You're going to the gossip network.

604
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,360
You're going to talk to strangers.

605
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,040
Stop it.

606
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,200
You don't have time.

607
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,200
Hurry up.

608
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,280
Get in the car.

609
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,360
Hello?

610
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,200
Okay.

611
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,400
I won't let you in.

612
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,680
We've found Ding Xiaorou's home.

613
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,200
We've left the words and the note we should write.

614
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,040
What else can we do?

615
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,040
If this goes on,

616
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,520
Xiaojia will be a father-in-law of a rich young man.

617
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,000
Maybe we should wait until time runs out.

618
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,800
Then Xiaojia will give up.

619
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,440
I won't wait until time runs out.

620
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,920
If Xiaojia keeps going on like this,

621
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,400
he'll kill all the people.

622
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,120
He'll give an explanation.

623
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,120
I have to do it myself.

624
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,800
What are you going to do?

625
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,680
I'm going to find out the truth.

626
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,240
Okay.

627
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,320
This one.

628
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,400
So these are it?

629
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,200
These are the rest of the people.

630
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,280
ok

631
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:22,760
So you will say things on that matter of the니

632
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,920
yes

633
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,880
you even would say things on that matter

634
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,520
if you're a teacher now.

635
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,720
Yeah, I am.

636
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,760
Did you get bore?

637
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,760
I'm here. Call me.

638
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,760
What do you want?

639
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,760
I want to check Xiaorou's room.

640
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,760
See if she's married.

641
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,760
Or just a boyfriend.

642
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,760
Tell me how to get in.

643
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,760
Just turn in.

644
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,760
No one is there.

645
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,760
Turn in?

646
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,760
You turn in?

647
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,760
Uncle is my master.

648
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,760
What does it matter to him?

649
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,760
Hold this.

650
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,760
You're a girl after all.

651
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,760
You can't go.

652
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,760
I'll do it.

653
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,760
You're in the dark.

654
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,760
The security guard is here.

655
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,760
Hurry up.

656
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,760
Hold me.

657
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,760
Hold me.

658
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,760
Hurry up.

659
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,760
Be careful.

660
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,760
I can't see anyone.

661
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,760
Be careful.

662
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,760
I'm sorry.

663
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,760
Anyone there?

664
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
Xiaojiao?

665
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,760
It's all Xiaojiao's photos.

666
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,760
I'm sorry.

667
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,760
Xiaorou.

668
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,760
It's beautiful.

669
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,760
Xiaojiao, you're good at choosing.

670
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,760
Hello.

671
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,760
Are you buying flowers?

672
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,760
Someone is here.

673
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,760
Go.

674
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,760
Who are you?

675
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,760
I'm not a thief.

676
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,760
Why did you come to my house?

677
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,760
I'm a friend of Samo.

678
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,760
Friend?

679
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,760
I'm sorry.

680
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,760
I'll send it to you.

681
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,760
How is it?

682
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,760
They think you're a thief.

683
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,760
At first, yes.

684
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,760
Then I gave them a photo of me and Xiaojiao.

685
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,760
They said they were friends of Samo.

686
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,760
They saw that there was nothing in the house.

687
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,760
They let me out.

688
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,760
How is it now?

689
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,760
What do you mean?

690
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,760
Of course it's Xiaorou.

691
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,760
You're a pig.

692
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,760
She...

693
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,760
She has a boyfriend.

694
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,760
I told you.

695
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,760
No wonder you didn't want to see her.

696
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,760
Now it's okay.

697
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,760
She can give up.

698
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,760
Xiaojiao can give up.

699
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,760
You want to change this shop into a flower shop?

700
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,760
I think the flower view of different seasons

701
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,760
will make the customer like this place more.

702
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,760
And you don't need too much money.

703
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,760
I think the season of the experiment is between 12 to 15 people.

704
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,760
Who is the main character?

705
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,760
Xiaojiao?

706
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,760
I told Xiaojiao.

707
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,760
She said she would give some opinions at the beginning.

708
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,760
But for the long-term plan, I want to see Weiwei.

709
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,760
I really don't know what she's thinking.

710
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,760
Come on, eat some food.

711
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,760
I think your suggestion is good.

712
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,760
Weiwei usually likes to cook.

713
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,760
She is very knowledgeable about food.

714
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,760
I'm telling you.

715
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,760
If we become the main chef,

716
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,760
I will come to the show.

717
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,760
If you don't want this concept,

718
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,760
I will move it to the opposite side of the Anfei.

719
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,760
You two are wearing wedding dress.

720
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,760
Does it work?

721
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,760
Ding Yi's idea is good.

722
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,760
Let go and do it.

723
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,760
If this small restaurant can really leave Xiaojiao,

724
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,760
maybe she can forget Ding Xiaorou.

725
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,760
No way.

726
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,760
Xiaojiao is still worried about that unappeared Ding Xiaorou.

727
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,760
What is this unhappiness?

728
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,760
What kind of woman is Ding Xiaorou?

729
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,760
She doesn't want such a good uncle.

730
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,760
She even wants to return the long-term plan.

731
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,760
Uncle doesn't want her.

732
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,760
I want her.

733
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,760
You change your mind so fast.

734
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,760
Are you jealous?

735
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,760
By the way,

736
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,760
Youxi gave you a new address last time.

737
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,760
Did she ask you to find Ding Xiaorou?

738
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,760
We went to find her.

739
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,760
We didn't see her.

740
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,760
But her parents said she already had a boyfriend.

741
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,760
She knows him so well.

742
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,760
Does Xiaojiao know about this?

743
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,760
I sent a message to Youxi.

744
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,760
She should know now.

745
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,760
I'm afraid she can't stand this blow.

746
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,760
She went back to Guangzhou alone.

747
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,760
What did you say Xiaojiao taught you?

748
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,760
We just need to try to help her.

749
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,760
Xiaojiao's character is more than a man.

750
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,760
I think this time the breakup period is not just 33 days.

751
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,760
It's not necessarily 333 days.

752
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,760
Not really.

753
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,760
How about this?

754
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,760
We keep looking for a girlfriend for Xiaojiao.

755
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,760
Maybe she will forget Ding Xiaorou soon.

756
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,760
How can that be?

757
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,760
Xiaojiao is not the kind of person who doesn't love.

758
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,760
Xiaojiao.

759
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,760
Come on, come on, come on.

760
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,760
It's all over.

761
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,760
I'm so tired.

762
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,760
I'm going to the stage.

763
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,760
Why are you so tired?

764
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,760
I'm going to the stage.

765
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,760
I'm going to the stage.

766
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,760
I'm going to the stage.

767
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,760
Xiaojiao, don't go with me.

768
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,760
I'm afraid you'll kill yourself.

769
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,760
Don't talk nonsense.

770
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,760
Xiaojiao, drink some water.

771
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,760
Okay, thank you.

772
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,760
Are you okay?

773
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,760
I'm fine.

774
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,760
I went out for a walk.

775
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,760
I'm leaving Shanghai soon.

776
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,760
So you really decided to leave?

777
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,760
There is no night without the mountain.

778
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,760
I came here for an answer.

779
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,760
Now I finally know.

780
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,760
I'm satisfied.

781
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,760
Look, look.

782
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,760
Kang Weiwei is different from usual.

783
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,760
I just said why she was so concerned about Ding Xiaorou.

784
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:53,760
Maybe she and Xiaojiao are trying to make love.

785
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
She definitely loves Xiaojiao.

786
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,760
Can we see each other again?

787
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,760
Of course.

788
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,760
I will come back to see you.

789
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,760
I just want to find a place to stay while I'm cooking.

790
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,760
Don't be so sad.

791
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,760
Xiaojiao finally got out of the past.

792
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,760
We should be happy for her.

793
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,760
Let's have a farewell party for Xiaojiao.

794
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,760
Let her go on a happy path.

795
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,760
What path?

796
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,760
It's a new start.

797
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,760
Yes, a new start.

798
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,760
Okay, how about this party in my house?

799
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,760
I will invite the best chefs in Shanghai to cook for everyone.

800
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,760
Who?

801
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,760
Kang Weiwei.

802
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,760
That's good.

803
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,760
The End
