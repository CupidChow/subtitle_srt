00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Sister.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You're fine.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm fine.

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm fine.

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I care about you and my two sons the most.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I owe you so much.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I can't forget.

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
When you were five years old, I was too willful.

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I was pregnant with Ding Yi.

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
My parents abandoned me.

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
My parents bullied me.

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I can never forget you.

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You were chasing after my life.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Sister, come back.

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Come back.

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I want to come back.

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But how can I?

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
All right.

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I know.

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm not as miserable as you.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Why are you doing this?

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You can't do this.

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Promise me.

66
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Promise me to live well.

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You have to be happy.

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
All right.

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I know.

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
As long as you're happy, I'll be happy.

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't care about all the grievances and hardships.

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I came to Shanghai, but you went to a faraway place.

74
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
If you take a step forward bravely,

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
you don't have to bear the pain alone.

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Thank God for letting me spend the last days with you.

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The sky.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I want to go somewhere where I can love.

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I want to love someone.

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Where do you want to go?

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Shangri-La.

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The translation of the Chinese is the sun and the moon.

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I heard that the sky is very blue and the scenery is very beautiful.

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
There are no worries and no sadness.

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Will you go with me one day?

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes.

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Xiaorou, although you left,

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
you will always live in my heart.

89
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I want to take you to the heaven you want to go to.

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Shangri-La.

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Will you?

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm in front of the car. Can you take me there?

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Okay, no problem.

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Thank you.

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Be careful.

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Thank you.

97
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Here we are.

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This?

99
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Thank you.

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You're welcome.

101
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Thank you.

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Thank you.

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Thank you.

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Thank you.

105
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You're welcome.

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Be careful.

107
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
This is good.

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Youxi.

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Hi, beautiful.

110
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Hi.

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I've never seen you before.

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Nonsense.

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Let's go drink beer together.

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Okay?

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You're free anyway.

116
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
No, I'm busy.

117
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'll give you this flash.

118
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You may need it when you go back.

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What about you?

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's okay, I have another one.

121
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Oh, right.

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
This flash is very important to me.

123
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So, I'll give you a call.

124
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll go to you with it.

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Youxi.

126
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Let's talk later.

127
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
How about you two take my car?

128
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll give you a ride.

129
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Okay.

130
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
No need.

131
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Okay.

132
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Bye.

133
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Bye.

134
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Bye.

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Bye.

136
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Bye.

137
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Bye.

138
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You're good.

139
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What are you doing here?

140
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm afraid you don't have a flash.

141
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So I came to give you a flash.

142
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That's good.

143
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's good?

144
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Of course.

145
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Let's go.

146
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Who are you going to eat with me?

147
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
No one.

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm sorry.

151
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm sorry.

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm sorry.

157
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm sorry.

158
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm sorry.

162
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm sorry.

163
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm sorry.

165
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm sorry.

169
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm sorry.

172
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm sorry.

173
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm sorry.

174
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm sorry.

175
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm sorry.

176
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm sorry.

178
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Can you show me a balloon?

179
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Love moments made with a young age is beautiful.

180
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,220
A naive and simple life at the Pike,

181
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:37,220
There's no fight, no deception, no hatred.

182
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,940
It feels like yesterday.

183
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,540
I've been reading the gossip.

184
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,700
Now I know

185
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,220
that gossip can be so meaningful.

186
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,420
I want to remember forever

187
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,940
that this person believes in love.

188
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,940
That's it.

189
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,220
I want to remember forever that this person believes in love.

190
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,220
Xiaorou,

191
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,220
I'll miss you

192
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,220
if you go well.

193
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,220
I want to remember forever that this person believes in love.

194
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,220
I want to remember forever that this person believes in love.

195
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,220
I want to remember forever that this person believes in love.

196
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,220
I want to remember forever that this person believes in love.

197
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,220
I want to remember forever that this person believes in love.

198
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,220
I want to remember forever that this person believes in love.

199
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,220
I want to remember forever that this person believes in love.

200
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,220
I want to remember forever that this person believes in love.

201
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,220
I want to remember forever that this person believes in love.

202
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,220
I want to remember forever that this person believes in love.

203
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,220
Fuck you!

204
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,220
It smells great.

205
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,220
If one of my龍 Cannon Madrid masters were here,

206
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,220
I'd be theile of splendor.

207
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,220
I'm sure Ding Yi will make delicious food.

208
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,220
You're really good at cooking.

209
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,220
But remember to cook more delicious food.

210
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,220
Thank you, Chef.

211
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,220
I've learned a lot of dishes from you.

212
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,220
You're talented.

213
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,220
If I give you another month,

214
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,220
I think you'll learn all the dishes I've learned.

215
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,220
I can't help it.

216
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,220
Who told you to be so hard-working?

217
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,220
But I believe that with Ding Yi,

218
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,220
the business of our flower shop will get better.

219
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,220
Of course.

220
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,220
He has such a good assistant.

221
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,220
He's so sincere.

222
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,220
It smells so good. What is this?

223
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,220
It smells so good.

224
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,220
What new dishes did you make today?

225
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,220
This is the dish my uncle taught me.

226
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,220
Here you are, Ding.

227
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,220
Thank you.

228
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,220
It's delicious.

229
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,220
Mr. Kan, you'll be in charge of the restaurant.

230
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,220
You'll be a good student.

231
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,220
Mr. Kan, I'll leave the future to you.

232
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,220
Okay.

233
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,220
You two can go to the cinema with me on Friday.

234
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,220
Okay.

235
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,220
I'll go with you as long as Uncle likes it.

236
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,220
Okay.

237
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,220
Come here.

238
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,220
Don't dress like this.

239
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,220
I'm not a man who can stand a man who is so handsome.

240
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,220
If you're handsome, you'll lose your life.

241
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,220
Can you talk?

242
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,220
What do you mean by losing your life?

243
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,220
What son?

244
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,220
How do you know it's a son?

245
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,220
You'll know when you go to the hospital tomorrow.

246
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,220
Mom said she would go with you.

247
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,220
If it's a daughter, I like her more.

248
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,220
I treat her like a little princess.

249
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,220
I'm sorry.

250
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,220
Youxi.

251
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,220
I've been thinking.

252
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,220
Maybe I'm not suitable for this child.

253
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,220
Look, I can't even take care of myself.

254
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,220
I think I'd better take the child away.

255
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,220
Can you say that one last time?

256
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,220
I'll take care of you in the future.

257
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,220
As long as you give birth to the child,

258
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:14,220
I'll take care of your consciousness and your mind.

259
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,220
I'm sorry.

260
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,220
Let her decide for us.

261
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,220
If you come to this world,

262
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,220
I'll hug you.

263
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,220
You don't have to cry.

264
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,220
I'll marry your mother right away.

265
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,220
Okay?

266
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,220
When you go out,

267
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,220
you should prepare clothes.

268
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,220
This way you won't catch a cold.

269
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,220
Put your hands here.

270
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,220
And you can go to the hospital.

271
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,220
Put your hands here.

272
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,220
Okay?

273
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,220
Let's go.

274
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,220
I finally know where the real charm of a man is.

275
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,220
I have to thank you.

276
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,220
You and Xiaorou's things.

277
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,220
Let her find her conscience and courage.

278
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,220
What's wrong?

279
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,220
Someone is upset?

280
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,220
Or someone stole it?

281
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,220
How could it be?

282
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,220
I'm not happy.

283
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,220
Because my brother is leaving me.

284
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:49,220
He doesn't even know where the future is.

285
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,220
I don't know.

286
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,220
Let's wait for the day to decide.

287
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,220
Finally, it's romantic.

288
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,220
I'm worried about them before I leave.

289
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,220
I hope their feelings are in place.

290
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,220
Don't miss me.

291
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,220
Have you ever thought about coming to my bar?

292
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,220
Or go to Dingyi's restaurant?

293
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,220
Think about it and stay.

294
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,220
Sister.

295
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,220
Let me go out for a walk.

296
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,220
See the world outside.

297
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,220
Okay, let's go.

298
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,220
I want to be born.

299
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,220
But you want to fly away.

300
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,220
Our children are like wings.

301
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,220
The farther you fly, the higher you fly.

302
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,220
I understand.

303
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,220
Left a little.

304
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,220
More, more.

305
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,220
Right, right.

306
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,220
Put it down.

307
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,220
Down.

308
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,220
Down.

309
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,220
Put it down.

310
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,220
Okay.

311
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,220
Li Lucy.

312
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,220
Ah, we are leaving.

313
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,220
Hey, Weiwei.

314
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,220
Why did you arrive early after class?

315
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,220
I came out of the classroom right before school.

316
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,220
I want to give you a surprise. How is it?

317
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,860
Are you very touched?

318
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,060
I am. I am very touched.

319
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,700
Let's go to the supermarket.

320
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,380
We have no fridge at home. Let's go buy some food.

321
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,660
We'll cook dinner at home.

322
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,940
Now?

323
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:25,700
Let's go.

324
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,620
But...

325
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,940
Yingdong sent a driver to pick me up.

326
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,580
He's been waiting for me at the door for a long time.

327
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,220
He only has an hour and 20 minutes to meet me.

328
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,220
Is Yingdong that important?

329
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,220
How long does he know you?

330
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,580
We grew up together. We are good friends.

331
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,100
No.

332
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,460
He introduced me to the art director of the gallery.

333
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,020
He saw my work.

334
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,620
You are so petty.

335
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,820
If you don't want to be a good girl, go home.

336
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,140
I'll make it up to you.

337
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,700
I'll give you a massage.

338
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,700
Do whatever you want.

339
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,980
I'm not doing it.

340
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,540
I'm not even in a balance.

341
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,340
I'm not going to be a good girl if Yingdong shows up.

342
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,700
A woman who is a pervert is so scary.

343
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,540
How about...

344
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,460
Today, I...

345
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,980
Okay, I'm playing with you.

346
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,780
Go ahead. Don't wait for too long.

347
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,580
That's the best you can do.

348
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,460
Bye.

349
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,260
I'll come back later. I'll cook dinner with you.

350
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,460
Look at the room.

351
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,540
No.

352
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,700
Where are you going?

353
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,740
I'm going to the supermarket to buy something.

354
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,500
Get in.

355
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,220
I'll drive you.

356
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,420
You are so good. I can't get in.

357
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,340
I can't.

358
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,380
I'm begging you.

359
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,820
How can you drive a motorcycle?

360
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,140
You scared me.

361
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,740
I'm begging you too.

362
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,020
If you don't let me drive, please don't give it back to me.

363
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,180
You call me every day.

364
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,380
You are like a mental health exam.

365
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,060
I'm going crazy.

366
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,780
Your mother told me to stop you.

367
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,300
I have to follow the rules strictly.

368
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,620
Do you understand?

369
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,020
When did my mother say that?

370
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,580
Let's go.

371
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,980
Let's go.

372
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,020
Let's go.

373
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,140
Hat.

374
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,500
Hat.

375
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,580
Hat.

376
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,380
Hold on.

377
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,540
I'll go.

378
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,740
Hold on tight.

379
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,740
Let's go, Mu Ze.

380
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,060
Don't be my boyfriend.

381
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,860
Sit down.

382
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,780
Amber.

383
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,580
Why are you alone?

384
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,580
Did Xiao Qiao go out with someone?

385
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,780
Who knows?

386
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,380
Her phone is off.

387
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,140
Why are you abandoned too?

388
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,660
Who says I'm abandoned?

389
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,940
Amber has always abandoned others.

390
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,900
No one has ever abandoned me.

391
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,620
Oh.

392
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,340
Brother.

393
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,740
I have something to talk to your brother about work.

394
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,620
I'm shy.

395
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,540
I'm not a good girl.

396
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,740
Bye-bye.

397
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,820
Darling, get in the car.

398
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,620
I'm sorry, Amber.

399
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,740
We have to go now.

400
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,620
If you are sorry, you should say more.

401
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,420
I think you should go to a relationship if you have time.

402
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,820
Otherwise, you will be alone.

403
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,860
You are so annoying.

404
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:37,540
Let's go.

405
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,380
Bye-bye, baby.

406
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,300
Hey, listen.

407
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,700
You are in a relationship.

408
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,980
It has nothing to do with me.

409
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,860
I don't want you to be with me.

410
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,100
Mr. Kang.

411
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,460
Brother Bing Yi.

412
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,980
You are the first one who left school.

413
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,460
You haven't left yet?

414
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,780
What's wrong?

415
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:09,340
Is first love really that important to a woman?

416
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,020
They have changed.

417
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,580
Do you think I'm unlucky?

418
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,140
First, my best friend was taken away.

419
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,380
Then, my motorcycle and my helmet.

420
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,820
Finally, my brother was taken away.

421
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,020
This case of a serial robbery

422
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,940
sounds very complicated.

423
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,100
This case of a serial robbery.

424
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,260
The police are rude.

425
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,260
Forget it.

426
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,260
I'll accept it.

427
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,380
Then, you go to the supermarket with me.

428
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,580
We will talk about the case on the way.

429
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,140
Okay.

430
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,140
Let's go.

431
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,500
Mr. Li.

432
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,940
I asked you to meet me

433
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,580
because I want you to be the producer of this film.

434
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,580
What do you think of this story?

435
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,460
Mr. Kang.

436
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,340
No matter how good your story is,

437
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,980
it can only be a little bit of artistic success.

438
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,380
Do you understand?

439
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,700
Look at it now.

440
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,260
Even commercial films are expensive.

441
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,500
Not to mention the so-called pure foreign films.

442
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,900
Look at the story.

443
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,540
It's a mess.

444
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,380
The heroine didn't even get on the bed.

445
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,980
She didn't have a date or a relationship.

446
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,820
She finally kissed him.

447
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,540
In the end, the heroine got a leukemia.

448
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,740
Mr. Kang, are you going to make a Korean drama?

449
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,340
That's too fake.

450
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,780
I knew you were the one who made this script.

451
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,900
You don't know, do you?

452
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,660
This is a true story.

453
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,100
The heroine's name is Hua San Mao.

454
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,620
The heroine's name is Ding Xiang Rou.

455
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,740
The story of the two of them getting together is very popular on Weibo.

456
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,500
Amber.

457
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,060
Uncle, you're not good at talking, are you?

458
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,860
How can you talk?

459
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,620
Kang Da Wan.

460
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,260
You're a tough assistant.

461
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,500
I'm sorry.

462
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,260
She's new here. She doesn't know the rules.

463
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,540
Don't mind her.

464
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,340
Actually, the idea of this story

465
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,460
was created by my assistant and me.

466
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,620
So I asked her to come with me today.

467
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,740
I'm not going to be your assistant.

468
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,580
The audience is very popular now.

469
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,580
They will never come to the cinema to watch your drama.

470
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,380
So your drama has no market.

471
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,540
Even if you make it, it's a waste.

472
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,940
No one wants to invest in this drama.

473
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:32,060
But films like The Tree of Shadows are also very popular.

474
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,860
From this point of view,

475
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,580
the audience still longs for pure love.

476
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,100
The Tree of Shadows?

477
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,580
Who is the director?

478
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,820
Zhang Yi Mou?

479
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,180
Who is Zhang Yi Mou?

480
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,820
The famous international director.

481
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,620
Dear Kang Da Wan.

482
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,180
To be honest,

483
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,900
you usually shoot MVs and commercials.

484
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,100
Why do you let the investors

485
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,940
have the confidence to invest in you?

486
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,740
It's just money.

487
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,180
I have the confidence to invest in this movie.

488
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,460
I have 100% confidence in Kang Da Wan.

489
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,580
You're a little assistant.

490
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,220
Do you know how much it costs to invest in a movie?

491
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,140
Kang Da Wan, how much did you say?

492
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,020
Don't make a scene.

493
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,380
You should know what I'm talking about.

494
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,980
I won't let you down.

495
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,700
12 million.

496
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,740
How much did I invest?

497
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,300
I'll invest in this movie. I'll be the producer.

498
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,700
Kang Da Wan.

499
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,740
You're quite a good assistant.

500
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,540
Actually, the place we're talking about

501
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,300
is run by his father.

502
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,940
The owner of this hotel is Wu Yuting.

503
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,300
So your father hates Wu Yuting?

504
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,540
That's right.

505
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,100
And Kang Da Wan is my boyfriend.

506
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,820
I knew it. I finally understood.

507
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,900
Kang Da Wan, you're really good at hiding things.

508
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,980
Don't talk nonsense.

509
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:08,180
Take away the heroine of this movie.

510
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,900
I want to find a heroine who knows love,

511
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,060
who has a girl's heart for her first love.

512
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,540
Brother Li, I'm going to go.

513
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,660
Take care.

514
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,940
Bye.

515
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,900
Be careful.

516
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,060
Bye.

517
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,900
Bye.

518
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,140
Brother Tian Yi.

519
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,380
How did Wan Jia talk to those girls?

520
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,780
She wants us to know.

521
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,420
She'll tell us.

522
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,500
You're not happy?

523
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:52,860
I'm not.

524
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:56,540
Are you afraid that Yingdong will change Wan Jia?

525
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,420
If she doesn't want to be changed,

526
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,540
who can change her?

527
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,140
I think Yingdong is too strong.

528
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,260
She must want to change Wan Jia.

529
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,380
Enough.

530
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,820
We're starting a business.

531
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,580
You're still busy with other things.

532
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,900
Get back to work.

533
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,460
You really don't care?

534
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,580
I only care about this movie.

535
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,900
Wan Jia.

536
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,340
Why are you here?

537
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,780
I missed you.

538
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,980
How was the food today?

539
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,900
It was good.

540
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:47,140
She brought me to meet some friends of her art exhibition.

541
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,060
She said that she wanted to arrange my works

542
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,300
for the exhibition of European artists.

543
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,500
Not bad.

544
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,940
She wants to support you.

545
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,820
Brother Li.

546
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,940
Brother Li.

547
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,660
What are you doing?

548
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,900
What?

549
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,540
Aren't you happy for me?

550
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,700
No.

551
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,940
I'm happy for you.

552
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,620
Then, give me some advice.

553
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,700
I think Yingdong is a person who can create miracles.

554
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,580
If he really wants to help you,

555
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,180
you can do it.

556
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,180
Money.

557
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,820
Men's words are always more valuable than women's words.

558
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,300
No.

559
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:35,820
All I care about is your feelings.

560
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,300
Go back to the studio.

561
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,620
You can interview a popular idol in the eyes of young people.

562
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,700
The most sincere singer, Miss.

563
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,580
The listener you have dialed is busy.

564
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,300
Please leave a message.

565
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,700
Hello, everyone.

566
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,100
I'm Eddy.

567
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,900
I think many people are like me.

568
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,660
I want to know how you came to sing.

569
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,500
Actually, I was very ordinary when I was young.

570
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:09,380
Whether it's my appearance or my personality,

571
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,700
I didn't attract attention.

572
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:15,740
You know, little girls are a little bit inferior.

573
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:19,020
I always thought that I was inferior to others.

574
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,580
I was a little more loved than my classmates.

575
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,140
It's really hard to believe.

576
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,980
You're so good now.

577
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,820
So, should I say that singing saved you?

578
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,980
Because I'm not confident,

579
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,380
my classmates always mocked me.

580
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,620
They even gave me a name.

581
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,300
It's called Bao Ya Mei.

582
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,700
Bao Ya Mei.

583
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,860
Yes.

584
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,540
In my memory,

585
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,700
I spent my student years in college.

586
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,100
Then I went to Guangzhou to study middle school.

587
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:58,340
The winter snow is still cold.

588
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,260
It's hard to believe.

589
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,500
I feel like I know you.

590
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:13,620
I think you know everyone except me and Mei Bao.

591
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:17,900
You're a bad girl who never leaves anyone behind.

592
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,660
Yes.

593
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,660
You're so mean.

594
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,620
You're right. You're really rich.

595
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,140
I think your ideas are rich.

596
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,580
We're rich?

597
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:33,740
Then let's hear what you think about the poor.

598
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:39,700
You were talking about the annual concert.

599
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:45,340
You're worried about who should be the guest.

600
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,900
You're not...

601
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,620
Yes, it's her.

602
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,340
Ai Di is the hottest singer now.

603
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,740
She must be a hot topic.

604
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,100
If we invite her,

605
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,540
I'm afraid that the students won't pay attention.

606
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,060
Then the audience will be very excited.

607
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,620
What? What's wrong?

608
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,060
Am I not good at this?

609
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,460
You're talking nonsense.

610
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,500
Who doesn't know it's good to invite Ai Di to the concert?

611
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:14,100
But the problem is that she's so popular now.

612
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,780
Who can invite her?

613
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:23,020
Besides, Ai Di has always been a loud person.

614
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,140
She's never been on her MV.

615
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,900
She can't be invited to many concerts.

616
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,300
Let alone our school.

617
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,020
Who's so proud?

618
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,580
Right.

619
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,940
What does Ai Di look like?

620
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,100
Why can't she show her face?

621
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,820
She must be pretty.

622
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,700
She sings so well.

623
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,700
That's not necessarily true.

624
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,220
She's not a beauty if she's a sweet voice.

625
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,020
She might be a beauty.

626
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,100
It's no use guessing.

627
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,860
We can't see her face or her photos.

628
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,580
It's all nonsense.

629
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:56,260
Do you want to see her real face?

630
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,060
You're lying.

631
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,820
I'll help you.

632
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,260
Hua Xiao Xi.

633
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,460
We're all friends.

634
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,100
We know you're close to her.

635
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,900
Can you be a little more reliable?

636
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,580
It's a dream.

637
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,100
Wait and see.

638
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:17,660
I'll reveal her secret.

639
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,500
Hello, everybody.

640
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,660
Do you have time tonight?

641
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,140
Wei Bao and I want to have a farewell party with Wei Wei.

642
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,860
Okay. I'll inform him when I meet Kang Zirui.

643
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,460
I'll ask Yingdong.

644
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,380
He must want to attend the farewell party.

645
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,380
Wei Wei and I are going to watch a movie.

646
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,540
Let's go to the bar at 10 pm.

647
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,020
Okay. We have time to prepare dessert.

648
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,500
Thank you.

649
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,100
What are you drinking?

650
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,820
Just ask him.

651
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,380
I'll have a bottle of rice wine with popcorn.

652
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,620
I want a box of popcorn.

653
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,500
Mr Kang, you're too much.

654
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,980
You're just watching a movie.

655
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,500
You want popcorn with popcorn?

656
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,260
I'll call you Mr Kang.

657
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:03,820
It's none of your business.

658
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,020
Besides, you asked me what I wanted to eat.

659
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,260
Don't eat it if you don't want to buy it.

660
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,100
Fine.

661
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,820
I'm sorry.

662
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,340
I'm sorry.

663
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,740
How many are in the air?

664
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,900
13, sir.

665
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,700
How many can I carry?

666
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,860
4, sir.

667
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,100
Oh, wait.

668
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,260
Slow down.

669
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,420
Relax.

670
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,580
Heather?

671
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,100
I'm sorry.

672
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,700
What's going on?

673
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:06,020
Wei Wei, try the taste of the old man.

674
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,540
You've never tasted it before.

675
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,940
You don't understand, do you?

676
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,980
The taste of durian is sweet after it's eaten.

677
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,060
The old man is the one who has been in contact with it.

678
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,060
That's how you can feel its tenderness and kindness.

679
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,220
Do you understand?

680
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,060
I don't understand the taste of it.

681
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,260
You eat it.

682
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,460
I'm sorry.

683
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,740
What are you doing?

684
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,060
I'm sorry.

685
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,500
Xiao Jiu hasn't come back yet.

686
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,460
Xiao Jiu, I'm back.

687
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,740
You're back.

688
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,900
Let's eat.

689
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,060
Cook your favourite dishes.

690
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,820
Xiao Jiu.

691
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,100
Eat.

692
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,260
I'm too tired.

693
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,780
Why?

694
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,900
Why are you in a bad mood?

695
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,460
It seems that you've recovered from your sadness.

696
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,260
You can help me now.

697
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,860
I don't want you to be like me.

698
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,740
You're a good girl.

699
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,780
You'll regret it sooner or later.

700
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,300
Besides,

701
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:21,100
you might not be able to give the one you can give Wan Jia.

702
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,580
Yes.

703
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,540
I can't give it to her.

704
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,460
I know you're doing this for my own good.

705
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,620
Xiao Jiu,

706
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,260
I really don't want to be with Wei Wei

707
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,380
because I can't find Wan Jia.

708
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,900
Don't you think it's unfair to Wei Wei?

709
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,900
And every time I'm with Wei Wei,

710
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,500
I can't think of Wan Jia.

711
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,660
Besides, I...

712
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,740
Besides,

713
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,420
you're still waiting for her to change her mind, right?

714
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,380
Let me tell you.

715
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,980
Even if one day,

716
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,300
Yingdong really breaks up with Wan Jia,

717
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,980
she might not give up on you.

718
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,020
Then I still have a chance to wait, right?

719
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,620
I know I understand.

720
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,420
But I've also lost someone.

721
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,300
I just think

722
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,300
there are things that can be let go of.

723
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,380
You have to let go.

724
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,300
Why don't you look at the person around you?

725
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:22,700
It might be different from the feeling before, right?

726
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,780
Look.

727
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,380
It's like this dish.

728
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,620
I cooked something sweet before.

729
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,620
But now it feels different.

730
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,860
Come on, let's eat.

731
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,300
Let's eat.

732
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,180
Hello.

733
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,540
I want to eat.

734
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,860
Please come in.

735
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,260
Come on, try my new dessert.

736
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,340
It's called Miss You.

737
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,100
Thank you.

738
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:51,900
Come on, try it.

739
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,140
We're going to learn the hand-made hand-pulled rice.

740
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,540
You have to wait for a while.

741
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,180
The process is too troublesome.

742
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,620
Where are you going?

743
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,660
Xiao Xiao, let me give you a toast.

744
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,740
Okay.

745
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,780
Thank you for letting me learn

746
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,460
how to be a responsible man.

747
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,380
Learn from your brother how to be a responsible man.

748
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,460
Don't learn from me. I'm not a good example.

749
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,060
Xiao Jiu.

750
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,260
Next time you come back,

751
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,340
you two will have good grades.

752
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,220
You should make good restaurants occasionally.

753
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,700
Next time you come back, you will open a branch.

754
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,300
Are you here?

755
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,340
Hello.

756
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,700
The two beautiful men and women are here.

757
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,660
I saw them.

758
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,780
Come on, sit down.

759
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,420
Xiao Jiu, Amber specially prepared this.

760
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,900
We will drink it all tonight.

761
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,300
Thank you.

762
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,740
Don't you have to have a meeting?

763
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,260
You need friends to be busy.

764
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,860
Maybe one day my business will be in Shangri-La.

765
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,420
You will be able to get a hold of me.

766
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,140
You're angry again.

767
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,180
Thank you for arranging an interview for me.

768
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,260
Otherwise, I won't be able to see you.

769
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,420
I also want to thank you.

770
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,140
I learned a lot from you.

771
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,820
Handsome men, I'm starving.

772
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,740
Wait, mom hasn't come down yet.

773
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,660
My mom won't come down so early.

774
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,420
I don't like Xiao Jiu.

775
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,020
Then let me go up and persuade her.

776
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,460
Do women need to be coaxed?

777
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,060
No, I'll go.

778
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,180
You're too much.

779
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,140
Why are you so happy?

780
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,220
I'm coming.

781
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:14,940
Mom.

782
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,460
Where are you going? Sit.

783
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,100
I'm going to sing a song today.

784
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,220
It's for my dearest daughter.

785
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:32,860
A long, long time ago

786
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,860
You have me

787
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,860
I have you

788
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:45,860
A long, long time ago

789
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:07,860
You have me

790
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:13,860
I have you

791
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:19,860
I have you

792
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:25,860
I have you

793
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:31,860
I have you

794
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:37,860
I have you

795
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,860
I hope you're happy.

796
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,860
Go find your happy world.

797
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,860
Okay, you have to take good care of yourself.

798
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,860
I give you a video every day.

799
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,860
What's not happy?

800
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,860
Call back.

801
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,860
I'm always waiting for you.

802
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,860
I know.

803
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,860
Even in the next life

804
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,860
I also hope we are a family.

805
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,860
But I want to be your brother.

806
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,860
Because you are too much.

807
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,860
Okay, thank you very much.

808
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,860
Really, thank you.

809
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,860
Let's have a drink.

810
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,860
Don't shout.

811
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,860
Jiu Jiu, have a safe trip.

812
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,860
Have a safe trip.

813
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,860
Cheers.

814
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,860
I have you

815
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:40,860
I have you

816
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,860
Thank you three old men for getting me together with my brother.

817
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,860
Let him finally see my tenderness.

818
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:52,860
Today is the first time I watch movies with my brother.

819
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,860
Although he didn't invite me

820
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,860
But it was intended by the old man.

821
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,860
But I still feel very happy.

822
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,860
The old man is about to leave.

823
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,860
I hope that after she arrives in Shangri-La,

824
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,860
she can meet another Xiaorou.

825
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,860
She can live happily like a fairy tale.

826
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,860
You two, take good care of my sister.

827
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,860
Or else I'll beat you up.

828
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,860
Don't worry, Xiao Jiao.

829
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,860
As long as I have time, I'll be with you.

830
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:21,860
Xiao Jiao, don't worry.

831
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,860
Although I really don't want you to leave,

832
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,860
if I can let you come back and cook with us,

833
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,860
I'll be angry with you on purpose.

834
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,860
And then I'll tell you.

835
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,860
You're so angry.

836
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,860
It's not the time yet.

837
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:33,860
You're still not convinced?

838
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,860
You're kidding.

839
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,860
Are you going to beat me up?

840
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,860
You...

841
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,860
You're my only disciple.

842
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,860
You have to be grateful and considerate.

843
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,860
Remember that every dish has a name.

844
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,860
I remember.

845
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,860
If you have time, call us.

846
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:53,860
I will.

847
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,860
By the way, Xiao Jiao,

848
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,860
this watch with the girl's name on it

849
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,860
is a souvenir for you.

850
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,860
I won't do anything

851
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,860
that will hurt other people's feelings anymore.

852
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:08,860
One day,

853
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,860
I'll be proud of you.

854
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,860
Okay.

855
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,860
Thank you.

856
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:17,860
Okay, that's enough.

857
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,860
I'm leaving.

858
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,860
I'm leaving.

859
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,860
Take care.

860
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:23,860
Goodbye.

861
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,860
I'm leaving. Bye.

862
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,860
Goodbye.

863
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,860
My longing for you

864
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,860
is like a kite that's broken.

865
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:01,860
An angel will come and love you for me.

866
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,860
I'll be by your side.

867
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:33,860
The most beautiful treasure in life

868
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:39,860
is those forgotten times.

869
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:46,860
Although we're poor, we only have happiness.

870
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:51,860
Wearing the old clothes.

871
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:01,860
We'll wait until the end.

872
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:05,860
We don't need any reason.

873
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:08,860
There's too much distance.

874
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:11,860
We can't be with you.

875
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:15,860
We'll wait until the end.

876
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,860
There's no excuse.

877
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:22,860
When you need it most,

878
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:26,860
you can always have it.

879
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,860
There's a saying

880
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:45,860
that you don't need to say.

881
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,860
You'll never hesitate.

882
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,860
You'll reach out your hand.

883
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:56,860
You'll be my wind.

884
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:59,860
You'll be my rain.

885
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:04,860
You'll teach me to stop and walk forward.

886
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,860
We've been hurt before.

887
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:12,860
There's a sorrow in the wound.

888
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:16,860
You'll be by my side.

889
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:19,860
We'll cry and drink.

890
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:23,860
We'll shout together.

891
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,860
We'll keep our mouth shut.

892
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:31,860
We'll stay on the street drunk.

893
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,860
We'll wait until the end.

894
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:39,860
We don't need any reason.

895
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:42,860
There's too much distance.

896
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:45,860
We can't be with you.

897
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:49,860
We'll wait until the end.

898
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:52,860
There's no excuse.

899
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:56,860
When you need it most,

900
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:00,860
you can always have it.

901
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:08,860
We'll wait together.

902
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:22,860
We'll wait.
