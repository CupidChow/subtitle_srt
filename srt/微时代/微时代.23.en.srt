1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Thank you for watching.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Thank you for watching.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Thank you for watching.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Thank you for watching.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Thank you for watching.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Thank you for watching.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Thank you for watching.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Thank you for watching.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Thank you for watching.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Thank you for watching.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Thank you for watching.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Thank you for watching.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Thank you for watching.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Thank you for watching.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Thank you for watching.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Thank you for watching.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Everyone says...

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
your name...

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
is as cold as winter.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But you know...

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
you're just like the winter fire.

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I have you as my warmth.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm happy,

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
but...

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm really scared.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,400
Because this happiness is so unreal.

55
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,400
I'm sorry, but I have to go to a meeting.

56
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,680
Can't you stay for another five minutes?

57
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,560
Five minutes?

58
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,160
I'm serious. Not even a minute.

59
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,000
Alright, I'll do it.

60
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,600
Don't be so angry. You're going to break your hand.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,280
Go, go, go. Take a break.

62
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,520
Come on, come on.

63
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Come on, let's wash.

64
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,840
The water is cold today.

65
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,560
What did you want me to do yesterday?

66
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,760
What you have to do is to wait for the meal to be done.

67
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,600
Go.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Go.

69
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,840
Tell me, what's wrong?

70
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,720
You never go to the kitchen to work.

71
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,720
It's okay.

72
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,560
Let's break up.

73
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,200
Why do you want to break up?

74
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,200
I think it's good.

75
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,040
That new feeling of happiness is finally over.

76
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,960
It's okay.

77
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,000
Is it because of Ying You Jin or the high-level tension?

78
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,800
Or Ying Dong decided it himself?

79
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,000
No matter what the reason is, it's all in the past.

80
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,440
Jia Jie. Jia Jie.

81
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,840
Ying Dong is here. He's waiting outside.

82
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,040
Let's go and have a look.

83
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,320
I knew it.

84
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,640
Ying Dong is still concerned about you.

85
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,080
Otherwise, he wouldn't come.

86
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,720
What are you drawing?

87
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,880
Nothing.

88
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,880
I saw you drawing a man's back.

89
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,600
Did you like someone else?

90
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,880
No.

91
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,680
I...

92
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,760
I...

93
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,840
I...

94
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,920
I...

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I...

96
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,080
I...

97
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,160
I...

98
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,240
I...

99
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
I...

100
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
I...

101
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,480
I...

102
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
I...

103
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
I'm drawing...

104
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,840
your back.

105
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,240
My back?

106
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,880
Then why don't you draw me?

107
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,960
Because...

108
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,840
I'm used to seeing your back every time you leave.

109
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,040
You're so pitiful.

110
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,040
It's like you don't answer when you're separated.

111
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,040
I really feel...

112
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,200
that you'll never come back...

113
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,840
if you leave.

114
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,280
Silly girl.

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I won't.

116
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,320
They say first love is boundless.

117
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,440
Do we?

118
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,280
I really feel...

119
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,720
that we're from different worlds.

120
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,480
Mr. Chen.

121
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,000
Let's go see Qi Shi.

122
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,480
I like you.

123
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,680
I have some things to do.

124
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,760
Why don't you go with Jia Jia?

125
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,160
No, thanks.

126
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,240
I'm not going.

127
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,760
I have something to do after I finish drawing.

128
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,280
You guys go.

129
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,360
Jia Jia.

130
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,120
Jia Jia.

131
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,440
What's wrong with her?

132
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,640
She broke up with Ying Dong.

133
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
She's not here anymore.

134
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
She's not here anymore.

135
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,880
She's not here anymore.

136
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,760
She broke up with Ying Dong.

137
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
Jackie.

138
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,960
I think the first scene of the leading role...

139
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,600
is too shallow.

140
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,080
How about this?

141
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,200
Go watch the European movie I showed you.

142
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,960
We'll talk tomorrow night when we eat, okay?

143
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,720
Okay, then. See you tomorrow.

144
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,880
What's wrong?

145
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,680
It's a hassle to change it over and over again.

146
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,880
My mom said she could open a chain store in Africa for me.

147
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,840
After a thorough evaluation,

148
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,720
the profit is very good every year.

149
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,520
Congratulations, Mr. Wu.

150
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,480
And she also said she could help you get into Hollywood.

151
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,440
I'll use the money I earned from the chain store to support you.

152
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,040
We can do whatever we want.

153
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Thanks.

154
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,080
I appreciate your kindness.

155
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,160
I'll do my best.

156
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
But I'm not a good talker.

157
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,360
I can't eat women's food.

158
00:08:52,440 --> 00:09:08,140
Besides, I'm a

159
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,360
You're not going to America with me

160
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,640
just to keep your career as a director.

161
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,120
Wu An Po, Miss Wu.

162
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,760
You said you would give up America for me.

163
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,920
Why did you demand from me?

164
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,600
What are you looking at?

165
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,120
No matter how hard you try, you can't be Li An Wang Jia Wei.

166
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,320
There's a good path for you to follow.

167
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,840
You'll have to work hard all your life.

168
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,960
Don't say that.

169
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,280
You're right.

170
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,880
I'm just a show-off.

171
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,400
I'm sorry.

172
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,280
I'm not good enough for you.

173
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,960
I'm sorry I'm late.

174
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,680
You can leave now.

175
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,960
You're unreasonable.

176
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,080
I'm ignoring my dad and my mom

177
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,520
just to love you.

178
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Really?

179
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,640
I think you like them to fight for you.

180
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,200
Don't say that.

181
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,480
If you really love someone,

182
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,920
you won't be so stingy.

183
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,760
You don't love me enough.

184
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,880
Do you love me?

185
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,400
You just enjoy the feeling of being loved

186
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,240
and loved.

187
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,560
To put it bluntly, you only love yourself.

188
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,920
This kind of selfishness can be inherited.

189
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,040
Your dad is a pedophile,

190
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,160
but he's not that cold.

191
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,080
Do you know who you're like?

192
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,200
Like your mom.

193
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,120
You're just like your mom.

194
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,560
You're selfish and hypocritical.

195
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,920
Get lost!

196
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,080
Fine.

197
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,560
I'll get lost.

198
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,920
But I hope you're not here

199
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,520
when I come back.

200
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,000
Miss, don't cry.

201
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,000
I don't know how to comfort you.

202
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,040
I don't need your comfort.

203
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,480
Let me be quiet.

204
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,480
I'll play some music.

205
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,800
Wu Yuting,

206
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,720
you're stubborn and stubborn.

207
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,680
You're amazing.

208
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,240
I don't want to be killed by the same woman again.

209
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,440
Fine.

210
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,280
I want this price.

211
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,040
One hundred million.

212
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,600
But what can you guarantee?

213
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,440
You won't see my daughter again.

214
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,920
One hundred million can buy Amber's safety and happiness.

215
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,600
It's worth it.

216
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,640
Even the boss doesn't know that I'm a pedophile.

217
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,480
Why are you telling me this?

218
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,320
I want you to understand

219
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,480
that your mom doesn't love you at all.

220
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,720
Your daddy is the only one who loves you.

221
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,280
You're not pitiful enough, are you?

222
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,680
You're using these things to stimulate me.

223
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,560
I don't want you to be hurt more.

224
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,280
Your mom doesn't deserve your trust.

225
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,000
What does this have to do with you?

226
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,560
I don't want you to be cheated.

227
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,760
Stop pretending to be a pedophile.

228
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,120
I've been with you for so long.

229
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,400
You're very important to me.

230
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,200
Although this has exceeded my work,

231
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,920
I still hope that you can understand the truth earlier.

232
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,160
So that you won't get hurt more.

233
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,200
I'm thirsty.

234
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,960
Go to the convenience store and get me some water.

235
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,160
Okay.

236
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,520
I've already checked.

237
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,160
This is the real ticket to Wuyuting.

238
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,600
You can pay it anytime.

239
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,080
In two days, I'll return the money to you.

240
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,480
I'll be back in the end of the month.

241
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,000
I'll be back.

242
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,680
I'll see you in a few days.

243
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,200
Please book a ticket to the US.

244
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,440
Everything is going smoothly in the US.

245
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,680
Everything is under my control.

246
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,440
Don't worry.

247
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,200
Miss Wu, you can't go in.

248
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,080
I won't go in.

249
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,360
You can't go in.

250
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,320
Amber.

251
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,480
Amber, why are you here?

252
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,320
You didn't plan to take me to the US, did you?

253
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,560
What are you talking about?

254
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,400
Come on, sit down.

255
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,360
Stop it.

256
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,560
You did all this for money.

257
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,440
You left me for 10 million.

258
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,520
If it wasn't for that 10 million,

259
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,360
I wouldn't be here now, right?

260
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,120
Say something.

261
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,200
You didn't plan to take me to the US, did you?

262
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,400
You did all this for money.

263
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,800
I only had 10 million.

264
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,200
Now that I'm promoted,

265
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,680
you're here to get the money, right?

266
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,440
That's not true.

267
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,760
You're my only daughter.

268
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,040
I really want to be with you.

269
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,240
Okay.

270
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,480
Then, promise me.

271
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,160
Promise me.

272
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,120
I'm sorry.

273
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,040
I never did anything so serious.

274
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,880
I never swore to anyone.

275
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,880
I finally understand why I'm so selfish.

276
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,760
Now, I know why.

277
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,160
You haven't changed at all.

278
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,280
segment

279
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,720
第10

280
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,680
Chapter 9

281
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,120
There are many requirements for a Booksist.

282
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,320
If a great flies in,

283
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,520
she'll be great.

284
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,480
Also, she'll be a back-DEAK per permission.

285
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,780
You don't love me enough!

286
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,780
Do you love me?

287
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:09,280
You only enjoy the feeling of being loved and loved by others.

288
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,780
To be honest, you only love yourself.

289
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,980
This kind of selfishness can really be a fool.

290
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,780
Even though your father is a salesman, he's not that cold.

291
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,280
Do you know who you're like?

292
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,780
Like your mother!

293
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,780
This is for you.

294
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,080
Such an expensive gift. We just met.

295
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,880
I'm not that good at accepting gifts.

296
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,180
Amber helped me find the red skull.

297
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,080
I've worn this ring for 20 years.

298
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,980
I've never lost it.

299
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,780
It's also the fate of us.

300
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,980
You've never had a mother since you were little.

301
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,380
You don't need a mother!

302
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,680
Why does Daddy hate you so much?

303
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,880
He doesn't hate me.

304
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,880
He's afraid.

305
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,180
He's afraid that one day, I'll tell you the truth.

306
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,280
So, he has to drive me away.

307
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,480
He's trying to stop me from getting close to you.

308
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,780
Who abandoned this family?

309
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,280
Who abandoned Amber?

310
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,780
For a ticket,

311
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,980
he went to the house with that guy named Ma Zhen.

312
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,980
Wu Yuting, I want this family.

313
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,080
One hundred million?

314
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,080
What guarantee can you make?

315
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,980
I won't see my daughter again.

316
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,380
One hundred million can buy Amber a safe and happy life.

317
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,080
It's worth it.

318
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,280
I was ten million back then.

319
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,880
Now I have a job.

320
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,280
Do you want to come back to get money?

321
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,780
Mr. Wu.

322
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,980
You haven't eaten anything since yesterday.

323
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,880
You know we don't have any news from Miss.

324
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,780
But your health is very important,

325
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,480
so you should have something to eat.

326
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,380
Leave me alone, I'll get back to work.

327
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,880
Mr. Wu,

328
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,120
You're back.

329
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,200
Ms Wu, you're back.

330
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,920
Come on, sit down.

331
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,120
Chenyin, prepare more breakfast for Ms Wu.

332
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,640
Why didn't you ask me what I was doing?

333
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,160
You must have been upset and came back.

334
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,120
That's not important.

335
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,560
It's good that you're back.

336
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,360
Drink it while it's hot.

337
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,400
Daddy.

338
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,280
It's good that young people are happy when they're in love.

339
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,920
What is love?

340
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,640
How can you grow up without crying?

341
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,480
Kang Zirui lost his daughter.

342
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,160
He's unlucky.

343
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,840
You can't afford to waste your romance.

344
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,920
But I'm not only a maid.

345
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,720
Nothing else matters.

346
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,320
It's important that you're back safe and sound.

347
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,160
You'll inevitably meet some setbacks.

348
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,880
Be good.

349
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,240
I used to think that I was strong.

350
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,200
I thought that everyone in the world loved me.

351
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,520
But today I realized that I was too stupid.

352
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,240
There's no one else in the world who loves me.

353
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,680
Only you.

354
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,040
Daddy.

355
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,800
I don't want anyone else.

356
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,680
I don't want Gao Qi.

357
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,520
I don't want Kang Zirui.

358
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,240
I don't want anyone else.

359
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,160
But I can't live without you.

360
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:36,480
Because you're the only one in the world who's good to me unconditionally.

361
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,320
Daddy.

362
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,160
I have so many shortcomings.

363
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,480
I'm willful, selfish, and arrogant.

364
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,880
I'm not good at hiding things.

365
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,960
I always like to fight against you.

366
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm so stubborn and I want to hurt you.

367
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,920
But you still love me.

368
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,520
Because you're my daughter.

369
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,760
Baby, you know what?

370
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,600
No matter how strong a person is,

371
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,000
there's always a weakness.

372
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,240
You're my weakness.

373
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,920
In my life, I've never loved Gao Qi.

374
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,960
And I've never loved anyone else.

375
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,920
You're my precious daughter.

376
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,000
As long as you're happy,

377
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,280
I'll be happy.

378
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,280
Daddy, am I worth that much money?

379
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,760
That's a hundred million.

380
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

381
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,560
Come on, eat.

382
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,040
Daddy.

383
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,920
Even if I have the love of the world,

384
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,240
I won't be happy without you.

385
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,680
You silly girl.

386
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,640
Daddy is the most handsome and the best person in the world.

387
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,320
Baby, I'm glad you're back safely.

388
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,640
I'm glad you're back safely.

389
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,960
Hello, sister.

390
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,640
Have you eaten your medicine?

391
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,920
Did you see the porridge I made on the fire?

392
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,440
Drink it before you go to bed.

393
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,480
When you wake up, if you still have a headache,

394
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,520
I'll take you to the nail salon, okay?

395
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,480
Drink more water.

396
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,280
How is it? Is she okay?

397
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,200
She said she had a headache, but she didn't get hurt.

398
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,400
I'm thinking, is she still thinking about Yingdong?

399
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,080
She's not the only one who's been in love.

400
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,000
Don't worry about her.

401
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,520
Do you have a conversation with your nephew?

402
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,080
I'm strangely sure about that.

403
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,720
I heard them talk today this afternoon.

404
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,840
Vi be going out on polls on the second day of their marriage.

405
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,880
I think that she really loves her daddy.

406
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,760
This isn't the first time she's married.

407
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,200
It's incredible how you can keep everything as romantic.

408
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,640
I think the power of love is strong.

409
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,440
The first time I saw you

410
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,440
The first time I saw you

411
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,440
The first time I saw you

412
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,440
The first time I saw you

413
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,440
I still want to be with you

414
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,440
I still want to be with you

415
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,440
On the other side of the sea

416
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,440
I've seen you for a year

417
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,440
I miss you so much

418
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,440
I close my eyes and open them

419
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,440
I miss you so much

420
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,440
Time is passing by

421
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,440
The first time I saw you

422
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,440
The first time I saw you

423
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,440
I miss you

424
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,440
I miss you

425
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,440
It's so late, Ying Ying

426
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,440
How come?

427
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,440
Don't stand there, come in

428
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,440
I have news

429
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,440
Tonight's night is for you

430
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,440
For me?

431
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,440
Why, Xiao Jiu?

432
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,440
Because I want you to be happy

433
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,440
I'm the princess of the night

434
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,440
This is the only thing my mom left behind

435
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,440
I want to give it to you

436
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,440
So you can spend the rest of your life with me

437
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,440
Hello

438
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,440
Hello

439
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,440
Why are you here?

440
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,440
My dad got a long vacation

441
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,440
I suddenly thought of something

442
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,440
I just walked here

443
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,440
I'm sorry

444
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,440
Is this the design of Paris?

445
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,440
Who's Paris is so beautiful?

446
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,440
It's more grand than the Spring Festival Gala

447
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,440
It's my dad and Gao Qi's wedding

448
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,440
You don't know that your dad is getting married, do you?

449
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,440
I know

450
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,440
My dad asked Minghui to send me the invitation

451
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,440
But I didn't see it

452
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,440
Gao Qi's project is on the high-paying bank

453
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,440
The reaction is very good

454
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,440
He is now helping my dad to plan an overseas listing

455
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,440
Our family's future is really bright

456
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,440
They are really close

457
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,440
They are so close

458
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,440
You are so naughty

459
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,440
No wonder your wedding is so popular

460
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,440
Yingdong, Jiajia is sick

461
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,440
Do you want to see her?

462
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,440
Don't bother her

463
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,440
Let her have a good rest

464
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,440
You guys can go now

465
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,440
I'm leaving

466
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,440
Bye

467
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,440
Bye

468
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,440
Why is the atmosphere so scary?

469
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,440
Why do I feel like I'm on a business trip?

470
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,440
I'm not a duck

471
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,440
I'm not a duck

472
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,440
I'm not a duck

473
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,440
I'm not a duck

474
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,440
I'm not a duck

475
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,440
I'm not a duck

476
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,440
I'm not a duck

477
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,440
I'm not a duck

478
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,440
I'm not a duck

479
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,440
I'm not a duck

480
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,440
I'm not a duck

481
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,440
I'm not a duck

482
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,440
I'm not a duck

483
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,440
I'm not a duck

484
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,440
I'm not a duck

485
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,440
I'm not a duck

486
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,440
Enough

487
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,440
Hopefully you are not a guy

488
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,440
Shall we go have some tea?

489
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,440
You still don't know yet?

490
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,440
Jajia, here you are

491
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,440
Thank you

492
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,440
You are welcome

493
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,440
Good evening, Se dla��릴

494
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,460
She asked me out to the office the other day but she kept saying that we'll hang out until the afternoon.

495
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:04,060
A dab of nonsense around here and there.

496
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,820
Any objections?

497
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,580
Not one.

498
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,140
Tada.

499
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,540
Fourth came from the second grade in humanities

500
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,280
so it's like whether it's the fourth grade or the third.

501
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,160
He's been here for the last 20 days.

502
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,880
You don't get it.

503
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,280
Yiba, don't bother him.

504
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,200
He'll tell me everything

505
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,240
when he calls Witte.

506
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,660
Didn't you break up with Witte?

507
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,260
You were with Zhu Guoshan.

508
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,720
Who broke up with him?

509
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,100
Are you thinking of a plan again?

510
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,760
I'm just asking who the princess is mad at.

511
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,220
You don't have to ask him.

512
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,720
He won't tell you even if you talk to him.

513
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,080
This is my family business.

514
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,120
Don't bother me in front of me.

515
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,320
Amber,

516
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,800
your mother is getting married.

517
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,960
Are you going to be her stepmother?

518
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,200
Don't call me that.

519
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,280
I don't have a mother who doesn't like me.

520
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,320
Did I say something wrong today?

521
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,760
You did.

522
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,760
She's my mother's friend.

523
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,360
Let's not get married.

524
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,360
Go away.

525
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,240
Amber, what's wrong?

526
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,400
What's wrong?

527
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,560
It hurts.

528
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,920
Is it serious?

529
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,440
I'm dying.

530
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,600
Go, go, go.

531
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,040
Call an ambulance.

532
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,000
Tell me when you're ready.

533
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,160
What's wrong?

534
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,320
Hold on.

535
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,000
Hello, is this 120?

536
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,880
Amber, what's wrong?

537
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,480
What's wrong with you?

538
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,080
Don't worry, it's not serious.

539
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,880
You need to have an operation.

540
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,400
Why are you yelling at me?

541
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,760
It's not serious.

542
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,920
It's just a small operation.

543
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,520
You're so nervous about Amber.

544
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,440
In your eyes,

545
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,400
Amber is more important than anyone else.

546
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,000
In my eyes, Amber is more important than anyone else.

547
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,040
Are you done?

548
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,440
Stop it.

549
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,040
We're having an operation.

550
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,680
Why are you fighting?

551
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,560
Did you tell Amber's father?

552
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,560
I did.

553
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,840
Mr Wu is on a business trip.

554
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,120
He can't come here right away.

555
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,840
But he booked the fastest flight.

556
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,560
He's probably on the plane now.

557
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,600
Amber's first operation.

558
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,200
Her parents can't come.

559
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,360
Poor Amber.

560
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,520
You told Gao Qi?

561
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,680
Yes.

562
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,160
But he's in Shihuan Mountain.

563
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,320
He can't come.

564
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,080
Who told you to tell him?

565
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,560
She's Amber's mother.

566
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,640
If anything happens to Amber,

567
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,120
I'll take the responsibility.

568
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,200
Besides,

569
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,920
I want Amber to have a family to accompany her

570
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,120
after the operation.

571
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,360
You're on a business trip.

572
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,560
Why are you so angry?

573
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,760
Mr Wu, please don't tell Gao Qi

574
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,200
that she's in the hospital.

575
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,400
You're not going to tell Gao Qi

576
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,480
if I don't agree.

577
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,040
How am I going to explain to the boss?

578
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,080
She's Amber's mother.

579
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,720
Amber is in the hospital.

580
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,960
Doctor.

581
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,960
Did you succeed in the operation?

582
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,200
Yes, we did.

583
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,080
Besides the operation,

584
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,200
the patient is in a coma.

585
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,560
The patient is still unconscious.

586
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,720
We've sent her to the ward.

587
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,120
Don't worry.

588
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,720
She'll wake up soon.

589
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,640
Mr Chen.

590
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,960
Thank you, doctor.

591
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,080
You're awake.

592
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,440
Amber, you're awake.

593
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,840
How do you feel?

594
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,200
Does your wound hurt?

595
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,200
Are you thirsty?

596
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,040
Xiao Qiao went to buy you food.

597
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,120
I'll watch over you.

598
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,240
No one will dare to touch you.

599
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,920
By the way,

600
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,640
I've sent a message to Kang Zirui.

601
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,040
He hasn't replied yet.

602
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,800
Why are you so angry?

603
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,040
Don't be angry.

604
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,360
I just want to know if I'm sick,

605
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,600
I don't want to see you get pregnant.

606
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,040
I'm not pregnant.

607
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,440
I'm not like you.

608
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,040
I'm not as useless as you.

609
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,360
Where's my father?

610
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,000
Is he here?

611
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,760
Mr Wu is on the plane.

612
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,800
He'll be here soon.

613
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,080
Does it hurt?

614
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,360
It hurts more than I care.

615
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,080
It's my first operation.

616
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,720
I can't believe my family is gone.

617
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,840
Do you want Kang Zirui to come with you?

618
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,080
If you want, I'll call him.

619
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,440
It's the most painful thing.

620
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,560
Amber.

621
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,320
Did you succeed in the operation?

622
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,920
How did you get the beauty?

623
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,640
What's wrong?

624
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,440
I saw something I didn't want to see.

625
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,760
It's disgusting.

626
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,800
Amber.

627
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,040
Can you stop being so childish and stubborn?

628
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,280
Can you talk to me nicely?

629
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,040
I don't want to hear your voice.

630
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,960
I don't want to see you.

631
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,800
You're still wearing the wedding dress.

632
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,440
You were shooting the wedding dress, right?

633
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,800
Waiter.

634
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,960
I'm off.

635
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,600
Miss Gao, I'm sorry.

636
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,920
Please leave.

637
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,200
I'm talking to my daughter.

638
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,560
It's none of your business.

639
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,880
Out.

640
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,560
If I remember correctly,

641
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,920
Miss Gao has taken the cheque from our boss.

642
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,800
Please keep your promise.

643
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,120
Don't break the contract again.

644
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,400
Are you threatening me?

645
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,040
I'm reminding you.

646
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,360
Please.

647
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,240
Are you talking about this cheque?

648
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,640
Your cheque is broken.

649
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,360
My contract with your boss is also wasted.

650
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,560
I'm talking to my daughter.

651
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,960
Get out.

652
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,680
Waiter.

653
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,680
You go out first. I'll talk to him alone.

654
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,680
But Boss said...

655
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,680
You tell him yourself.

656
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,680
Anbo, I'm leaving too.

657
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,680
I'm leaving too.

658
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,680
That's a one-million dollar note.

659
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,680
Do you really want to give it up?

660
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,680
If it was in the past, I wouldn't give it up.

661
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,680
But for you, I think it's worth it.

662
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,680
Even if I owe you for the past 20 years...

663
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:18,680
Do you think a note can change my feelings for you?

664
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,680
At least I know that before I got this note, you had feelings for me.

665
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,680
Now that the note is broken, is it a compensation for my feelings for you?

666
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,680
Can I ask you a question?

667
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,680
Go ahead.

668
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,680
You gave birth to me for ten million.

669
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,680
Now you're leaving me for one hundred million.

670
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,680
Is money really that important to you?

671
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,680
Anbo, you're too lucky.

672
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,680
You don't understand my age.

673
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,680
To me, money is all I need to live with dignity.

674
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,680
I don't have anyone to trust except money.

675
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,680
Including Daddy?

676
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:15,680
If I hadn't gotten pregnant with you, I would have divorced him long ago.

677
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:21,680
But you should know that because of you, Daddy and Mommy...

678
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,680
...wanted to get back together.

679
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,680
But...

680
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,680
Why didn't you get back together?

681
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:33,680
I heard that you had an affair with Daddy.

682
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,680
You said he had an affair.

683
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:44,680
I was young and couldn't take it.

684
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,680
My first boyfriend was pursuing me.

685
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,680
I took revenge on you.

686
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,680
I heard that the woman pretended to be pregnant...

687
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,680
...and wanted to cheat your father's money.

688
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,680
No wonder Daddy is afraid of women now.

689
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,680
He doesn't want to get married again.

690
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,680
All these years, it's not easy for me to live alone.

691
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,680
I can't trust any man anymore.

692
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:19,680
Because the man I love always betrays and hurts me.

693
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,680
Including your father.

694
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:30,680
From that moment on, I knew that I needed a lot of money.

695
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,680
Because money and material can make me feel safe.

696
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,680
Material won't change.

697
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,680
And people change.

698
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,680
So you're going to marry a prostitute?

699
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,680
Amor.

700
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:57,680
I'm tired of wandering alone.

701
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,680
I need a man to rely on.

702
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,680
I didn't think about taking the cheque.

703
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,680
I just wanted to play tricks.

704
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,680
Daddy would keep me.

705
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,680
But I didn't think that he'd rather spend money...

706
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,680
...than give me a marriage contract.

707
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,680
I don't have a marriage contract with you.

708
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,680
He hates me.

709
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,680
I married Ying Youjin because of his wealth.

710
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,680
He wanted me to stay in Shanghai.

711
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:37,680
Only by staying here, I can see my precious daughter.

712
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,680
Mommy.

713
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,680
I didn't expect you to love me so seriously.

714
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,680
I underestimated your feelings for me.

715
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,680
It's Kang Zirui.

716
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,680
Listen to me.

717
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,680
Don't spend time and energy on Kang Zirui.

718
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,680
Why?

719
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:13,680
Mommy had a boyfriend when she was young.

720
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,680
An artist doesn't stop for a woman.

721
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,680
And you have the right to choose.

722
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,680
Don't be ashamed of yourself because you don't want to.

723
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,680
Remember, a woman can be single.

724
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,680
She can't be married.

725
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,680
I don't care about fame and fortune.

726
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,680
I only care about the people I love.

727
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,680
Amber, you don't deserve to live like a normal person.

728
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,680
You can't fight against fate.

729
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,680
Your pride won't let you go with him.

730
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,680
Because you have my blood in your body.

731
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,680
And you have to be brave.

732
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,680
You have my blood.

733
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,680
And you are the only reporter of Wu Yuting's property.

734
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:23,680
I have to earn money to buy the ticket she just tore.

735
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,680
Mei Bao.

736
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,680
Director Kang.

737
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,680
I thought you wouldn't come.

738
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,680
You didn't reply to my message.

739
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,680
How is she?

740
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,680
Lan Wei Yan's surgery was successful.

741
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,680
Her mother is with her now.

742
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,680
You should go and see her.

743
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,680
I'm not going.

744
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,680
I just got a call. I have something to do.

745
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,680
I'm leaving.

746
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,680
She's sick.

747
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,680
Why don't you see her?

748
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,680
I don't know what love is.

749
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,680
We broke up.

750
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,680
Why?

751
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,680
We were meant to break up.

752
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,680
We don't have to waste time.

753
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,680
You should tell her.

754
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,680
Men are always so stubborn.

755
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,680
But we women want a clear result.

756
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,680
