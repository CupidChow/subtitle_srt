1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Thank you for watching.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But in this contract,

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
we have to give the two stores in the upper class to the outsiders.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Isn't this dividing our business power?

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's okay.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What?

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's okay?

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
How much did Eva spend on us?

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Why did she divide it to the outsiders?

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And it's actually for Han Dingyi.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Because Weiwei still can't let go of Han Dingyi.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I want her to know who to choose.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's the right thing to do.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So,

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I want to keep Han Dingyi here to compete with me fairly.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh?

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You're going to fight with me?

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I've never been afraid of any challenges.

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Most importantly,

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I want Weiwei's sincerity.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Okay.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'll do my best to support you on this.

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I believe

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
as long as you get up seriously,

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Weiwei will not choose Han Dingyi.

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
By the way,

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
who suggested that Han Dingyi

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
run the restaurant?

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It was Wu Yuting.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
How could Wu Yuting have such an idea?

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Dear,

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
the O'Hay has agreed to sign the contract.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
In a while, the representative will tell you the position in the group.

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Miss,

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I need the internal information.

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The representative has a good reputation.

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I will be in the same group with you.

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Don't worry.

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I will accept any result.

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This is not the purpose of our love, right?

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
See you later.

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Drive safely.

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Love you.

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Love you.

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What's wrong, Mr. Zhu?

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Congratulations, Yingdong.

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The high-end cheats have been transferred.

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The high-end cheats have not been caught yet.

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You have lost your assets.

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Thank you.

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Now, we only need to sign the contract.

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The big deal is about to be completed.

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Success is in sight.

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Ou Juan and Ou Hui have agreed to sign the contract.

83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So I think the amount of money is not big.

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I believe I can get it this week.

85
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I will be waiting for you.

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Thank you.

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Thank you.

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Thank you.

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Thank you.

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Thank you.

91
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Thank you.

92
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Thank you.

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Thank you.

94
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yingdong, you win.

95
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That's what I like to hear.

96
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
For the sake of OVA Group,

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
we can join the Wu's Hotel.

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Here, cheers.

99
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Cheers.

100
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Daddy,

101
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
this time Yingdong has completed your design,

102
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
it's so good.

103
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Shouldn't you encourage him?

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Through OVA,

105
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I have to admit

106
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yingdong's strength.

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay, I will fulfill my promise to you.

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I will not only allow you to continue to interact with my daughter,

109
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
but also I will give you a specific position

110
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
in our hotel group.

111
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I decided to let you be the head of the hotel group

112
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
in the southern part of China,

113
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
the regional manager,

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and the specific person responsible for the cooperation project

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
between the Wu's Hotel and OVA.

116
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Daddy.

117
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Enough, stop talking.

118
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I know what you want to say.

119
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Don't think that you can climb the ladder

120
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
after winning a battle.

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yingdong,

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
you have to make my third deal

123
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
with the Wu's Group.

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You have to make me

125
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
the real-life son-in-law of Wu Yuting.

126
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Son-in-law,

127
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I have a good news for you.

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Thank you, uncle.

129
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Here.

130
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yingdong,

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
what do you think of Han Dingyi

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
who worked with you

133
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
in the flower shop?

134
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
He is very capable.

135
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He is reliable.

136
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He is just a little bit clumsy.

137
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He is just a little bit clumsy.

138
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He is reliable,

139
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
but sometimes he is stubborn,

140
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and he doesn't understand the change.

141
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It seems that you are quite objective

142
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
in your current boyfriend's opinion.

143
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
No matter what, we are good friends.

144
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And I appreciate capable people.

145
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Uncle is interested in him.

146
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What does he want to do?

147
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I hope Han Dingyi can run

148
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
two restaurants in Shanghai.

149
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Ou Hui also agreed to this suggestion.

150
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You have to work together.

151
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I have a good news for you.

152
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Young people in your generation

153
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
are all single-parent.

154
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
They don't understand the importance of cooperation.

155
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But I believe that you are different from Han Dingyi.

156
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You can definitely make a career.

157
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Don't worry, uncle. We will.

158
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I haven't announced this decision

159
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
to Han Dingyi yet.

160
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You can tell him this good news later.

161
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
OK.

162
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Come on.

163
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Did you know about the thing I just wrote?

164
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
What do you want to say?

165
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So Yingdong didn't tell you,

166
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
and neither did your father.

167
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
If you want me to stay in front of you for a few more minutes,

168
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
please be honest with me.

169
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Gao Qi was arrested overseas.

170
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The money that was stolen should be completely unsealed.

171
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Mr. Zhu has already told Yingdong and your father.

172
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Relying on you is no longer the only way to Yingdong.

173
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Such an exciting thing

174
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
is not the first thing he told you.

175
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You have to be careful.

176
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He didn't tell you about the money he stole.

177
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
He left a lot of room for himself.

178
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I wonder if Wanjia knows about this before you do.

179
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
How could Wanjia know about this?

180
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yingdong has already told me.

181
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So he doesn't mind the position my father left him.

182
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
He doesn't care that Han Dingyi is appreciated by my father.

183
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Besides, even if the world is going to change,

184
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yingdong and I will be fine.

185
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Don't worry.

186
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I hope you won't talk about my mother and my boyfriend behind my back.

187
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I don't feel well.

188
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Hello?

189
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's me.

190
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yingdong, what's up?

191
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Where are you?

192
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm preparing something for Wanjia to go to America.

193
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Don't worry.

194
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I have a very promising job.

195
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I want to keep you in Shanghai.

196
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What?

197
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Ying, my mother's father told me that

198
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
you are an incredible talent.

199
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You are not only experienced in managing the flower shop,

200
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
but also very thoughtful in managing the restaurant.

201
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I don't need a talent like you.

202
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You are overpraising me.

203
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I admire you very much.

204
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I hope I can invite you.

205
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Invite me?

206
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What do you mean?

207
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The restaurant at the European Conference will be held in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Shenzhen, Guangzhou,

208
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
five cities, Wuyuting, Qixia, and all the hotels.

209
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I will take care of everything.

210
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I hope you can manage one of the two shops in Shanghai.

211
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's a rare opportunity, Ding Yi.

212
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Think about it.

213
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Will Ding Yi go to America with me?

214
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Stay in China or go to America?

215
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's up to you.

216
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I have to answer the phone.

217
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You look ugly.

218
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You are not as good as you look.

219
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I don't know when you and Ding Yi became so close.

220
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You are now giving him the right to manage two restaurants.

221
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Do you mind that he goes to America with me?

222
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
No, you don't.

223
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I don't mind.

224
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But Ding Yi can give up everything for you to go to America.

225
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You are a student there, but he is nothing.

226
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Why can't you stay for Ding Yi?

227
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You are an ordinary person, but you are silently supporting him.

228
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Isn't that good?

229
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Unless you only want a man who loves you more than you love him.

230
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
What do you want from me?

231
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What are you doing?

232
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I told you not to take so many books.

233
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I will take care of my own affairs.

234
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You don't have to help me.

235
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Don't do this.

236
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I don't want to break my promise.

237
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Who is not in between the two?

238
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
If I give up,

239
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
the person you miss will be me.

240
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I don't know when I found the door locked.

241
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I can't open it anymore.

242
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
He doesn't allow me to go in anymore.

243
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I can't find him anymore.

244
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm scared.

245
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But I can't go in.

246
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I can't go in.

247
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I can't go in.

248
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I can't go in.

249
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I can't go in.

250
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I can't go in.

251
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But I told myself,

252
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
that I can find someone to replace you.

253
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You can also find someone to replace him.

254
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I know that I've made you worry so much.

255
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You're not happy either.

256
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But I...

257
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I...

258
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I really don't know

259
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
what to do to make myself feel safe.

260
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I understand.

261
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
If we get married in a few days,

262
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
will you feel safe?

263
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I don't want you to be sad.

264
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
As long as you're happy,

265
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'll do anything.

266
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'll do anything.

267
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I didn't expect

268
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
to get your promise.

269
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Weiwei,

270
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Ding Lingyi and I are going to Li's tomorrow.

271
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I know you're still taking care of Sister Juan.

272
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
But if you're not busy tomorrow,

273
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
will you come back to celebrate with us?

274
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Why are you here?

275
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I was walking and saw you lying on the bridge.

276
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I came to see you.

277
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm sorry.

278
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm sorry.

279
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm sorry.

280
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm sorry.

281
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm sorry.

282
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm sorry.

283
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm sorry.

284
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Is it that obvious?

285
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Why do you always see me through?

286
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I don't like this.

287
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Actually,

288
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
there's something very important

289
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I want to tell you.

290
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I've decided to give the two restaurants in Shanghai

291
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
to Han Dingyi.

292
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And I've already made an appointment with him

293
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
to discuss the contract tonight.

294
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Why did you do this?

295
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Because I agree with his ability.

296
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
No way.

297
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Wanjia is going to marry him and go to America.

298
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
How do you know about Han Dingyi's opinion?

299
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
No way.

300
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
They're getting their marriage certificate tomorrow.

301
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Really?

302
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
If he's already decided to go to America,

303
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
why would he see me?

304
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I don't know.

305
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The most untrustworthy person is his heart.

306
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
When your heart can still beat,

307
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
you should love the person you love.

308
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Only then can you be happy.

309
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
The environment in this bar is really nice.

310
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Your mother runs it.

311
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
My mother manages it for others.

312
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Who's the big shareholder?

313
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's quite good.

314
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You're not going to buy it back, are you?

315
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It seems that you have a prejudice against me.

316
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I asked Yingdong to come out today

317
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
to ask you

318
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
if you want to run the two restaurants in Shanghai.

319
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Dingyi,

320
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
this is everyone's hope.

321
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
We're all waiting for your answer.

322
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I want to know the reason.

323
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Because we all agree with your ability.

324
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I think Wu Yuting's suggestion is good.

325
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And Yingdong supports you.

326
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
If I accept this job,

327
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I can't go to America with Wanjia.

328
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I don't understand why you want to go to America.

329
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
If it weren't for Wanjia,

330
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
you wouldn't have thought of going abroad.

331
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
If a man doesn't have his own career,

332
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
what will he use to protect his lover?

333
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Dingyi,

334
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
please think about it.

335
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Mr. Ou is right.

336
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Men should have a career first and then have a relationship.

337
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
We hope that after signing the big contract tomorrow,

338
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
your work contract will be signed.

339
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Okay?

340
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Brother, please think about it.

341
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
This is a good opportunity.

342
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You will definitely succeed.

343
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Don't waste your talent in America.

344
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I believe you can help me with my work.

345
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Thank you.

346
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I want to think about it.

347
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
What else do you want to think about?

348
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I know.

349
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But I promised Wanjia

350
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
to go to America with her.

351
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And we are going to get married.

352
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Before Weiwei really gives up on you,

353
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I think

354
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
you can't marry anyone else.

355
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You can't leave here and go to America.

356
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Mr. Ou,

357
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I think you misunderstood.

358
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Weiwei and I have nothing in common.

359
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
We are just friends.

360
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I don't have any misunderstandings.

361
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
No matter what relationship you have with Weiwei,

362
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
as long as Weiwei hasn't made a real choice,

363
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I won't let you go.

364
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I must give you a chance to develop yourself.

365
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I want you to prove your ability

366
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
and create your own career and value.

367
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
So that whether Weiwei chooses you

368
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
or me in the future,

369
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
our competition is fair.

370
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Give me a chance, okay?

371
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I want to protect you.

372
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
The feeling of loving someone

373
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
can't be replaced.

374
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Weiwei,

375
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
give me some time.

376
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I will tell everyone

377
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
that I won't let you go.

378
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I will tell everyone

379
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
that I won't let you go.

380
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I don't have any misunderstandings.

381
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
No matter what relationship you have with Weiwei,

382
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
as long as Weiwei hasn't made a real choice,

383
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I won't let you go.

384
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I must give you a chance to develop yourself.

385
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I want you to prove your ability

386
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
and create your own career and value.

387
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
So that whether Weiwei chooses you

388
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
or me in the future,

389
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
our competition is fair.

390
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Love,

391
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
love,

392
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I have a thought of escape.

393
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I will struggle.

394
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Are you asleep?

395
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's almost time.

396
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm afraid that our relationship will be broken.

397
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Why did you turn off the phone all night?

398
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I will be with you.

399
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Ying Tong and Ou Hui asked me to meet tonight.

400
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
They talked about the cooperation.

401
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The phone is out of power.

402
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It just came out.

403
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
The moon is not as bright as the sun.

404
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It's time to say goodbye.

405
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
If there's nothing else,

406
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
you should rest early.

407
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
There's something important tomorrow.

408
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
What's the matter with you?

409
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Let's go.

410
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Ou Hui wants me to sign that contract with him tomorrow.

411
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Have you forgotten what day tomorrow is?

412
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Let's hold hands and overcome everything.

413
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Forget it.

414
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Since you have accepted Ou Hui's offer,

415
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I think

416
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
you don't plan to go abroad with me.

417
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Why do we still need to get the certificate?

418
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Jia Jia, listen to me.

419
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm interested in that contract.

420
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I want to give you a beautiful future.

421
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I don't know why

422
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
everything has become so strange.

423
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm tired.

424
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I want to sleep.

425
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
If you want to go to America with me,

426
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'll see you at 10 o'clock tomorrow.

427
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Good night.

428
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Maybe happiness is there.

429
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Brother, today is a very important day for you.

430
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Mom and I don't want to make decisions based on our thoughts.

431
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So we came out of the door

432
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
to tell you that

433
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
whether you sign the contract with Ou Hui

434
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
or get the certificate with Wanjia,

435
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
we all support you.

436
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
We hope you don't make a regrettable choice.

437
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Youxi.

438
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm sorry.

439
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Miss, you have a good appetite.

440
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You ate everything.

441
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Miss Tang,

442
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I didn't see you eating breakfast.

443
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
What's on your mind?

444
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I'm not hungry. I have no appetite.

445
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You're like Hui Shao.

446
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Hui Shao has no appetite for anything recently.

447
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
He didn't eat breakfast either?

448
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
He went to the company early in the morning.

449
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
He said he had an important contract to sign.

450
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Hello, is Mr. Han Dingyi here?

451
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yes.

452
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Follow me.

453
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Come in.

454
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Mr. Ou, Mr. Han is here.

455
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Go get Mr. Han's contract.

456
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Okay.

457
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I'll go with you.

458
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Okay.

459
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I'll go with you.

460
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I'll go with you.

461
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I'll go with you.

462
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Go get Mr. Han's contract.

463
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Okay.

464
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Mr. Han, please come in.

465
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Good morning.

466
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Good morning.

467
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I knew you'd come.

468
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I won't let you look down on the people Weiwei likes.

469
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Not bad.

470
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm glad you accepted the challenge

471
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
and competed with me.

472
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
No.

473
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
No.

474
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
No.

475
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I won't let you look down on me

476
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
and compete with me.

477
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I'll go.

478
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Don't play around.

479
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Look, you're in such a big rain,

480
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I wonder if your brother went to get a license

481
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
or signed a contract.

482
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I don't know if it's going well.

483
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I don't know.

484
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Call him and ask him.

485
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I'm back.

486
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Mom, I'm back.

487
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Son.

488
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Did you get the certificate or sign the contract?

489
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I signed the contract.

490
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Look at your brother.

491
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
He made the right choice at the last minute.

492
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Let's go.

493
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Tell me, how did you make such a choice at such a critical time?

494
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
That's right.

495
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Tell me.

496
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Hello, Meng.

497
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Hello, Wu Weiwei.

498
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Where's Jiajia?

499
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
She's not going to get the certificate with you.

500
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Wang Jia didn't get along with me.

501
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I went to Ou Hui's place and signed the contract.

502
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Why did you sign the contract?

503
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Why didn't you get the certificate?

504
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Because I wanted to have a career.

505
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Have you ever thought about Jiajia's feelings?

506
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
If she really loves me,

507
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I believe she will understand my choice.

508
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
You dare not go to such a big thing like getting the certificate.

509
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Why should she understand you?

510
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Ok.

511
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
He will never listen to your call.

512
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I want you to send him a message like

513
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Decides to withdraw the work contract and bring him to America.

514
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Wei Wei, I don't want to make a promise that I can't keep.

515
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Wei Wei, Ding Yi chose to work because he accepted Ou Hui's challenge.

516
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
He made a choice. He chose you.

517
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
No, he didn't choose anyone.

518
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
He chose his own future.

519
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And I am no longer the Kang Wei Wei I used to be.

520
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I can't find the Kang Wei Wei I used to be.

521
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Wei Wei, Ding Yi.

522
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Ding Yi.

523
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
You are here!

524
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
This is the upgraded version of the flower room.

525
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
It's called the Wei Love Restaurant.

526
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Imagine, when many customers come to buy flowers,

527
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
they can be in the flowers.

528
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Smell the flowers, eat the desserts.

529
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
This is such a wonderful thing.

530
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Thank you, Master.

531
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I learned a lot of dishes from you these two days.

532
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
You are talented.

533
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
If I give you another month, I think you will learn all the dishes I learned in my life.

534
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I like her.

535
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
On the other side of the sea.

536
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I have seen her for a year.

537
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Even the bad memories are cut off.

538
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Close your eyes and open your eyes.

539
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
The fireworks are burning.

540
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Time is like water.

541
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
You are really lucky to understand the flowers.

542
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Be brave and chase your dream.

543
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Love is like a cold.

544
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
In fact, when the relationship is over,

545
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
the person who left first will not be so painful.

546
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
The rest will always remember you.

547
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
You will always remember the loneliness left behind.

548
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
At this time, you must be born quickly.

549
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
This is a kind of liberation.

550
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
This is a salad with a golden shrimp and Thai-style fried rice.

551
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Kang Weiwei, we may meet again.

552
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
This big fat cat in the middle is the first one.

553
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
It's on the edge.

554
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And it's a big flower.

555
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It's a smelly chicken.

556
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
But I want to make this black, thin and cool.

557
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I can't see it.

558
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
How can I find it?

559
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I'm sitting on the face that I'm familiar with.

560
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
The woman is too simple.

561
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I thought she would see it.

562
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
But I forgot her smile.

563
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
She, she.

564
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
That smile.

565
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It's a fairy tale.

566
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I fell in love with you.

567
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
The prince is not her.

568
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
The fairy tale is a little bit wild.

569
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
The fairy tale in the story.

570
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
You didn't come to my house in the morning.

571
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I guessed you would come here.

572
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Yes, I came to see.

573
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I want to see what has become of this place.

574
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I know you have left a lot of unforgettable memories here.

575
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Weiwei, if you want to keep the original image here,

576
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I will ask them to come back immediately.

577
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
No need.

578
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Everyone in V-Lob is different from before.

579
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Especially me.

580
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
There is no life that is always the same.

581
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Although you don't like it, you have to accept it.

582
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Is it really that interesting to train Han Dingyi to defeat him?

583
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I left him because I wanted to.

584
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Your sister's illness has healed.

585
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
V-Lob is sold to you.

586
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I don't want to participate in your boring game with Han Dingyi.

587
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
So in a few days, I will give you the resignation letter.

588
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Have you forgotten that you have signed a contract with me?

589
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Not only you, Han Dingyi also signed.

590
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
You have to do something that is against the contract for personal feelings.

591
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Aren't you afraid that I will make it difficult for Han Dingyi because of you?

592
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
What do you want?

593
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Let Han Dingyi use the experience of V-Lob on Jin Yi Eva.

594
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Use her abilities well.

595
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Nothing else is that simple.

596
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
What else?

597
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And leave your personal feelings aside.

598
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
You have to do your job well.

599
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Taking care of my sister is your main task.

600
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
But from now on, you are not allowed to appear in front of me without permission.

601
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
And ask me questions that I don't want to answer.

602
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
You are crazy.

603
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Who will listen to your unreasonable demands?

604
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I know that you are very confused right now.

605
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
You don't know what you should do.

606
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
But running away is not a solution.

607
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Give yourself some time to think about it.

608
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
As for other things, it is not important at all.

609
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Go ask Han Andong.

610
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
If I had not seen you before,

611
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Did you plan on hiding this from us the whole time?

612
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I don't know.

613
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Wei Wei knows about this?

614
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I don't know.

615
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
This is something that you must not let Wei Wei know.

616
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I'm your sister.

617
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I don't need you to command me.

618
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
As long as I'm alive, you must listen to me.

619
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
The flow in your brain is getting bigger and bigger.

620
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
What are you going to do?

621
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
The doctor said that this flow is genetic.

622
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
It's fair.

623
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
You've experienced it, but you haven't experienced it now.

624
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Do the surgery.

625
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
How did you persuade me before?

626
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Now you're persuading yourself.

627
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Sister, I won't do such a high-risk surgery.

628
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I can't do anything about it.

629
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
As long as you're healthy, that's enough.

630
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Just for Wei Wei, okay?

631
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I'll find her and let her accompany you to the surgery.

632
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Can you do it?

633
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Sister, I don't want to leave her with me because of this.

634
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I know very well that you're not a good person.

635
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
There are many people who know me very well.

636
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Everyone has their own weaknesses.

637
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
As long as she's willing to be with you,

638
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
she can do anything she wants.

639
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
She wants shares, I'll give her shares.

640
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
She wants money, I'll give her money that she can't spend for ten lifetimes.

641
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Sister, there are many things in this world that you can't buy with money.

642
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Health, time, and love.

643
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I hope the person I love stays with me because I love her.

644
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
If she doesn't love me, I'll only wish her happiness.

645
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
So you're the one who's going to promote the Han Ding Yi I love.

646
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Han Ding Yi is a talent, but he doesn't have a suitable chance.

647
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I want to help Wei Wei to have a perfect first love.

648
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
You want to help someone who doesn't love you?

649
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Why?

650
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Sister, maybe some people's life is a love that's destined to be unhappy.

651
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Just like you and me.

652
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
No matter how much we earn, we can't make up for the lack of feelings.

653
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Is this not the biggest regret?

654
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Wei Wei.

655
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Even though it's like this, I'm still very happy.

656
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
At least I can have what I want and make the person I love happy.

657
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Actually, it's enough for me.

658
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Satisfied.

659
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Wei Wei.

660
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Arthur, Are you sure?

661
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:20,280
Ellace

662
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,800
Don't you ever feel like you're falling in love with Xiaohui?

663
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,600
If you ever had a moment of love,

664
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,600
would you be by her side?

665
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,000
If you can't do it,

666
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,200
I hope you can convince her to get the surgery.

667
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,000
She's in the parking lot.

668
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,800
Hurry up and get me out of here.

669
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,200
Where's my phone?

670
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,000
There's something very important in my phone.

671
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,600
What are you doing?

672
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,400
I already told you that you can't show up in front of me

673
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,200
without my permission.

674
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,800
I didn't ask you to come here,

675
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,600
and I didn't ask you to cry.

676
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,000
Why didn't you tell me?

677
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,200
I just wanted to tell you that

678
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,200
I'm not here to make you cry.

679
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,600
I just wanted to tell you that

680
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,000
I'm not here to make you cry.

681
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I just wanted to tell you that

682
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,400
I'm not here to make you cry.

683
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,400
Why didn't you tell me?

684
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,800
I didn't allow you to be like this.

685
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,400
Why are you like this?

686
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,600
Idiot.

687
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,400
If you like me,

688
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,000
I'll change back.

689
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,800
Such a big thing,

690
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,800
such a big thing,

691
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,800
why didn't you tell me?

692
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,400
Why are you crying, idiot?

693
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,000
I didn't lose to anyone.

694
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,200
I just lost to the world.

695
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,600
Han Dingyi is the man you met when you were 20.

696
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,200
I'm the man you met when you were 22.

697
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,200
When you're 24,

698
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,200
you may meet a man who is better than us.

699
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,800
That's the way life is.

700
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,200
But,

701
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,600
because I have brain tumor,

702
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,600
I have less time.

703
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,600
I can only meet you, idiot.

704
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,200
I'm sorry.

705
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,600
I'm sorry.

706
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,400
You should go for surgery.

707
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,000
I'll be with you.

708
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,000
If this is your wish,

709
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,800
I will go.

710
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,200
Weiwei,

711
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,800
I'm really afraid.

712
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,400
I'm afraid

713
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,800
I won't see you again.

714
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,800
The End

715
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,800
When you're ready to die,

716
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,800
you can stay in heaven.

717
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,800
There's a saying,

718
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,800
don't say it out.

719
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,800
You will not hesitate to take action.

720
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,800
You block the wind for me,

721
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,800
you bring rain for me.

722
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,800
Teach me to stop,

723
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,800
and move forward with your chest.

724
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,800
I've been hurt,

725
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,800
and hurt, but I still have a dream.

726
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,800
I want you to stay with me,

727
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,800
and cry with me.

728
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,800
Let's shout together,

729
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,800
and hug together.

730
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,800
Let's stay together on the street.

731
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,800
We will go to the end,

732
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,800
without any reason.

733
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,800
We've been through too much together,

734
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,800
but we still can't get over it.

735
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,800
We will go to the end,

736
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,800
without any reason.

737
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,800
When we need each other the most,

738
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,800
we can stay together in heaven.

739
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:12,800
Let's stay together on the street.
