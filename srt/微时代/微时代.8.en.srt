00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Thank you for watching!

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Thank you for watching!

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Hello!

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm here!

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm here!

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Mei Bao!

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What should I say?

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What should I say?

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
My boyfriend didn't say anything.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I can't say anything.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yingdong,

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
do you have any words to say?

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm looking forward to your beautiful outfit.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Mr. Zai Kang,

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I don't want you to regret it forever.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I've already taken the photo of you

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
in the photo studio.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
In order to keep us together,

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
we decided to push you

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
into our group.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Han Dingyi,

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
shouldn't you say something for me?

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You don't know about your crush?

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That's not funny.

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
No wonder you made it clear

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
when you were together.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Mr. Zai Kang!

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I think you're thinking too much.

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I have something to do. I'll go first.

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Weiwei, where are you going?

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I have something to do. I'll go first.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Your brother just told me that you were going to cook today.

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But then he said goodbye to me.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He won't cook for you today.

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Today's party

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
is to keep you together.

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
No, no, Xiaojiu.

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Actually, we all miss you.

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Will you stay for us?

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What?

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Why would Xiaojiu stay for us?

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Mr. Kang,

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
please confess.

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
There must be a result.

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Xiaojiu will miss this chance.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That's right.

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
you will see that the couple will become lovers

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Mr. Kang, you don't have to take pictures of Xiaojiu anymore.

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You can have a serious relationship.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Stop it.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Why are you taking pictures?

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
We're just students.

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You're just a student.

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yes, I took pictures.

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I took pictures of Xiaojiu running.

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I took pictures of Xiaojiu playing basketball.

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I took pictures of you going to work and going home.

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I took pictures of all the little things in your life.

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Do you know what I want to do most now?

89
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I want to take pictures of your smile.

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Let's be together.

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But I'm not the one who wants to know all of this.

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Who is it?

93
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's Ding Xiaorou.

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I promised her and her parents

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
not to tell you about this forever.

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But I'm afraid if I don't tell you now,

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'll regret it forever.

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
After Ding Xiaorou and you broke up,

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
she never fell in love with anyone.

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Do you know?

101
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I climbed into her house that day.

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Her house was full of your pictures.

103
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
She said when she missed you,

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
she would take these pictures and put them on her bag.

105
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Imagine what you're doing.

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Who you're with.

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
How are you doing now?

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Everything I do is what she told me to do.

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Because she wants to see you now.

110
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Then why didn't she come to see me?

111
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Because she was afraid to see you.

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
She was afraid to drag you down.

113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
She told me not to tell you everything.

114
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Because she was afraid to affect your life.

115
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Do you know what her biggest dream is?

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
She wants to see your dream come true.

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
She wants to be a real chef.

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Even if she just calls you at midnight

119
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
and hears your voice.

120
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That's enough.

121
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
She doesn't want to see you.

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Because she's really sick.

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What kind of disease is that?

124
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Snow-capped.

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What's your wish?

126
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I want to go to the Eastern Hospital.

127
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Does anyone know where to go?

185
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The second room on the left.

186
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Thank you.

187
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:32,960
Please note that they recognize the

188
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:41,740
screenplay with played roles.

189
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:48,560
It is a novel, so there is noiblight.

190
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,220
JAN einzige

191
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,740
I'm going to find

192
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:14,660
theerry

193
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,660
I can't take a picture of you in the room.

194
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,660
But I still miss you in my heart.

195
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,660
I miss you.

196
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,660
I miss you.

197
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,660
I miss you.

198
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,660
I miss you.

199
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,660
I miss you.

200
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,660
I miss you.

201
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,660
I miss you.

202
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,660
I miss you.

203
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,660
I miss you.

204
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,660
Do you know why you're so upset about Uncle Wei?

205
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,660
Why can't money solve some problems in this world?

206
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,660
Let's be together forever, okay?

207
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,660
I want to be with you forever.

208
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,660
People say your name is like ice in winter.

209
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,660
But do you know?

210
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,660
You're the fire in winter.

211
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,660
I feel warm when I have you.

212
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,660
I miss you.

213
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:59,660
You didn't eat all night.

214
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,660
Have some porridge.

215
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,660
I cooked this myself.

216
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,660
If you don't eat, I'll cook for others.

217
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,660
You dare to...

218
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,660
I know you're worried about Uncle Wei and Ding Xiaorou.

219
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,660
But you can't just eat and ruin yourself.

220
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,660
You can't help me with anything.

221
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,660
I used to complain about the things I lacked in my life.

222
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:45,660
Now I know how happy I am.

223
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,660
At least I'm alive. I'm healthy.

224
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,660
I have nothing to be dissatisfied with.

225
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:00,660
The most important thing is that the person I love is in front of me.

226
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,660
Then I can touch her.

227
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,660
I want to make a movie about Uncle's love story.

228
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,660
I'm really touched by it. But it's too sad.

229
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,660
As long as he has one day of breath, we'll have one day of hope.

230
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,660
I know a person.

231
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,660
As long as I have a problem, he can solve it.

232
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,660
As long as money can solve it, it's not a problem.

233
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:53,660
Mr. Wu is in front of the theater.

234
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,660
How do you take care of Miss?

235
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:02,660
I'm sorry.

236
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,660
Amber.

237
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,660
How are you?

238
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,660
I brought the best medical team from America.

239
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,660
Don't worry. The disease is just a little worse than a cold.

240
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,660
You'll be fine. Don't be afraid.

241
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,660
I'm just too tired to live in the hospital.

242
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,660
I don't want to let Witte tell you that I'm the one who got the leukemia.

243
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,660
If I don't say that, will you bring me the best doctor in the world?

244
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,660
Do you know how important the business in America is?

245
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,660
I don't know.

246
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:58,660
Do you know how much I have to pay for the business I finished?

247
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,660
I don't want to know.

248
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,660
Why are you so emotional?

249
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,660
What kind of friends do you have?

250
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,660
Why do you want me to fly back?

251
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:23,660
I'm not helping them for a reason.

252
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,660
I'll make it clear. Which one is Amber's boyfriend?

253
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,660
Is it you?

254
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:38,660
It's me.

255
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,660
I know you. You're the advertising director.

256
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:48,660
Yes, it's me.

257
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,660
Is it me?

258
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,660
I know you. You're the assistant director who lost the advertising material.

259
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:03,660
Which one is your good friend?

260
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,660
It's me.

261
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,660
And me.

262
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,660
Whose girlfriend is it?

263
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,660
I don't have a girlfriend yet.

264
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,660
She's my girlfriend.

265
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:33,660
I've never seen you before.

266
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,660
He's my brother.

267
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,660
Witte, take the doctor to the hospital.

268
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,660
Don't worry.

269
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,660
He's always been mean to me.

270
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,660
We're in Shanghai.

271
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,660
If you know you have leukemia, you can go to school.

272
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,660
Who has this disease?

273
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:12,660
She's always been a good girl.

274
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:17,660
She's afraid that we'll feel bad.

275
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,660
She's always been a good girl.

276
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,660
She told me that she didn't feel any pain.

277
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,660
The more she's like this, the more we feel bad.

278
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,660
The only thing that can make her happy is...

279
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:41,660
...the doctor who's always been a good girl.

280
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,660
He's a very handsome and ugly boyfriend.

281
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,660
He's a chef and can cook all kinds of dishes.

282
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:58,660
He said that when he's well,

283
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,660
you can come back to get married.

284
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,660
Every time he's in pain,

285
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,660
he'll put your photo on the wall.

286
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,660
He took these photos when you were unconscious.

287
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,660
He knows that wherever you are,

288
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:27,660
he lives with you.

289
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,660
A few days ago, you took your friend to the hospital.

290
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,660
He saw you secretly.

291
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:42,660
He was so happy that he couldn't sleep.

292
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,660
Xiaorou didn't sleep at all.

293
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:52,660
But she didn't stop smiling.

294
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:56,660
She said that she'd watch you grow up.

295
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:01,660
She's a good girl.

296
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:06,660
A year ago, the doctor knew that...

297
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,660
...she couldn't live through the winter.

298
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:16,660
But she's still alive because of your faith.

299
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,660
I'm sorry.

300
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:31,660
Let's go inside.

301
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,660
We've done our best.

302
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:41,660
These hospital bills are not something that a friend can afford.

303
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:46,660
Amber, don't do this.

304
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:50,660
I'm afraid that I'll affect your treatment.

305
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,660
I'll take Zi Yu's car.

306
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,660
Can I say no?

307
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:05,660
Take her mother and play games.

308
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:10,660
No, we'll take a taxi.

309
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:15,660
It's late.

310
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,660
Let's go.

311
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,660
Thank you for doing so much for our family.

312
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:47,660
I'm sorry for the loss.

313
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,660
Let's go.

314
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:37,660
We've tried everything we could.

315
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:42,660
But there's still no hope.

316
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:47,660
Let's go.

317
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,660
I'm sorry.

318
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,660
I'll pass on your wish.

319
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:09,660
Sure.

320
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:14,660
I'll do whatever you want.

321
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:19,660
I'll go with you.

322
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:24,660
I want to eat and drink.

323
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:29,660
But I don't want you to leave me.

324
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:35,660
You can do it.

325
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:39,660
I'll do whatever you want.

326
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:44,660
Will you stay with me?

327
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:49,660
Sure.

328
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:54,660
I'll do whatever you want.

329
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:09,660
I'm sorry.

330
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,660
Thank you.

331
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:37,660
I'm sorry.

332
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:41,660
I'm sorry.

333
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,660
Who are you?

334
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:08,660
I'm Zhang Guo.

335
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,660
Xiao Tian.

336
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:20,660
Are you okay?

337
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:25,660
Try the chrysalis.

338
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:30,660
Chrysalis?

339
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:34,660
It's like my name.

340
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:39,660
Why did you say your name is Chrysalis?

341
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,660
Thank you.

342
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:50,660
I'm sorry.

343
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,660
I'm sorry.

344
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:20,660
I'm sorry.

345
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:50,660
Are you so nice to everyone?

346
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:55,660
You're the only one.

347
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:20,660
I'm sorry.

348
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:34,660
Xiaorou.

349
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:39,660
I'm sorry.

350
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:44,660
I'm sorry.

351
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:48,660
I'm sorry.

352
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:04,660
Xiao Tian, let me see you.

353
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:09,660
It's the best gift.

354
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:13,660
You're the only one I've ever had.

355
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,660
You're my companion.

356
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:25,660
Thank you.

357
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:43,660
I'm sorry.

358
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:48,660
I'm sorry.

359
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:13,660
I'm sorry.

360
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:18,660
I'm sorry.

361
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:23,660
I'm sorry.

362
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:28,660
I'm sorry.

363
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:33,660
I'm sorry.

364
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:38,660
I'm sorry.

365
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:43,660
I'm sorry.

366
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:48,660
I'm sorry.

367
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,660
I'm sorry.

368
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,860
In my heart, there is only you.

369
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:03,260
If your feelings are as special as yours,

370
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:08,260
who will you choose to protect?

371
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:59,220
If your feelings are so special as yours,

372
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:05,260
who will you choose to protect?

373
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,220
Are you okay?

374
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:18,260
Do you know if they will give me another chance to see you?

375
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:24,260
I don't know if you will hear my voice.

376
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:29,260
The top of the mountain has been severely deprived of the right to love you.

377
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:34,260
Even the right to hear your voice has been deprived.

378
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:39,260
But I always want to leave you something.

379
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:45,260
At least you will hear my voice when you miss me.

380
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:53,260
I will miss you.

381
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:57,260
I will miss you.

382
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,260
Mei Bao.

383
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,260
Meng.

384
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,260
You don't have to come to work anymore.

385
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,260
The waitress is here.

386
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,260
Here, go over there.

387
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,260
Over there.

388
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,260
Yes.

389
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,260
Why?

390
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,260
Did I do something wrong?

391
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:21,260
Meng, before you resign, you should tell me.

392
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,260
I have to save the rent for the second half of the year.

393
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,260
Don't worry.

394
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:31,260
I will pay your monthly salary on time.

395
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,260
Why?

396
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,260
Why?

397
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,260
Because I don't want you to work after class.

398
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:41,260
You are so tired walking around in high heels.

399
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,260
You are pregnant with my son's child.

400
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:49,260
After graduation, you will marry Youxi.

401
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,260
Marry him?

402
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,260
Of course.

403
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,260
Why not?

404
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,260
I told you to ask your mother to come from Shenyang.

405
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:01,260
Why not?

406
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:06,260
Meng, I haven't prepared for the wedding.

407
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,260
Aren't you also pregnant?

408
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:12,260
That's why my son suffered so much.

409
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:17,260
I have to build a good family for you.

410
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,260
Listen to me.

411
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:24,260
You have to take care of yourself.

412
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,260
I'm sorry, Meng.

413
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:30,260
Can you give me some time to think about it?

414
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,260
I'm going to work.

415
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,260
What are you thinking about?

416
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,260
I'm going to work.

417
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,260
I'm going to work.

418
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,260
Stop drinking.

419
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,260
You are drunk.

420
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:10,260
I'm drunk.

421
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:14,260
You can go back to the past.

422
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:18,260
You can see the future.

423
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:22,260
Tell her

424
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,260
not to leave.

425
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,260
Goodbye forever.

426
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,260
I didn't hear it.

427
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:45,260
I heard the sound of the small boat.

428
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:48,260
And

429
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:53,260
and the wind I gave her.

430
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:58,260
I heard the sound of the small boat.

431
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:03,260
I'm at the door.

432
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:07,260
Let's go find her together.

433
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,260
Let's go.

434
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,260
I'll go home with you.

435
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,260
Come on.

436
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,260
Let's go.

437
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,260
Let's go.

438
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,260
Let's go.

439
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,260
Let's go.

440
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:26,260
Let's go home.

441
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:30,260
I'll take you home.

442
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,260
Let's go.

443
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,260
Let's go.

444
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,260
Let's go.

445
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,260
Let's go.

446
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,260
Let's go.

447
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,260
Hello.

448
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,260
Hello, Samo.

449
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,260
Come to the bar tonight.

450
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:53,260
I'll buy you a new dress.

451
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,260
Let's have dinner together.

452
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:15,260
My brother is very handsome.

453
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,260
But he's not in a good mood.

454
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,260
Let him cheer up.

455
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,260
Okay.

456
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,260
Thank you.

457
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,260
Come on.

458
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,260
Drink more.

459
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,260
My brother is here.

460
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,260
Samo.

461
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,260
This is my brother.

462
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,260
Hello.

463
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,260
I'll introduce you.

464
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,260
Guo Ping is the manager of the advertising department.

465
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,260
This is Dan Dan, the chief editor of the magazine.

466
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,260
Mei Xiaoman, the top of the bank.

467
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,260
They are all customers of my jewelry store.

468
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:51,260
We've all seen your story on the Internet.

469
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:54,260
Actually, I think Xiao Rou also wants you to live a happy life.

470
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,260
Don't we have to make an appointment?

471
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:59,260
We can get to know each other and make friends.

472
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,260
You can go to the countryside to breathe the fresh air.

473
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,260
Look, my friends are so bright.

474
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,260
They didn't come with their purpose.

475
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:09,260
Come on, sit down and chat.

476
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,260
Make friends first.

477
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,260
I'm sorry. I have to go first.

478
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:16,260
Wait a minute.

479
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,260
Don't go.

480
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,260
Samo.

481
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,260
Look at you.

482
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,260
How can you stand this attitude?

483
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,260
Why do you care?

484
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,260
You can't even manage yourself.

485
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,260
You love Shen Dongwei, but you're not like me.

486
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,260
Please.

487
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,260
Let me be at ease.

488
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,260
Samo.

489
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,260
Samo.

490
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,260
Samo.

491
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,260
Samo.

492
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,260
Where are you going?

493
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,260
Where are you going?

494
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,260
I don't want to scold you.

495
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,260
It's okay.

496
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,260
You can scold me if you want.

497
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,260
I've been away from home since I was a child.

498
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,260
I'm sure my parents hate me.

499
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:03,260
If you can scold me for my parents, then go ahead.

500
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,260
Don't do this.

501
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,260
Go back.

502
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,260
I hate myself for everything.

503
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,260
You can't blame me for your parents' death.

504
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,260
You don't have a brother.

505
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,260
Okay?

506
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,260
Samo.

507
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,260
You're hurt like this because of a woman?

508
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,260
If something happened to you,

509
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,260
I wouldn't tell your parents.

510
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,260
How can I live?

511
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,260
It's hard now.

512
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,260
I can't feel this world every day.

513
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,260
I'm not her.

514
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,260
Do you know?

515
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,260
Okay.

516
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,260
You treated your sister like this.

517
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,260
You treated your sister like this.

518
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,260
Don't you know your sister is in pain?

519
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,260
I'm telling you.

520
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,260
If Xiaorou was still alive,

521
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,260
she wouldn't love you

522
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,260
if she saw you like this.

523
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,260
You're not in love.

524
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:56,260
Don't touch her.

525
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:11,260
We want the best.

526
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:15,260
We don't need any reason.

527
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,260
There are too many things in the world.

528
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:22,260
We can't expect anything.

529
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:25,260
We want the best.

530
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:29,260
We will have any excuse.

531
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,260
When you need it most,

532
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:37,260
let's stay together forever.

533
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,260
There's a saying,

534
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:56,260
don't say it out loud.

535
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:59,260
You will be fine.

536
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:01,260
I'm not sure if I can do it.

537
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,260
I'm not sure if I can do it.

538
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,260
I'm not sure if I can do it.

539
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,260
I'm not sure if I can do it.

540
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,260
I'm not sure if I can do it.

541
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,260
I'm not sure if I can do it.

542
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:13,260
I'm not sure if I can do it.

543
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,260
I'm not sure if I can do it.

544
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,260
I'm not sure if I can do it.

545
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,260
I'm not sure if I can do it.

546
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,260
I'm not sure if I can do it.

547
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,260
I'm not sure if I can do it.

548
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,260
I'm not sure if I can do it.

549
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,260
I'm not sure if I can do it.

550
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,260
I'm not sure if I can do it.

551
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,260
