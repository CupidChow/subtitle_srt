00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,440
Side Story

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,000
Why are you so depressed?

4
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,480
Did you meet a ghost?

5
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,480
Do I look like a ghost?

6
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,040
Yes.

7
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,880
You look like a bad luck ghost.

8
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,880
You look like a bad luck ghost.

9
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,880
I'm not that kind of person.

10
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,880
But I don't want to know which woman made you like this.

11
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,880
I look like her.

12
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,880
Don't worry.

13
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,880
Your boyfriend is not a good match for me.

14
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,880
He's just a normal man.

15
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,880
Even if you learn to use him, it won't work.

16
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,880
Give up.

17
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,880
Men who are jealous of Gong Xin are more horrible than women.

18
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,880
You should be jealous.

19
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,880
I'm a man.

20
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,880
I know what men think.

21
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,880
He spoiled you like honey today.

22
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,880
He doesn't want you tomorrow.

23
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,880
It's like he never knew you.

24
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,880
Men are the most hopeless and memoryless animals.

25
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,880
Aren't you a man like that?

26
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,880
Yes.

27
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,880
The world is dark.

28
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,880
So I'm telling you, never believe in men.

29
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,880
Never.

30
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,880
You want me to be single forever?

31
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,880
It's better than being a bad luck ghost.

32
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,880
Okay.

33
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,880
I'm not here to talk about that.

34
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,880
Are you hungry?

35
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,880
Let's go eat.

36
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,880
Let's go.

37
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,880
Let's go eat.

38
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,880
Is it good?

39
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,880
We'll order more if it's good.

40
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,880
Is Wan Jia awake?

41
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,880
She's fine.

42
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,880
Thank God she's fine.

43
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,880
Why did Ye Fei Fei lie to us for so long?

44
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,880
I didn't expect that she's a gossip reporter.

45
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,880
I don't know if I should praise her for her experience or because she's too scary.

46
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,880
Hey.

47
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,880
Some people are her boyfriends.

48
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,880
Why can't you tell?

49
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,880
You knew it long ago.

50
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,880
You should have kept it a secret.

51
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,880
I'm in a bad mood today.

52
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,880
I don't care if I'm a coward.

53
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,880
You still insult my character.

54
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,880
What?

55
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,880
You have a character.

56
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,880
We didn't argue.

57
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,880
Then you should break up with me.

58
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,880
So fast.

59
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,880
Who's handsome?

60
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,880
Why do you ask so many questions?

61
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,880
Me?

62
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,880
I just want to make fun of you.

63
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,880
We never dated.

64
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,880
She didn't really treat me as a friend.

65
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,880
She approached me just to write her gossip news.

66
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,880
Satisfied?

67
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,880
Very satisfied.

68
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,880
You said that a girl like her who is a bit manly doesn't like you.

69
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,880
Do you know how bad you are?

70
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
Licking hair...

71
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,880
It's painful.

72
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,880
That's weird.

73
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,880
What?

74
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,880
Why are you so worried?

75
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,880
Me?

76
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,880
You're an idiot.

77
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,880
I realized that I can't chat with you.

78
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,880
As long as I chat with you, you can't ruin the atmosphere.

79
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,880
Are we really not suitable to be together?

80
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,880
It's enough to be together.

81
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,880
Maybe.

82
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,880
Let me ask you a question.

83
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,880
Yes.

84
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,880
If you didn't lie to me,

85
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,880
you would really be pregnant.

86
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,880
Would you give birth to a child?

87
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,880
Of course not.

88
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,880
Are you afraid that I can't raise you?

89
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,880
Or I won't admit it?

90
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,880
If a woman decides to have a child,

91
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,880
she will think about it.

92
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,880
The whole world can't rely on her.

93
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,880
She will try to raise her.

94
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,880
Do you understand?

95
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,880
No.

96
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,880
Of course you don't understand.

97
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,880
You don't have a child.

98
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,880
What about you?

99
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,880
Why don't you have a child?

100
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880
Me?

101
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,880
I don't have the courage to live a life with a child.

102
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,880
Young people don't have the courage.

103
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,880
It's not fair to the child.

104
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,880
Yes, it's not fair.

105
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,880
But a person's youth is just a few years.

106
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,880
If you don't bet, you may not have hope in the next life.

107
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:01,880
So, only a great woman can give her everything for her child.

108
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,880
Do you understand?

109
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,880
I understand.

110
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,880
I know.

111
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,880
You need to find me at any time.

112
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,880
I'll be there soon.

113
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,880
Who?

114
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,880
Someone is looking for you at any time.

115
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,880
It seems that the market has not fallen.

116
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,880
There is no other way.

117
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,880
I have a great charm in the Chinese market.

118
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,880
You just hide your secrets from me.

119
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,880
And then you go out and do nothing.

120
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,880
To be honest, I admire you very much.

121
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,880
You are not old, but you are bold.

122
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,880
You are a talent to be able to hide your secrets from me.

123
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,880
Thank you for your compliment.

124
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,880
I believe you know very well what I'm going to ask you out for today.

125
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,880
I hope you can stop investigating me from now on.

126
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,880
Don't put my private life in danger.

127
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,880
This is a blank cash receipt.

128
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,880
Please accept my little heart.

129
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,880
I thank you for your kindness.

130
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,880
But I am a professional reporter.

131
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
I have my own professional copy.

132
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,880
I understand.

133
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,880
But I believe that everything has a price.

134
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,880
As long as the price is fixed, there is no unfulfilled business.

135
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,880
As for your professional skills, how much is it worth?

136
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,880
Then you will have to evaluate it yourself.

137
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,880
I'm sorry.

138
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,880
I think I have no right to judge myself.

139
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,880
I think my professional copy is priceless.

140
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,880
There is nothing in the world that has no price.

141
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,880
I think you just haven't figured out how much money to fill in.

142
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
Of course.

143
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,880
Maybe you really don't have the courage to take this receipt.

144
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,880
If you take this receipt, then it's very likely that it belongs to someone else.

145
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,880
Maybe it belongs to the owner of your magazine.

146
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,880
I don't know.

147
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,880
There is still some time.

148
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,880
Think again.

149
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,880
Who will this receipt belong to?

150
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,880
It's up to you.

151
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,880
Goodbye.

152
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,880
Wait.

153
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
I have one last question.

154
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,880
Do you really have no feelings for Huayou Xi?

155
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,880
Anyway, you have already investigated everything I have.

156
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,880
I'm not afraid that you will know.

157
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,880
I admit that I have.

158
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,880
But that's why I won't give myself this chance.

159
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,880
Because I'm afraid that some love will be out of order.

160
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,880
Mom, stop drinking.

161
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,880
I want to drink today.

162
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,880
I want to get drunk and rest.

163
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,880
Mom, I'll drink with you.

164
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,880
Son, you have grown up.

165
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,880
Your wings are hard.

166
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
Can you stay with me for a while?

167
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,880
Can you stay with me for a while?

168
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,880
Of course I can.

169
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,880
I'm your son.

170
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,880
I'm your son.

171
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,880
I'm your son.

172
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,880
Drink less.

173
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,880
Son, I said that Wan's family is not my daughter-in-law.

174
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,880
Don't take it to heart.

175
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,880
No.

176
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,880
From now on, if you want to do anything,

177
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,880
if you're happy, do it.

178
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,880
I will never care about you.

179
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,880
Never.

180
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,880
Mom,

181
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,880
maybe others won't choose me.

182
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,880
But I will choose you.

183
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
I always thought that

184
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,880
what men said was a lie.

185
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
But what you said,

186
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,880
I'm willing to listen.

187
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,880
What I said is true.

188
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,880
Yes.

189
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,880
We two are drinking such a good wine.

190
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,880
It's a waste.

191
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,880
Let's drink together.

192
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,880
Yingdu is working overtime.

193
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,880
Weiwei is with Wan's family in the hospital.

194
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,880
Everyone is busy.

195
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,880
And me.

196
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,880
As long as you need me, I will be here.

197
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
Come on.

198
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,880
Tonight I will be the guardian of the flower.

199
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
Cheers.

200
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,880
Why do you always look so happy?

201
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,880
It seems that you never have any worries.

202
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,880
I envy you.

203
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,880
What?

204
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,880
You have worries?

205
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
Come on.

206
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,880
Give me this giant trash can.

207
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,880
Listen.

208
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,880
I feel very lonely.

209
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,880
I have everything I want.

210
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,880
But I'm still in pain.

211
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,880
Although my dad loves me very much,

212
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,880
I don't want what he gave me.

213
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,880
He can't give me what I want.

214
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
What do you want?

215
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,880
I want a free life.

216
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,880
A love without worries.

217
00:14:53,880 --> 00:15:07,440
A romance without any

218
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,880
I'm afraid that one day daddy won't accept Yingdu anymore.

219
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,880
I'm also very worried that Yingdu will leave me one day.

220
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,880
I'm afraid that one day daddy won't accept Yingdu anymore.

221
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,880
I'm also very worried that one day daddy will leave me one day.

222
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,880
They all have one goal in their world.

223
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,880
That is to be successful.

224
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,880
And I only want romance.

225
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,880
Why are men and women so different?

226
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,880
You are also a man.

227
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,880
Do you know why?

228
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,880
I don't know.

229
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,880
Maybe I will never be that kind of man.

230
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,880
If you become this kind of man one day,

231
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,880
remember to tell me.

232
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,880
Okay.

233
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,880
It's a deal.

234
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,880
I don't have any brothers or sisters.

235
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,880
Fortunately, I have friends who are familiar with cameras.

236
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,880
Especially you.

237
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,880
Maybe the heavens are watching me too lonely.

238
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,880
So they sent you to help me.

239
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,880
I have cameras like 18-15.

240
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,880
In addition to helping you with the questions,

241
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,880
I can help you solve all kinds of problems.

242
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,880
I'm more powerful than Doraemon.

243
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,880
I'm very powerful.

244
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,880
You are so cool.

245
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,880
You are the best in the world.

246
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,880
I'm so proud of you.

247
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,880
If only I had a sister like you.

248
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,880
I don't want a brother like you.

249
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,880
What?

250
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,880
It's not good to have a brother to take care of you.

251
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,880
I don't want a brother.

252
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,880
My dad has been controlling me all day.

253
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,880
It's enough to annoy me.

254
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,880
If another person comes to annoy me,

255
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,880
I will not be able to stand it.

256
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,880
And I don't want anyone to share my dad's love for me.

257
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,880
I want you guys.

258
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,880
Don't worry.

259
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,880
You have everything.

260
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,880
You are your father's only.

261
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,880
Cheers.

262
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,880
Cheers.

263
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,880
How many degrees?

264
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,880
37 degrees.

265
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,880
It's not burning.

266
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
Let me see.

267
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,880
Where is he?

268
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,880
What?

269
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,880
Where is he?

270
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
I don't know.

271
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,880
I don't know.

272
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,880
I don't know.

273
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,880
I don't know.

274
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,880
I don't know.

275
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,880
I don't know.

276
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,880
I don't know.

277
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,880
I don't know.

278
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
Where is he?

279
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,880
I'm here.

280
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,880
They all left.

281
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,880
What?

282
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,880
Meng, are you having a nightmare?

283
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,880
I had a long, long dream.

284
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,880
If it's a poor mother and a father,

285
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,880
who would you choose?

286
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,880
Of course, father.

287
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,880
Mom.

288
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,880
It's all your fault.

289
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,880
Who let you choose father?

290
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,880
It's just my uncle.

291
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,880
It's great to have a father who can take care of a poor mother.

292
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,880
You chose father too, right?

293
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,880
I don't want to talk to you.

294
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,880
You obviously chose the same as me.

295
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,880
The phone.

296
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,880
The phone.

297
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,880
Here.

298
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,880
Mom.

299
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,880
Xixi.

300
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,880
You decided to go to your dad, right?

301
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,880
What are you talking about?

302
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,880
I don't blame you.

303
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,880
If it was me,

304
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,880
I would have chosen you.

305
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,880
I hope you

306
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,880
can get

307
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,880
the father you should have.

308
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,880
Mom, don't think too much.

309
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,880
I know you miss your dad.

310
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,880
I understand.

311
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,880
Your dad is not that heartless.

312
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,880
He will accept you.

313
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
But Youxi,

314
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,880
I'm afraid you will live there.

315
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,880
I don't want to be with you.

316
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,880
Mom,

317
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,880
do you remember when I was a kid,

318
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,880
I was bullied at school?

319
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,880
I was bullied by my parents.

320
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,880
I fought with them every time.

321
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,880
I was beaten up.

322
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,880
Some people asked me to pay you.

323
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
Do you remember?

324
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,880
Of course, I remember.

325
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,880
When you were a kid,

326
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,880
you always made me angry.

327
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,880
When you were a kid,

328
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,880
people asked me why I didn't have a father.

329
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,880
I told them that

330
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,880
my mom was too beautiful.

331
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,880
No man can match her.

332
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,880
That's why I don't have a father.

333
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,880
People laughed at me.

334
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,880
How can you have a father?

335
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,880
I said that my mom didn't want me.

336
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,880
She went to the hospital that day and was beaten up.

337
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,880
When I went out,

338
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,880
I saw the sunrise.

339
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,880
I felt that life had hope.

340
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,880
So I named Youxi.

341
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,880
I wanted to grow up.

342
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,880
I became a mother.

343
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,880
So,

344
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,880
Ms. Hua Mengjue,

345
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,880
please listen to what Xia Mei says carefully.

346
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,880
Your son, Hua Youxi,

347
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,880
will never leave you.

348
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,880
If there's a deadline,

349
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,880
I hope it'll be 10,000 years.

350
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,880
Where are you, Youxi?

351
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,880
I want to see you.

352
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,880
Where are you?

353
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,880
Mom,

354
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,880
I'm here.

355
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,880
You're still here?

356
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,880
Mom, Youxi is busy all day long.

357
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,880
She bought a lot of things to make you a full-length dress.

358
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,880
Yes, she occupied the whole kitchen all day long.

359
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,880
She was busy with her own work.

360
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
I was afraid she would burn the whole kitchen.

361
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,880
You didn't tell me.

362
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,880
You didn't leave, you didn't tell me.

363
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,880
What are you doing?

364
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,880
You're pissing me off.

365
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,880
Mom.

366
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,880
What's that smell?

367
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,880
Something is burnt.

368
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,880
I... I'll...

369
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,880
I'll go and check.

370
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,880
Mom, did Youxi grow up?

371
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,880
We won't leave you.

372
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,880
We'll be together forever.

373
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,880
We haven't treated you well.

374
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,880
Jiajia, what do you want to eat today?

375
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
I sent it to you yesterday.

376
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,880
Ding Yi, Yingdong, Amber, they are asking if you are feeling better.

377
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,880
You have to get better soon.

378
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,880
I'll go.

379
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,880
Feifei, why are you here?

380
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,880
I came to see you.

381
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,880
Beautiful flowers.

382
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,880
Sit down.

383
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,880
Why did you come to see me?

384
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,880
I think you are busy writing your report.

385
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,880
I...

386
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,880
I made you look like this for the report.

387
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,880
Shouldn't you hate me?

388
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,880
Anyway, you blocked me.

389
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,880
Maybe God wants you to do your job.

390
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,880
So I let you rest here.

391
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,880
Do you think you won't feel bad?

392
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,880
Besides, your job is just an investigation.

393
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,880
Actually, it can help Yingdong to get back on track.

394
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,880
I'm sorry.

395
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,880
I think I'm not a good person.

396
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,880
You are too kind.

397
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,880
Kindness is a good thing.

398
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,880
You should keep your kindness.

399
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,880
Otherwise, you will be cheated one day.

400
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,880
Who will cheat me?

401
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,880
You?

402
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,880
How do you know I won't?

403
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,880
Even if you cheat me, I have to thank you.

404
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:59,880
If it wasn't for this accident, how could I have an accident?

405
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,880
Accident?

406
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,880
You made me understand one thing.

407
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,880
It's not that you have love, but you lose your friendship.

408
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,880
But you have changed the wrong person.

409
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,880
Your friendship has nothing to do with me.

410
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,880
Of course it has.

411
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,880
Actually, a while ago, we had a feeling that we couldn't say it.

412
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,880
Some topics we didn't dare to touch.

413
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,880
Some feelings we didn't dare to say.

414
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,880
I don't know what will happen to our friendship with Weiwei.

415
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:42,880
I don't know if we can be friends with Yingdong.

416
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,880
I was really worried.

417
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,880
I was worried that we would give up our friendship because of love.

418
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,880
But because of you, I understand.

419
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,880
I was worried too much.

420
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,880
Our feelings are always there.

421
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,880
So your investigation didn't just disband us.

422
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,880
It made us love each other more.

423
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,880
You should rest. I won't bother you.

424
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,880
Actually, Youxi is a good person.

425
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:40,880
Although he looks like a man, he is kind.

426
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,880
Give him a chance.

427
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,880
Let him die in your hands.

428
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,880
We can say that he is a double fish and you are a fairy.

429
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,880
You are a match made in heaven.

430
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,880
Once you get him, we will have a single man.

431
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,880
I will leave this fire pit to others.

432
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,880
I will leave this fire pit to others.

433
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,880
I have time.

434
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,880
It's a long way.

435
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,880
Okay, see you later.

436
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,880
Bye.

437
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,880
Is this the city of Wallachia?

438
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,880
Yes.

439
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,880
I'm touched by our boss.

440
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,880
He taught us a lesson.

441
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,880
Who is your boss?

442
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,880
He is a potato.

443
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,880
Let's go.

444
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,880
Go.

445
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,880
Hello, is this the chief editor?

446
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,880
Why are you looking for me?

447
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,880
Feifei, do you want to buy today's match?

448
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,880
Come and see.

449
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,880
What's wrong?

450
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,880
They won't find Wu Yuting's illegitimate child?

451
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,880
No, it's your potato.

452
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,880
He is not my chief editor.

453
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,880
It doesn't matter what your relationship is.

454
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,880
Go to see the match now.

455
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,880
They made the potato into a cover news.

456
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,880
Now it's sold out.

457
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,880
How is the investigation going?

458
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,880
Please take out the dry goods.

459
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,880
We have no news about the explosion.

460
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,880
I'm waiting for you.

461
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,880
What?

462
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,880
What's wrong?

463
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,880
I gave you so many resources.

464
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,880
Don't fool me.

465
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,880
And you don't want to be the chief editor?

466
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,880
Don't think that you can take the potato.

467
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,880
I'm telling you,

468
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,880
many people are watching the chief editor.

469
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,880
You can't do it.

470
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,880
You can't do it.

471
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,880
You can't do it.

472
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,880
Many people are watching the chief editor.

473
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,880
I see.

474
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,880
I will think about it.

475
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,880
We will win this battle.

476
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,880
You said it.

477
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,880
You must do it.

478
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,880
Boss, thank you for the match.

479
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,880
You're late.

480
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,880
I bought it.

481
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,880
You bought it?

482
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,880
Yes.

483
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,880
People nowadays are strange.

484
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,880
They like dirty things.

485
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,880
It's a bad thing.

486
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,880
They take it as food.

487
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,880
You want this?

488
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,880
I have it.

489
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,880
Why did you buy this?

490
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,880
I'm a famous gas boy.

491
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,880
I'm not as professional as you.

492
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,880
But I need to update the news.

493
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,880
I won't do it.

494
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,880
Thank you.

495
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,880
What's wrong with your face?

496
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,880
It's because of your potato.

497
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,880
I told you not to bother him.

498
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,880
It's okay.

499
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,880
You're happy now.

500
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,880
Here.

501
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,880
I bought you coffee and three bottles of juice.

502
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,880
Come on.

503
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,880
Eat.

504
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,880
You're strong.

505
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,880
You're not hungry.

506
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,880
I'm not hungry.

507
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,880
I'm on a diet.

508
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,880
You're afraid I'll send you a secret message.

509
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,880
I'll take your right hand away.

510
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,880
I'll smash your computer.

511
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,880
You'll never get this message.

512
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,880
Don't worry.

513
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,880
I won't.

514
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,880
Actually,

515
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,880
I should thank you.

516
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,880
If it wasn't for you,

517
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,880
I wouldn't know who my father is.

518
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,880
I want to thank you for my mom.

519
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,880
Because of you,

520
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,880
I can get over her.

521
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,880
My mom won't worry about me leaving her.

522
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,880
I can't give you sugar.

523
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,880
I can accept sugar.

524
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,880
I'll give you sugar.

525
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,880
You're thinking too much.

526
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,880
I know

527
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,880
I can't buy you

528
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,880
a weird card.

529
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,880
You're the weird card.

530
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,880
You don't admit it.

531
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,880
You don't eat soft food.

532
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,880
My mom begged you.

533
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,880
You don't eat hard food.

534
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,880
You don't compromise in front of violence.

535
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,880
Wu Yuting must have bought you with money.

536
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,880
You don't love money.

537
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,880
Otherwise, you wouldn't be sitting here.

538
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,880
So,

539
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,880
you're a weird card

540
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,880
who doesn't love

541
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,880
or admit anything.

542
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,880
Okay.

543
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,880
Why are you looking for me today?

544
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,880
I know.

545
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,880
I know you won't get this message

546
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,880
because of our friendship.

547
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,880
But,

548
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,880
I want to record

549
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,880
a real me

550
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,880
for you.

551
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,880
There's something I really want to say to you.

552
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,880
So,

553
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,880
don't show your fake videos

554
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,880
that you've been searching for.

555
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,880
Hua Youxi,

556
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,880
I love you so much.

557
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,880
Can I

558
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,880
confess my love?

559
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,880
Whatever.

560
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,880
I don't care.

561
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,880
Come on.

562
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,880
I'm Hua Youxi.

563
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,880
I've had a mom and a dad since I was a kid.

564
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,880
I have a dad.

565
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,880
So, when I was a kid,

566
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,880
I always imagined

567
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,880
what kind of person my dad was.

568
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,880
If my dad was

569
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,880
a rich man,

570
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,880
I would be rich.

571
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,880
I didn't expect that

572
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,880
God would really help me.

573
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,880
My dad was a rich man.

574
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,880
But now,

575
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,880
it doesn't matter to me.

576
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,880
My dad

577
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,880
has never raised me

578
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,880
for more than 20 years.

579
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,880
But I'm still

580
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,880
healthy and happy.

581
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,880
So,

582
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,880
for more than 20 years,

583
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,880
he has never appeared

584
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,880
in my life.

585
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,880
Now, it's the same.

586
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,880
The most important thing

587
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,880
is my mom's place in my heart.

588
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,880
No one can replace her.

589
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,880
Of course.

590
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,880
I want a rich dad.

591
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,880
But

592
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,880
my mom needs

593
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,880
a man who is more like her.

594
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,880
Uncle Wu,

595
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,880
if you see this tape,

596
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,880
I want to tell you

597
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,880
that

598
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,880
I will accept you

599
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,880
only if my mom

600
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,880
recognizes you.

601
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,880
You don't need to worry about me.

602
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,880
Because I don't like you at all.

603
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,880
If you feel guilty about me,

604
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,880
you can tell me.

605
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,880
You just need to

606
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,880
return what you owe my mom.

607
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,880
I don't want to

608
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,880
reveal our relationship.

609
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,880
I won't reveal

610
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,880
Amber's relationship.

611
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,880
You must think

612
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,880
I'm stupid and childish.

613
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,880
I don't know how to seize the opportunity.

614
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,880
But it doesn't matter.

615
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,880
I don't care.

616
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,880
My whole life

617
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,880
is living in misunderstanding.

618
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,880
I'm also living in misunderstanding.

619
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,880
I'm also living in misunderstanding.

620
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,880
But I believe that

621
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,880
it's priceless to you.

622
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,880
Jin Shang, Ye Fei Fei.

623
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,880
What are you doing?

624
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,880
Put me down.

625
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,880
Ye Fei Fei, I love you.

626
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,880
You want to confess?

627
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,880
I don't mind.

628
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,880
I don't mind.

629
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,880
What are you going to do?

630
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,880
I don't know.

631
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,880
What about your dream?

632
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,880
Aren't you going to be a medical student?

633
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,880
Isn't it?

634
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,880
I'm leaving.

635
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,880
I don't have time to be with you kids.

636
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,880
We can't meet again?

637
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,880
It depends on fate.

638
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,880
Okay.

639
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,880
Before you leave, I'll give you a very nice gift.

640
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,880
Your kiss is the least emotional kiss I've ever seen.

641
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,880
You're the most ungrateful person I've ever seen.

642
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,880
You're the most perverted person I've ever seen.

643
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,880
You're the least feminine person I've ever seen.

644
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,880
You're the most unforgettable person.

645
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,880
You...

646
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,880
Are you okay?

647
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,880
You'll get numb.

648
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,880
I won't help you.

649
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,880
Mom, I feel so happy.

650
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,880
I have a good mom.

651
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,880
I have a good brother.

652
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,880
I have a happy family.

653
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,880
Although we don't have much money now,

654
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,880
we have a lot of chopsticks.

655
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,880
We can't buy them with money.

656
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,880
Son, what's wrong with you today?

657
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,880
You're so sad.

658
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,880
Mom, look.

659
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,880
How sweet you are.

660
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,880
You...

661
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,880
Don't be fooled by me and my brother anymore.

662
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,880
Go and have a relationship.

663
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,880
I decided to put your picture on the marriage website.

664
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,880
There must be a lot of people after you.

665
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,880
Our family will be exposed.

666
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,880
I'm warning you.

667
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,880
Don't put your mom's picture on the marriage website.

668
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,880
I can't afford to lose your mom.

669
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,880
But my mom's body and face...

670
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,880
If you don't accept it, it's a waste.

671
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,880
Go and have a relationship.

672
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,880
No.

673
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,880
I promise.

674
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,880
If you find a boyfriend,

675
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,880
I won't be jealous.

676
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,880
I will support you 100%.

677
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,880
How do you care about your mom?

678
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,880
Now I have you and your brother.

679
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,880
How happy I am.

680
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,880
He's not sick.

681
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,880
Why did you find an old man to spend many years with him?

682
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,880
I'm not sick.

683
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,880
I'm not sick.

684
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,880
How many years can you spend with him?

685
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,880
We are looking for young people.

686
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,880
There are six-star hotels all over the world.

687
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,880
Looking for young people?

688
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,880
We will train him.

689
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,880
Then we will give him to other women.

690
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,880
Mom, it's like this.

691
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,880
There are things that you don't want to happen.

692
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,880
But it will happen.

693
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,880
Because love is free.

694
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,880
Your mom is most concerned about

695
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,880
you and Mei Bao.

696
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,880
And your brother.

697
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,880
And Wanjia and Weiwei.

698
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,880
Nothing else matters.

699
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,880
Son, we are very happy.

700
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,880
Stop it.

701
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,880
Get up.

702
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,880
Get up.

703
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,880
Hurry up.

704
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,880
The English group

705
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,880
has returned to the track.

706
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,880
It's a big deal.

707
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,880
But the business is not as good as before.

708
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,880
You are really good.

709
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,880
You have been through this.

710
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,880
After a month, Amber will graduate.

711
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,880
I have arranged her to work in my hotel.

712
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,880
She wants to go out and do business.

713
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,880
But you know,

714
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,880
the society outside is cruel,

715
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,880
and complicated.

716
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,880
I don't want her to work in other companies.

717
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,880
After all, I'm just a baby.

718
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,880
I'm not a woman.

719
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,880
I'm a woman.

720
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,880
Amber is really lucky

721
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,880
to have such a good father like you.

722
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,880
But Amber is still too young.

723
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,880
And she has never had any work experience.

724
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,880
I'm worried that she will be proud

725
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,880
and have a good eye.

726
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,880
So I hope you can come to the company

727
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,880
to help her.

728
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,880
Because she can't hear

729
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,880
everyone's words.

730
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,880
Including me as a father.

731
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,880
Only you can hear her.

732
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,880
Thank you for inviting me to the company.

733
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,880
It means a lot to me.

734
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,880
I'm very grateful.

735
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,880
But...

736
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,880
I can't say yes right now.

737
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,880
No one can refuse

738
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,880
my request.

739
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,880
Tell me,

740
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,880
why you don't say yes?

741
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,880
I admit,

742
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,880
I have a bad reputation in the business.

743
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,880
Wushi is a very good company.

744
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,880
But I'm an outsider.

745
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,880
Amber is the reason

746
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,880
why I can come to the company.

747
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,880
If one day Amber is in the top position,

748
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,880
I will be eliminated.

749
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,880
But I hope

750
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,880
even without Amber,

751
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,880
you will still invite me to work with you.

752
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,880
Because I'm the one you need.

753
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,880
You're very clear-minded.

754
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,880
Okay.

755
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,880
Tell me,

756
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,880
what position do you want?

757
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,880
A position that is not for outsiders.

758
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,880
You want

759
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,880
the vice president of the administration.

760
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,880
I will leave this position

761
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,880
to my future son-in-law.

762
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,880
Uncle Wu,

763
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,880
I really love Amber.

764
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,880
Amber is a very big

765
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,880
hotel kingdom.

766
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,880
No one dares to do Amber.

767
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,880
You're so willful.

768
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,880
Okay.

769
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,880
You can sit in this position.

770
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,880
But you have to

771
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,880
pass my test first.

772
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,880
Test?

773
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,880
I've been thinking about

774
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,880
a business.

775
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,880
That's a

776
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,880
multinational restaurant

777
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,880
founded by a young man.

778
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,880
Have you heard about it?

779
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,880
Of course.

780
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,880
This is a Western restaurant

781
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,880
founded by Asians.

782
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,880
It's very popular abroad.

783
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,880
It's a 20-brand restaurant.

784
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,880
That's right.

785
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,880
If you can get this project,

786
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,880
then the position you want

787
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,880
will probably be yours.

788
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,880
Thank you.

789
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,880
Thank you.

790
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,880
Thank you.

791
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,880
Thank you.

792
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,880
Thank you.

793
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,880
The End
