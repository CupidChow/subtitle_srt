1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I

7
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You

8
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I

9
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You

10
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You

11
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Ha ha ha

12
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Ha ha ha

13
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Ha ha ha

14
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Ha ha ha

15
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Ha ha ha

16
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Ha ha ha

17
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Hello

18
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I am Han Di Ni

19
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I am the monitor of this class

20
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Welcome

21
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I love you

22
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Don't move

23
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
My baby

24
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Who made you so angry?

25
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What's wrong?

26
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He turned off the machine again

27
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Who?

28
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Tang Zi Wei

29
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He must be with the ID

30
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Baby

31
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Everyone turns off the machine at midnight

32
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
He told me before

33
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
He won't turn off the machine for 24 hours

34
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
He will wait for the day

35
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
May I ask you

36
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Did he tell you in the daytime

37
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Or did he tell you in the evening?

38
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
In the evening

39
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What men say

40
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You can only believe half of what you say in the daytime

41
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What you say in the evening

42
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You can't believe it at all

43
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Bad people

44
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Baby, don't do this

45
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I feel so bad to see you like this

46
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Daddy

47
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I don't want to take a picture

48
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Why is it that I am so sad

49
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And my love emotions are controlled by others

50
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I am so upset that I can't sleep

51
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Then

52
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I will let Sister Ping give you a cup of milk, okay?

53
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I don't want to drink

54
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Do you know what is the most unfortunate thing in the world?

55
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What?

56
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's a house that has a house that even speaks

57
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's so annoying

58
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Baby, you can't say that

59
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Your breakfast is here

60
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Your flower room is really good after it's been renovated

61
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You can eat and enjoy the flowers

62
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's elegant

63
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Then you should come often

64
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Baby

65
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Come here

66
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Then you can enjoy it

67
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What's wrong?

68
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Look, this is from Wanjia

69
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You have to hang it well

70
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
If Jiajia becomes a famous house in the future

71
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
This painting is worth it

72
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
There is a card

73
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
We love

74
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Forever love

75
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Wanjia is really thoughtful

76
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Look, there is a sentence in the picture

77
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
This is the cat that looks at the world outside

78
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Who knows it's you

79
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I will always love your home

80
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Slow down, baby

81
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Can you keep up?

82
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
If you can't keep up, go back

83
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I will be the flower shop on the left

84
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Good morning

85
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Good morning

86
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Good morning

87
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You are still up?

88
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You got up so early on the weekend

89
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You want to go to the other side?

90
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
What other side?

91
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I will exercise and then protect you

92
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You got up so early on the weekend?

93
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yes, I exercise and then protect you every morning

94
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
This painting is really beautiful

95
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
There is a group of friends beside the big cat

96
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
This painting is from Wanjia

97
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
All are back eyes

98
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But I guess the big fat cat in the middle

99
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Is the one on the edge

100
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Like us

101
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yes, and the one with the big flower is you, Hua Youxi

102
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But I want to do this

103
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's dark, thin and cool

104
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You can tell by the back

105
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That this painting is really cool

106
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I tell you

107
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's a painting of the back

108
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
If you turn it back

109
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You can't see it, you know?

110
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I will hang it up

111
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Hang it here

112
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Okay

113
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Slow down

114
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If only I had one of these

115
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That would be great

116
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's my pleasure

117
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I will buy one

118
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I will make you breakfast

119
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I am so happy to have your breakfast

120
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Let's go

121
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Okay

122
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Don't you think I like the first one?

123
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Impossible

124
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Girls are afraid that I will refuse them

125
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So they will find a life-guard

126
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
If you fail, you will be so miserable

127
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You forgot

128
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
When I was chasing after the treasure

129
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I used this trick

130
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I was so close to the big cat

131
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And then I got scared

132
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Why are you so humble?

133
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Do you think girls all over the world like you?

134
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Coming

135
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Why are you looking at the door now?

136
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You just got up

137
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Why did you come so early?

138
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Why did you turn off the power last night?

139
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The power supply was in the car

140
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I forgot to take it

141
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What kind of attitude is this?

142
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You are very disappointed when you see me, right?

143
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You hope that the person outside the door is not me, right?

144
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
What are you talking about?

145
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Tang Zirui

146
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Don't be so bold

147
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You are not brave

148
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What did I do?

149
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You hid the case in the house, right?

150
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
He is my screenwriter Jackie

151
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
We talked about the script for a whole night last night

152
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This is Wu Anpo

153
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Hello

154
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Jackie, please go downstairs and buy me breakfast

155
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Ok

156
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Thank you

157
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Thank you

158
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Are you satisfied now?

159
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I did this because I care about you

160
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Unless you promise me not to look for ID

161
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Impossible

162
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I have to talk to him about signing the contract for the movie

163
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Why do you have to look for him?

164
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yu Luo is a young actress

165
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
She is very popular

166
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And she is a wild girl

167
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
She is not a professional actress

168
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Give me a reason not to owe her

169
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's because the actress from the class of science is too natural

170
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
There is no surprise at all

171
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But you listen to the voice of ID

172
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You know that she is a very emotional person

173
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And her fans are growing up on the straight line every day

174
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
We can aim at her fans

175
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And the ticket office will be guaranteed

176
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Aim at the fans?

177
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I think you are aiming at her

178
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You never give flowers to others

179
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I give her flowers because of work

180
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What? Are you afraid that I will run away with her?

181
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I never know what is afraid

182
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Wu Anpo

183
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Do you know what attracts me the most?

184
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's your self-confidence that you don't know where it comes from

185
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The pride of being ungrateful

186
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Of course, I am a spokesperson for myself

187
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Are you trying to blame me?

188
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
How dare I?

189
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You are such a perfect woman

190
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
How dare I say you are not good

191
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's just that...

192
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What is it?

193
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You don't have money anymore?

194
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I didn't say

195
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I just don't want to argue with you for three days

196
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I want to put all my energy on work

197
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yu Luo has so many celebrities

198
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Why do you have to blame her?

199
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Miss Wu, you are the successor of the five-star hotel

200
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Don't you understand this?

201
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Although there are many celebrities in the entertainment industry

202
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
But those who have a little potential have already been signed

203
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
The rest are all newbies without a foundation

204
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
We are just a small company

205
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
What do we use to compete with others?

206
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Like the free life of Eddie

207
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And to have so many fans

208
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That is simply indisputable

209
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I can't let myself miss this opportunity

210
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I understand

211
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You finally understand

212
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You are afraid of getting old

213
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
What?

214
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
The newbie in the entertainment industry is out

215
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You are afraid of the long-term future

216
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You were eliminated

217
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
So you chose to change your career

218
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You can't be a director

219
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You can only be a producer

220
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Right?

221
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Can I not answer you?

222
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Why don't you answer?

223
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Eddie lives in a Chinese-American family

224
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Isn't it just to get close to your sister first

225
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And then get close to you?

226
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Wu Anpu

227
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You really should learn how to get along with men

228
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I don't want to argue with you every day

229
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You didn't treat me like this before

230
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Don't you know?

231
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
All the love insurance period is only two months ahead

232
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I am very naive in this area

233
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I am not like you

234
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Like a professor who knows how to play with people's feelings

235
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Please, Miss

236
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Every time you talk

237
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You have to hurt someone before you can shut up

238
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You are too naughty

239
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I can't help it

240
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
This is my personality

241
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I won't do this newbie

242
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I can't make your movie anymore

243
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Are you serious?

244
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Of course

245
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I won't allow my first love to get hurt

246
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Okay

247
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
No problem

248
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Please close the door when you leave

249
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Tao Zirui

250
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Where are you going?

251
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Tao Zirui

252
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You

253
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I am interested in being the investor of this movie

254
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
The culture industry is still developing

255
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
If I can be the operator

256
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I will be able to get a lot of ads

257
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
That's great

258
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Does Amber know about this?

259
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
No need

260
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
She gave up first

261
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
If Eddie is the main character of this movie

262
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Then he must sign up for our company

263
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
If you are worried

264
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I can get two new clothing brands from Europe

265
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
To let you be the spokesperson

266
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Ding Dong

267
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I think this will affect our friendship with Amber

268
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It won't

269
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Amber has been a fan since childhood

270
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I am helping her get off the stage

271
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Don't worry

272
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
If there is any misunderstanding

273
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I can solve it

274
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Wan Jia

275
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Men can't be too rich to do big things

276
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
But that's good

277
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Eddie

278
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
We changed this boss

279
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I believe things will be easier in the future

280
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I don't think so

281
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I hate this kind of operation

282
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That the commercial packaging is more important than the cultural art

283
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You know

284
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
From my debut to now

285
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I am not on the business path

286
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
This doesn't match my image

287
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Miss Eddie

288
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You have to know

289
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
If you don't have talent, you will succeed in anything

290
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
The important thing is

291
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
To look at the funds behind it

292
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The relationship between people

293
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And the way you do things

294
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
But don't worry

295
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Ding Dong

296
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
He won't do any loss-making investment

297
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
As long as you sign up for our company

298
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I promise you

299
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
The annual income is three times the current one

300
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And in three years

301
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I will make you the first queen of the Chinese music industry

302
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It sounds really attractive

303
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I want to tell you

304
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I really am

305
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Not ready to sign up for a person

306
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
But I tell you

307
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I sing not to make money

308
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Why?

309
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I have no special hobbies since I was a child

310
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And nothing special

311
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Only when I sing

312
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I feel like I am a valuable person

313
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Once there was a person who was very important to me

314
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
He told me

315
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I can shine only when I sing

316
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
He made me remember the feeling of singing

317
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Because I am different from others

318
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
So I sing for the sake of singing

319
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Only singing can make me feel free

320
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It can make me feel alive

321
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It can make me feel like a special person

322
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
If there is any purpose in saying this

323
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I hope to sing for this person for the rest of my life

324
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
This is also the motivation I have been having for so many years

325
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Is this person your lover?

326
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
He is the person I fell in love with for the first time

327
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Women always have a strong will

328
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You are the same as Eber

329
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
If I am not wrong

330
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You are helping Eber to find out the news about us

331
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Really?

332
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Nothing can be hidden from you

333
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
We are all people who love art

334
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So we are very sensitive

335
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You are a painter

336
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You should have this kind of sense of detail

337
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Really?

338
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Maybe

339
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Actually I like you

340
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You were always trying to get justice from Eber

341
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
We are not siblings

342
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Friends and classmates are our most precious assets

343
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Yes

344
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
We are classmates from middle school and college

345
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I think that feeling is very real

346
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Can I ask you a question?

347
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Sure

348
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Why did you come to Mengjie's bar to sing?

349
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And why did you live in her house?

350
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Actually, are you doing this for someone in between us?

351
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Is it Kang Zirui?

352
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Or Hua Youxi?

353
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You must be helping Eber and Mei Bao to find out

354
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's not like that

355
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Actually I said it before

356
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I came back for my memory

357
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You don't believe me?

358
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
No

359
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I didn't expect that my appearance disturbed your first love

360
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm going

361
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Someone wants to give you a gift

362
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You found it

363
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Is it beautiful?

364
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's a name tag

365
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I've been saving it for a long time to buy it

366
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I want to give it to Hua Youxi

367
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
But I'm afraid she doesn't want it

368
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
She doesn't want me to be nice to her

369
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Men are like this

370
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You keep it for yourself

371
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
No

372
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I can't afford it

373
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
But Hua Youxi likes it

374
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Please give it to Eber

375
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Just say you gave it to Hua Youxi

376
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
No

377
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Sister

378
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Why not?

379
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It's pretty good

380
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
No

381
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
No

382
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Is he your first boyfriend?

383
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Is he your first boyfriend?

384
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
My first boyfriend is so handsome

385
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
He's so good

386
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So cute

387
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
What should I do?

388
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm coming

389
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I was thinking if you were here when I met you

390
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I didn't expect that

391
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You were waiting for me

392
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
This is the wallet that I gave you

393
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Is it beautiful?

394
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It's so expensive

395
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
How much do you like it?

396
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It's so good

397
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I like it

398
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Why are you so happy?

399
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
What are you doing?

400
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Can you be nice to her?

401
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Yes, be nice to me

402
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm afraid she can't accept it

403
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
She's writing a poem

404
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Adi

405
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You're a little too...

406
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I can't hide your heart

407
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I won't tell you now

408
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I have an interview tonight

409
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I have to buy flowers

410
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I'm leaving

411
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I'm fine

412
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I'm fine

413
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Where are you going?

414
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I'm staying at my house

415
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Wait

416
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
What are you doing?

417
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I'll put this in Meng

418
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I'm leaving

419
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
You're dirty

420
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
You're wearing a uniform

421
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
You didn't get the wallet

422
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Can you throw it away?

423
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You can take it

424
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I don't

425
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
You're such a fool

426
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You're so stingy

427
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
You gave it to me

428
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Goodbye

429
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You're a fake

430
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
You're a treasure

431
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Boss, buy flowers

432
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
How much?

433
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
A rose

434
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
You're a big star

435
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
This rose is for you

436
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
That's great

437
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I buy a rose every day

438
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I'll give you a rose

439
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
No problem

440
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It's my pleasure

441
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I'll buy it for you

442
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I'll buy it for you

443
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I'll buy it for you

444
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I'll buy it for you

445
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I'll buy it for you

446
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Aren't you going to sing tonight?

447
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
No

448
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I have an interview at the radio tonight

449
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
You're a painting of Boss Zhen

450
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
You're out of painting

451
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
No matter if this painting is famous

452
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It's very important to me

453
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
You're like a big cat

454
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
This one?

455
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Yes, I'm at home every day

456
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I'm with everyone

457
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Maybe I'm just a person who likes to wait

458
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I know you like Wan Jia

459
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Even if she has a boyfriend

460
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
You can fight with Yin Dong Chen

461
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Yin Dong Chen

462
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Yin Dong is the prince of every girl's heart

463
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Being with him is always Wan Jia's dream

464
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Now it's finally realized

465
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
How can I break your heart?

466
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
In fact, when I see her happy when she is in love

467
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm happy for her

468
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Wan Jia is stupid

469
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
You are even more stupid than him

470
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Don't you think that every day

471
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
You are watching someone you like

472
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Watching her come and go in your life

473
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
She is always worried

474
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
In fact, you can be bold

475
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Even if it's a failure

476
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
You won't regret

477
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Yin Dong is a very good person

478
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
What he can give Wan Jia is definitely happiness

479
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And what I can give Wan Jia

480
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Is just a little effort

481
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
You are not sure if you can give her happiness

482
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Won't you take the first step of the hot?

483
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
In fact, you can be a big brother even if you can't be a couple

484
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
After all, in the name of friendship

485
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Isn't it also very happy to love someone?

486
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Is it okay to be just a blue-eyed friend?

487
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Are you tired?

488
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Maybe you just lack the courage to fight against the strong

489
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
In fact, I haven't signed an agent yet

490
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
If you are willing

491
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I want to ask you to be my agent

492
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Take over my acting career

493
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
So you won't worry about having no capital and high income

494
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
You can also have the capital to chase Wan Jia

495
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Your condition sounds very attractive

496
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
But your joke is a little big

497
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I'm telling the truth

498
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Because I don't think you are a person with too much power

499
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
If I give myself to you

500
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I won't be afraid of you taking me as a commodity

501
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
And you can give me a flower every day

502
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
But I don't know what the girl is thinking

503
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Thank you for caring so much about me and Wan Jia

504
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Who is this?

505
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Who is this?

506
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Youxi

507
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Adi, you are lonely

508
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Come to me

509
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I'm going to the radio station to do the interview

510
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Take your time

511
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I'll leave as soon as I come

512
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Do you want to know why I broke into your world?

513
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
You just have to listen before you receive the sound

514
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Tonight is a big night

515
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Especially you

516
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Me?

517
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I was not here just now

518
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
What are you doing?

519
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Nothing

520
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Stop pretending

521
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You are so funny

522
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Ok, back to the studio

523
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Ok, back to the studio

524
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Let's ask a young popular idol

525
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
The most sincere singer, Miss Adi

526
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Hello, everyone

527
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I'm Adi

528
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Since the last time Miss Adi talked about her first love in the show

529
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Many listeners sent messages to ask Miss Adi

530
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
What kind of first love did you experience?

531
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And how did this first love bring Miss Adi to the path of singing?

532
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
You know, little girls are a little bit self-centered

533
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I always thought that I was inferior to others

534
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I was a little bit more loving than my classmates

535
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Because I was not confident

536
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
So my classmates always mocked me

537
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
And gave me a name

538
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Called the toothless girl

539
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Toothless girl?

540
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I remember that my student days were spent in transfer

541
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Then I went to Guangzhou to study middle school

542
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
There I met a person who was very important to me

543
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
At that time, everyone laughed at me

544
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Only her

545
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
After listening to my singing

546
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
She kept encouraging me

547
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
To keep going

548
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
She told me

549
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
When I sing

550
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I shine like a star

551
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
She also told me

552
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I look the best when I sing

553
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Can you believe it?

554
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Before this, no one has ever said I was good-looking

555
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I knew it from that time

556
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I was a good-looking girl

557
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I knew it from that time

558
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I have my own unique point

559
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I know that because of my singing

560
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I can get the respect and love of others

561
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It was also from that time

562
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I consciously trained my singing

563
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I think she should be a very good person

564
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Correct

565
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
At that time, many girls in our school were in love with her

566
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
And she told me

567
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
My talent is my shining point

568
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Gold will shine

569
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
At that time

570
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
There will be more and more people who like you

571
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Then I ask her

572
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Is this boy your first love?

573
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
He is the first boy I fell in love with

574
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Did he fall in love with you?

575
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I think

576
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
He just likes to listen to me sing

577
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And with my appearance at that time

578
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
This may only be a memory

579
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Later, their family moved to Shanghai

580
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Until he left

581
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
You have never confessed to him

582
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I dare not confess to him directly

583
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
My dad was scared

584
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I don't know

585
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And I'm afraid

586
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
This will destroy my first love

587
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
This is really a pity

588
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
This should be considered fate

589
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
No

590
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Because I met him again in Shanghai recently

591
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Hello

592
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
It's fate

593
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Fate

594
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Let him appear in front of me again

595
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
So I want to take every opportunity

596
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
To enter his world

597
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Did he recognize you?

598
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
No

599
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
But he is still as good as ever

600
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
So the dream of love is still for love

601
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I always believe

602
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
A woman

603
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
The first man she met in her first love

604
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Will deeply affect her faith in love

605
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
And her opinion

606
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Then I will ask you boldly

607
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Have you had a close relationship with this man?

608
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Yes

609
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
We used to hold hands

610
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Until dawn

611
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
What a pure love

612
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
No wonder your singing is so touching

613
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
But he doesn't recognize me anymore

614
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And he should have a girlfriend he likes

615
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
You always think about the one you don't forget

616
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
But don't know you

617
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
This is really cruel

618
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Then are you going to give up?

619
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
No

620
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I will never give up a person

621
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Who gave me the courage to chase dreams

622
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
He gave me confidence

623
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
So

624
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I decided to pursue him

625
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
The first man to love is going to pursue

626
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
What kind of handsome man should this man be?

627
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
He is the first man I have ever loved

628
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
So

629
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I will never forget him

630
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I will never forget him

631
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Han Bingyi

632
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Han Bingyi

633
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Did you hear that?

634
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Yiting

635
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Yiting

636
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
No

637
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
This is my game

638
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
How could Anlin not be me?

639
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
He is my brother

640
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I am not a traitor

641
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Is this true?

642
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Of course

643
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I checked everything you asked me to

644
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
This family was rented by a couple

645
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
No one rents in between them

646
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
It's always empty

647
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
No wonder

648
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
This Adi

649
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
He lives in our house

650
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
He must live in Dingyi's room

651
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
According to what you said

652
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It's very likely that it's for Dingyi

653
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
It seems that Adi is very serious about our Dingyi

654
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
This news is too exciting

655
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
There should be few people who can sleep well last night

656
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Oh, right

657
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Yesterday Meng said you and Adi couldn't go home

658
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Are you two together?

659
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
What did you say?

660
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
She didn't go home yesterday

661
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Tell me honestly

662
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
How did everyone see this?

663
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
They were all happy for you

664
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
My brother also said

665
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
If you really become Adi's agent

666
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
You will be in trouble

667
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Nonsense

668
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Then

669
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Adi sings in the bar

670
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
And he lives in your house at night

671
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
You have discussed it before, right?

672
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I really didn't

673
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
How could you think

674
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
You don't believe me

675
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
The girl's family's healer

676
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Don't you believe this?

677
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I don't believe it

678
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Did you forget the time?

679
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Why can't I make it clear to you?

680
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I really don't have any impression on her

681
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Really?

682
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
You don't have any impression?

683
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Really

684
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
She is a celebrity because she is a celebrity

685
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
You are so heartless

686
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
You call Adi

687
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
From last night to now

688
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
The phone is off

689
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Today is Saturday

690
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Why don't you go to class?

691
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Of course not

692
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Today the school basketball team is playing a game

693
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Moreover

694
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Now the girls must be

695
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Thinking about yesterday's Adi and Adi

696
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I said what's so good about their first love?

697
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Wanjiang, are you jealous?

698
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I'm not jealous

699
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I'm not jealous

700
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I don't have a boyfriend

701
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I just think

702
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
We finally figured out

703
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Why Adi entered our life

704
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Right?

705
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I think Adi is so lucky

706
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
To meet a guy who only sleeps with him

707
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Oh my god

708
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
This kind of first love is unforgettable

709
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
How many girls will be envious of him?

710
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I even want to choose him

711
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Who is he?

712
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Didn't you listen to Adi's interview last night?

713
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
You don't even know about the love song

714
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Did I listen to the interview?

715
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Am I supposed to have a boyfriend?

716
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I just think

717
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Han Dingyi is a real beauty

718
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
If one day

719
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I break up with Kang Ziyu

720
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Then I must be with Han Dingyi

721
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
If one day

722
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I break up with Hua Yuexi

723
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Then I must be with Yiding too

724
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Goodbye

725
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Yesterday

726
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
The principal and the principal

727
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Handed their hands to me

728
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
To praise me for my contribution to this event

729
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Now we just need to investigate

730
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
If Adi can be proven right

731
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Can you come to me first?

732
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I'm not sure

733
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Yes, I know you are not sure

734
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Dingyi, you have

735
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
You are first love

736
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Then the two of you will sing a song together

737
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
And finish

738
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
How can this be?

739
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I have no special relationship with him

740
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
How can it be?

741
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Didn't they all admit it?

742
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Be a man

743
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Right?

744
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
They were very generous

745
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
They called me early in the morning

746
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
And said they were coming today

747
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
What?

748
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
That's great

749
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I just want to make it clear to him

750
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
You can't

751
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
If you say it

752
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
He will be embarrassed

753
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
How can you not make it clear?

754
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Do you have a girlfriend now?

755
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Yes

756
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Maybe it's Mei Bao after a few months

757
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Did I ask you?

758
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I asked Dingyi

759
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
You ask, ask, ask

760
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
It doesn't matter if you have a girlfriend

761
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I really didn't sign the paperwork until dawn

762
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Hello Miss Ai Di

763
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Welcome, welcome

764
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I'm Lan Tian

765
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
The planner of this event

766
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
We will go to the principal's office later

767
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
To sit down

768
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
There are several senior executives

769
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Who want to meet you

770
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I want to talk to Dingyi

771
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
In private, okay?

772
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Of course, of course

773
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Youxi

774
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Take them to the principal's office later

775
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Okay, okay

776
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
You guys talk

777
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
You guys talk first

778
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
How did you turn off your phone last night?

779
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I think my impulsive

780
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Will bring you trouble

781
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I didn't think about how to face you

782
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
So I chose to calm down

783
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Your joke

784
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Is too big

785
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
You think

786
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I was confessed by you in the program

787
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Is your confession a joke?

788
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I don't doubt this is true or false

789
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Ai Di

790
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
To be honest

791
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I don't remember what you said

792
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
People's memories are like sand

793
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Always like

794
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Remember those happy things

795
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Those unhappy things

796
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Always choose to forget

797
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I think I was wrong

798
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
You may not remember me

799
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I really didn't mean to forget anything

800
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I didn't lose my memory

801
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I really didn't lose my memory

802
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
But I have no impression at all

803
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Do you think I was making up rumors in the program?

804
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I don't know what to do

805
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I don't know what to do

806
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I don't know what to do

807
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I don't know what to do

808
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I don't know what to do

809
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I don't know what to do

810
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I don't know what to do

811
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I don't know what to do

812
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I don't know what to do

813
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I don't know what to do

814
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I don't know what to do

815
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I don't know what to do

816
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I don't know what to do

817
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I don't know what to do

818
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I don't know what to do

819
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I don't know what to do

820
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I don't know what to do

821
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I don't know what to do

822
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I don't know what to do

823
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I don't know what to do

824
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I don't know what to do

825
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I don't know what to do

826
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I don't know what to do

827
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I don't know what to do

828
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
There's a saying

829
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Don't say anything

830
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
You will not hesitate

831
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
To reach out

832
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Be the wind for me

833
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Be the rain for me

834
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Teach me to stop

835
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And move forward

836
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I've been hurt

837
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
And hurt

838
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I will have you with me

839
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
To cry and drink

840
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Let's shout together

841
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Let's keep our mouth shut

842
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Let's stay on the street

843
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
We will go to the end

844
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
We don't need any reason

845
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
We've been through too much

846
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
That's what I'm afraid of

847
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
We will go to the end

848
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
We don't need any reason

849
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
So every time we need it

850
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
We will go to the end

851
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:09,000
We don't need any reason

852
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
We will go to the end
