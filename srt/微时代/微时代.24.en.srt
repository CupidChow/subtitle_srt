00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Translated by Releska

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Do you want to talk to me after I leave?

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What are you doing here?

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Aren't you already broken up with me?

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I think I want to make it clear to you.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't want to be like the Yindong team's Wanjia.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I don't want to be like the Meibo team's Tony.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But I don't know why.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The farther I drive away from you, the more confused I am.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I drive back without knowing it.

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Maybe I just want to see you.

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
See if you're okay.

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm not feeling well.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But from now on, I'll get better.

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm glad you're okay.

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Then I'm relieved.

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Now, I feel like the broken person between us.

48
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Sick.

49
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I must get rid of it.

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It hurts, but I'll get better.

51
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,680
Everyone must have a real chance

52
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,680
to find out who the most exciting of them is.

53
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:45,680
But a match of skills must not simply be a mere lastowner's forte.

54
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,040
It must be someone who holds something dear.

55
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,840
That's why it is sent to a horrible freeloader.

56
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,600
You no longer act on fire.

57
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,500
It is still life time.

58
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,500
this situation.

59
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
Last time we were there,

60
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
dirty men were 화� CHARGE

61
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,500
talking about hisumping

62
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,500
because he had more other things to worry about.

63
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,500
He threw them into the recurrence of junkie

64
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,260
and threw them into the history into the rather

65
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,500
That sounds strange.

66
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:29,100
Grey,

67
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
I can't eat it.

68
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
What's wrong?

69
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,500
It's too salty.

70
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,500
Is it?

71
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,500
No.

72
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
I'll go get some water.

73
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,500
I think so.

74
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,500
Sorry.

75
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
I was just cooking.

76
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
It's okay. It's good.

77
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,500
You're so rude.

78
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,500
How can you let my brother lie to you?

79
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,500
If it's too salty, don't eat it.

80
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
I really think it's delicious.

81
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Weiwei, your dish today is really not good.

82
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
I saw you were not in the kitchen.

83
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
What's on your mind?

84
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
My brother broke up with Amber.

85
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,500
He broke up?

86
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
That's a big deal.

87
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
I'll send it to the Internet.

88
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
You're a bastard.

89
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Breaking up is not necessarily a bad thing.

90
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,500
How can you not miss it?

91
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,500
Again?

92
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
You're so rude.

93
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,500
Eat your food.

94
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
How can I eat this?

95
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
It's salty and meaty.

96
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,500
I'm going to eat it all.

97
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,500
I'm done.

98
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,500
Mengjie, if you're too lazy, don't eat it.

99
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,500
Don't force yourself.

100
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
Weiwei, it's okay.

101
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,500
I'm in the same boat with the first.

102
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,500
It's not a problem.

103
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
Is it better today?

104
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Are you still thinking about your brother?

105
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,500
It's okay.

106
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,500
I just feel like I'm not doing well.

107
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,500
It's a pity.

108
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,500
Don't think too much.

109
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,500
I'll go with you to Sanxing.

110
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,500
I bought two tickets for the tour.

111
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
Would you like to go with me?

112
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,500
Okay, of course I would.

113
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,500
Pretty girl,

114
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,500
seeing that Amber's mother is getting married to Fu Hao,

115
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
I envy you.

116
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
If I want to marry Fu Hao,

117
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,500
I have to wait until today.

118
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,500
Your father is a Fu Hao.

119
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Don't make this kind of joke with me.

120
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,500
If my father is Fu Hao,

121
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,500
you won't let me recognize him.

122
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
Then you're not going to be able to live without him.

123
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,500
I'm not going to live without him.

124
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,500
Come on, I'm not going to live without him.

125
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,500
You're going to be a Fu Hao.

126
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,500
I'm not going to live without him.

127
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,500
You're just a poor mother and a father.

128
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,500
Who do you choose between a poor mother and a father?

129
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,500
According to the normal logic,

130
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,500
I must choose a father.

131
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,500
I don't want a poor mother.

132
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
I knew you were a vain and vain woman.

133
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Who let me have a face of a vain and vain woman?

134
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,500
How did I give birth to you?

135
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
Mom, I don't feel right about your mood lately.

136
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,500
What's wrong? No more dates?

137
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,500
No.

138
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
Your mother has you and your brother.

139
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
And your mother is old and doesn't want to fall in love.

140
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,500
Who says you're old?

141
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,500
Let me tell you.

142
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,500
If I had been born twenty years earlier,

143
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,500
if you weren't my mother,

144
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,500
we would have had a love affair.

145
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,500
What are you talking about?

146
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,500
All right, all right, don't be unhappy.

147
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,500
How about this?

148
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,500
If you're free tomorrow,

149
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,500
you can go on a date with your most handsome son.

150
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,500
That's a good idea.

151
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,500
Let's go to the music school.

152
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,500
Let's go.

153
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,500
Let's go.

154
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Where are you going? It's so long.

155
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,500
What are you doing?

156
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
What else are you doing?

157
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,500
We're playing with the pirate ship.

158
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,500
You're playing with this?

159
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,500
We're playing with the minibus.

160
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,500
Let's go to the music school.

161
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,500
Over there.

162
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Who's calling me?

163
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Mengjie, you have a heart.

164
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,500
Youxi.

165
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,500
If we hadn't come here,

166
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
we wouldn't have found you.

167
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,500
Mom, Youxi, why are you here?

168
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
Why are we here?

169
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,500
It's your bad idea again, Youxi.

170
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,500
What are you talking about?

171
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,500
It's such a nice day.

172
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,500
Do you believe in a date?

173
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,500
Do you believe in our date?

174
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,500
All right, I'm doing this for you and my brother.

175
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,500
How about this?

176
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,500
You two can date in a fair and just way.

177
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,500
It's a painful thing to do.

178
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Dingyi, your mom is so bitter.

179
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,500
Since we've met,

180
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,500
you won't choose us as the light bulb, right?

181
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,500
Of course not.

182
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,500
Then let's go on a date.

183
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
Let's go.

184
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,500
Let's go.

185
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,500
Aunt.

186
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
Don't call me aunt.

187
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
I used to call you that

188
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,500
to show my daughter's respect.

189
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,500
I'm not close to you.

190
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
Aunt.

191
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,500
No.

192
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,500
Mr. Gao.

193
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,500
Why are you here?

194
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
I came here this time

195
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,500
to take my daughter's things

196
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,500
as a mother.

197
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,500
Xu Hui.

198
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,500
Cup, camera, and handbag.

199
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,500
Check around.

200
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,500
Take all the things of a girl.

201
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,500
Okay.

202
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
Amber asked you to come here?

203
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,500
Yes.

204
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,500
She called me

205
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,500
and said she had broken up with you.

206
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
She doesn't want to see you again.

207
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,500
She doesn't have to hide from me.

208
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
This house is hers.

209
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,500
I can move out.

210
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,500
If you say so,

211
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,500
why haven't you moved out?

212
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,500
Do you think

213
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,500
my daughter will come back?

214
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,500
I don't think so.

215
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,500
I just want

216
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
to feel her breath again.

217
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Feel her breath?

218
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,500
What a self-written, self-directed,

219
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,500
self-righteous hero.

220
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,500
What a pity.

221
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,500
Your story with my daughter

222
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,500
is destined to have no result.

223
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,500
Mr. Gao.

224
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,500
I've packed up.

225
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Okay.

226
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Let's go.

227
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,500
I don't want to stay here anymore.

228
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Young man.

229
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,500
It's your pleasure

230
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,500
to fall in love with my daughter.

231
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,500
But for my daughter,

232
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,500
it's a big stain in her life.

233
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,500
This stain

234
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,500
needs a long time

235
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
to wash off.

236
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,500
I'm warning you now.

237
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,500
From now on,

238
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
don't get into my daughter's world.

239
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,500
Her world

240
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,500
can be very clean.

241
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,500
Remember that.

242
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Why are you here?

243
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,500
Amber told me

244
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,500
that she asked you to bring something.

245
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,500
I didn't believe it.

246
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
I didn't expect you to come.

247
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,500
Get in the car and wait for me.

248
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,500
Okay.

249
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Do you have something to say to me?

250
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,500
Are you here

251
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,500
just to see if I'm here?

252
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,500
I have a bill to pay you.

253
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,500
Thank you for

254
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,500
tearing off the fake cheque

255
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,500
in front of Amber that day.

256
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,500
I promised you.

257
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,500
It's okay.

258
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,500
I'll give you this show.

259
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,500
I also want to leave a good impression on my daughter.

260
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,500
Why did you suddenly

261
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,500
get angry with your mother?

262
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Didn't you care about her?

263
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
You guessed wrong again.

264
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,500
I do care about her

265
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,500
more than you think.

266
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,500
And

267
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
I really really really really like

268
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,500
the feeling that my daughter likes me.

269
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,500
You won't be angry with me, will you?

270
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,500
I've thought about it.

271
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,500
I can deny you as my ex-wife.

272
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,500
But I won't let my daughter

273
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,500
deny her real mother.

274
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
Your wedding with Yin Youjing

275
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,500
will be the focus of the whole weekend.

276
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,500
Of course I won't go.

277
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,500
But I promised you

278
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
to let Amber be your bridesmaid.

279
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
Then no one will be

280
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
in the way of the wedding.

281
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,500
You can also be

282
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,500
the princess of Mrs. Ying.

283
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,500
Is this the gift

284
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,500
you gave me for the wedding?

285
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,500
You are not the only woman

286
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
I've ever felt sorry for.

287
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,500
But at least I've been

288
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
very affectionate to you.

289
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,500
This feeling

290
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,500
is not good.

291
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,500
You really let me go.

292
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,500
You don't love me anymore.

293
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,500
You don't love me anymore.

294
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,500
Is this how you treat

295
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,500
the dream-maker?

296
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,500
I'll get the ring.

297
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,500
This way, please.

298
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Please sit.

299
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
Yingdong.

300
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,500
I'm here to get the ring.

301
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
Do you want to buy something?

302
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,500
I'm here to get the ring my mom left me.

303
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,500
Really?

304
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,500
Are you really going to give that ring to Wanjia?

305
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,500
It's none of your business.

306
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
You still don't listen to your dad.

307
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
Do you really have to be so stubborn?

308
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Maybe one day he'll need you to take care of him.

309
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
My relationship with my dad is like this.

310
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,500
Who is it because of?

311
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,500
It seems that you still despise me.

312
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,500
Do you really want me to leave your dad?

313
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,500
I used to.

314
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,500
But now I'm not so naive.

315
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
You're holding the ring my dad gave you for 6 million.

316
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Will you leave this money?

317
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,500
I thought you saw through me.

318
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
I was mistaken.

319
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,500
Do you think I'm your girlfriend?

320
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,500
A woman who can be caught with a ring?

321
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
I won't attend your wedding.

322
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
I know.

323
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,500
Your dad doesn't mind.

324
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,500
How could I mind?

325
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,500
Anyway, I took everything I wanted.

326
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,500
I'm sorry.

327
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,500
Stop!

328
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Why are you taking pictures of me?

329
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,500
I usually take pictures of the pretty ones.

330
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,500
You're so rude.

331
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,500
Really?

332
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,500
I don't know.

333
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,500
Take a picture of me first.

334
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,500
Or I'll smash your phone.

335
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,500
Why are you so fierce?

336
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
Fine. I'll pay you back.

337
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,500
You're awake.

338
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,500
See you next time.

339
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
Are you crazy?

340
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Miss.

341
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,500
Here's a package for you.

342
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,500
Package?

343
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,500
Who sent it?

344
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,500
I don't know. I don't have the address.

345
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,500
Here you are.

346
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,500
Here you are.

347
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,460
Taehyun Power

348
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,500
And the way of my love

349
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,100
I'm already on the plane.

350
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,140
I'm sorry.

351
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,580
I broke my promise.

352
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,260
I didn't take you away.

353
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,020
I can't stay with you.

354
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,020
But please remember,

355
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,980
no matter where I am,

356
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,380
I'll always miss you.

357
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,380
I'm sorry.

358
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,500
I'm an unworthy mother.

359
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,180
I brought you into this world,

360
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,580
but I didn't have time to see you grow up,

361
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,660
and I couldn't see you get married.

362
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,340
This ring is a dowry for you.

363
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,820
I wish you happiness.

364
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,900
Love your mother.

365
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,620
Goodbye.

366
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,820
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

367
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,860
It seems like we really have a connection.

368
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,420
I was thinking,

369
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,900
if I called you,

370
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,260
would you call me back?

371
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,860
But you really called me.

372
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,820
Where are you?

373
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,820
What?

374
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,020
Do you miss me?

375
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,460
Did you receive that ring?

376
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,460
Do you know?

377
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,100
You're the only one in this world.

378
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,700
I'm willing to give it to you

379
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,780
from my pocket.

380
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,700
Answer me. Where are you?

381
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,700
At the airport.

382
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,420
I'm boarding soon.

383
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,780
Wait for me. I'll be there soon.

384
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,340
It's too late.

385
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,860
I'll be boarding in two minutes.

386
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,740
You can change your name.

387
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,340
It seems like you don't know me enough.

388
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,340
I'm more interested in you.

389
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,300
I won't change my decision

390
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,500
for anyone else.

391
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,540
Don't leave.

392
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,740
Stay with me, okay?

393
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,220
Don't cry.

394
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,420
Remember,

395
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,780
your body is my blood.

396
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,300
Don't be as strong as your mother.

397
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,700
And,

398
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,180
don't marry a man who will make you suffer.

399
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,460
You won't be happy.

400
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,180
I don't want to hear that.

401
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,740
Stay with me, okay?

402
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,820
Baby,

403
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,220
I'll always remember

404
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,740
that I have an outstanding woman like you.

405
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,780
I love you.

406
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,340
I love you.

407
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,500
I love you.

408
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,100
I love you so much.

409
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,340
I love you.

410
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:23,020
Why do you agree to

411
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,620
join our этоGa neuraden maker?

412
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,580
Because you're our boss.

413
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,220
So we shouldn't stop and keep meeting you.

414
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,060
The Li Ze product was saved in my bank account.

415
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,700
The money was taken away by Gao Jie.

416
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,940
The product was sold for 45 days.

417
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,260
Mr Ying signed a guarantee.

418
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,940
I'm still in the process of retirement.

419
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,780
I can't afford to lose anything.

420
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,060
How is that possible?

421
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,780
We're already married.

422
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,140
I'll satisfy her with whatever she wants.

423
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,940
There must be a misunderstanding.

424
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,940
I have to find her.

425
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,380
The number you have dialed is power off.

426
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,540
Please call again later.

427
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,300
Dad, don't call.

428
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,900
He must be making money.

429
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,540
I've lived in this house for so many years.

430
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,660
I've never believed in anything.

431
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,060
Why did I have to do this?

432
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,020
Why did I have to do this?

433
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,660
I have to find out.

434
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,820
I have to find out.

435
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,700
Mr Chen.

436
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:39,380
What responsibility do we have to bear?

437
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,460
From a legal perspective,

438
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:45,460
if a person is killed or killed,

439
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:49,140
we have to bear all the losses.

440
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,740
How much do we have to pay?

441
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,900
It's hard to say.

442
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,260
If we really have to pay,

443
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,260
I'm afraid it's not a small amount.

444
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,180
Mr Ying, if we can't find another support,

445
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,380
we'll be in trouble soon.

446
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,500
Why did you kill me?

447
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,980
I'm so good to her.

448
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,300
I'll satisfy her with whatever she wants.

449
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,500
I'll totally...

450
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,700
Dad, I'm sorry.

451
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,260
What?

452
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:23,020
Would you buy her money with this much financial money?

453
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,260
I'm sorry.

454
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,140
But, ma...

455
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,420
Ma, let me explain that.

456
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,980
She told me that your family benefit money should come from

457
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,860
keeping your marriage.

458
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,300
I had to explain, right?

459
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,140
I didn't have any other way to make it up to you.

460
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,780
I can't move.

461
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,180
I need to call an ambulance.

462
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,500
Call an ambulance.

463
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,940
Hurry up! Call an ambulance!

464
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,620
Call an ambulance!

465
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,100
How is Ning Youyin?

466
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,820
She came out of the operating room

467
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,820
and was immediately treated.

468
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,900
I heard she hasn't woken up yet.

469
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,300
But her body is already paralyzed.

470
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,540
Do you want to go to the hospital?

471
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,900
There are also some mental health problems.

472
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,780
I'll borrow money from you.

473
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,580
The financial product that Ning Youyin

474
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,460
guaranteed for Gao Qi is in big trouble.

475
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,100
I advise you not to go to this mess.

476
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,820
Gao Qi is your ex-wife.

477
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,100
Ning Youyin's current mood

478
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,420
must have a lot of unpleasant words.

479
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,580
Even if she's in a coma and doesn't scold you,

480
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,780
everyone should be able to avoid her.

481
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,300
Won't the bank lend her?

482
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,780
The financial product that Ning Youyin

483
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,700
is in big trouble.

484
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,020
Which bank dares to save this lazy man?

485
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,620
Come on.

486
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,620
Let's have a drink to celebrate.

487
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,100
If this continues,

488
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,260
we'll all drag the British into the poverty line.

489
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,900
The Indian is still small.

490
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,580
We can't suppress this situation.

491
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,420
Let's all

492
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,580
take advantage of the British.

493
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:10,340
You sound like you're taking advantage of the situation.

494
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,980
Come on.

495
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,780
Let's drink.

496
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,340
Hello, Minghui.

497
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,740
How is my father?

498
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,060
What did the doctor say?

499
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,860
The doctor said that the president might have been stressed

500
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,420
and the blood pressure will rise.

501
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,380
Plus, he has a high blood pressure.

502
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,340
Although he's not in danger of life,

503
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,460
he still needs to be watched.

504
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,180
How's the company doing?

505
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,220
The bank just called.

506
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,100
They said that Mr Wu has helped the president pay off some of his money.

507
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,020
So the bank decided to

508
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,740
extend the company's one-month payment period.

509
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,460
Mr Wu?

510
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,260
Who is Mr Wu?

511
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,420
He's the boss of the Wu Group.

512
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,860
I don't know.

513
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,940
How could it be him?

514
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,220
I'm also curious.

515
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,820
Mr Ying, I don't know what to say.

516
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,380
Just say it.

517
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,340
I heard from Mr Lin's assistant that Mr Lin

518
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:30,140
saw Gao Qi and Wu Yiting having dinner together at a restaurant.

519
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,220
But Gao Qi disappeared the next day.

520
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,500
I wonder if there's something wrong with it.

521
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,220
Okay, I got it.

522
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,460
Don't let my father hear about this.

523
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,420
He's not well. I don't want to affect him.

524
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,420
Okay, I got it.

525
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,540
Anna?

526
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,580
Why are you here?

527
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,020
I thought you were Wan Jia.

528
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,620
I happen to have something to do.

529
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,500
Here.

530
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,780
WAN JIA

531
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,060
I heard from Witte

532
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,660
about such a big thing happening in your family.

533
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,100
I have to explain it to you.

534
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,740
I really don't know how much Gao Qi lied to your father.

535
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,140
If I knew, I would definitely tell you.

536
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:41,060
Though this bad girl who lied to your father is my mother,

537
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,060
But you should know me.

538
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,060
I'm not that kind of person.

539
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,060
Take this ring back.

540
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,060
Your mom gave it to you for your wedding.

541
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,060
Since my dad gave it to her,

542
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,060
she has the right to decide who to give it to.

543
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,060
I don't want such a dirty gift.

544
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,060
Besides,

545
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,060
your family is in trouble.

546
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,060
Keep it.

547
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,060
Maybe it will help you.

548
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,060
This ring is useless.

549
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,060
I need 200 million.

550
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,060
200 million?

551
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,060
That much?

552
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,060
Gao Qi is really cruel.

553
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,060
She took away our 200 million in a few months.

554
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,060
To be honest, I admire her.

555
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,060
I'm sorry.

556
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,060
I didn't expect her to be like this.

557
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,060
Your dad paid the bank for the ring today.

558
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,060
Do you know that?

559
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,060
My dad paid your dad?

560
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,060
He didn't tell me that.

561
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,060
Okay, let me ask you.

562
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:55,060
Did Gao Qi meet your dad alone the day before he ran away?

563
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,060
The day before...

564
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,060
Right.

565
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,060
They went to Kang Zirui's house

566
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,060
to get my stuff.

567
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,060
You're not suspecting that my dad

568
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,060
and Gao Qi colluded to cheat your dad's money, right?

569
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,060
Your dad is definitely not that kind of person.

570
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,060
Please believe me.

571
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,060
Tell me who else I can trust now.

572
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,060
I really regret why I ignored my dad

573
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,060
and didn't go back to the company.

574
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,060
I ruined my dad's life.

575
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,060
If I had stopped him,

576
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,060
things wouldn't have turned out like this.

577
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,060
I'm sorry.

578
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,060
Xindong, don't be like this.

579
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,060
No one wants this to happen.

580
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,060
How about this?

581
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,060
I'll go and find Wan Jia.

582
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,060
She must be very worried about you.

583
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,060
No need.

584
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,060
I can't help you with her background.

585
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,060
No one can help me now.

586
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,060
I'm sorry.

587
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,060
I'm sorry.

588
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,060
No one can help me now.

589
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,060
Xindong,

590
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,060
can you stop being so pessimistic?

591
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,060
Life itself is not perfect.

592
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,060
The strong don't have pain.

593
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,060
They won't be affected by pain.

594
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,060
I hope you can be strong.

595
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,060
I've always admired you

596
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,060
since I was a child.

597
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,060
Because you won't be defeated by anything.

598
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,060
In my heart,

599
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:29,060
you'll always be a strong and tall person.

600
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,060
Don't worry.

601
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:39,060
You'll overcome all these things.

602
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,060
Will you overcome them with me?

603
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,060
Yes, I will.

604
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,060
I've neglected her.

605
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,060
She knows me so well.

606
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,060
It seems I'm really wrong.

607
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,060
What do you mean?

608
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:21,060
I thought I found the real owner of this ring.

609
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:24,060
But I didn't expect her owner to be with me.

610
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,060
I'm sorry.

611
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,060
I want you to face it with me.

612
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:59,060
I met a man

613
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:02,060
who liked her

614
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:06,060
On the other side of the sea

615
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,060
Weiwei,

616
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,060
don't be busy.

617
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,060
Love is so cold

618
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,060
It's not easy to be normal

619
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,060
It's getting cold

620
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,060
It's raining today.

621
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,060
We got up so early.

622
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,060
Let's go to the cinema.

623
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:24,060
I heard Zhou Jingchi's play is very good.

624
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,060
The cinema?

625
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,060
I don't think so.

626
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,060
I went with Jiajia.

627
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,060
How about this?

628
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,060
Let's go there together.

629
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,060
Okay.

630
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:40,060
But I'm afraid I'll show up when I'm with you.

631
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,060
What will you show?

632
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:47,060
When we're in love.

633
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,060
How long are you going to keep it?

634
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,060
You're really not afraid of Jiajia?

635
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,060
Why should I be afraid of Jiajia?

636
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,060
What?

637
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,060
Are you the one who's very happy with me?

638
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,060
Maybe Jiajia will bless us.

639
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,060
What are you laughing at?

640
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:19,060
No, I just suddenly feel very happy.

641
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,060
I like you.

642
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,060
I like your voice.

643
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,060
I like you.

644
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,060
I like you.

645
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,060
I like you.

646
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,060
I like you.

647
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,060
I like you.

648
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,060
I like you.

649
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,060
I like you.

650
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,060
I like you.

651
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,060
I like you.

652
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,060
I like you.

653
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,060
I like you.

654
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,060
I like you.

655
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,060
I like you.

656
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,060
I like you.

657
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,060
I like you.

658
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,060
I like you.

659
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,060
I like you.

660
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,060
I like you.

661
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,060
I like you.

662
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,060
I like you.

663
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,060
I like you.

664
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,060
I like you.

665
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,060
I like you.

666
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,060
I like you.

667
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,060
I like you.

668
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,060
I like you.

669
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,060
I like you.

670
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,060
I like you.

671
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,060
I like you.

672
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,060
I like you.

673
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,060
I like you.

674
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,060
I like you.

675
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,060
I like you.

676
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,060
I like you.

677
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,060
I like you.

678
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,060
I like you.

679
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,060
I like you.

680
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,060
I like you.

681
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:12,060
I like you.

682
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,060
I like you.

683
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,060
I like you.

684
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,060
I like you.

685
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,060
I like you.

686
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,060
I like you.

687
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,060
Go home and get some rest

688
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,860
Calm down.

689
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:50,620
Forget about what happened just now.

690
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,620
Forget about the memories.

691
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:00,380
What I want is not memories, but the future.

692
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,380
Let's be together.

693
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,820
I have the right to reject you.

694
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,820
Is it because of Kong Zirui?

695
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:21,060
Doctor, I broke up with him.

696
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:26,660
I was afraid that I would hurt Wan Jia.

697
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,660
I broke up with Wan Jia.

698
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,260
We are not from the same world.

699
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,860
We are destined to be together.

700
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,860
Just like you and Kong Zirui.

701
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,860
Maybe we are not from the same world.

702
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,860
But we are from the same world.

703
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,860
You should think about me.

704
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:54,860
Didn't you say that your dream is to marry me?

705
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,860
I forgot.

706
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,860
Did you forget me because of Kong Zirui?

707
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,860
I am not your wife.

708
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,860
Did you forget me because of Kong Zirui?

709
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,860
Are you happy?

710
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,860
Are you happy?

711
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:16,860
You rejected my dream first.

712
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,860
Since I had an impetus for love,

713
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:23,860
I had hoped that you would love me.

714
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,860
But I have never been your dream.

715
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,860
You love Luo Yi.

716
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,860
The second time you chose me, it was Wan Jia.

717
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,860
I love you.

718
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,860
I love you.

719
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:42,860
I will not hesitate to reach out my hand.

720
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,860
You are my wind.

721
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:49,860
You are my rain.

722
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:54,860
Teach me to stop and walk forward.

723
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,860
I have been hurt.

724
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:02,860
I have been hurt.

725
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:05,860
I have been hurt.

726
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:08,860
I have been hurt.

727
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:11,860
I have been hurt.

728
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,860
I have been hurt.

729
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,860
I have been hurt.

730
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:20,860
I have been hurt.

731
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:23,860
I have been hurt.

732
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,860
I have been hurt.

733
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:29,860
I have been hurt.

734
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:32,860
We have been through so much together.

735
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,860
But we are the biggest.

736
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:39,860
We know best.

737
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:42,860
We have a special bond.

738
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:45,860
When you need it most,

739
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:49,860
you can always be there.

740
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:55,860
In our times,

741
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:02,860
we will always be together.
