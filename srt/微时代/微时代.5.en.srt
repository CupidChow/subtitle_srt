1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,520
You

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,820
The

6
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:15,400
해야

7
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,140
мало

8
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,140
Closer.

9
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,980
One, two, three, and four.

10
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,820
I remember when we were in school,

11
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,300
most of the boys loved Xiaorou.

12
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,420
You two must be like that too, right?

13
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,380
Yeah, Xiaorou ignored me.

14
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,460
Yeah, of course. How could Xiaorou like you?

15
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,140
You haven't wished me happy birthday.

16
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,580
Happy birthday.

17
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,380
I thought you left.

18
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,660
I was waiting for you.

19
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,860
Here you go.

20
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,740
I wish you a happy birthday.

21
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,540
Thank you.

22
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,940
Then you should have a bite of my cake.

23
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,140
Thank you.

24
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
Thank you.

25
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,740
Is it sweet?

26
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,220
Yes.

27
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,940
Maybe it's because of the good mood.

28
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,740
You need me?

29
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,660
Actually, you're really nice.

30
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,900
Are you so nice to everyone?

31
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,100
You're the only one.

32
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,060
If I leave here one day,

33
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,580
will you come to me?

34
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,340
Yes.

35
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,700
Where have you been the farthest?

36
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,660
I haven't left here.

37
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,060
You're quite a good boy.

38
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,020
No.

39
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,620
My parents are older than me.

40
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,900
My sister is not at home.

41
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,340
I have to stay and take care of them.

42
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,820
You're so responsible.

43
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,860
My sister likes to go out.

44
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,260
She flies everywhere.

45
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,940
She likes to see the world.

46
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,220
So I'll stay and take care of them.

47
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,300
I'll let her go.

48
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,460
I can see that you have a deep love for your sister.

49
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,300
I also want to go somewhere

50
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,620
where I can wander the world one day.

51
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,260
I want to love the person I love.

52
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,460
You're so kind.

53
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,540
I'm so happy.

54
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,980
I want to love the person I love.

55
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,060
You're good enough.

56
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,860
Where do you want to go?

57
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,740
Shangri-La.

58
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,860
The sun and moon are in my heart when the rain falls.

59
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,340
I heard the sky there is blue.

60
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,620
The scenery is beautiful.

61
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,700
There are no worries or sadness.

62
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,780
If one day,

63
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,660
will you come with me?

64
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,420
Yes.

65
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,620
The prayers were for the dog.

66
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,540
I'm gonna be the one to call

67
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,540
I'm gonna be the one to call

68
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:56,540
I'm gonna be the one to call

69
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,540
I'm gonna be the one to call

70
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,540
I'm gonna be the one to call

71
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,540
I'm gonna be the one to call

72
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:12,540
I'm gonna be the one to call

73
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,540
I'm gonna be the one to call

74
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,540
This is my love story

75
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,540
Hmm

76
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,540
So you came to Shanghai

77
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,540
just because Ding Xiao said something?

78
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,540
Yes

79
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,540
I promised her

80
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,540
I would do it

81
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:17,540
If Ding Xiao really didn't show up

82
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,540
would you regret coming to Shanghai?

83
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,540
No

84
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,540
Why would I regret?

85
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,540
Knowing her

86
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,540
is the best thing in my life

87
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:37,540
This is the most moving love story I've ever heard

88
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:44,540
Xiao Jing, don't worry

89
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,540
I promise Ding Xiao will show up again

90
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,540
Liu Xin told me

91
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,540
she said

92
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,540
everything is an illusion

93
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,540
But I think

94
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,540
she is here

95
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,540
We will meet again

96
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,540
She is drunk

97
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,540
Let her be

98
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,540
Maybe she will be better than Qingxing

99
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,540
Do you think Ding Xiao will show up?

100
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,540
I'm not sure

101
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,540
According to the current situation

102
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,540
Ding Xiao is not from our school

103
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,540
I guess she doesn't know that I came to see her

104
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,540
This news is on our school's BBS

105
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,540
Did they miss it?

106
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,540
Not necessarily

107
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,540
The real fate needs to be waited for

108
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,540
If it were you

109
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,540
would you wait or give up?

110
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,540
I would wait

111
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,540
What if she already has a boyfriend?

112
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,540
Then look at her from afar

113
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,540
and wish her happiness

114
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,540
You are all stupid

115
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,540
and stubborn

116
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,540
What about you?

117
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:26,540
Dan Mao, someone is looking for you

118
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,540
It's you, excuse me

119
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,540
It's you

120
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,540
Dan Mao, are you not happy to see me?

121
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,540
No

122
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,540
Your boss said you don't want to be a public figure

123
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,540
Have you ever thought

124
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:11,540
that your

125
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,540
boss

126
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,540
is a chef?

127
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,540
But now it's all ruined

128
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,540
It sounds very fishy

129
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,540
But you never talked to me before

130
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,540
So

131
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,540
Xiao Jiu

132
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,540
Maybe you can't get along with me

133
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,540
I don't mind

134
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,540
But you need to understand

135
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,540
It's impossible to get a chef

136
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,540
even if you work in the business

137
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,540
We can make your job a career

138
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,540
or even a business

139
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,540
As long as you create your own brand

140
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,540
it's called success

141
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,540
I don't want to control you

142
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,540
We are partners

143
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,540
We work together

144
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,540
Just like Ding Yi

145
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,540
I know

146
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,540
But I'm not interested

147
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,540
Why?

148
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,540
Xiao Jiu, I can give you higher conditions

149
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,540
It's not a matter of conditions

150
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,540
Maybe I don't have the same ambition as you

151
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,540
You can say I'm not good at it

152
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,540
But I'm a very good at it

153
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,540
If he doesn't want to

154
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,540
Of course I will

155
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,540
Because he will only be with a

156
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,540
first love who doesn't know if he has

157
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,540
My business has nothing to do with you

158
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,540
Xiao Jiu

159
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,540
It doesn't matter to me if you do this business

160
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,540
I just want to plan your future

161
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,540
Everyone has a living value at the moment

162
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,540
I'm helping you realize your value

163
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,540
Thank you, Mr. Song

164
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:44,540
But I really don't have the same ambition as you

165
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,540
Is it my plan that has ruined your great love

166
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,540
or made your life more ordinary?

167
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,540
Sorry

168
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,540
I don't know what to do with you

169
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,540
I'm leaving

170
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,540
You haven't sent me any photos for so many years

171
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,540
Now it's okay

172
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,540
I can go back and have a look

173
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,540
You have to take more pictures of yourself

174
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,540
You'd better not be alone

175
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,540
You have to be with two people

176
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,540
Sister

177
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,540
I don't think it's like defining her personality

178
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,540
She doesn't say she likes someone

179
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,540
If she likes someone, she doesn't know

180
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,540
Should we help her?

181
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,540
Yes

182
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,540
I think of it with you

183
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,540
You think they are funny

184
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,540
I think she at least knows what to do

185
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,540
You are so happy

186
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,540
Why did you bring Kang Weiwei here?

187
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,540
Why did you bring Wanjia here?

188
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,540
I want to be with Dingyi and Wanjia

189
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,540
Of course I have to bring Wanjia

190
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,540
I thought you were wrong

191
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,540
But she is with Weiwei

192
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,540
What should we do?

193
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,540
What should we do?

194
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,540
Let's take one step at a time

195
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,540
Uncle

196
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,540
What are you arguing about?

197
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,540
Nothing

198
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,540
You guys talk

199
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,540
Mom

200
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,540
Just say what you want

201
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,540
Nothing

202
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,540
You guys talk

203
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,540
What are you doing here?

204
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,540
I don't know

205
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,540
Do you have any arrangement?

206
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,540
I bought two movie tickets

207
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,540
But

208
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,540
Only two

209
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,540
How about you two go?

210
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,540
I'm not going

211
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,540
You two go

212
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,540
I have something to do later

213
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,540
What? Let's go together

214
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,540
We haven't seen a movie together for a long time

215
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,540
That's right

216
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,540
Let's go

217
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,540
I really have something to do later

218
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,540
I have an appointment

219
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,540
It's okay

220
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,540
I can buy another one

221
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,540
Let's go together

222
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,540
I'm not interested in the content of today's movie

223
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,540
You two go

224
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,540
Go, don't touch it, okay?

225
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,540
Let's go

226
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,540
You go

227
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,540
I'm waiting for the phone

228
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,540
Then we go

229
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,540
Call me later

230
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,540
Mom, I'm going

231
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,540
You go

232
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,540
Bye

233
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,540
Bye

234
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,540
Bye

235
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,540
Do you think the movie was good?

236
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,540
I think the male and female lead are all stupid

237
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,540
They like each other for so long

238
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,540
No one knows

239
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,540
Isn't that what love is?

240
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,540
When do you like to laugh?

241
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,540
I don't know from myself

242
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,540
Who said that?

243
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,540
This kind of thing

244
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,540
I know for sure

245
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,540
Then

246
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,540
When did you like to exercise?

247
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,540
Wang Anwang

248
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,540
Wang Ziyuan

249
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,540
Xiao Jia

250
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,540
Xiao Jia

251
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,540
You are so lucky

252
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,540
Hello

253
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,540
Go, go, go

254
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,540
Wan Jia, you are so lucky

255
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,540
Do you want to hear the truth?

256
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,540
Yes

257
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,540
Do you like to play the game of kiss?

258
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,540
You mean

259
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,540
the party in the east?

260
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,540
Okay, don't talk about this

261
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,540
Take a picture for me

262
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,540
Okay

263
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,540
Okay

264
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,540
Okay

265
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,540
How is it?

266
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,540
They are all very good

267
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,540
Let me see

268
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,540
This is too ugly

269
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,540
Wait

270
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,540
I'll send it back to you

271
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,540
Let me see

272
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,540
Nothing to see

273
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,540
Don't look

274
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,540
I'll send it back to you

275
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,540
When did you take a picture of me?

276
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,540
It's too ugly

277
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,540
I'll delete it

278
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,540
Don't delete it

279
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,540
I

280
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,540
I'll send it back to you

281
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,540
Then

282
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,540
Then remember

283
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,540
You delete the ugly one

284
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,540
Send me the good one

285
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,540
Let's go

286
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,540
Let's go

287
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,540
How is it?

288
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,540
Did you have fun today?

289
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,540
What's the fun?

290
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,540
You know Han Tingyi

291
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,540
is so boring

292
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,540
I guess if I were to date her

293
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,540
I would be bored

294
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,540
But

295
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:17,540
It's good to be liked

296
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,540
I don't think so

297
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,540
I think

298
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,540
It's good to like someone

299
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,540
It's different

300
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,540
It's too tiring to like someone

301
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,540
You have to care about how they see you

302
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,540
whether they miss you

303
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,540
whether they will be with you forever

304
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,540
On the contrary, it's much easier to be liked

305
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,540
I like the feeling of being liked

306
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,540
It makes me feel alive

307
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,540
But to like someone

308
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,540
doesn't mean you have to be liked

309
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,540
As long as I see that person being happy with someone else

310
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,540
I feel happy

311
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,540
Yeah

312
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,540
Where else would you find someone as generous as you?

313
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,540
I think you are the living ambassador of love

314
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,540
I'm sorry

315
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,540
Look at this

316
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,540
It's so touching

317
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,540
I want to have a love story with someone who loves me so much

318
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,540
Li Xiaoru is such a happy woman

319
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,540
I hope I can be like the hero in the story

320
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,540
Let's go

321
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,540
Open the door

322
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,540
Is there only one person in the house?

323
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,540
How was the thing I asked you to help me investigate last time?

324
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,540
What?

325
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,540
Of course it's Ding Xiaorou

326
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,540
You are going to be the Gassi Boy in school

327
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,540
You can't investigate this little thing

328
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,540
Mr. Kang, don't say it so easily

329
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,540
Shanghai is so big

330
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,540
How do I know where Xiaorou is?

331
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,540
Besides, it's not sure if she is in Shanghai or not

332
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,540
Didn't you post that statement on Weibo?

333
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,540
Did you get any news?

334
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,540
Of course I didn't ask you

335
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,540
I also read the comments

336
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,540
Didn't there are many girls who call Ding Xiaorou's daughter a rich woman?

337
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,540
Those are not real Ding Xiaorou

338
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,540
They were all moved by the handsome things of Xiaojiu

339
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,540
before they left a message

340
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,540
Then you can pick the best one from the middle

341
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,540
and let her replace the real Ding Xiaorou

342
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,540
and Xiaojiu continue to romance the wind chimes story

343
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,540
Isn't that good?

344
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,540
How is that possible?

345
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,540
Xiaojiu will definitely not agree

346
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,540
How do you know you won't agree?

347
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,540
Because I understand that feeling

348
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,540
If you really like someone

349
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,540
no matter how long it takes

350
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,540
you will be willing to do it

351
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,540
Mr. Kang, as far as I know

352
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,540
you seem to have never been in love

353
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,540
That's better than you going to the wall with different women every day

354
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,540
Okay, I won't argue with you anymore

355
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,540
I'm leaving

356
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,540
Where are you going?

357
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,540
I'm going to find Xiaojiu

358
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,540
to distract him

359
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,540
Be careful

360
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,540
Hello, Xiaojiu

361
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,540
Where are you?

362
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,540
Do you have time?

363
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,540
I'll go find you later

364
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,540
I forgot the steps in the study room last time

365
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,540
Hello

366
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,540
Are you in a meeting?

367
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,540
I'm reading some project files

368
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,540
Are you very tired?

369
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,540
Yes, very very tired

370
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,540
My back aches, my legs are sore

371
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,540
What should I do?

372
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,540
What time do you get off work?

373
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,540
Do you have any plans for the afternoon?

374
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,540
I don't think there's any plans for the afternoon

375
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,540
I'll be off work at three o'clock

376
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,540
Then let's go watch a movie

377
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,540
I'll go buy tickets

378
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,540
We haven't watched a movie together for a long time

379
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,540
You've only been together for five days

380
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,540
People who are in love

381
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,540
watch a movie every day

382
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,540
Yes, yes, yes, I listen to you

383
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,540
It's settled

384
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,540
I'll go buy tickets later

385
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,540
Don't put me in a hurry

386
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,540
I'll go

387
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,540
You are my life motto

388
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,540
Wherever you go, I go

389
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,540
Bye

390
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,540
Come in

391
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,540
Mr Ying

392
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,540
Tonight, several European large brand customers

393
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,540
will discuss the next strategic cooperation plan with the chairman

394
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,540
The chairman just called

395
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,540
He hopes you can attend the dinner

396
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,540
What time is the appointment?

397
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,540
Six o'clock tonight

398
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,540
Okay

399
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,540
I know

400
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,540
Give me 15 minutes to arrange it

401
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,540
Go out

402
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,540
Okay

403
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,540
Hello, Ding Hui

404
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,540
Hello, Ding Yi

405
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,540
Is Mr Ying here?

406
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,540
He's in the office

407
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,540
Okay

408
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,540
Are you busy?

409
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,540
I'm too busy to even get myself together

410
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,540
How are you, Dr Han?

411
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,540
Do I have a job?

412
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,540
No matter how busy you are, you have to relax

413
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,540
You can spend more time with the people around you

414
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,540
What?

415
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,540
Is something wrong with me?

416
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,540
I'm here to send you the schedule

417
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,540
of this season

418
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,540
Actually, you don't have to send me every season

419
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,540
I trust your ability

420
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,540
That's not okay

421
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,540
In terms of relationship, you and I are brothers

422
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,540
But in terms of work

423
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,540
You are my boss

424
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,540
In terms of work and relationship

425
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,540
We are brothers

426
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,540
Can you help me?

427
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,540
What?

428
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,540
Hello

429
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,540
Hello

430
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,540
You are the hair dresser in the magazine, right?

431
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,540
My child has eaten your food

432
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,540
He likes you very much

433
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,540
Can you give him a name?

434
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,540
I'm sorry, I'm at the work department

435
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,540
It's not convenient

436
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,540
Young man

437
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,540
We don't want to bother you

438
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,540
We just want you to sign a name for us

439
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,540
The child likes you very much

440
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,540
We don't want to disappoint him

441
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,540
Thank you

442
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,540
Thank you

443
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,540
Thank you

444
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,540
Young man likes him

445
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,540
Jia

446
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,540
You also come to watch a movie?

447
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,540
Sorry

448
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,540
I let you down

449
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,540
It's like this

450
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,540
Ning Dong has something to do

451
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,540
He can't open his head

452
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,540
So he asked me to come with you to watch a movie

453
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,540
It's like this again

454
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,540
I should have guessed

455
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,540
He has no time to watch a movie with me

456
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,540
But he shouldn't come

457
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,540
He should have called me and told me

458
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,540
I think he doesn't know how to say it

459
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,540
Does he think he is a loser?

460
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,540
I'm thirsty

461
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,540
Then you drink it all

462
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,540
Hey

463
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,540
Jia

464
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,540
Actually Ning Dong wants to watch a movie with you

465
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,540
But he can't open his head

466
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,540
He told me that you have been looking forward to it for a long time

467
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,540
He wants to watch this movie

468
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,540
So he asked me to come

469
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:37,540
But if you don't want to watch a movie with me

470
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,540
Then we find a place to eat this

471
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,540
Where did you say?

472
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,540
Watch a movie, not a movie

473
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,540
Besides, you are much better looking than Ning Dong

474
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,540
Let's go to the movie

475
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,540
Let's go to the movie

476
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,540
Give it to me

477
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,540
I'm not going

478
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,540
I'm not going

479
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,540
Ok, go

480
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,540
You come to me

481
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,540
You don't want to do some sort of repair, right?

482
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,540
No

483
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,540
Tell me

484
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,540
What's the matter?

485
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,540
Uncle

486
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,540
I didn't get your permission

487
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,540
I posted your and Ding Xiaorou's thing on Weibo

488
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,540
There are many comments called Ding Xiaorou

489
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,540
But they are not the one you said

490
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,540
Uncle

491
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,540
Why don't you try a new relationship

492
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,540
Forget about Ding Xiaorou

493
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,540
Can a real relationship be replaced?

494
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,540
No one can replace Xiaorou

495
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,540
Then you just keep waiting like this?

496
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,540
You don't have to wait all the time

497
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,540
If he knows you have come to Shanghai

498
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,540
He just wants to hide from you

499
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:57,540
Or he already has a boyfriend

500
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,540
Then

501
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,540
Then I will leave Shanghai

502
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,540
Don't disturb him

503
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,540
A Western steak

504
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,540
Sweet salad

505
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,540
Red-braised yellow croaker

506
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,540
And that

507
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,540
Dried pot squid and shrimp

508
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,540
Italian noodles with Italian pasta

509
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,540
Two cups of orange juice, thank you

510
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,540
It's quite expensive here

511
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,540
Why did you bring me here to eat?

512
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,540
Didn't you say last time

513
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,540
You like to eat here the most?

514
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,540
Yingdong brought me here once

515
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:43,540
You don't have to force yourself to cater to my appetite

516
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,540
What do you mean by forcing yourself?

517
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,540
Although I don't have money

518
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,540
But I can treat you to a meal

519
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,540
Don't worry

520
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,540
I made a lot of money last month

521
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,540
You can eat as you like

522
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,540
You are so nice

523
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,540
As long as you are happy

524
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,540
I will do anything for you

525
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,540
Why don't you eat?

526
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,540
Thank you

527
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,540
Yingdong also likes to eat salad here

528
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,540
Didn't we agree not to mention him tonight?

529
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,540
You don't understand

530
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:32,540
When you are used to relying on someone

531
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,540
You will find that missing is a thing that is particularly difficult to remove

532
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,540
You never liked anyone

533
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,540
You never liked anyone

534
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,540
You won't understand

535
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,540
How come I don't understand?

536
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,540
I am experiencing this feeling every day

537
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,540
Hello

538
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,540
Are you still in the meeting?

539
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,540
Just finished

540
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,540
I forgot to eat

541
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,540
What?

542
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,540
You haven't eaten yet?

543
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,540
Yes

544
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,540
Can you eat with me later?

545
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,540
Okay

546
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,540
I will go find you

547
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,540
Dingyi

548
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,540
I

549
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,540
I

550
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,540
I

551
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,540
I

552
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,540
I

553
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,540
I

554
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,540
I am not very kind

555
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,540
Yingdong hasn't eaten yet

556
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,540
I want to eat with him

557
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,540
Can we pack?

558
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,540
Okay

559
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,540
I will pay

560
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,540
Hello sir

561
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,540
With the service fee

562
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,540
You will spend 1500 yuan in total

563
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,540
Let's go

564
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,540
Hurry

565
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,540
Wanjia, slow down

566
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,540
I am wearing high heels, don't fall

567
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,540
It's okay

568
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,540
I just don't get used to it

569
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,540
I remember you don't like high heels

570
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,540
Yingdong likes it

571
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,540
What's wrong?

572
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,540
I think my feet are twisted

573
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,540
Look at yourself

574
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,540
You always do things that you can't do

575
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,540
It's okay

576
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,540
Let's go

577
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,540
Yingdong is waiting for me

578
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,540
You have waited for him so many times

579
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,540
What's wrong with you letting him wait for you?

580
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,540
Why do you always make yourself suffer?

581
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,540
Why are you so angry?

582
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,540
Because I can't stand it

583
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,540
You are so wronged

584
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,540
Why don't you let go?

585
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,540
What's wrong with you?

586
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,540
It's okay

587
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,540
Eat

588
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,540
If it were me

589
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,540
I wouldn't let you suffer

590
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,540
Okay, don't say that

591
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,540
Let me finish

592
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,540
Although Yingdong is my friend

593
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,540
He is very important to me

594
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,540
But in my heart

595
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,540
You are more important than anyone

596
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,540
I won't allow you to be hurt

597
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,540
For you

598
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,540
I can do anything

599
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,540
Give me a chance, okay?

600
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,540
I want to protect you

601
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,540
The feeling of liking someone

602
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,540
Is impossible to be replaced

603
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,540
If you really like someone

604
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,540
You will know

605
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,540
Even if you can't see him

606
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,540
You can be satisfied

607
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,540
If you don't like someone

608
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,540
Even if you are together all the time

609
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,540
You won't really feel happy

610
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,540
Ding Yi

611
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,540
We are good friends

612
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,540
You are good to me

613
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,540
I am very grateful

614
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,540
Just now

615
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,540
What you said just now

616
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,540
I didn't hear it

617
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,540
I am leaving

618
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,540
Yingdong is waiting for me

619
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,540
Are you hungry?

620
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,540
No, I just arrived

621
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,540
What's wrong with your feet?

622
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,540
Nothing

623
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,540
I just walked by

624
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,540
And I just got a little bit of a headache

625
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,540
Let me take you to the hospital

626
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,540
No, I am fine after seeing you

627
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,540
If there is any problem

628
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,540
Let me take you to the hospital

629
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,540
I will just stop at the gate

630
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,540
Let me carry you

631
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,540
How can I go?

632
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,540
I will carry you

633
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,540
Is it okay?

634
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,540
It's okay

635
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,540
But after I hugged you

636
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,540
I feel like

637
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,540
I am the best man in the world

638
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,540
Why?

639
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,540
Because I have raised you so well

640
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,540
I can't even hold you anymore

641
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,540
Hello everyone

642
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,540
Mengjie

643
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,540
Teacher Lan is waiting outside

644
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,540
I will go

645
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,540
Wait a minute

646
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,540
Go ahead

647
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,540
Did you find it?

648
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,540
I found it

649
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,540
Ding Xiaorou did read in our school

650
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,540
Then why did you and Youxi

651
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,540
On the school's name list

652
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,540
Can't find Ding Xiaorou's name

653
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,540
That's because she dropped out of school

654
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,540
So on the name list

655
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,540
Can't find her name

656
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,540
At that time

657
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,540
She had paid a semester's tuition

658
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,540
But she didn't come to class

659
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,540
But specifically

660
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,540
What is the reason for her drop out of school

661
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,540
I haven't found it yet

662
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,540
Can you check it for me?

663
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,540
Row

664
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,540
Anyway, she didn't cheat Sanmao

665
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,540
She really is a student of our school

666
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,540
But

667
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,540
I'm not sure if she is still in Shanghai

668
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,540
How do you know

669
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,540
Teacher Lan must have

670
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,540
Ding Xiaorou's address?

671
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,540
She told my mom

672
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,540
That Ding Xiaorou asked Xu Binbin to come to class

673
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,540
How could she not know the address?

674
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,540
Even if she knew the address

675
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,540
She wouldn't tell us about Xiong Yinsi

676
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,540
You won't change the registration of the school's name list

677
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,540
Are you stupid?

678
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,540
I'm busy

679
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,540
Teacher Lan, hello

680
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,540
Teacher Lan

681
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,540
You are still working today?

682
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,540
Teacher Lan

683
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,540
I'll get you a glass of water

684
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,540
I have to say

685
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,540
School is so crowded

686
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,540
You are still working on the weekend

687
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,540
If you come to ask about Ding Xiaorou

688
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,540
I'm sorry, I don't have

689
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,540
Don't disturb my work

690
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,540
Teacher Lan

691
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,540
I'm sorry, I don't have

692
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,540
I'm sorry, I don't have

693
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,540
I'm sorry, I don't have

694
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,540
Teacher Lan, what are you talking about?

695
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,540
I'm here to pay my respects to you

696
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,540
You can stay at home and pay your respects to your mother

697
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,540
I can't reveal the student's entry information

698
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,540
This is my responsibility as a teacher

699
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,540
Teacher Lan

700
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,540
You just tell me a little bit

701
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,540
A little bit

702
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,540
You know Xiao Jiu

703
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,540
He is a man of his word

704
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,540
You can't bear to see a good young man

705
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,540
being abandoned like this

706
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,540
You are not that kind of person

707
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,540
I am really that kind of person

708
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:41,540
Sometimes it's not good not to know the answer

709
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,540
Teacher Lan is right

710
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,540
Just like her and Teacher Yang

711
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,540
Some things are not seen as a mirror

712
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,540
What Weiwei

713
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,540
Poor Teacher Yang was tortured by her husband

714
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,540
He is not living well

715
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,540
No one can help him

716
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,540
What do you mean?

717
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,540
Hua Youxi, wait a minute

718
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,540
Wait a minute

719
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,540
What do you mean by what you just said?

720
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,540
Other people's business

721
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,540
I don't know if I should say it or not

722
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,540
You say

723
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,540
Ok, hold on

724
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,540
Liu Yibo

725
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,540
Met a dancing lady at the night club

726
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,540
The two of them are now

727
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,540
Like glue and stick together every day

728
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,540
Do you know what the most hateful person is?

729
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,540
He was still in Puxin

730
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,540
Bought a villa and went into hiding

731
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,540
After Teacher Lan knew

732
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,540
Sad, tears of tears

733
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,540
Life is not as painful as death

734
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,540
Unbearable

735
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,540
The two almost divorced

736
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,540
Now

737
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,540
He is angry with his husband

738
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,540
And lives in a house

739
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,540
Now

740
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,540
He is angry with his husband and lives in a hospital

741
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,540
Don't you know?

742
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,540
You really don't know?

743
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,540
I always thought you were the most concerned person

744
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,540
I didn't expect people to change

745
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,540
No music

746
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,540
I understand music

747
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,540
Xiao Qing

748
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,540
It should be the one in front

749
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,540
Let's go

750
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,540
Here it is

751
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,540
Then I'll ask the doorbell

752
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:14,540
I've been through too much together

753
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:17,540
I can't replace it

754
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:20,540
I'm waiting for you to end

755
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:24,540
I will have an excuse

756
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:27,540
When you need it most

757
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:31,540
I can be your guardian

758
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:45,540
There is a saying

759
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,540
Don't say anything

760
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:53,540
You will not hesitate

761
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,540
To reach out

762
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:00,540
Be the wind for me

763
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:04,540
Take the rain for me

764
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,540
Teach me to stop

765
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,540
I stop and walk forward

766
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:13,540
I've been hurt

767
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:17,540
There are also grudges

768
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,540
You must be with me

769
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,540
Tears and wine

770
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,540
Together

771
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,540
Together

772
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,540
Together

773
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,540
Together

774
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,540
On the street of drunkenness

775
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,540
We go to the end

776
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:44,540
No need for any reason

777
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:48,540
We've been through too much together

778
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:51,540
Even though I'm the most stupid

779
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,540
We listen to the end

780
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:58,540
There will be no excuse

781
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,540
When you need it most

782
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:05,540
I can be your guardian

783
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,540
There is a saying

784
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:13,540
Don't say anything

785
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,540
You will not hesitate

786
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,540
To reach out

787
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:23,540
Be the wind for me

788
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,540
Take the rain for me

789
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,540
Teach me to stop
