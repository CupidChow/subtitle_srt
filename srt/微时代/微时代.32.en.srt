1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:55,520
Priestess

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's not like she's dressed up like this.

3
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
She's just a customer.

4
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You don't understand.

5
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Ou Hui met her own film director Wang Guo when she was less than 30 years old.

6
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
She started from Malaysia and went to Southeast Asia and Asia.

7
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Now she's in Europe.

8
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This process took less than five years.

9
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
She created the most popular new food for young people.

10
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And do you know that her restaurant will be booked 10 days in advance?

11
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
She's already created a miracle.

12
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
A man with talent and charm.

13
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The point is that he's very handsome.

14
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I must leave a good impression for him.

15
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay.

16
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It seems that you've done so much research.

17
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Can I be jealous?

18
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Darling, I allow you to be jealous.

19
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It takes one minute to fall in love with you.

20
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It takes only one second to fall in love with Ou Hui.

21
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
She has the ability to make all women fall in love at once.

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
A real noble knight should be like her.

23
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
He's talented and capable.

24
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
How can he be so perfect?

25
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Should I bow my head or put my hair down?

26
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's good to bow your head or put your hair down.

27
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But I think you're not good enough.

28
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Look at you. You're jealous and you're talking in a sarcastic way.

29
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Ou Hui has a strange temper.

30
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
She's not easy to get along with.

31
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Your father asked me to take over the right to work in their restaurant.

32
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I want to bow my head.

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You're not even starting.

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Can you make some room?

35
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I don't know if Uncle Wu wants to take this opportunity to make me exercise.

36
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Or he wants to find a reason to drive me away from you.

37
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
My father gave you such an important task because he completely believes in you.

38
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But don't worry.

39
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I've already bought Ou Hui's secretary.

40
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
She'll arrange our meeting in her first day of the year.

41
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
As long as we can meet Ou Hui, it's half of the success.

42
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Do you know how difficult it is to meet Ou Hui?

43
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay.

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But this matter is really not a matter that can be solved with one move.

45
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What's the most important news today?

46
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Long Juan Feng and Kenny were attacked by Americans.

47
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The three of them died and dozens of people were injured.

48
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Can you be a little happy?

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
famous actor Zhang Ziyan and his foreign boyfriend Meigen Furi

50
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
have been married today.

51
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I hate getting married the most.

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And then they're still divorced.

53
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What's the point?

54
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The point is that they're still married.

55
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Why do you think they're still married?

56
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You're not even married.

57
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You're not even married.

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And you're not even married.

59
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What do you mean?

60
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Change it.

61
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Zhang Lanlan, a gourmet shop owner,

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
opened his first restaurant chain in Shanghai a day ago.

63
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's the new trend of food on Jiangyin Island.

64
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You're three seconds late.

65
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Get ready to pack up.

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Boss, give me another chance.

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You've ruined my mood today.

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Cancel all the employment.

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Hello?

70
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Hello, I'm...

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's okay.

72
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Okay, thank you.

73
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Goodbye.

74
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What's wrong?

75
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Secretary of the Ministry of Health.

76
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
He said his boss was in a bad mood today.

77
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
He refused to see everyone.

78
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
He said he was in a bad mood today.

79
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He refused to see everyone.

80
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We've canceled our meeting.

81
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The exam time has come down.

82
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
There are still 30 days left.

83
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I hope you will put your mind on the exam and paper in these 30 days.

84
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I hope you will put your mind on the exam and paper in these 30 days.

85
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Put your mind on the exam and paper.

86
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Have fun, okay?

87
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
After all, this is the first calendar in your life.

88
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's also the first list of grades in society.

89
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Okay, time is running out.

90
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
If you have any questions, just contact me.

91
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You can go to school now.

92
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This is a success.

93
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Then I'll go home.

94
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Thank you very much.

95
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You can behave well and fill your anchor.

96
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Bye GRAMMY!

97
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,600
The dog meat in the restaurant is cheap.

98
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,680
It's not worth the money.

99
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,320
Boss, I'm sorry.

100
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,280
You only know how to search on the internet.

101
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,040
There's no information about the food experts.

102
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,360
Forget it. I'll go and look for it myself.

103
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,560
Look, how is it?

104
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,000
Wait.

105
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,080
The night has come to the слишком hot and dry.

106
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,760
Boss, my father has already given me some tricks.

107
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,840
Stop it!

108
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,720
Let me take a look at your hands.

109
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,960
There are so many useful tricks here.

110
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,400
Get me a historivär face mask.

111
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,960
aphomagony

112
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,320
I need a Rancho's handkerchief for the talk.

113
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
In the name of democracy

114
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,280
Hi, sir.

115
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,340
Your traffic jam is against the rule.

116
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,560
Don't worry.

117
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,840
I'll order a fine for driving training.

118
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Sir, are you here for dinner?

119
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Bullshit.

120
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Am I here to see you?

121
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What do you need?

122
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
We have Chinese food here.

123
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't know what you want.

124
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm not hungry.

125
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Bring me the least trash food.

126
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Okay.

127
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
There's a guest at the door.

128
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Bring him the best food.

129
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
He's so small.

130
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I didn't expect his nose to be so smelly.

131
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
He must have taken the medicine.

132
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'll make him some trash.

133
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's boring.

134
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I have a few girls to ask for a drink.

135
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll go.

136
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'll take care of you.

137
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm a young man.

138
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'll go.

139
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm glad you're here.

140
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I read in the magazine that

141
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
you have a lot of interesting tests.

142
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'll test you.

143
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Come on.

144
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The problem of pervert killing.

145
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The problem of pervert and your pervert is the same.

146
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I can't guess it.

147
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Try it.

148
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Listen to the first part.

149
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
A boy's favorite goldfish died.

150
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
His mother tried to make up for it.

151
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So she bought him a goldfish chocolate.

152
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But the next day

153
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
he killed his brother.

154
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Why?

155
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Because he killed goldfish.

156
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Wrong.

157
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Because he ate his goldfish chocolate.

158
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Wrong.

159
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Because he wanted to drink his chocolate.

160
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The same size as my brother.

161
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's amazing.

162
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Congratulations.

163
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You've reached the first stage.

164
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Congratulations.

165
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Congratulations.

166
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You've reached the first stage.

167
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Your junk food.

168
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
What is it?

169
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Salad.

170
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Gold shrimp with Thai rice.

171
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Okay.

172
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Let's continue.

173
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The second part.

174
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Listen.

175
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
A man saw a man's chest.

176
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
He turned around and looked at it.

177
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And he pointed at you with his hand.

178
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Why?

179
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
He warned me not to tell anyone.

180
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Wrong.

181
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
He warned you that the next one died.

182
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Wrong.

183
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Can you not use the normal people's thinking to answer this question?

184
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's a pervert question.

185
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
His hand pointed at the floor.

186
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It means...

187
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It means...

188
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The next one is going to kill me.

189
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Wow.

190
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You two are so in sync.

191
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Congratulations.

192
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You've reached the final stage.

193
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The final pervert.

194
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Okay.

195
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The last question.

196
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Listen.

197
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
He said you were walking through the desert.

198
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
He saw a man in the desert.

199
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
He saw a man with a lot of stuff.

200
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And he had a fire in his hand.

201
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And he had a fire in his hand.

202
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And he had a fire in his hand.

203
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
He was killed.

204
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
He was killed in the desert.

205
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I know.

206
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
He was killed by a luggage.

207
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Can you not joke about this?

208
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You're making a cartoon.

209
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I don't know. I'm not playing.

210
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Half a firewood.

211
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
There was a man with a firewood.

212
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Did he fall from the sky?

213
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Let me give you a hint.

214
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The point is that

215
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Half a firewood.

216
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Half a firewood.

217
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So short.

218
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So short.

219
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Could it be...

220
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
He was thrown

221
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
from a hot air balloon.

222
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Because

223
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
He was hit the shortest.

224
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You two are perverts.

225
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You two are perverts.

226
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Brother,

227
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Don't offend anyone in the future.

228
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Let's go.

229
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Let's go back to the fire.

230
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Let's go.

231
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
This is a receipt for your ticket.

232
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Welcome to the kitchen.

233
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Did you cook these dishes?

234
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yes.

235
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Is it enough?

236
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm hungry today.

237
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I ate all.

238
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You're lucky.

239
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
What's your name?

240
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm just a garbage cook.

241
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Is it important?

242
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Oh, right.

243
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Her name is Kang Fei.

244
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You talk too much.

245
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Where did you learn cooking?

246
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I didn't learn it officially.

247
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I cook with passion.

248
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Passion.

249
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Do you understand?

250
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So you're

251
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
self-taught.

252
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Who inspired you?

253
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I've been studying recipes since I was a kid.

254
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So I know a little bit.

255
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Kang Weiwei, maybe we'll meet again.

256
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I don't think so.

257
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Through the test,

258
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I proved that you're a pervert.

259
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You're a pervert too.

260
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You're a pervert.

261
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You look great.

262
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Exquisite.

263
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I haven't found anyone

264
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
who's as beautiful as me.

265
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You already

266
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
can relate to each other.

267
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You two really didn't match.

268
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,400
She's a pervert.

269
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,400
Why did you come here?

270
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,400
Just kidding.

271
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,400
He's just a passer-by.

272
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,400
You're not a good person.

273
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
I'm sorry.

274
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,400
I'm sorry that you came here in person.

275
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
We've been friends for so many years.

276
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,400
And you're here to say hello.

277
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,400
After your heart fell down,

278
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,400
my old friend was worried about your health.

279
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,400
And you asked me to bring your will.

280
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,400
What? Are you really going to retire?

281
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,400
You're a strange person.

282
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,400
The richer you are, the less secure you are.

283
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,400
Brother Wu, I think you lack someone who can share your happiness.

284
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,400
I have. I have my daughter Amber.

285
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
They say that a woman should not be left out.

286
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,400
I think your daughter's heart is in Ying Dong, Ying You Jin's son.

287
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,400
It's a matter of time before she marries her son-in-law.

288
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,400
But now everyone is talking about me behind my back.

289
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,400
They say that I've taken over half of the business.

290
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,400
If Ying Dong really marries Amber,

291
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,400
then they will take over my Wu Group.

292
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,400
Wu, you're a well-known businessman.

293
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,400
You don't have to worry about it.

294
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,400
The changes have been too big in the past few decades.

295
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,400
It's easy to get fame.

296
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,400
But it's hard to let go.

297
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,400
Why are you so emotional?

298
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,400
Did something happen?

299
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
Nothing.

300
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,400
Let's talk about it.

301
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,400
I'm not going to talk about it.

302
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,400
Did you hear me?

303
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,400
It's okay.

304
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,400
Let's talk about business.

305
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,400
On my last will,

306
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,400
it was written that all my assets were given to my only daughter Amber.

307
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,400
But today I want to change the will.

308
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:02,400
I want to give 20% of my assets to another person.

309
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,400
Your future son-in-law Ying Dong?

310
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,400
Qi Chang Xiu, please keep this secret for me.

311
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,400
I want to give 20% of my assets to another person.

312
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,400
Someone who has blood ties with me.

313
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,400
Come on, eat some fruit.

314
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,400
Are you done?

315
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
I don't know what to do.

316
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,400
There are so many things going on in the restaurant.

317
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
And Ding Yi just sent me a message.

318
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,400
The owner said that if the restaurant had to rent,

319
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,400
it would have to be increased to 400,000 yuan a year.

320
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
It's a small thing.

321
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,400
I'll tell Ying Dong about it.

322
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Really?

323
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,400
But I don't know if Ding Yi will want to ask Ying Dong to help him.

324
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,400
You are very happy.

325
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
At least you have a solution to your worries.

326
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,400
Like the problem that my daddy had with Ying Dong,

327
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
it's a big problem.

328
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,400
We can't get close to the president of Eva Group.

329
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,400
The president of Eva Group.

330
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
It's really hard to deal with.

331
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
Hello.

332
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,400
Is Miss Kang Wei Wei here?

333
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,400
She is not here.

334
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,400
Are you...

335
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,400
I am the executive secretary of Eva Restaurant Group.

336
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
On behalf of our boss, I invite Miss Kang Wei Wei to the interview.

337
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,400
Please tell her.

338
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
The president's assistant?

339
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,400
Yes. This is our boss's business card.

340
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
I'm sorry.

341
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,400
What a coincidence!

342
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,400
It turns out that Kang Wei Wei is my savior.

343
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,400
I'm back.

344
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
Your savior is here.

345
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,400
Wei Wei.

346
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
You are so beautiful.

347
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,400
I love you so much.

348
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,400
You are my savior.

349
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,400
What's going on?

350
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,400
Are you Miss Kang Wei Wei?

351
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,400
Yes.

352
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,400
Don't worry.

353
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
I will dress her up and let her go out.

354
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,400
Amber said she would go to the meeting with you tomorrow.

355
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,400
But I haven't decided yet.

356
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
This man is very good at answering perverts.

357
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,400
And he said that the main thing is garbage.

358
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
The boss is such a pervert.

359
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,400
The company will not be able to get away with it.

360
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,400
How can a young man lose his temper?

361
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
Do you know?

362
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
Yingdong and Amber tried their best to avoid seeing him.

363
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,400
Why do they want to see him?

364
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,400
Wu Yuting wants Yingdong

365
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,400
to introduce Alva's restaurant to his hotel.

366
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,400
This way Yingdong can join his hotel.

367
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
Now Ou Hui wants to see you.

368
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,400
So you have a chance to work in their company.

369
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,400
By the way, you can also meet Amber and Yingdong.

370
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,400
But I haven't decided yet.

371
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
What are you thinking about?

372
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,400
A big company like Alva

373
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,400
can't get in no matter how many people want to.

374
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
Now this opportunity is in front of you.

375
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,400
As long as you are willing to try,

376
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,400
your future may change.

377
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
Unlike Ding Yi and I,

378
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,400
it is difficult to manage this studio.

379
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,400
Now the rent is going to be increased.

380
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
It will be increased to 400,000 yuan a year.

381
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,400
I really don't know

382
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
if we can hold on.

383
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
This difficulty cannot be overcome.

384
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,400
I think we can really close down.

385
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,400
Don't worry.

386
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
If V-Lab really closes down,

387
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
there will be no accident.

388
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,400
I have decided

389
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,400
to go to the interview tomorrow.

390
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,400
I want to meet him and see how perverted he is.

391
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,400
Fighting!

392
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,400
Fighting!

393
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,400
I have to go to the interview.

394
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
Why?

395
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,400
The interview is to see the first impression.

396
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Dressed in a formal way means respect.

397
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
Such a big company,

398
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,400
do you want to wear a T-shirt?

399
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,400
I'm not looking outside.

400
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,400
Good boy, I know.

401
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
But you have to be careful.

402
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,400
Remember,

403
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
you have to perform very well when you meet Ouhui.

404
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
My future with Yingdong is all up to you.

405
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,400
Fighting!

406
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
Let's go.

407
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,400
Come in.

408
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
Mr. Ou, Miss Wu and Miss Kang are here.

409
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
Please come in.

410
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,400
Hello, Mr. Ou.

411
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,400
Sit down.

412
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,400
I have only 20 minutes.

413
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,400
Please answer the question in a simple way.

414
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,400
Do you think it's difficult to invest in Shanghai's food industry?

415
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,400
What do you think about the Western cuisine in Shanghai?

416
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
Have you ever been to Aiva for a meal?

417
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,400
Tell me the pros and cons.

418
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
And what do you want to see in my company?

419
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,400
Shanghai is a place where

420
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,400
no matter what you do, you have to be very hardworking.

421
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
Plus, the rent is one of the most expensive cities in China.

422
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,400
There are many choices at the moment.

423
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
It's easy to get sick.

424
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,400
Investing here is risky.

425
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,400
The return is not guaranteed.

426
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,400
So I don't think it's the best choice.

427
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
The young people in Shanghai like to eat Western cuisine.

428
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
But the chefs here don't have feelings for food.

429
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,400
They always pursue high-end food.

430
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,400
The food without feelings is always delicious.

431
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
As for the restaurant that Mr. Ou Hui opened,

432
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,400
I have never been there.

433
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,400
Because I have never left Shanghai since I was a child.

434
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,400
But according to my judgment,

435
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
your success is because your dishes are novel and creative.

436
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,400
It suits the taste of young people.

437
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
As for the lack of sweat,

438
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
it's just too creative and too fancy.

439
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,400
But there is a lack of sincerity.

440
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,400
Sometimes, if you can make a good dish,

441
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
it's enough to support the power station for a hundred years.

442
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,400
As for the hope of any development in the company,

443
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,400
I'm sorry.

444
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,400
I don't know much about this company.

445
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,400
I don't have any hope.

446
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,400
Weiwei definitely doesn't mean that.

447
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,400
She means that Shanghai is an international capital city.

448
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,400
There is no place that is more suitable for investment than here.

449
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,400
And Weiwei really wants to join the European companies.

450
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
She was so excited last night that she didn't sleep at all.

451
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
Probably because she was too nervous.

452
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,400
She was so nervous that she couldn't speak.

453
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,400
Even if you are not very talented,

454
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,400
at least you are honest.

455
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
You dare to tell the truth to me.

456
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,400
Thank you.

457
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,400
Do you know why I'm choosing you now?

458
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
I don't know.

459
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,400
When I was a child, my family was very poor.

460
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,400
The greatest pleasure was to steal other people's food and drink to study.

461
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,400
I remember you said that you are self-taught.

462
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,400
That should be much better than some of my useless people.

463
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,400
I'm sorry.

464
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,400
We have the biggest difference.

465
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,400
I'm a loan partner.

466
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,400
You are a thief.

467
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,400
Only by telling the truth can you achieve real results.

468
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,400
I decided to hire you as my assistant.

469
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,400
I am responsible for the information investigator of Shanghai's food and drink industry.

470
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
Thank you, Mr. Ou.

471
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,400
I think I have the right to reject you.

472
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
Why?

473
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,400
To be honest, Mr. Ou,

474
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,400
you are a strange and arrogant person.

475
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
I really don't like you.

476
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,400
But work is work.

477
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,400
I can be your assistant.

478
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,400
But you have to promise me one condition.

479
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,400
How dare you talk to me about conditions?

480
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,400
Tell me.

481
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,400
I'm sorry for what I did in the past 40 years.

482
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,400
You are a big mouth.

483
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,400
And you are not a person who can be used as a tool.

484
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
You are a big mouth.

485
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
And you will pay me half a year's salary after the probation period.

486
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,400
Kang Weiwei, you are getting more and more interesting.

487
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,400
Why do you think I will agree to you?

488
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,400
To be honest, I don't think you will agree to me.

489
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,400
But I have to say the conditions.

490
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
I need this money very much.

491
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,400
If I can't, then I have no meaning in working here.

492
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,400
You mean you came to work for money?

493
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,400
Otherwise,

494
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,400
would I be interested in you?

495
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,400
I will prove to you that your judgment is wrong.

496
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
That's it. I agree to you.

497
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,400
Thank you, Mr. Ou.

498
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,400
Kang Weiwei.

499
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,400
And...

500
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,400
And?

501
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
You have to promise to meet Yingdong.

502
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,400
Is Yingdong sent by Yuting Group?

503
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,400
Yes.

504
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
You help Yingdong so much.

505
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,400
Is he your boyfriend?

506
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,400
He is my boyfriend.

507
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,400
Hello, I am Yuting's daughter.

508
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,400
It seems you like to be nosy.

509
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,400
Can I be a kind of praise to me?

510
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,400
I agree to your request.

511
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
I will come to work on time tomorrow for three months.

512
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,400
I want to see if you are worth it.

513
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,400
Thank you, Mr. Ou.

514
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,400
I will take Weiwei away now.

515
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,400
I will let her come to work on time tomorrow.

516
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,400
And the appointment of Yingdong...

517
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,400
I will ask my secretary to arrange it.

518
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
Thank you, Mr. Ou.

519
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,400
I will leave now.

520
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,400
See you tomorrow.

521
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,400
Miss Kang Weiwei.

522
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,400
I think you must value this interview very much.

523
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
You didn't even sign the form.

524
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
Are you going to cancel the interview?

525
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,400
Let's drink.

526
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
Come on, let's drink.

527
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,400
Come on, we haven't changed our mind about Miss Kang.

528
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,400
We have found such a good job.

529
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
We should treat ourselves to a meal.

530
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,400
Yes, treat us to a meal.

531
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,400
Yes, yes, yes.

532
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,400
It's such a good day.

533
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,400
Let's drink and celebrate.

534
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,400
Okay.

535
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,400
Weiwei, you are so young, but you make so much money.

536
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,400
Have you ever thought about investing?

537
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,400
I can give you some insider information.

538
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,400
I promise you will become a rich woman in a few years.

539
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,400
Yes, you can make so much money when you are 20 years old.

540
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,400
I envy you.

541
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,400
I think Ou Hui must have a crush on our Mr. Kang.

542
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,400
Otherwise, how could he agree to such a rude request from a child?

543
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,400
Don't you think so?

544
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,400
Ou Hui must have a crush on Weiwei.

545
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,400
Weiwei, you have to hold on to the opportunity to join the rich family.

546
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,400
When you become a gold phoenix, don't forget us sisters.

547
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,400
I think you haven't drunk yet.

548
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,400
Why are you talking nonsense about something like drinking too much?

549
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
Let's drink again.

550
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,400
Okay, cheers.

551
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,400
Cheers.

552
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,400
Cheers.

553
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,400
Are you still dizzy?

554
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,400
I've been driving you around the house for 8 days.

555
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,400
It's strange that you are not dizzy.

556
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,400
Everyone is happy for you.

557
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,400
I think Mei Bao is right.

558
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,400
Ou Hui must have a crush on you.

559
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,400
Why don't you think about it?

560
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
She is so good.

561
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,400
Stop it.

562
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,400
Ou Hui is a total pervert.

563
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,400
If I am with her, what if she kills me in the middle of the night?

564
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,400
Look at you.

565
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,400
Is she so disgusting as you say?

566
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Okay, you stay here.

567
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,400
I'll go take a shower.

568
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,400
Hello, are you looking for me?

569
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,400
Okay, I'll be right there.

570
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,400
Okay.

571
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,400
I said you called me today.

572
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
You want me to drink with you, right?

573
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,400
I haven't had enough.

574
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
I'm happy for you.

575
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,400
I thank you.

576
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,400
You say you want to drink, you say you want to drink.

577
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,400
Don't take me as a shield.

578
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,400
Can you be gentle to me?

579
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,400
Why are you so tough?

580
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
I tell you, you can't do anything without me.

581
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,400
Hua Xiaoqi, you are like a sheep.

582
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,400
I'll take you.

583
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,400
I'll be very impressed.

584
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,400
What are you impressed with?

585
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,400
Oh my god, you can even look at a violent boyfriend.

586
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,400
You are so talkative.

587
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,400
Hua Xiaoqi.

588
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,400
I ask you a question.

589
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,400
You answer me honestly.

590
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,400
Say it.

591
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
Do you really agree to marry?

592
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,400
Is it purely for yourself?

593
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,400
I said it's not that simple.

594
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,400
Yingdong wants to cooperate with Ou Hui.

595
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
My brother has no money to pay the rent.

596
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,400
So if it's not for these two reasons,

597
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,400
you won't agree so quickly.

598
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,400
Sometimes I know you very well.

599
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,400
But now I don't know what you are thinking.

600
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,400
What do you want to say?

601
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,400
You do this,

602
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
completely to help Yingdong and my brother.

603
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,400
Or to help Amber and Wanjia.

604
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,400
Do you think it's worth it to sacrifice yourself so much?

605
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,400
This is not sacrifice.

606
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,400
This is helping friends.

607
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,400
Seeing them happy, I am happier than them.

608
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,400
Then don't you feel a little wronged?

609
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,400
No, it's called win-win.

610
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,400
Win-win.

611
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
Look,

612
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,400
I have a job.

613
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,400
Deng Yi won't worry about the rent.

614
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,400
And Yingdong can take the opportunity to explain to Wu Yuting.

615
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
I not only find a job that makes people envy,

616
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,400
but also can help everyone solve the problem of the media.

617
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,400
This is not win-win.

618
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,400
So sometimes I really admire you.

619
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,400
If you were my sister-in-law,

620
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,400
how good it would be.

621
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,400
You are really drunk today.

622
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,400
You are really drunk today.

623
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,400
This is all the things I collected these days.

624
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,400
This is all the information about Shanghai's old restaurant.

625
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,400
To open a restaurant in Shanghai,

626
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,400
except for the good food and fair price,

627
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,400
the most important thing is to understand their traditional culture.

628
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,400
This way you can know yourself and your friends.

629
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,400
You can catch their taste and their heart.

630
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,400
You can read these information.

631
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,400
It will help you to open a restaurant in Shanghai.

632
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,400
You said so much just to prove that you came to the company only a few days ago.

633
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,400
You are so smart, right?

634
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
Enough.

635
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,400
I have promised to meet Yingdong.

636
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,400
Don't worry. I won't break my promise.

637
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,400
Then let's make it clear.

638
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,400
When you go upstairs later,

639
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,400
you can't look down on your friends like you do to your secretary.

640
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,400
They are my best friends.

641
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,400
What do you mean by look down on them?

642
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,400
Nothing.

643
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,400
Your car can't stop here.

644
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,400
You don't have the right to park your car here.

645
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,400
I can park my car wherever I want.

646
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
I didn't ask you to teach me.

647
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,400
Mr. Ou,

648
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,400
Eva is a top-class restaurant abroad.

649
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,400
It's a very popular restaurant.

650
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,400
It's a very popular restaurant.

651
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,400
Eva is a top-class restaurant abroad.

652
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,400
But foreign food brands want to enter Shanghai.

653
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,400
But it's not enough to rely on a few people.

654
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,400
And the location of the restaurant is also the key to success.

655
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:52,400
So I hope Eva can enter all the five-star hotels in Wuyi Ting when she enters Shanghai.

656
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,400
You should know that my restaurant never cooperates with outsiders.

657
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,400
Of course.

658
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,400
Mr. Wu only values the influence of Eva.

659
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,400
According to the distribution,

660
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,400
it must be a good deal.

661
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,400
My father has more than 200 five-star hotels in the world.

662
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,400
But there are only five in Shanghai.

663
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,400
They are all located in the golden area of Shanghai.

664
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,400
Our business has always been a theme for young people.

665
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,400
As long as you agree to cooperate with us,

666
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
our team will definitely promote your business image.

667
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,400
Let Eva Group be more advanced in domestic image.

668
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,400
This is our business data and experience.

669
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,400
Take a look.

670
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,400
Let's go.

671
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,400
How about this?

672
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,400
Mr. Ou, please tell me your opinion.

673
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,400
Mr. Wu,

674
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,400
can you not play with your phone in such a situation?

675
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,400
Didn't you hear what I said?

676
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,400
Kang Weiwei,

677
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,400
who is the boss and who is the subordinate?

678
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,400
Can you control what I do?

679
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,400
I can't control what you do.

680
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
But I have to control your friends.

681
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,400
No subordinate dares to control me.

682
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,400
Am I too tolerant to you?

683
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,400
I made you forget your identity.

684
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,400
You are so low-key again.

685
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,400
Kang Weiwei, who are you scolding?

686
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,400
Who knows?

687
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,400
Fine.

688
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,400
Then you don't have to come to work tomorrow.

689
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,400
My company doesn't need a bastard like you.

690
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,400
That's good. I'm free.

691
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,400
I don't need a selfish, cold-hearted,

692
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,400
merciless, perverted boss like you.

693
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,400
Mr. Ou, my sister is still a little girl.

694
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,400
She really respects you.

695
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,400
Don't be so stingy with a little girl.

696
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,400
Little girl?

697
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,400
And she didn't grow up normally, right?

698
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,400
You!

699
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,400
Mr. Ou,

700
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,400
Weiwei is a bit stubborn,

701
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,400
so she is easily impulsive.

702
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,400
But this opportunity is very important to her.

703
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,400
I apologize on her behalf. Please forgive her.

704
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,400
Hello.

705
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
Okay, I got it.

706
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
You guys help me to calm her down.

707
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
I'll be right out.

708
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,400
Excuse me.

709
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,400
Okay.

710
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,400
Where is the car?

711
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,400
It must have been taken away.

712
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,400
If you are here to make fun of me,

713
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,400
then you don't have to.

714
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,400
You'd better not drive your stupid motorcycle.

715
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,400
You really want to get a gentleman's payment.

716
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,400
Come on, I'll give you a ride.

717
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,400
You can't get a ride here.

718
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,400
You mean,

719
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,400
I should take this?

720
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,400
Can you drive slower?

721
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,400
What are you talking about? Listen carefully.

722
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,400
Slow down.

723
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,400
My life is more valuable than yours.

724
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,400
Then I'll drive faster.

725
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,400
In case of any accident,

726
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,400
I'll definitely not lose my debt

727
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,400
before my life.

728
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,400
Doctor, how is my sister?

729
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,400
Mr. Ou, I really can't help you.

730
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,400
Although my sister is a patient,

731
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,400
she is more temperamental than anyone else.

732
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,400
Now, our medical staff

733
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,400
dare not enter her ward.

734
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,400
My sister is so reluctant to cooperate.

735
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,400
We really have no other choice.

736
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,400
Thank you, doctor.

737
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,400
You're welcome.

738
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,400
Why don't you go and have a look?

739
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,400
I'll be back in a minute.

740
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,400
Ou Hui!

741
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,400
Ou Hui!

742
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,400
Ou Hui!

743
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,400
Look at her!

744
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,400
I can't stand her anymore.

745
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,400
Shut up.

746
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,400
If you can't stand her, then don't.

747
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
I thought you could take care of my sister.

748
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,400
But it seems not.

749
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,400
Let's break up.

750
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,400
Ou Hui, you...

751
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,400
I'm not going to serve you.

752
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,400
I'm not going to serve you.

753
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,400
I'm not going to serve you.

754
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,400
I'm not going to serve you.

755
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,400
I'm not going to serve you.

756
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,400
I'm not going to serve you.

757
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
I'm not going to serve you.

758
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,400
Ou Hui!

759
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,400
Come in.

760
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,400
Ou Hui.

761
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,400
I really don't like the flowers

762
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,400
your newly-wed friends are dressing up.

763
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,400
And they don't know me.

764
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,400
Take me away quickly

765
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,400
I'm going to Malaysia to have some meat tea.

766
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,400
I'd like to try the meat tea.

767
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,400
Really?

768
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,400
That's great.

769
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,400
I'm sorry.

770
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,400
This girl is quite a good girl.

771
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,400
Xiaohui, you've changed a lot since you came to Shanghai.

772
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:39,400
Your new girlfriend is not a beauty, but she is naturally generous and can cook.

773
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,400
I'm very satisfied.

774
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,400
Big sister, you misunderstood. I actually...

775
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,400
What else do you want to eat? She can cook.

776
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,400
Xiaohui, do you remember?

777
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,400
My parents died early, and no one cared about us.

778
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,400
We could only wait in the restaurant for other people's leftovers.

779
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:06,400
At that time, if we could eat the meat bone tea left by two people, it would feel like a festival.

780
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:12,400
So in my memory, meat bone tea is the best food in the world.

781
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,400
It's a pity that we can't eat such authentic meat bone tea now.

782
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,400
Of course I remember.

783
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,400
Big sister, you won't have such a hard life anymore.

784
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,400
Kang Weiwei has already made you meat bone tea.

785
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,400
You should rest well. You can only eat later.

786
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,400
If she doesn't make authentic meat bone tea, I'll find you a better chef.

787
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,400
Big sister, promise me to take good care of yourself.

788
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,400
I know.

789
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,400
Is it really done?

790
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,400
I don't know if it's to your taste.

791
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,400
Did you really make it yourself?

792
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,400
Of course.

793
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,400
I wish you good health.

794
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,400
Although it doesn't taste like the food I ate when I was a child,

795
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,400
it's the most authentic meat bone tea I've ever had in the past few years.

796
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,400
You don't know,

797
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:17,400
but now it's really hard to eat authentic meat bone tea made with the most ancient recipe.

798
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,400
It's good that you like it.

799
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,400
You're a good girl.

800
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,400
You can pretend to be good, but also have a good personality.

801
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,400
The most important thing is that the cooking is so good.

802
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,400
You're here.

803
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,400
I'll tell you secretly.

804
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,400
My brother listens to me the most.

805
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,400
As long as it's the person I like, he'll treat her very well.

806
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,400
You're his girlfriend.

807
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,400
I agree.

808
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,400
The End
